Mathieu is a player I am looking at, yes. He would give us a bit more experience to winning games. I like the fact whenever he played, he played in the big, big games at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> when they needed someone to kind of lead the team over the line and get big results. Mathieu’s name was always on that list. I have always admired what he’s done, so I am looking at him. His age, 32, in my mind I signed <a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Teddy Sheringham</a> when he was 38, so the age isn’t a problem for me. I think his experience is something I am looking at, yes<br /><br />We’ve had a couple of meetings with Mathieu to talk about what he would do here and how he would feel about competing with <b>[Yohan]</b> Cabaye, <b>[James]</b> McArthur, <b>[Jason]</b> Puncheon, <b>[Jordon]</b> Mutch, Chung <b>[Yong Lee]</b> and <b>[Joe]</b> Ledley. I think another one <b>[in midfield]</b> is where I’m going to go with it, but whether it’s him or not, I don’t know. We do face strong competition for him, but mainly from clubs who have got a much higher profile than us. It could well be a situation like <a href="jack-wilshere.html">Jack Wilshere</a>, where we are in there but don’t get it over the line. There are others we are considering. There are one or two others floating about who are always of interest</p>

Sometimes, when you have been a manager at a big club like that, to go to a rival is something I wouldn’t do so that wouldn’t interest me.

  <p><b>[Alan Pardew on <a href="pape-souare.html">Pape Souare</a> who had experience being involved in a serious car accident]</b> Pape was incredibly brave. I remember visiting him in the hospital the following day and he still offered up that beaming smile of his as best he could through the broken jaw, even after everything that had happened. We all loved him at the club - he was so popular, a star on and off the field, and we missed him badly as a team and a group after the crash. To see him up, running and playing again now is testimony to his commitment and the hard work he and the medical staff put in. It’s wonderful to see him back</p>

  <p><b>[Man City could reignite their interest in Jonny Evans this January]</b> We are pretty tight financially. I am conscious if there are no funds available I might have to move something around.

So there is a scenario Jonny Evans might move and for sure I have looked at that. He has all the qualities for a top team. I would be stupid to sit here and deny that. There have been astonishing figures for defenders all through the summer really. If you look at defenders and compare Jonny with central defenders in the Premier League he is right up there</p>

  <p><b>[Baggies boss Alan Pardew has refused to reveal his valuation of Jonny Evans]</b> We’ve had a couple of enquiries about what we’d be looking for. The answer has been: ‘We’re not going to tell you.’ Make a bid and we’ll get a gauge. We don’t really want to sell Jonny but he’s a target for other clubs and we might sell if the price is right. I think we’ve been realistic about the situation.<br /><br />If they ring up late Tuesday they’re probably not going to get the response they want. If they ring today, tomorrow, they’ll get a nicer response. That’s the way it is. Obviously the later you leave it the less chance you have of bringing someone in. When Andy Carroll went at Newcastle we had eight or nine hours to react - we couldn’t. Jonny is in his prime. Centre-halves are in their prime from 29-34, when they really know their game, and their fitness levels are strong</p>

Jonny is an important, great player and part of the spine of the team</p>

That didn’t give us the perfect start. We just can’t seem to get the goals that get us the wins, and they need to come, and come quickly, so Daniel’s recovery will be important now - we need to get him back. We are hoping it is not that bad. It happened very early in the game, but we don’t think it is a tear. It seems to be a strain, which will probably keep him out of the FA Cup game <b>[versus Southampton on Saturday]</b>. Hopefully, fingers crossed, in a couple of weeks he’ll be OK.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho was not at fault for his aggresive reaction to taunts from a member of the Chelsea coaching staff]</b> This guy - the second coach or whoever he is - his first action is unacceptable and the second action is also doubly unacceptable. The man of the match is that steward stopping Jose. If you’re going to be a top manager of any sort, you’ve got to have fire in your belly and if you haven’t, then don’t do the job. In a situation like that, they’ve conceded in the last second, he’s back at his old football club and you have an assistant manager go up into his face like that - it’s totally ridiculous. I’m glad he apologised and I’m glad Jose accepted his apology. In Jose’s situation with the pressure he is under, that is the last thing he wanted. He’ll be worried this morning about who people will blame and you can go in that kind of circle. It’s not nice.</p>

  <p><b>[Rafa Benitez and Mike Ashley have to work together to rescue Newcastle United’s season]</b> That’s something they have to work out and sit down together. We got to a situation in maybe my third season at Newcastle where we really needed help in January. I said to Mike, ‘I think we’re in big danger here’ and he came to the fore, we signed four or five players and it transformed our season. I think Rafa is going to be in that position, the way it looks at the moment, that he is going to need an influx of new blood into that team. We all know it is very difficult for football managers but it is also difficult for owners. I was probably closer to Steve Parish at Crystal Palace than I was to Mike at Newcastle in terms of the running of a business and putting the clubs at risk et cetera. It is a difficult situation where he’s looking, and has made it quite public that he is willing to sell the football club. I think in January, Mike will have to have a long sit down with Rafa and come up with a plan.<br /><br /><b>[Pardew enjoyed some success at St James’ Park]</b> As a manager at Newcastle, I had my own tricky runs there at times and the chairman and the board stayed with me and it’s very important to do that because, at the moment, they have a very experienced manager who knows exactly what he’s doing. When you come up to the Premier League and you have the momentum to have a decent season which they had last year, that doesn’t always guarantee it will happen in year two. I think some of those guys are struggling for confidence a little bit, they need a result quickly and that stadium can change. I can think of one game where we were 4-0 down at Arsenal and the place was completely rebellious, and then at 4-3, the place is jumping and it’s alive. When it’s alive, it is very difficult for the opposition and that’s what they have to get back - get that goal, maybe a two-goal lead and that will come back very quickly. But the confidence needs to come back and Rafa has got a job on his hands</p>

Now, when players are leaving the training ground, they’re not leaving the training ground, they’re WhatsApp-ing each other <b>[…]</b> the guy that’s really toxic is now being very toxic to the whole group and he’s bringing people in.<br /><br />Suddenly, you arrive at the training ground and there’s a strange atmosphere <b>[…]</b> they’ve all made a different outcome to what you as a manager perceived would be the outcome. And it’s completely out of your control, of course. You can’t infiltrate it, you don’t want to infiltrate it really because then you’re asking for even more problems I would guess. The senior players and toxic players now have a bigger control over the dressing room</p>
