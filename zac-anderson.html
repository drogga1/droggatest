<blockquote>
  <p>[Kedah centre back Zac Anderson was not surprised by Selangor’s defensive approach in their 1-1 draw on Saturday] I think teams understand the way that Kedah want to play, that is to keep the ball and play positive football. Teams have come to our home this season and played very defensively to try and get a draw. We know and understand this but we can’t do anything about it. We just have to be better, worry about ourselves, and hopefully we can break down defences better in the coming matches<br /><br />Every football team needs to rely on its reserve players at times, and we are very lucky that we have such a good team. At the moment it’s hard with the absence of the junior national team players, but it gives other players an opportunity to play. Tonight is disappointing in that we have dropped two points, but we have to refocus because we have another important game in two days’ time<br /><br />I want to say ‘thank you’ to the Kedah supporters tonight. The stadium was full, it was a great game. We’re disappointed not to have won the match, but there are a lot more matches to come</p>
