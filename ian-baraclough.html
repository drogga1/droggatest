  <p><b>[Northern Ireland job: Stephen Robinson, Ian Baraclough among five names targeted by IFA]</b> On Tuesday, the governing body sought consent to interview Stephen for the job, which we reluctantly granted. We have expressed in the strongest possible terms that we want him to stay with us. The work he has done so far to take the club to two national cup finals, bring through young talent and finish third in last season’s Premiership has been exceptional. As we prepare to embark on a <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Europa League campaign, it is our hope that Stephen will stay to continue the work that has proven so successful</p>

  <p><b>[Ian Baraclough has been appointed as the new manager of Northern Ireland]</b> To ultimately accept the role as the new Northern Ireland manager is an honour and a privilege. I couldn’t be more energised and excited to get going</p>

  <p><b>[Ian Baraclough: New Northern Ireland manager outlines priorities]</b> It would be wrong of me not to make the phone call. <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Ollie</a> had a big impact while he was in the group. He made the decision and I wasn’t part of that conversation. If he’s had a different feeling about it then he can only strengthen the group of players.<br /><br /><b>[Northern Ireland are two games away from reaching a major finals, something that is not lost on Baraclough]</b> It’s not something I fear. It’s got me excited and I think we can win two games of football if we’re prepared right and go into it with the right frame of mind. We don’t fear going away to Bosnia. We’ve had the experience of playing them twice in the Nations League and feel we should have won those games. We still think there won’t be any fans allowed into the ground in October and we’ve seen in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> that can be a great leveller. It’s an honour to be given the job. I like my teams to be organised. The way I set up the U21s was positive, to try to win games and be attacking. Players knowing their individual roles is important<br /><br />There isn’t a great change from the previous manager. Ahead of the March game I’d been out to Bosnia to look at hotels and training facilities and relayed that back to Michael. Michael has always said he’ll be there for us and to pick up the phone at any time. He’s certainly someone I will tap into for sure. I consider him a great mentor</p>
