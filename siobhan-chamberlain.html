<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Siobhan Chamberlain leaves <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> by mutual consent]</b> When I found out I was pregnant in 2019, I knew I wasn’t ready to finish playing, fighting to get back into the squad at United was my entire focus. However, life and football very rarely follow the perfect path, I feel my career for club and country is the example of that. But the one thing that’s driven me throughout my entire career is not giving up. I had been to four major tournaments with England over 11 years before making my tournament debut in 2015. I had plenty of opportunities to give up prior to that. I didn’t. I have loved every minute of my time as a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player but after discussions with Casey we both agreed that now was the right time for me to move on and take time to consider the next steps in my career. I am proud that we as a group of players have written a chapter in this great club’s history. The future of this club is in great hands with Casey and I have no doubt that trophies and success are not far away. I can’t thank the fans enough for their support. The support for me as a player and the love and kindness shown to me in becoming a mother, it makes being a women’s footballer special. Women’s football needs your passion. In 2005, playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> was a dream. Dreams can come true</p>
