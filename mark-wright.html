<blockquote>
  <p>[Mark Wright says <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> is the kingpin at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>] You can talk about his ability in possession and, yes, he can head the ball, he is quick and he can do all the other bits and pieces as well. But you don’t come to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> unless you can do those things. The biggest thing that has impressed me is what I see from him when the ball is at the other end of the pitch. He dictates. He makes sure people fill those pockets where previously <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were being hurt on the counter-attack. He makes sure others are aware. It’s that organisation of others that has made the biggest difference because there aren’t a lot of leaders around but he can do that. Nobody is going to argue with him because Virgil is the kingpin. I see him as the key to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s success. He is an exceptional player and I really cannot believe it wasn’t more of a battle to get him because there is a dearth of top centre-halves around. Look around. Name the top five in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and I think you would struggle to come up with five. Virgil stands out like a sore thumb, to be honest with you.<br /><br />I hope this is the start of something. They are already feared. Teams don’t want to play against them. That is where they are now. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are where everyone else wants to be. I think they need maybe two good players this summer and that would be enough. Maybe a centre-forward who could change the play if they needed to. But who am I to say anything to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>? He is the manager and he knows exactly what he is doing. I am the same as the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> supporters worldwide, I trust in him. If he doesn’t want to buy anyone then that means there aren’t the right players out there</p>
