  <p><b>[Former <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> midfielder Curtis Woodhouse says <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> was an unbelievably overrated <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player]</b> <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a>, another unbelievably overrated <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player. Outstanding longevity but in a team that dominated for years and were a free scoring machine his statistics for goals and assists is awful. Another <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> myth, good player, never anything more. <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> has 162 assists in the PL over 22 years to go with his 109 goals, again over 22 years. His team dominated them 22 years of football breaking scoring records as they went. <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> was a left winger, looking at his stats you may confuse him with a left back. <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> didn’t even have a good left foot!! He was a outstanding athlete but his left foot wasn’t that good. His delivery was ok, not great, he couldn’t spray it about, he was a great athlete. Let’s keep it real. <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> was a good player. Steady away down the left hand side, great energy, great pace. Good player, just not a great player, never had a world class season in 22 attempts but still a good player. Never poor but never brilliant, a good steady player<br /><br />Yes, <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> is better than <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a>, had a bigger impact in club football and international football. <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> will have longevity over <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>, that’s it. <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> hasn’t got a single attribute better than <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>, not one. TAA <b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold]</b> is more of a attacking threat than <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> was in 22 years. TAA is a right back and <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> is a left winger</p>
