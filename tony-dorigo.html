  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata will leave Chelsea this summer and could be followed through the exits by Eden Hazard and Antonio Conte]</b> I do yes. The problem is he left Real Madrid to get some games, and he went to Juventus and did quite well but again didn’t play all the time. He’s been disappointing for me, he’s had one or two issues as well but Juventus may see the value in trying to get him back and Chelsea will be looking for another striker. He works hard and seems a good type of person, but it just hasn’t worked out. When you have spent that kind of money, £60m or £70m, you expect to get a bit more, so I can’t see it ending too well to be honest. The likes of Chelsea, you look where they can improve, and up top has got to be one of them.<br /><br />Real Madrid and Barcelona are the two teams outside of England that when they come calling, there is only one thing that is going to happen. Those two clubs are incredible, the passion is absolutely amazing. It’s a difficult one, Hazard will probably think if Chelsea don’t make the Champions League then he might start to look elsewhere. It’s difficult when Real Madrid and Barcelona come calling<br /><br />I really like Antonio Conte, I have to say. He needed some backing in the transfer market though, because what he’s seen is Manchester United spending a lot and obviously Manchester City improving in every position, whereas Chelsea’s spending was disappointing. Morata hasn’t really done it and Conte didn’t get a lot of the key players he requested, so there were problems from the start. I think he’s a really good manager, I like the way his teams play but he does need a certain type of player. There will be plenty of suitors who want Antonio Conte as manager, I hope Chelsea back him and give him some money to spend</p>

  <p><b>[Tony Dorigo on <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a>’s promotion]</b> When <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Marcelo Bielsa</a> came in, suddenly, we had our identity back. The fans have taken to him, he has believed in the project and he certainly loves the city. The fans are together with him. He has turned some really good players into very good players and now they have got a shot at <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. We know it is difficult. There are levels in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Clearly, survival is the first thing and then you look to build from there but there is no doubt that the brand that <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> have can be reinvigorated around the world. But let’s just enjoy this first!</p>
