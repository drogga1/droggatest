  <p><b>[Leeds United goalkeeper Illan Meslier has hailed the club’s fans as crazy and football as being a religion in the city as he adapts to life in West Yorkshire]</b> Football is a religion in <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>. The fans - they are crazy! They sing all the time in the stadium. The atmosphere in the stadium is amazing. For my first game, I stayed for 10 minutes after to watch the fans. When you’re an opponent, you must feel very small. It’s incredible<br /><br /><b>[Teenager insists he is ready for that responsibility, though he remains hopeful that Casilla will avoid punishment]</b> I’m learning a lot with Kiko. He’s 33, he played for Real and won three Champions Leagues. He has great experience. He knows what to do in a lot of situations, and I really take on board everything he teaches me. Now, I’m ready to play at any time if there is a suspension or an injury. It’s important to seize the opportunity. Kiko is the number one and I respect him. If he were to be cleared, it would be good for the group. And if he were to be suspended, I’m ready to play<br /><br /><b>[Bielsa is famed for his high-intensity football, and Meslier admits he is learning how to adapt his own game under the Argentine]</b> We all have a lot of respect for <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Marcelo Bielsa</a>. We know what he did in his career. All the players want to work hard with him and we have only one goal: to go in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at the end of the season. I think that if I had stayed in Lorient last summer, I wouldn’t have progressed. Here, you have more intensity. It’s box-to-box with the English style. I take a lot more pleasure with Leeds</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal forward <a href="eddie-nketiah.html">Eddie Nketiah</a> has been backed to reach the very top by current <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> team-mate Illan Meslier, with the striker currently on loan at Elland Road]</b> We have a great relationship and I think he will be a great player in the future. He’s very strong, he’s fast, he finishes well. He’s a really good player who can go even higher. He’s unbelievable. He’s off to a good start to the season. Last year I think he was in League One. This is his first year in the Championship and he’s shown he’s at that level. Brighton has a very good player on its hands</p>
