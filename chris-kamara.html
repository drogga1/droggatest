  <p><b>[Chris Kamara has a charity story about Cyrille Regis]</b> Gutted to hear the news that Cyrille Regis has died. Great player &amp; most of all a gentleman, had the pleasure of his company on many occasions in recent years &amp; I will always be grateful to him for helping with our charity golf tournament in Tenerife. He certainly will be missed</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Kamara album Here’s to Christmas: Release date &amp; full details]</b> Initially, I thought we would do lots of gimmicky things and we’ll have a laugh. I’ve been asked to release songs called ‘Unbelievable’ all the time and I actually wouldn’t have minded. Then they told me, ‘No, no, this is a serious album, we’ve got belief in you that this’ll do OK. We think you’re good<br /><br /><b>[He went on to reveal his passion for big band music]</b> I know it might be surprising to some, but anyone who knows me - especially those who shared a changing room with me in my playing days who first told me I could sing - will tell you what a big fan I am of big band music. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d get to record a full album, though! ‘Here’s to Christmas’ is something I’m really proud of and I think it stands up as something fun, but something that doesn’t sound half bad too - an album to get everyone into the swing of Christmas!</p>

  <p><b>[Southampton striker Michael Obafemi confused for <a href="obafemi-martins.html">Obafemi Martins</a> in Crystal Palace win]</b> In the first few minutes of this game it has been all Southampton, they are playing in the Crystal Palace half. <a href="obafemi-martins.html">Obafemi Martins</a> is playing up front instead of Danny Ings… not <a href="obafemi-martins.html">Obafemi Martins</a>, what is his name? Obafemi someone. Michael Obafemi, that’s who! Haha! I was close! I knew there was an Obafemi in there somewhere!</p>
