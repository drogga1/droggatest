<blockquote>
  <p>French police investigating whether corruption played a role in the stunning decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar took 1980s soccer superstar and former top executive <a href="michel-platini.html">Michel Platini</a> into custody Tuesday for questioning. <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a>’s representatives denied any wrongdoing on his part, saying he is ‘absolutely confident in the future’ and has ‘strictly nothing to reproach himself for’<br /><br />Also questioned Tuesday were two one-time associates of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, adding a layer of political intrigue to the investigation of the hugely controversial decision to hold soccer’s showcase tournament in a desert country so scorching hot in June and July that the matches will be played instead in November and December<br /><br />As head of European soccer’s governing body <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>, <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a> was the continent’s top representative on the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> committee that picked Qatar in 2010<br /><br />The closed-door, secret-ballot vote baffled many at the time, not least because the Persian Gulf nation has no soccer pedigree to speak of. But gas-rich Qatar is pouring billions into the world’s most popular sport and has the means to finance new stadiums<br /><br />French authorities did not announce any charges against the soccer legend or say exactly what he was being asked. He can be held for questioning for up to 48 hours, after which he can be either released or formally charged. French prosecutors are known to be investigating an array of winning bids for major sports events, including the 2018 World Cup, awarded to Russia, the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo and track and field world championships. Qatar beat the long-favoured United States 14-8 when <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> selected the host country for the 2022 World Cup<br /><br />Former <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> President <a href="sepp-blatter.html">Sepp Blatter</a>, who presided over the vote, has accused <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a> of backing out of a secret ‘gentleman’s agreement’ to award the tournament to the United States after meeting with Sarkozy, France’s president at the time<br /><br /><a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a>’s representatives said he was taken into custody only for ‘technical reasons’. His lawyer, William Bourdon, explained that police wanted to ensure that <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a> and other witnesses couldn’t confer with each other about their accounts<br /><br />Also detained Tuesday was Sophie Dion, a former sports adviser in Sarkozy’s administration, the judicial official said. She was released late in the evening. Claude Gueant, former secretary general of the Elysee presidential palace under Sarkozy, was questioned as a witness and not detained. French prosecutors previously questioned Blatter<br /><br />Ahead of the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> vote, Sarkozy hosted a meeting in November 2010 that brought <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a> together with Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, then the crown prince of Qatar and now its ruling emir. Al-Thani also owns the French soccer club <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, and Sarkozy frequently attends its games. <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a> has long insisted that the meeting did not influence his vote for Qatar less than two weeks later<br /><br /><a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> had no comment on <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a>’s detention and said it has made a full commitment to co-operating with the authorities<br /><br />Both <a href="michel-platini.html">Michel Platini</a> and <a href="sepp-blatter.html">Sepp Blatter</a> were toppled from their positions at the top of soccer in 2015. <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a> was banned by <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> for financial misconduct in connection with a $2 million payment authorized by <a href="sepp-blatter.html">Blatter</a> - a suspension set to expire in October</p>
