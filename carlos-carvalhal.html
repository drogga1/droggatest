  <p><b>[Another option could be a temporary return to <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> which has been mooted in Portugal, with compatriot Carvalhal encouraging him to return to his homeland following his difficult time in Swansea]</b> Renato knows he has had a very bad season. He is not at the level he was and when he had the injury in January, it finished him. He would agree this has been a really bad season for him. Someone told me he could go back to <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> and if he can, it is the best step for him. It happens often with Portuguese players. Renato has a big talent, but he has much to learn. He stopped learning when he left <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> and went to one of the biggest clubs in the world. I think by going back to <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> and having his friends and mother and father around him, and a good club to support him, he can achieve the best level. He needs to go back to Portugal because he is a boy and he is not ready for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> level</p>

  <p><b>[Carlo Carvalhal says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have landed a player in the <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> mould with their €55 million signing of Bruno Fernandes]</b> He is really very good. He is a player from another planet, the planet of Portugal is very small to him in this moment, he’s an extraordinary player. Bruno is the best player in the league, he’s miles ahead of the others. He is a complete player, and if you ask me to compare Bruno with a player, I will say Frank Lampard<br /><br />Last season was fantastic, he scored 20 league goals, the season before he scored 11 and this season he has eight goals and seven assists, and this is a midfielder, not a winger or an attacker. He has very good deliveries in free-kicks, makes very good assists, he’s an athlete. He’s not a number 10, he’s an eight in my opinion, he’s a worker, a box-to-box player. He also reminds me of Joao Moutinho, who I had at Sporting. I think <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> is different, because he has more goals, but they have something in common - they understand the game very well. He is very organised, he is always talking. He is 25 years old, he is in the Portugal first XI and he would be a fantastic addition in my opinion<br /><br />About money, I don’t know too much, but when <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> sold Joao Felix to <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> for €126m, the fans of Sporting will look to that and think: ‘Come on, €65m is not enough!’. <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> is another level to Joao Felix in my opinion, but I don’t know if Bruno at 19 years old was the same level as Felix is now. But he is a ready player, he’s a complete player</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Carvalhal has insisted that the Red Devils’ new signing operates best in a deep-lying role, rather than just behind the strikers]</b> He (Fernandes) is not a number 10. He is a midfielder but he has developed that ability to break the line of the defence to score goals<br /><br />He shoots, he assists, the passes and the free-kicks. But he is not a 10, he is an 8. He is a box-to-box player who understands very well the game. He doesn’t just play. He understands everything that happens around him. He shoots, he assists, the passes and the free-kicks. But he is not a 10, he is an 8. He is a box-to-box player who understands very well the game. He doesn’t just play. He understands everything that happens around him<br /><br />He has been the best player in the Portuguese league for two years minimum. He is in that group of players who are among the best in the world.<br /><br />Sometimes these technical players, it is their quality in the defensive transition that is a problem in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. When they lose the ball, they don’t react quickly enough to win it back, but he has developed a lot in the past two seasons. When his team loses the ball, he reacts quickly to win the ball back. That is important in England. He is not lazy, he is the opposite. A fighter. He has everything to be a key player</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal delivers his verdict on <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> pay cuts proposal]</b> I think we must give (an) example to the society all the time. The first thing that happened in my country about the coronavirus was professional football closed its doors to give (an) example to everybody.<br /><br />And we must understand that it is not just in a positive way we must give an example. In the bad moments, we must give an example to society.<br /><br />This is more of a problem to the people in medical and nurses. These people are in the first line of this fight. These people really have a problem.<br /><br />We have a problem because we are not acting. We are not working but we must understand society and give the best example that we can give.<br /><br />We can give a good example because football is doing this all the time in society. I agree, absolutely, there are problems and we are part of the solution. We are not part of the problem and we must help to solve the situation</p>

  <p><b>[Why Carlos Carvalhal’s orchestra analogy still rings true for Sheffield Wednesday today. Speaking before their famous cup win over <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in October 2015]</b> Midfielders are the ones who control the game but without a good defence and attackers to support them they can do nothing. Everyone has the same importance. In an orchestra they have a saxophone, they have a piano and they have the drums. We have some players who must be the drums. You can’t have an orchestra that is just 11 people playing piano or all playing the drums</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Carvalhal makes revealing admission on his Sheffield Wednesday appointment]</b> After Besiktas and Istanbul BB, my contract with Al Ahli had ended, and I was in negotiations with Glasgow Rangers. I even went to London to talk to them.<br /><br />During that time, Amadeu (Paixao, a close advisor to Chansiri), contacted me, told me that Sheffield Wednesday were interviewing several coaches and asked me if I’d be interested<br /><br />I did the interview, I was chosen and, months later, I came to know that who had the last word on my hiring was <b>[…]</b> the son of the chairman, who would’d be 10 or 11 years old (laughs).<br /><br />He had seen some things on the internet, some press releases in Turkey and some games. The purest reality. The decision of a 10-year-old kid opened the door for my life’s challenge! And at that moment, I felt that I was starting my career seriously<br /><br />All my life I dreamed of going to England, especially in a fascinating league like the Championship. I usually say that it is not for boys: it’s for leaders, for commanders. Twenty four teams: 20 want to go up. Excellent coaches. Stadiums full. Completely diverse styles. The proximity of the games is a constant challenge for a coach</p>

He is a player with incredible technical ability, with a great level. But I’m not sure Atletico’s way of playing is the best for him.

In a different situation, we would see a great <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a>. It will be a little difficult and it will take time more time. He will have to transform as a player.

It’s not a criticism of <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>, there is no doubt about what he has achieved. The work speaks for itself, I just believe this marriage is not the best.</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Carvalhal: Former Sheffield Wednesday and <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> boss target of attempted robbery]</b> As I was travelling back to my house in Braga from Madeira yesterday, I was attacked by three hooded individuals at around 2.15am. My natural instinct was to put up a fight - that was perhaps a risky decision - and with the help of my son, José Carlos, we managed to get out of the situation. We have a few cuts and bruises but nothing serious. I want to thank people for all the shows of friendship and support, but I would ask you not to contact me or my family at this time to help us get through this situation as soon as possible. The Braga police were called to the scene immediately and couldn’t have done any more to help. They dealt with the incident and I hope that they catch those responsible for this attempted robbery</p>
