  <p><b>[Swansea remain at the bottom of the league table despite taking four points from Carlos Carvalhal’s first three league games in charge of the club]</b> If we carry on like this in the Premier League, we can achieve what we want to achieve. Even if we are five, six or even seven points away from safety at some stage, it is possible to win three or four games in a row and then everything changes. We must believe in our hearts that we can do something. I have seen a lot of things in life. I have seen people with problems who have a normal life, so why, all together and with commitment, can we not achieve something? I try to give the players that feeling and I have the sensation that they can capture the belief I am giving them. They are better than they have shown in the past, and they are starting to show that.<br /><br /><b>[On Monday’s high-energy opponents]</b> They will make things different for us, they have intensity, they are very dangerous and it is the type of football I like. We have different ideas as managers, no one is better than the other one, we are all different.but they all have good dynamics. Renato Sanches is fully fit, while Tammy Abraham will have a late fitness check</p>

  <p><b>[Explaining his tactics for the clash]</b> When we studied Liverpool, I told the players that they are a really strong team - like a Formula One car. But a F1 car in London traffic at 4pm does not run well. If they have space like in Formula One, we would lose three or four-nil. So we have to put them in traffic. We have to make them play the way they don’t like.</p>

I spent a week at Manchester United when Alex Ferguson was there, then a week watching Mourinho at Chelsea. I also went to Real Madrid. I tried to learn with the best. He has a big self-confidence, like I do. You need that. But he is a completely ­different personality to me. He likes confrontation. He likes to fight with people. And he’s very good when he is fighting. I am completely different. I like to keep far away from the fight. I like to win, but, if ­someone tries to fight with me, they will find they are fighting with themselves.</p>

Our problem was it was difficult to control <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba and <b>[Nemanja]</b> Matic because they started to control the game with their two players. We can’t put pressure on them. And because we can’t put pressure on them, we play too much near our area and with the players that they have between the lines they create problems</p>

  <p><b>[Swansea City boss Carlos Carvalhal is primed to celebrate Premier League survival with a special gift from Jose Mourinho]</b> I have a bottle that Mourinho gave me when we played them, a Portuguese wine, that I am ready to open with my staff if we stay in the Premier League like we expect and are optimistic about. It’s a special bottle. I keep it because the wine is fantastic. He gave it to us and we will keep it until that special day, if we achieve it. I am looking forward to opening the wine. I am very excited for that, but first it’s about focus and winning points. When we arrived we had 0.01 per cent chance of staying up, nobody believed we would, everybody thought the team would be relegated soon. Now we are optimistic, I don’t know the percentage but we have changed things completely and we have things in our hand to stay in the Premier League. Everything is possible, but reality shows to us we have lost three games. We are achieving points in most of our games. I don’t know why we wouldn’t continue to do that until the end of the season. I believe we will and if we do we will stay up.<br /><br />This is not our party at the weekend but we will try to do our best and get points, understanding that it will be one of the most difficult games of the season for all teams because they are champions</p>

  <p><b>[Swansea City have confirmed that they will not be extending manager Carlos Carvalhal’s contract at the Liberty Stadium]</b> We’d like to put on record our thanks to Carlos for his enthusiasm, hard work and commitment since arriving at the club in December. Naturally, we are all disappointed with the club’s relegation from the Premier League, and following discussions with Carlos, we felt it was in the best interests of both parties that we move in a new direction. We will now be looking to appoint a new manager in readiness for the 2018-19 season. While there are already rumours linking us with several managers, it is vital that we identify the right person to take this team forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="sheffield-wednesday.html">Sheffield Wednesday</a> manager Carlos Carvalhal says <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a>’s immense potential is incomparable to other rising stars in Portugal]</b> His characteristics are more near <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a> in my opinion, the way he drives the ball, connects play and his goals. <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a> is one of the best players in the world at this moment. But at 19, he did not show the talent that Felix is showing in this moment at 19 - so imagine what kind of player we are talking about.<br /><br /><b>[The interest isn’t a shock to Carvalhal]</b> Why is he so special? He’s a mix between a nine and a 10, he plays like a second striker. He is a good header, even if he is not a massive player physically. He knows how to find space well in the last line of defence, that is why he scores a lot and he shoots well with both feet. When he must connect the game between attack and midfield he does so very well. He’s a very good technical player. What makes him different is he is a No.9 when he goes to the last line of defence and he scores goals. But he is also a very good player to connect the game between the lines, to assist and pass. That is why we are talking about the big clubs being interested in him. It is not a surprise to me because since the beginning we have been looking at a talented player</p>

He is a player from another planet, the planet of Portugal is very small to him in this moment, he’s an extraordinary player. Bruno is the best player in the league, he’s miles ahead of the others. He is a complete player, and if you ask me to compare Bruno with a player, I will say Frank Lampard<br /><br />Last season was fantastic, he scored 20 league goals, the season before he scored 11 and this season he has eight goals and seven assists, and this is a midfielder, not a winger or an attacker. He has very good deliveries in free-kicks, makes very good assists, he’s an athlete. He’s not a number 10, he’s an eight in my opinion, he’s a worker, a box-to-box player. He also reminds me of Joao Moutinho, who I had at Sporting. I think <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> is different, because he has more goals, but they have something in common - they understand the game very well. He is very organised, he is always talking. He is 25 years old, he is in the Portugal first XI and he would be a fantastic addition in my opinion<br /><br />About money, I don’t know too much, but when <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> sold <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> to <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> for €126m, the fans of Sporting will look to that and think: ‘Come on, €65m is not enough!’. <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> is another level to <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> in my opinion, but I don’t know if Bruno at 19 years old was the same level as Felix is now.

  <p><b>[Carlos Carvalhal has insisted that the Red Devils’ new signing operates best in a deep-lying role, rather than just behind the strikers]</b> He (Fernandes) is not a number 10. He is a midfielder but he has developed that ability to break the line of the defence to score goals<br /><br />He shoots, he assists, the passes and the free-kicks. But he is not a 10, he is an 8. He is a box-to-box player who understands very well the game. He doesn’t just play. He understands everything that happens around him. He shoots, he assists, the passes and the free-kicks. But he is not a 10, he is an 8. He is a box-to-box player who understands very well the game. He doesn’t just play. He understands everything that happens around him<br /><br />He has been the best player in the Portuguese league for two years minimum. He is in that group of players who are among the best in the world.<br /><br />Sometimes these technical players, it is their quality in the defensive transition that is a problem in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. When they lose the ball, they don’t react quickly enough to win it back, but he has developed a lot in the past two seasons. When his team loses the ball, he reacts quickly to win the ball back. That is important in England. He is not lazy, he is the opposite. A fighter. He has everything to be a key player</p>
