<blockquote>
  <p>[Chelsea will bring Andreas Christensen back to the club this summer] Chelsea would like Andreas back, and they have wanted that for a long time. But it was a two-year lease, so there was nothing they could do. They have worked to get him back before, but Gladbach would not let him go. Instead, they want to buy Andreas, but will Chelsea get rid of him, and is the price too high? As it is right now, he’ll be back at Chelsea again this summer. It is important to Andreas that he plays. He will not return to Chelsea just to sit on the bench. This transfer window will determine how Andreas’ situation will look in the summer. If Chelsea buy 10 centre-backs, it may well be that we need to do something else</p>

  <p>[Andreas Christensen’s father, Sten, has admitted that Chelsea have until Christmas to start using the promising centre-back on a regular basis] If his situation doesn’t change around Christmas, we’ll obviously schedule a chat with Chelsea and say: ‘Okay, what can we do for Andreas? Can we move him?’. For me it’s not a loan again. Either it’s Chelsea or else he needs to leave. I don’t think a loan is the optimal situation for Andreas. It’s sort of either or. I think, unfortunately, Chelsea have too many players who just go out on loan if [the club] isn’t going to use them and I don’t think Andreas should get caught in that. I’m of the conviction that we’ll attempt to move Andreas in the winter time [if he’s not playing]. Around Christmas, something else needs to happen.</p>
