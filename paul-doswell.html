  <p><b>[Much has been made of the facilities at non-league side Sutton United in the build-up to Monday night’s historic FA Cup tie against Arsenal]</b> We thought about putting new shower heads in … for about two seconds. And then thought, no. We haven’t done it for any of the other teams that are coming down. It’s only because we haven’t been able to afford it. It’s not us trying to be big and clever. One of the players said to me the other day, ‘When I played against you it was always hot in the dressing room’. I said that’s because we can’t turn the <b>[radiator]</b> off – the valve’s gone.</p>

  <p><b>[Sutton United boss Paul Doswell has said that goalkeeper Wayne Shaw did not show the club in the best light when he was caught on television eating a pie on the bench as his side lost 2-0 in the FA Cup to Arsenal]</b> I don’t think it shows us in the best light. I think Wayne has become this global superstar on the back of being 23 stone. He’s made that a chance to make some more media coverage off the back of it, the reality is I don’t know but it wouldn’t surprise me.<br /><br />As much as it’s been great for the club it’s not been the best three weeks in my life. It impeded everything I do. I’ve not been able to do a proper day of work. The social media world is not all it’s cracked up to be. I’ll be glad to get away from it personally and get back to my normal life</p>

  <p><b>[Sutton United boss Paul Doswell has revealed that Arsenal have promised the club £50,000 after their FA Cup fifth round clash at Gander Green Lane]</b> Arsenal have been superb and we think they will help us with a classroom. They promised us £50,000 and that will buy us two classrooms, an amazing gesture and we are very thankful.<br /><br />It was a shame they couldn’t get the round of applause they deserved. It was a real shame people came on the pitch and took that away from them. I saw a few idiots shouting and screaming at Wenger and Arsenal players. You saw an idiot run on the pitch, that was the big moment of his life<br /><br />I’d have loved to have got a goal for the supporters. One of my little goals was to do better than Southampton and we have done that. They lost 5-0 to them and we lost 2-0 so in my mind that’s a moral victory</p>

  <p><b>[Sutton goalkeeper Shaw resigns after pie affair]</b> It’s been very disappointing, no doubt about that. I woke up this morning to this storm of criticism and it’s something we have dealt with quickly as a club. Wayne has offered his resignation to the chairman this afternoon and its been accepted. It’s a very, very sad end to what’s been a great story.</p>
