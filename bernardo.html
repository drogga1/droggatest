<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Bernardo, is quoted this morning on PA with some interesting thoughts on racism]</b> I don’t know how it works in England, but in Brazil racism is a crime and you go to jail if something like this happens. I think it should be the same over here - maybe things would start to change.<br /><br />When one incident happens, then a second and third one, and people notice that nothing is happening, they will carry on doing it. Unfortunately you can’t change people’s minds - if someone is racist, you can’t change that, and I actually feel pity for that person. But what will stop people <b>[being racist]</b> is being punished. It’s been too soft, it shouldn’t be accepted and things should be more strict<br /><br /><b>[Full-back Bernardo, who was born in Sao Paulo, recalled an incident during a match in South America which resulted in direct action against racist abuse]</b> If you <b>[racially]</b> offend me on the street in Brazil and I go to the police office, nothing happens, but if it happens on a football pitch with cameras and the whole media covering it, it’s jail<br /><br />I was at the stadium for a Copa Libertadores game between Sao Paulo and an Argentinian team - the camera saw the Argentinian player offending the Brazilian player and at half-time they had the images. The second half didn’t start, they went and arrested him on the pitch and took him to jail<br /><br />The guy spent one day in jail and then flew back to Argentina, but the image of a football player being arrested on the pitch for being racist is so powerful and impactful. I see it as a crime and something that should face a punishment - maybe not years and years in jail, but you should be punished and embarrassed</p>
