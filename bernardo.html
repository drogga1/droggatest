  <p><b>[RB Leipzig defender Bernardo has admitted it is impossible for a club other than Bayern Munich to win the Bundesliga at the moment]</b> Reaching Bayern is practically impossible in the Bundesliga. It’s a much wealthier club, with much better players. There’s no opponent for Bayern. If we had two, three, four opponents who could take points from them <b>[it could be different]</b>. But there’s not. So I think that, today, it’s an impossible task.<br /><br /><b>[Bernardo confesses that there was an obvious gulf in quality on the night]</b> For me, <b>[their best player]</b> was Douglas Costa. But I think I chose the wrong tactic - I gave him too much space. I’m a fast player, but he has an incredible explosion of speed. I gave him space to run and he won most of the balls<br /><br />To tell the truth I expected us to fight relegation. But now with the team we have, the campaign we’re having and the level of our opponents, I think we have all that it takes to establish ourselves at least as a top-five team in Germany, to always fight for a spot in the European competitions<br /><br />For now, I see myself playing for Red Bull. For me, it’s the perfect project. I’m identified with the club and I see a great future for this club</p>

  <p><b>[RB Leipzig are not looking to emulate ‘random’ Leicester]</b> Leicester encouraged lots of smaller teams to try to reach something bigger in their respective championships. But I see a big difference between the two projects. Leicester achieved something that Leipzig possibly may never will, of conquering the title, but I saw that much more as <b>[being]</b> random. Of course it wasn’t just luck, but I can see more planning at Leipzig.<br /><br />Apparently, Bayern are not in the same form from last year. But the team is basically the same. This year it seems more balanced, and as Borussia <b>[Dortmund]</b> is getting stronger maybe this intimidates Bayern a little more and leaves the championship more open. We’ll try everything, but in terms of the squad you cannot compare Bayern with other teams… but everything is possible in football. We have to give our best to beat Bayern. It would be an important victory to symbolise that our team is here to stay<br /><br />It’s true, it would be the perfect situation… last year it happened. I played as a left-back. The game ended 5-4, a crazy game, and he had some difficult times when I was pressing him. But at the end, during a counter-attack, he faced a full-back one-on-one and scored the winning goal for Bayern</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton defender Bernardo insists he is not afraid of Manchester City]</b> They have many good assets. We’re studying, the information comes to us in a very easy way to understand. Of course I look <b>[at the tablets with the tactical and individual information about the opponent]</b>, but in this case, it’s not that necessary because I watch every City game regularly. They have my attention, it’s the best team in England, there’s no doubt about it I think<br /><br />Each one <b>[of the players]</b> has a special attribute. Bernardo Silva is the most technical one, Sterling is the fastest, De Bruyne has more creativity. We must be prepared for everything but it’s difficult. I’m happy, I’m not afraid nor apprehensive to play against these players. I came here <b>[to England]</b> to make my name, to prove I can be one of the best defenders and there’s nothing better than face those players. So I’m very motivated. As I said, all the pressure is on them</p>

  <p><b>[Bernardo, is quoted this morning on PA with some interesting thoughts on racism]</b> I don’t know how it works in England, but in Brazil racism is a crime and you go to jail if something like this happens. I think it should be the same over here - maybe things would start to change.<br /><br />When one incident happens, then a second and third one, and people notice that nothing is happening, they will carry on doing it. Unfortunately you can’t change people’s minds - if someone is racist, you can’t change that, and I actually feel pity for that person. But what will stop people <b>[being racist]</b> is being punished. It’s been too soft, it shouldn’t be accepted and things should be more strict<br /><br /><b>[Full-back Bernardo, who was born in Sao Paulo, recalled an incident during a match in South America which resulted in direct action against racist abuse]</b> If you <b>[racially]</b> offend me on the street in Brazil and I go to the police office, nothing happens, but if it happens on a football pitch with cameras and the whole media covering it, it’s jail<br /><br />I was at the stadium for a Copa Libertadores game between Sao Paulo and an Argentinian team - the camera saw the Argentinian player offending the Brazilian player and at half-time they had the images. The second half didn’t start, they went and arrested him on the pitch and took him to jail<br /><br />The guy spent one day in jail and then flew back to Argentina, but the image of a football player being arrested on the pitch for being racist is so powerful and impactful. I see it as a crime and something that should face a punishment - maybe not years and years in jail, but you should be punished and embarrassed</p>
