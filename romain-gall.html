<blockquote>
  <p>[Romain Gall is playing the best soccer of his career] It definitely took some convincing. Coming from the Columbus Crew, an MLS club, and also the national team, and then going down to the third division was a tough decision. After thinking about it and speaking with my agent and family it was the option to take. At the time this was kind of the only option that I had to take, that I could take. I kind of put my head down and I was like, ‘I need to get playing time, consistent playing time’, and this was the best move at the time.<br /><br />Things definitely got tough. Not a lot of people see how much you can struggle, and how much you have to deal with certain things. Regardless of what’s going on and things seem to be going bad, your destiny is your destiny and things will happen the way they’re supposed to happen. Obviously that’s something that helped me go through my tough times and there were a lot of moments when it was tough<br /><br />I wouldn’t say it was a bad experience at all. I actually enjoyed my time in Columbus. I was honored to be coached by Gregg Berhalter, who I think is a wonderful coach. I think he’s very smart, and he’s helped me a lot. He helped me develop my game when I was there. Some things just don’t work out, but I had a good time. My first year that I came to Columbus, which I came toward the end of the season, was good for me. I made my professional debut there, so i have a bunch of wonderful memories. Unfortunately it just didn’t work out, but I enjoyed my time there still<br /><br />It’s a very tactical league. We focus a lot on the tactical aspects of the game. You can compare it to MLS. Obviously there’s some stronger teams and some weaker teams than others, but all around a good league with great competition and good young talent. It’s a league that has also grown<br /><br />Of course It’s always in the back of my mind to represent my country and get back with the national team, so it’s something that I work for of course. Right now I’m just focused on my club and doing the best I can over here and I know the rest will follow<br /><br />I’m excited to get my chance. I just want to keep doing what I’ve been doing and hopefully my chance will come. I’m very excited for all the new young players that are coming up. I feel like we can form a strong young team and strong team going forward. Of course I’m going to keep working to be a part of that and hopefully it’ll happen in the future</p>
