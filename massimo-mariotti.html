  <p><b>[Former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> translator Massimo Mariotti has revealed the details behind <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Ousmane Dembele</a>’s infamous disappearance that ultimately resulted in forcing through a move to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, claiming that the France international and his entourage were unreachable for three days]</b> Everyone came to me and asked where he was. But I didn’t know either. I tried to reach him and his cousin, but that was in vain. They were both unavailable for three days. Somehow I had guessed at the time that he was no longer in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> at all, so I went to his house and found out that he had gone to France with his mother in the morning. Ousmane was really gone overnight and I was the only one who had contact with him later. I told him that he should come back, so that we could talk about things and he could understand <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a>, that he must behave professionally. But it was already too late for that<br /><br /><b>[Mariotti also made it clear that while there was always going to be a period of transition for the youngster in a new country]</b> He was never alone, his cousin and best buddy lived with him. His mother came over again and again. Ousmane was just very young and needed a lot of support. They were completely overwhelmed. Ousmane himself was relaxed and always said: ‘Massimo will take care of that’. Also, <b>[former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> coach]</b> <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a> spoke to him almost daily and put together video analysis. He said to me: ‘Massimo, we need him, he’s so incredibly good, take care of him’. Ultimately, his lifestyle was good enough to allow him to put in strong performances with BVB<br /><br /><b>[Rumours had circulated after <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Dembele</a>’s exit that he had left his German apartment in a mess]</b> That’s not true. His adviser had asked me to drive to his house and take pictures. I did that after he moved and I photographed everything there. I collected the keys and took them to the owner in Rheda-Wiedenbruck. I did not see any garbage there. He left the house in top condition and never missed his rent. He even got his deposit back</p>
