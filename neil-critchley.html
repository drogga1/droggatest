  <p><b>[Critchley, not a man prone to exaggeration, was suitably impressed with Hoever]</b> Unbelievable. Sixteen years old? Just… wow, really. He tired towards the end, which was understandable considering he played in the week as well. But I thought his calmness and assurance, his decision-making, his intelligence without the ball, it was terrific. Playing against a good player, I was very impressed with him indeed<br /><br /><b>[Woodburn is expected to be recalled by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> in January having been unable to nail down a regular spot at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Bramall Lane</a>]</b> I don’t know about that yet. That’s for the two clubs to decide. But if that happens then I’m always delighted to have good players, and he’s a good player. We’ll see what happens in the next few weeks.<br /><br />It was important for him to get 90 minutes here. I thought he was involved in a lot of our good play. It’s always nice to see Ben when he comes back, he’s just a good kid who mucks in with the lads, and he helps the players on the pitch. He gives good information, he talks, so we were delighted to see him and hopefully it did him good. He needs to play games and hopefully that 90 minutes benefits him<br /><br /><b>[As for Camacho, another who has been moved up to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> by <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, Critchley was impressed by the Portugal youth international’s versatility]</b> That’s the beauty of Rafa. I spoke to him about when he was away with Portugal and he played left, he played as a nine. He’s really versatile, and he’s intelligent so you can play him in a number of positions. He becomes very useful for managers. We know we can trust him, and he’s a useful acquisition for any type of manager in any squad<br /><br />I’m very pleased for the boys. We’ve had an up and down week, to say the least! To go from what we experienced on Wednesday to what we experienced today, it was a roller-coaster of emotions. But I couldn’t be more pleased with the performance, I thought from the first whistle to the last, the boys were excellent. I always knew we could compete. I saw the performances at the beginning of the season and they were good, but not backed up by the results. I say we are unfortunate to be where we are in the league, we could have been much higher. There’s not a great difference between any of the teams in the league to be honest, it’s very tight, so when the players play like they did today then we’re capable of beating anyone. I just get frustrated with them sometimes that they don’t always play to that standard</p>

  <p><b>[In 2016, though, he had Trent in his pocket, terrorising the callow young full-back in an under-21 contest between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. City won 3-0, Brandon Barker set up two of them. <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a> was substituted well before the final whistle]</b> We’d played <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> in the Youth Cup in midweek, and he was fantastic at right-back. I remember saying to him in the dressing room after that game ‘You were fantastic tonight’, and I went away feeling so positive about him. Then, the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> game came on the Sunday, and I remember watching him warm up at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, and straight away I was worried. You could always tell with Trent if his mind wasn’t quite on it. That day, he just looked tired, and that’s how he started the game. And as soon as that happened, the alarm bells were out<br /><br /><b>[Critchley, <a href="alex-inglethorpe.html">Alex Inglethorpe</a> and other fellow coaches would do everything to test <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a>’s resilience and character. Break him to make him, was the mantra]</b> Myself and Alex would put him under pressure in training. We’d tell Bobby Adekanye (the former Reds winger who joined Lazio in 2019) to get at him, get at him, get at him. We knew there was a good player in there, but he needed to be tested and put under pressure. He needed to be in a hostile environment, where he would find it tough. We’d do it on purpose, we’d throw in the odd comment and try to get under his skin. But it was to help him improve<br /><br /><b>[Critchley remembers his frustrations boiling over on more than one occasion]</b> He could be a little bit petulant sometimes. He had a real winning attitude, but he didn’t always know how to display it. He returns to that City game for the under-21s, when Barker destroyed him. His reflection after the game was very honest. I remember speaking to him here in the back room at the Academy, and I think he realised if he was going to take the next step, then he had to become more consistent. From then, I think his mindset and his mentality around training, preparation and recovery changed. He knew he had to put more focus in</p>

  <p><b>[Is <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a> a future <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain?]</b> The things that we speak to him about and the things he is exceptional at, such as running forward with and without the ball - if he does those things, then he has an impact on the game. So, when he is in full flight and he is driving towards the opponents’ goal, with and without the ball, he is a serious, serious player<br /><br /><b>[Fleetwood, of League One, were among the clubs keen to give him a taste of senior football, but Jones’ opinion is that he will, at some point, be given an opportunity by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. The Reds’ Carabao Cup third-round tie, which will see them visit League One side MK Dons, could provide that opportunity later this month]</b> hope that our players would be looking at that draw and thinking that it is a possible opportunity for them. Obviously, the manager has numerous other players he can choose from too, but I would hope that our players would see that potential opportunity.<br /><br /><b>[Critchley believes Jones’ new contract has taken a weight off his shoulders]</b> I think anyone, when they have no distractions and they can just concentrate on their football, I think that helps. It has definitely helped him. He seems a lot calmer about the situation. He now has a clear focus of where he wants to go and where he wants to be - and it’s our job to help him get there</p>

You know what you are going to get from him in terms of his behaviours, and being competitive all the time. I don’t worry about his temperament, he’s been a consistent performer for us for a season-and-a-bit and he’s gone up to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> and the first-team staff have been really pleased with him. He’s trained there and he’s stayed there, so that can only be a good thing. If he gets his opportunity, it’ll be deserved and hopefully he does himself justice</p>

It’s a great opportunity for all of us. Yeah, thanks for reminding me of that!<br /><br /><b>[Those two, plus Kelleher, Elliott and, if fit, Brewster, are on standby to fly immediately to Qatar after Tuesday’s game]</b> There’s a flight waiting. But it might depend on how they play! The message from the staff will be to go and play like a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team. We’ll be well prepared, we know how we will approach the game. I hope they go and play how I know they can play<br /><br /><b>[We can expect a few debutants. Scotsman Tony Gallacher is likely to play at full-back, while Remi Savage, Morgan Boyes and Tom Clayton will also be in contention. Leighton Clarkson, a diminutive, ball-playing midfielder, will be in the squad, as will 16-year-old Scouser Layton Stewart, a striker who has been in fine form for Barry Lewtas’ Under-18s this season. Isaac Christie-Davies and Elijah Dixon-Bonner, midfielders recruited from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> respectively, could feature, as could Luis Longstaff, who was on the bench against MK Dons and the high-pressing Jake Cain]</b> They’ll be outside their comfort zone.

He’s had first-team exposure already, the manager and staff think a lot of him. I thought he was a constant threat all night, a really good outlet for us. But he was reliant on a lot of the players getting the ball to him and I thought the service to him was top class as well.

He gives myself, the staff, the players unbelievable support. I can speak to him whenever I like when I’m down here, he supports the young players unbelievably well - as he’s shown so far this season.

  <p><b>[<a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> to watch <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s Shrewsbury FA Cup replay on laptop]</b> Jurgen sent through a message at half-time (against Villa), which I have to say was brilliant at that moment. Even though we were going off the pitch thinking: ‘We’ve played all right there but we’re getting beat 4-0,’ it creates that element of doubt in your mind about whether you are doing the right thing and if you need to do something different. So when you get a message from the manager saying: ‘Don’t change anything, carry on doing what you’re doing, you’ve been brilliant,’ it clears all that doubt in your mind and you can give that message to the players. The message killed every doubt and settled them right down. It helped everyone at that moment. I didn’t have my phone on me but the message came through one of the staff. That option is available tomorrow but that’s up to the manager<br /><br />Another great quality of the manager is he trusts people to do their job. The best support he gives the players is he gives them an opportunity. I don’t know what more support you could wish for as a young player. I know there has been a lot spoken going into the game, but there has been total clarity around the decision and we all support the decision. We all follow him because he has earned that.<br /><br />Another great quality of the manager is he trusts people to do their job.

It was a little bit of fortune how it happened but also I’d like to think the boys had taken on the message at half-time.
