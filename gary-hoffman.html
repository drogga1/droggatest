  <p><b>[Gary Hoffman named as new <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> chair]</b> Football has been central to my life as a fan, an administrator and in my business career, so it is an honour to join <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> as Chair. During my time at the Football Foundation, I saw how the growth of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, to become the world’s most-watched sporting competition, helped it play an increasingly pivotal role in communities across the country. Now everyone in football, at home and abroad, is coming together to support one another through the Covid-19 pandemic. I am convinced this spirit of togetherness will help the game we cherish, and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, endure long into the future.</p>
