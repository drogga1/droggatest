  <p><b>[Hal Robson-Kanu has challenged Wales to make history and qualify for Euro 2016 when they take on Bosnia-Herzegovina at the Stadion Bilino Polje]</b> We’re on the verge of making history but our focus is on getting the job done. There’s a real feel-good factor around the country right now. We hope this can kick-start an exciting time for Welsh football.</p>

  <p><b>[Hal Robson-Kanu on Wales’ incredible Euro 2016 &amp; that goal vs Belgium]</b> It was a special moment. Looking back, it was more that we’d just beaten Belgium in the quarter-finals of Euro 2016. I wasn’t really thinking too much about the goal. It was only after when you logged into social media and you saw the response that it got was like ‘OK, that must’ve been special’. The feeling of winning that game, particularly after going behind in that game, against such a top team was probably the most special moment for me and the nation because it meant so much to everyone. In terms of the goal, I still get it sent to me pretty much everyday whether it’s on social media, or by friends and family. It’s obviously a part of the Welsh nation’s history and I’m pleased to have played my part in it<br /><br /><b>[Chris Coleman’s team were the first Welsh side to qualify for a European Championships and it was their first major international tournament appearance since the 1958 World Cup]</b> It was a special experience and something as a group of players we had worked so hard towards. We’d been together for eight to 10 years - a lot of us came through the U21s and then into the first team. To actually have qualified for the campaign, it was a massive achievement. To have done what we did, I think it spoke volumes of the group, the manager <a href="chris-coleman.html">Chris Coleman</a> and the nation as a whole. A lot of people wrote us off as soon as we got there, without any of us playing in a major international tournament before, but the morale of the team and the confidence of the group internally made us feel that we could definitely achieve something special<br /><br /><a href="aaron-ramsey.html">Aaron Ramsey</a> off the striker, Joe Allen in midfield, <a href="ashley-williams.html">Ashley Williams</a> at the back, Wayne Hennessey in goal - we had a very, very strong spine and we had people who could win games for us. The game against England was a relatively close game. In the end it was a disappointing result but we managed to qualify through the group. Every time we had success, whether it was a win or even scoring a goal, it was a highlight of the tournament because it took us on to the next stage<br /><br />In the semis, the disappointment was <a href="aaron-ramsey.html">Aaron Ramsey</a> being suspended for that game. I think if he had been available we would have unlocked the Portuguese defence and hurt them a little bit more, so that was probably the only real disappointment because we knew we could have picked up a win in that game. It was such a special occasion for the nation. When we arrived back we had an open-bus tour and it was like we came home heroes which was special. If you ask any Welsh man or woman what was their favourite summer over the last decade, I’m sure they’ll say 2016!</p>

  <p><b>[Inspired by the likes of <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>, who successfully lobbied the government to guarantee meals for 1.3 million schoolchildren over the summer, and <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>, a major figure in the fight for equality championed by the Black Lives Matter movement, Robson-Kanu decided to try make a difference himself]</b> So, we began looking at other ways to help my recovery and my own well-being. My father began looking into different ingredients. We did research around what might work and we kept building on that. We found that a blend of natural ingredients as the best road to go down<br /><br />As footballers, I think we mostly want to do anything we can with whatever opportunities we have. However, some people don’t have the connections required to make something happen, while sometimes it isn’t always easy to know who to help<br /><br />So, it is great to see people like <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> and Sterling finding ways to support and help the nation. They have set an example that has been phenomenal. Yes, our job is to perform and entertain on the pitch first and foremost, but if we can support in other ways, then it is only a positive. I think when you are training and playing games, you have to be fully focused on your profession. In terms of downtime, I know a lot of my team-mates play <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> until the early hours or play 18 rounds of golf, which is good, as it can help you unwind from a very mentally demanding sport. However, I just chose to work with our team at Turmeric Co. and build something that I am passionate about. With Covid-19, the NHS front-line workers have been working extremely hard. So, we’re doing what we can by sending care packages to different locations throughout the UK, in London, <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> and Cumbria. We just wanted to show our appreciation for the work they’ve been doing around the country<br /><br /><b>[In their first game back, the Baggies drew 0-0 at home to <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham City</a> to edge back above <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> at the top of the Championship table on goal difference]</b> I just want us to finish the season strongly. e want to do what we set out to do: get back into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. So, we have be fully focused on that. We put ourselves in a position to achieve promotion. The majority of players in our squad have proven themselves before, either in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or internationally. But everyone knows that the Championship is a very competitive league because the prize is a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> place<br /><br /><b>[Robson-Kanu is optimistic that he, star player <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> and manager <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> can do something equally special]</b> <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> is still 100 per cent a world-class player. He has been a bit unfortunate at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> but at the same time when you look at the most decorated players of players at the club, he is up there because of all the medals he’s won and the things he’s achieved. I enjoy playing alongside him and we have a good connection on and off the pitch. Whether or not he gets the credit he deserves, he can remain proud of what he’s already done. <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> was a top, top player himself throughout his career and in management he has achieved something special by qualifying for the European Championship. Looking back, I think that goal against Belgium was a special moment for the nation. I think that’s what you play football for and what you work for. It is part of being a professional.</p>
