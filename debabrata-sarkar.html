  <p>[Morgan also requested the club to take a disciplinary action on Willis Plaza who punched defender Anas Edathodika and got himself a red card during the 66th minute of the high-voltage Kolkata derby last Sunday] Morgan has told us to impose some extra fine on him. It is shocking that he would get himself a red card in such a crunch game. It is really not expected from a professional player.<br /><br />To some extent, it is the fault of Mehtab and the other seniors as well. When some foreigners come to the club, it should be their responsibility to tell them the ethos of the club and the importance of the derby. He should have done that first. It is not right of him to comment such</p>

  <p>[East Bengal’s Debabrata Sarkar says ‘ISL and I-League may not co-exist’] I am very unhappy with what was being proposed. We don’t have anything more to say. Let Praful Patel come back from the FIFA World Congress and then we’ll see what he has to say.<br /><br />[He also felt that the proposal to have a longer I-League and ISL, running parallel to each other, is not feasible] I don’t think ISL and I-League can co-exist</p>

  <p>[East Bengal seriously considering an Indian Super League bid] We are collecting the form tomorrow. We will study the form and then details will follow.<br /><br />[When asked about the chances of a bid from The Red and Golds] We are only collecting the document tomorrow and no decision has been taken<br /><br />[Archrivals Mohun Bagan are also considering the prospect of bidding] According to rules and regulations, Mohun Bagan are on the same platform we are in</p>

  <p>[Mohun Bagan and East Bengal apprehensive on AFC meeting after AIFF snub] We are still in dark about how football is going to be run in this country. If Praful Patel wants, we can play in the ISL. It seems he could not care less and it is not happening. In my personal opinion, Praful Patel is the only hurdle.</p>
