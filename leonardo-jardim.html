  <p><b>[Man Utd &amp; Chelsea flop Radamel Falcao is back to his brilliant best]</b> He has a little less strength, but more experience. That’s life, it’s like that. Because he is a world-class player, I manage him differently from the others. I said early in the season that I was sure he would be a success. Quality is always there.</p>

  <p><b>[Eight goals, 10 yellows, Falcao &amp; Aguero magic]</b> Normally you say you want 100 per cent on the pitch. Today was maybe 150 per cent and there was so much going on. It was so fast. The score changed so quickly. It was a great game</p>

  <p><b>[Leonardo Jardim gives Liverpool &amp; Arsenal Thomas Lemar hope]</b> Things can happen that even a club like Monaco can’t say no to. It happened at Liverpool. The figures today are very high. Everything can change very quickly. What I tell you today can be different tomorrow. I want to keep Lemar. If I stayed here for 10 years, I’d want Lemar to stay with me for 10 years. He’s young. He could play for another decade. He’s got a lot of qualities and I like him a lot.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> Jardim saw something in Jean-Kevin Augustin, but was unhappy with his goalscoring return]</b> He’s a quality player, physically strong. He’s not a goalscorer like <a href="wissam-ben-yedder.html">Ben Yedder</a>. With his physique and movement, he can help us score. That’s what you expect from an attacker</p>

  <p><b>[What happened to Pietro Pellegri? The €25m teenager in injury hell at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a>]</b> Maybe we need to talk about the ideas we have of taking young players who are 14 or 15. We think they’re adults in miniature. A lot of the time we kill players. After that, no one takes responsibility. Maybe if they had been more careful two or three years ago when training Pietro at Genoa, he wouldn’t have all these muscle problems today. A 16-year-old guy is not a miniature adult. We have to respect that. Today, we think that a 15 or 16-year-old boy has been trained. It’s not true. Maturity comes at 18 or 19 with regards the bones and the tendons. We have to pass this message on because it could break the lives of young players</p>
