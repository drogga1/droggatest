  <p><b>[<a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> vs <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a>’s steadier approach, meanwhile, wrought them 1-0 pre-season wins over <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>, <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> and <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a>, with it evident that they will be harder to beat than last term]</b> Work is the most important thing. There are many examples of teams having a bad season but picking up in the next one. It’s a new league and a new challenge. We must go match by match, and it starts on Friday against <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> are a big team that always has the ambition to play for the top places. It won’t be easy, but we’ll do our best to win this match</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> Jardim saw something in Jean-Kevin Augustin, but was unhappy with his goalscoring return]</b> He’s a quality player, physically strong. He’s not a goalscorer like <a href="wissam-ben-yedder.html">Ben Yedder</a>. With his physique and movement, he can help us score. That’s what you expect from an attacker</p>

  <p><b>[What happened to Pietro Pellegri? The €25m teenager in injury hell at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a>]</b> Maybe we need to talk about the ideas we have of taking young players who are 14 or 15. We think they’re adults in miniature. A lot of the time we kill players. After that, no one takes responsibility. Maybe if they had been more careful two or three years ago when training Pietro at Genoa, he wouldn’t have all these muscle problems today. A 16-year-old guy is not a miniature adult. We have to respect that. Today, we think that a 15 or 16-year-old boy has been trained. It’s not true. Maturity comes at 18 or 19 with regards the bones and the tendons. We have to pass this message on because it could break the lives of young players</p>
