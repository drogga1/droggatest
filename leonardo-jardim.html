  <p><b>[Man Utd &amp; Chelsea flop Radamel Falcao is back to his brilliant best]</b> He has a little less strength, but more experience. That’s life, it’s like that. Because he is a world-class player, I manage him differently from the others. I said early in the season that I was sure he would be a success. Quality is always there.</p>

  <p><b>[Radamel Falcao is a doubt for Monaco’s Champions League meeting with Manchester City next week having sustained a hip injury in their 2-1 win over Bordeaux]</b> He took a heavy knock to the right of his hip. We’ll take a look at what’s going on with it. I hope it’s not a serious thing, just the one knock, but I have to wait for the scans. Today, we didn’t risk starting him though he is feeling good at the moment. I hope the injury is not a serious one, because if he is fit, he will start against Manchester City</p>

  <p><b>[The best Portuguese coach in the world isn’t Mourinho]</b> Attacking is a message that I pass onto my players, whether we’re playing against Chambly or against PSG or against Tottenham, it’s always the same. We have attacking in our DNA. The team does not change according to our opponents. Maybe the result’s not always the same, but life’s like that.<br /><br />We are the European team that has played the most this season. Fatigue is not like on the PlayStation - players are not green or red, everyone reacts differently. When my son plays FIFA, he takes out a red player and puts on a green player, but football is not like that</p>

  <p><b>[Leonardo Jardim has extended his contract with Monaco until 2020]</b> The confidence the club has shown in me has always been essential to me. I feel part of AS Monaco and of the principality. I’m therefore very happy to continue my work at AS Monaco. The last three seasons have been exceptional, crowned by the title of champions of France in May. We will therefore work with the same ambition to continue this project and continue to grow this club with the same passion that has inspired us from the beginning. I’m certain that the future looks very exciting at Monaco.</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim claims that the decision to drop Kylian Mbappe to the bench was not a punishment against the player]</b> Was Mbappe punished? No, not at all. With everything going on around an 18-year-old kid, it’s our responsibility to protect him from the storm. I will always protect players who need it. My philosophy is to play with players who are 100% available to the squad. Kylian is not at 100%. He’s not in shape right now. It was a decision from the club. That means me, vice president Vadim Vasilyev and the sporting director, Antonio Cordon. It’s our decision for the player, the squad and the club.<br /><br />The players must adapt to playing with any of their team-mates. I’ve been here a long time. I won’t cry if any player leaves. It’s not the mentality of the club to work like that. We will try to keep our momentum. We have our idea of the game and we’ll try to project it. The transfer market is 20 per cent about buying and selling. The other 80% is to cause mayhem for your opponents. It’s strategic<br /><br /><b>[Jardim has commented on Fabinho once again being overlooked for selection to the Brazil national side]</b> I don’t understand why he’s not been called to the Brazil team. But it’s like that, it’s not for me to decide</p>

  <p><b>[After he was left on the bench a week ago by head coach Leonardo Jardim, he will not even travel to Metz as part of a 19-man squad]</b> Kylian is not at 100 per cent. He’s not in form at the moment.<br /><br /><b>[He said addressing journalists]</b> It’s normal. If another newspaper offered you 15 times your salary, you wouldn’t be typing so quickly on your laptops. The transfer window, it’s 20 per cent buying and selling. The other 80% is to cause mayhem for your rivals. It’s strategic<br /><br />I will always remember my very first day of training with him. I saw a boy who had not even celebrated his 18th birthday, but he was going twice as fast as the others in everything he did - whether he was running with or without the ball, dribbling or shooting at goal.<br /><br />It’s easy, when you see an alien, you immediately recognise it in relation to others who are normal. You think, who’s that? Mbappe. Okay, so how old is he? 17. Okay. Then you realise you have something magical in front of you. His father and mother, who are very close to him and make sure he grows up in the best way, do an excellent job. He’s balanced, serious and calm. If nothing extraordinary happens and if he keeps his health… I see a boy who is going to make world football history</p>

  <p><b>[Kylian Mbappe could return to the Monaco squad for Sunday’s game against Marseille]</b> If the match took place today <b>[Friday]</b>, he would be in it. Everyone has trained well, everyone is in good condition. We’ll decide on Saturday, but normally, yes, if everything goes well for him as for the other players. He is an option to play or to stay on the bench. He is more capable of helping the team now than he was in the two weeks before. I would be crazy to deprive myself of the best players.<br /><br /><b>[The transfer market]</b> is used to buy players but also to destabilise the clubs. Not just with us. Sometimes there are discussions that go on for three or four weeks without finding an agreement. It doesn’t disrupt me, but I think UEFA and FIFA should limit the transfer window to July. If the transfer period lasts four months of the year, it is too much. We need to be available physically and mentally to work serenely.<br /><br />It is always the management that decides, and it was the same in all the clubs I worked at before. If the management tells me tomorrow that Falcao can not play, Falcao will not play. It’s management that pays and signs players, it’s like that</p>

The figures today are very high. Everything can change very quickly. What I tell you today can be different tomorrow. I want to keep Lemar. If I stayed here for 10 years, I’d want Lemar to stay with me for 10 years. He’s young. He could play for another decade. He’s got a lot of qualities and I like him a lot.</p>

  <p><b>[What happened to Pietro Pellegri? The €25m teenager in injury hell at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a>]</b> Maybe we need to talk about the ideas we have of taking young players who are 14 or 15. We think they’re adults in miniature. A lot of the time we kill players. After that, no one takes responsibility. Maybe if they had been more careful two or three years ago when training Pietro at Genoa, he wouldn’t have all these muscle problems today. A 16-year-old guy is not a miniature adult. We have to respect that. Today, we think that a 15 or 16-year-old boy has been trained. It’s not true. Maturity comes at 18 or 19 with regards the bones and the tendons. We have to pass this message on because it could break the lives of young players</p>
