  <p>[Former AFC Leopards and Gor Mahia defender Jackson Saleh has been training with Western Stima but is yet to be confirmed] We all know Saleh is a good player, but as a club we have to be cautious when handing this players contracts. We might sign him without knowing he has an injury, or maybe he is unfit. So as a club we decided to give him enough time to prove he is okay. If it happens that he is fine and fit, we will not hesitate to sign him. We are aiming on strengthening this team and making it competitive</p>

  <p>[Western Stima are close in acquiring the services of Ezekiel Otwoma who has been training with the Henry Omino coached side] We are interested in his services, we know he is a good player who can give us the much needed depth in the squad. He has been training with us and I understand he is so passionate in joining us, and we are interested in working with him. But there is a little problem with his former side, and that is what we have requested him to sort out.</p>
