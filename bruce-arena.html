He’s very fit and has a burning desire to get back on the field and prove to people he can still play. I have a hard time believing he won’t be one of the better left-backs in our league</p>

  <p><b>[Arena kicks off second tenure as USA coach with start of January camp]</b> I’m having the time of my life. I haven’t had to move. The hotel is a five-minute drive from my house. I’ve been coming here for the last eight years. I had to move 30 yards from my past office, so life could be worse.<br /><br />All January camps have games attached to them at some point. However, I think with the urgency we have in March, close to the end of the month, it’s really pushing the group very hard and making the right evaluations necessary to get a good look at all of the players and try to evaluate who can help us in March, so this is important<br /><br />I told them before training that I don’t think anyone is winning a starting position in today’s training session. But, as far as I’m concerned, I have an open mind about how we’re going to look at this group and the other players in this pool as well</p>

  <p><b>[On Benny Feilhaber]</b> I think he’s a better player. He’s more experienced. I just think he’s a very good player, and to be honest I haven’t checked his history with the national team after 2010, and that’s with all of them. I haven’t really looked into what happened with Benny from 2010 on, although I’ve been around him in Major League Soccer and always thought he was a good player. My impressions in 2010 was that he did a good job, and he’s still a player that deserves consideration here.<br /><br />I don’t think that Jurgen calls in the best players that are available to him. That, for me, is a problem. There’s players that are better than other players that don’t get an opportunity with the national team. That, for me, is a much bigger deal than anything else. Everybody points fingers at certain things. But for me, that’s the most important thing<br /><br />I think it was just me being honest. I think at that point, I had already closed the book on that chapter of my career and it was something that was just an honest answer. I don’t want to harp too much on that, but it was an honest answer and I’m looking forward to the opportunity at hand right now and not look back at what has happened in the past years</p>

  <p><b>[Bruce Arena has some tough cuts to make ahead of U.S. friendlies]</b> Obviously when you have a change in coaches, you have different philosophies and the players have to respond to you. I think over these two weeks we’ve gotten a good reaction out of the players. They’ve worked real hard and they’re making the task of trimming this roster basically impossible. I will make five or six decisions today to get our roster down to 23 players and I will tell you guys, you can say that this guy is an idiot on the five or six guys because they all have earned a spot, really. They’ve all done so well, so this is going to be difficult to do.<br /><br /><b>[Arena said of arranging Jorge Villafana’s release and inclusion in the U.S. camp]</b> We did that a long time ago. I’d seen Jorge during his days at Chivas USA, at Portland, and he played against the Galaxy, I guess it was a year ago, and I thought he played well against us. I always felt he was a player that needs an opportunity with the national team program. He’s a good, experienced left back. He can sense the position well. He’s a pretty good passer and he’s experienced. We’ll see what he’s like in this setting but I’ve always felt he’s a player we’ve needed to look at. He fit right in. He looked comfortable in this setting. We’ll give him a few more days to get his feet under him and figure out how to utilize him in this camp<br /><br />We’ll see him in camp and see how he responds in one these games. He has to return to his club team and play a little bit more, but one of the advantages he has is that he’s in a little bit better form than some of our players here because he’s playing off of a little break from the Mexican league<br /><br />We brought in some young guys that I’m more or less looking at for potentially the Gold Cup, and I’d say that would be the case for <b>[Taylor]</b> Kemp and <b>[Keegan]</b> Rosenberry for example, and even <b>[Walker]</b> Zimmerman. They’re all candidates for the Gold Cup. We want to have the opportunity to see them here and then we’re going to follow them during their MLS seasons before we make those decisions<br /><br />I think I would say Walker Zimmerman impresses me every day and Matt Hedges did as well. They are two good center backs in Dallas and it’s unfortunate that Matt got nicked up a bit, but we really feel responsible to MLS clubs in these kinds of settings where if there’s any damage to a player, we’ll send them back so they’re ready for the season. We did that in that case. We could have kept those guys around but felt that was the more responsible thing to do. Zimmerman’s done well. I think <b>[Sebastian]</b> Lletget has done well. I think some of the veteran guys continue to demonstrate why they’ve been leaders of the team. I’d say <b>[Michael]</b> Bradley, <b>[Jozy]</b> Altidore, <b>[Jermaine]</b> Jones, they’ve been impressive individuals on a daily basis and they bring a lot of character to the team</p>

  <p><b>[Jozy Altidore prepares for his 100th cap serving as one of the U.S. team’s most important players]</b> He’s kept his head on his shoulders, and now he’s injury free and he’s a talented player and very mature person. When Jozy’s in form he’s an outstanding striker. He holds the ball up great. he’s intelligent, he can communicate with teammates on the field</p>

  <p><b>[Bruce Arena will test out some new players and a new formation as he embarks on his second stint as USA coach]</b> I expect a bunch of good individual performances, and if we have that we should be able to be successful in the game <b>[on Sunday]</b>. We need to answer some questions we have with our roster. When these two games are completed, I need to evaluate - and we obviously have to date as well - our pool abroad. We have to merge our domestic players with our players overseas and come up with the best roster we think we can piece together to be successful in March. These games are very important. We’re thin in some areas. I need these games to answer a couple of questions, and hopefully that allows us to move forward and develop the right kind of roster to be successful in March.<br /><br />I think what you see in these next two games is what you’ll see in March. We’re going to have players show up where we’re going to have four days to prepare them for our game against Honduras, and there’s a number of them that have never worked with me before. It’s important that, between now and then, we maintain contact and communication and get a good feel for each other so we’re not starting from scratch on March 20th when they report to our camp<br /><br />Our biggest question marks in this camp, and as we move forward, is to try and address our thin-ness in the outside back positions. We know DeAndre Yedlin has played at right back, as has Timmy Chandler. Timmy Chandler’s suspended for the game against Honduras. What would we do if DeAndre Yedlin is hurt, so we’ve got to answer some of those questions<br /><br />It’s not going to be easy, but we have a good pool of players in MLS and there’s no reason to believe that combining them with our other players abroad we can’t piece together a team and qualify for the next World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[0-0 draw against Serbia]</b> I’ll be honest with you, if we won 5-0 today or lost 5-0, I’m not sure it would change our world for March. These games are important, especially for our domestic players, but the games that are going to count are in March.<br /><br />Overall I thought our midfield played well, our back line did a good job, and Nick <b>[Rimando]</b> was solid in goal. There were a lot of encouraging things out there that I was pleased about<br /><br />This time of year the attacking players are a little bit behind. They’re just getting their fitness back, and their touch and all that. They trail, a little bit, the other players and you could see that today</p>

  <p><b>[Bruce Arena will have to be happy with seeing his defenders post a pair of shutouts]</b> I would have liked to have us score a few more goals in these past two games, but that usually comes a little later in a preseason. Usually the attacking players need a little bit more time. The biggest thing we can influence the most with the team is our mentality when our opponents have the ball, and how we move and react. I’ve been encouraged by how we’ve been able to become a pretty solid defensive group over the last couple of weeks, so that’s a real positive<br /><br />Jordan Morris has made a statement. He’s clearly a likely candidate for our camp in March. Jordan impressed me<br /><br /><b>[Lletget worked on the left flank]</b> I thought it was a good workmanlike performance from Lletget and Pontius<br /><br /><b>[on Graham Zusi’s performance]</b> It’s nice that we got Zusi almost two full games in that position. He could offer us depth there and certainly play if he’s positioned to do that<br /><br />Walker missed the first three or four days of camp, he had a little bit of a knee problem when camp started. I was focusing so much on Matt <b>[Hedges]</b>, I really felt Matt was having a very good camp before he got hurt, I think he’s an outstanding prospect at center back. And then, as the last couple of weeks went on, Walker got better and better every day, and I thought tonight he had a terrific game<br /><br />Jorge looked very good, and that’s a position that I have some concerns about, the outside back positions. To have <b>[Greg Garza and Villafana]</b> in camp and both have played games and held up pretty well, that’s encouraging. Both Greg and Jorge are players we can look at as we continue to develop a roster for the qualifiers</p>

He was in with us for a week during the camp, he came in from Stoke to have our doctors look at him. He’s a terrific kid. He can have any kind of opinion he wishes to have politically. The soccer part we’ve got to kind of be on the same page, though</p>

  <p><b>[Bruce Arena comfortable starting Brad Guzan despite lack of club playing time]</b> Brad Guzan is a very experienced goalkeeper. As we saw in the case of Nick Rimando in the January camp, that experience means a lot. Because they’re not getting games on a consistent basis doesn’t mean you can rule them out. I think Brad has shown enough that he’s still a strong candidate to be our No. 1 goalkeeper.<br /><br /><b>[The USA may be forced to rely on Guzan in part due to an injury to Tim Howard]</b> In the case of Tim Howard, he’s moving along pretty well. I believe he’s 12 weeks out of surgery. The expectation for him is his full recovery would be between 12 and 16 weeks, so he’s on schedule to hopefully start the first week of the Major League Soccer season. Having said that though, it could be off a couple weeks and perhaps he won’t be a candidate for March. Right now he’s in the picture and that’s a positive</p>

Again, I think in his case, we need to be very cautious.<br /><br />I’m aware of the fact that <b>[Howard]</b> trained pretty hard yesterday. So I think when you come back from those kind of injuries, you always have some kind of minor little setback. You get a strain or a little bit of fatigue … I think that’s normal<br /><br /><b>[Cameron]</b> is a little sore, naturally. It was his first game in a long time, so we’ll just follow him through the week.<br /><br /><b>[The coach added that he’s not expecting Dempsey, Howard and Cameron to all be available]</b> We’d like to have them all.

  <p><b>[Bruce Arena says Julian Green is still in the mix for a spot on the United States roster for March’s World Cup qualifiers]</b> He is. We’ve seen him in person twice over the last three weeks. I saw him play against Heidenheim and one of our assistants saw him play a few weeks ago in Stuttgart. We followed his progress the last couple of weeks and he hasn’t been in the starting XI for Stuttgart, so we’re going to watch him this weekend and make a final decision on him over the next week or so.<br /><br />It was great to see him play in the opening game in Houston for Seattle. I want to follow him again this weekend and really see where he’s at physically - if he’s getting a little bit sharper, if he’s increasing his workload on the field. We know he’s obviously a very good player and has a great history with the national team. But we want to be smart about Clint and make sure he’s ready to play international soccer. The next two weekends are going to be very important so we’ll follow him closely but I’m happy to see he’s back on the field and I’m confident he’ll be part of the national team at some point in 2017<br /><br />He plays almost on a regular basis as a left-sided midfielder at Borussia Monchengladbach. If we can, we want to play Fabian in the midfield. That’s one of our goals for 2017 - to find a regular position for him to play on a consistent basis<br /><br />Tim Howard is coming off an injury and didn’t play last weekend. We’re waiting to see whether he plays for Colorado this weekend. If he’s healthy and continues to make progress he’ll obviously get strong consideration for the call-ups in March</p>

I think players should stand for the national anthem. I think representing your country is one of the greatest honors a player or coach can have. That would be my expectations of the players as well.<br /><br />I think it’s a real simple approach: win the game. We’re going to do whatever we need to do to win. It’s important to get three points in that game because obviously you know where we stand in the Hex right now. We’ll have our players ready to go. We’ve got to go out, be aggressive and get some goals</p>

  <p><b>[Bruce Arena had been clear in recent weeks and months about wanting to be cautious with Clint Dempsey’s return to the U.S. national team]</b> Clint has a history that is almost second to none. We know there are some good days still ahead for Clint. He’s made great progress in preseason and his first two games with Seattle, and we think he’s a player that can still help us in these games – perhaps at a reduced role – but a player that still has a tremendous history of scoring goals and creating opportunities. To have that kind of player available I think is invaluable<br /><br />We put together a roster that we think has balance and one that gives us an option in playing a number of different ways. It’s a roster where the primary rationale is to help us be successful in these two games, but we’re also looking down the road and bringing in some young players that we think have an opportunity to be an important part of the national team program as well. Our approach to these games is simple: We want to win<br /><br />Obviously being suspended for the first game, I didn’t think it was worth having Timmy travel from Europe. Jones is a different situation. He’s a domestic player, so I think that makes a little more sense</p>

  <p><b>[Fabian Johnson is poised to play on the left side of midfield in the U.S. national team’s upcoming World Cup qualifiers]</b> I think we’re going to play him where he plays for his club team. It only makes sense to me. He’s played a number of games for Gladbach on the left side of midfield, and I think that’s his natural position where he feels most comfortable and that’s where we’re going to position him<br /><br />That’s a position that I think the national team has been lacking in. Fabian Johnson has been placed in that role over the last couple of years, and I believe he’s best suited in the midfield. We have a young, talented left back in Jorge Villafana who showed very well in January, and we’ve watched him in some Mexican cup matches. He’s playing well. And DaMarcus you know you can always put in at any time. He’s experienced, he’s got the right attitude, he understands the group. If it comes to crunch time, we can always put DaMarcus on the field<br /><br />Tim’s track record demonstrates the fact that, if healthy, you think he needs to be in the squad. We’ll see in the week in training in San Jose. If he’s in good form, he’s feeling right, there’s no reason to believe he’s not going to play<br /><br />I think Bobby Wood is in great form right now, and you have to think he’s going to be there. Jozy and Jordan give us other options as well, and Clint - depending on how we align ourselves - can be a second forward or he can play underneath the striker in the midfield as well. I think we have good options up top</p>

For the national team, he’s played more often than not as a center back, but he’s also played right back and holding midfielder. We don’t want to make a habit of moving players around a whole lot, but in this case we’ll probably look at Geoff as either a center back or a right back.<br /><br />I’ve known Dax McCarty for a number of years, I think he’s a very good player. I saw him up close in our camp in January. He played well. He’s experienced, he communicates well. He fits in well with the group, and watching him play in his first two games with Chicago convinced me that he can be a player that can be an important part of our squad</p>

I think his last couple of months with his club team in Germany have been good. He has very little experience at the international level and he’s going to need to get a taste of it to continue to grow as a player, but he has all the tools to become a very good player. I look forward to seeing how he reacts in these next two games.<br /><br />He does remind me of Landon <b>[Donovan]</b>. But he has a long way to go before he gets to stand next to Landon, because Landon, we saw a player have a tremendous career at both the club and international levels. Christian’s just starting and we don’t know what it’s going to look like 10 years down the road, but certainly at this age, he reminds me a lot of Landon</p>

Good movement off the ball, looking to counterattack when those possibilities are there, winning the ball back quickly and attacking with the team in numbers. Again, no one can ever predicts how any game’s going to go, how any team is going to play. Regardless of that, we’re prepared to deal with any kind of tactics that the Honduran team employs, but certainly any team that plays with greater numbers behind the ball it’s going to take some creative play, good, quick ball movement and a little bit of luck. Obviously set pieces then become important and just a simple understanding of our players how to break down those types of formations.</p>

  <p><b>[Bruce Arena believes his team could be among the favorites to win the 2026 World Cup]</b> In 1994 I think the U.S. was looked at as this emerging frontier in the game and FIFA wanted to bring the U.S. into the world’s game. I think in 2026 we’re going to be fully emerged in the game and a big player. I think 2026 will be the time where we’re going to start talking about winning a World Cup to be honest with you. It wasn’t going to be in 1994, it wasn’t going to be in 2010, but 2026 could be our time. I think that’s the difference.<br /><br />We’re one of the host countries, which is an advantage. Think about where we’re going to be in nine more years. Think about where we were in 1994, ‘98, 2000, keep going, and just think about where we will be with even nine more years in our league. Eight or nine more years of players developing all over the world, and then playing a World Cup in our country. I think we’re going to be positioned to be a big player by 2026. I’m not saying we’re hosting the World Cup, but if we were <b>[to host]</b>.<br /><br />There’s no loss of urgency. we’re far from out of the woods here. I think we have very little margin for error, so there’s a lot of urgency in these two games</p>

  <p><b>[Steven Gerrard will begin his Rangers managerial career with a match up against FK Shkupi in a Europa League preliminary round contest]</b> Well being a manager or a coach at any level requires some experience. Steven Gerrard’s only a couple years out of playing, he’s had some time at the academy level at Liverpool. I think in time he can become a strong manager. I think Rangers are a club with a lot of tradition in Scotland, as of late they have not been a strong club - they were relegated some years ago because I think of some financial irregularities, I’m not exactly sure. But now they’re back in the first division, they’re way behind Celtic but it’s going to be Steven’s job to get them back up and competitive with Celtic. I think Steven Gerrard’s always wanted to stay involved in the sport his whole life. His background is a strong one as a player, got some good experience in the United States as well, it helps him grow. It remains to be seen what he’ll be like as a manager but one would think he’s got a lot of the characteristics you need to be successful</p>

  <p><b>[Bruce Arena points out, the rush into South America by deep-pocketed teams like LAFC and Atlanta has driven up the price of the continent’s players dramatically over the past two seasons]</b> South American now is almost cost-prohibitive. Because of the money being spent there by Atlanta and LAFC, everyone thinks in South America now that the teams in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> have a lot of money to spend. It’s becoming now too expensive<br /><br /><b>[The league’s Hispanic fan base, the fastest-growing segment of its audience]</b> <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> was moving in the direction it was moving in because of the demographics in the United States. And from a commercial perspective, a marketing perspective, a branding perspective, certainly the Hispanic market is huge. And we must attract that market to our league. That’s part of the emphasis in the players you recruit as well. However those things do change<br /><br />Every market’s going to be a little bit different. Galaxy has decided what their team’s going to look like. I would not be surprised if they signed more players from Argentina. That’s going to be their team. The Portlands and the Seattles and the Torontos, they’re all going to be balanced a little bit differently the way they recruit players. So everything is going to be unique. And I think that’s kind of the beautiful part of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. It’s tremendous. That’s what our country is too is it not? Our country is diverse and I think our league will be diverse

  <p><b>[Bruce Arena has reflected on missing the 2018 World Cup]</b> For me, it was a great experience. That year in 2017, pushing that team and trying to get qualified for the World Cup. We couldn’t have come any closer than we came. And it’s unfortunate that we didn’t qualify. But I’m very proud of the job myself and my staff did, and the effort the players gave. I think the American public, and the media, did a really poor job, even to this day, of articulating what happened, and the real world of those things. It’s all part of the sport. You don’t win all the time. If I’m not mistaken, in the last World Cup, Italy wasn’t in it, and Holland wasn’t in it. And we’re not in it, so wake up and deal with it. It’s all part of it</p>
