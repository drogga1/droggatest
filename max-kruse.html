  <p><b>[Germany international forward Max Kruse says he turned down an offer from Liverpool earlier this summer]</b> During the transfer period, I’ve received lots of offers and one of them was Liverpool. But I decided to join Fenerbahce because I believe I will be very happy there. I spoke with a lot of players during that period and I am happy about my decision</p>

  <p><b>[German forward Max Kruse says that the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>’s return to play has been boring]</b> The games were relatively boring without fans. Fans are part of football. Why didn’t you stop and then continue playing in August?<br /><br /><b>[Many of those measured left players like Kruse confused about whether the policies in place are actually working as intended]</b> I think there are some things there that you just have to scratch your head about. Substitutes wear face masks and sit two metres apart in the stands, they warm up with a mask, then when they’re subbed on… it’s no longer infectious? Or do I just not understand?<br /><br />Watching the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> is fun! Especially the rules of cheering: no physical contact when cheering but holding on to <b>[opponents]</b> on corners is not a problem</p>

  <p><b>[Former Germany international Max Kruse says he cancelled his contract at Fenerbahce this week as he has not been paid his full salary since February]</b> I have never broken contracts in my career and would not give notice of termination if Fenerbahce had kept to the contractual arrangements</p>
