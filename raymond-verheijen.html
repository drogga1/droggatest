  <p><b>[Popular and adored, wise yet modest, respected and likeable, he was, in the words of his friend and Wales No.2 Raymond Verheijen a beautiful person]</b> Gary speed has no ego. He is smart, and secure enough to delegate. He lets me do what I want, which is to develop the playing style and the tactical sessions, but he is still the guy in charge. He makes all the decisions. We have an excellent partnership</p>

  <p><b>[Fitness expert Raymond Verheijen says <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>’s <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Ziyech</a> and Mazraoui would be irresponsible to fast against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> It would be irresponsible if <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Ziyech</a> and Mazraoui stick to the fasting requirements of Ramadan at this stage of the season. Ajax’s situation is extreme - everyone is aware of that. The players’ bodies will be deregulated, as they will be changing a pattern of training and diet of the past 11 months. If you do this now, in the ultimate performance weeks of the season, it is like throwing a spanner in a wheel. Their blood sugar level will be lower - and that means less and less energy. Not only does that make athletes less alert, it will also send weaker signals to the muscles of the body. The sun sets on Wednesday night at 21.18 in local time and the second leg of the semi-final kicks off at 21.00. You can’t play without eating before the game. And what about if this match goes to extra time, with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> leading 1-0? I expect the players to realise that this is almost impossible for them</p>
