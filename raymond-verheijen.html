  <p><b>[Popular and adored, wise yet modest, respected and likeable, he was, in the words of his friend and Wales No.2 Raymond Verheijen a beautiful person]</b> Gary speed has no ego. He is smart, and secure enough to delegate. He lets me do what I want, which is to develop the playing style and the tactical sessions, but he is still the guy in charge. He makes all the decisions. We have an excellent partnership</p>

  <p><b>[Hodgson ignored ‘overwhelming’ Sterling medical advice]</b> Sterling is totally right. He does need at least two days of recovery after every match. It is a given. For Roy to say there is no evidence for this is a joke. He makes himself look like a dinosaur. There is overwhelming evidence.<br /><br />In Sterling’s case, there are three reasons for this. Firstly, young players develop more fatigue during a game than mature players. His body has not fully grown yet but he has the same matchday workload as everyone else, because the game determines what you do. The load ability of Sterling is less than the load ability of a 26-year-old, which means if Sterling does the same load his body will be more tired.<br /><br />Secondly, Sterling is an explosive player. He has a lot of fast muscle fibres, which are white because not a lot of blood flows through these fibres. Slow muscle fibres are red because they need a lot of blood. If there is a lot of blood, there is a lot of oxygen. Fast muscle fibres recover slower because there is less oxygen. Because Sterling has a lot of fast muscle fibres he will <b>[recover]</b> slower than somebody with slow muscle fibres.<br /><br />Thirdly, because of the factors of Sterling’s age and explosiveness, he is more likely to accumulate fatigue and get injured. When players have accumulated fatigue, their nervous system slows down and the signal from the brain to the muscles arrives later. For instance, if the muscles that protect the knee fail to contract in time when you are turning - because the signal has arrived a millisecond too late - you can say goodbye to your ACL <b>[Anterior Cruciate Ligament]</b></p>

  <p><b>[On Wales’s recovery session]</b> Gareth Bale is an explosive player like Sterling and Sturridge. When I was with Wales and Bale played a Sunday match, he had a recovery session on the Monday and a day off on the Tuesday. The two days of recovery was common sense to ensure he did not get injured.<br /><br />In England the coach education is rubbish and that’s why Sturridge got injured in training on international duty. They don’t know about <b>[the less is more]</b> periodisation <b>[approach]</b> and tailoring players’ training methods. I have a lot of respect for the way Brendan Rodgers handles this situation. He is very polite even though he knows England are not looking after Liverpool’s players properly. At least they <b>[England]</b> tried to prevent Sterling getting injured but the player should not have to manage his own conditioning. Roy has clearly not learned from the Sturridge case</p>

  <p><b>[Fitness expert Raymond Verheijen says <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>’s <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Ziyech</a> and Mazraoui would be irresponsible to fast against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> It would be irresponsible if <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Ziyech</a> and Mazraoui stick to the fasting requirements of Ramadan at this stage of the season. <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>’s situation is extreme - everyone is aware of that. The players’ bodies will be deregulated, as they will be changing a pattern of training and diet of the past 11 months. If you do this now, in the ultimate performance weeks of the season, it is like throwing a spanner in a wheel. Their blood sugar level will be lower - and that means less and less energy. Not only does that make athletes less alert, it will also send weaker signals to the muscles of the body. The sun sets on Wednesday night at 21.18 in local time and the second leg of the semi-final kicks off at 21.00. You can’t play without eating before the game. And what about if this match goes to extra time, with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> leading 1-0? I expect the players to realise that this is almost impossible for them</p>
