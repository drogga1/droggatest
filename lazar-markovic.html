  <p><b>[Lazar Markovic hits out at Liverpool for lack of faith following £20 million transfer]</b> Liverpool spent money on me and I believe they should have believed more in my ability. Both Liverpool and the manager. I believed I should have played more than I did. I got the chance to play more elsewhere. I have no problems with that.<br /><br />We don’t know what will happen yet, it depends on the Liverpool situation. I still have two years on my contract at Liverpool. We shall see. I enjoy playing in the Premier League and would like to stay in the Premier League. I came to England to play football and I think I have proved myself. And proved to those who thought otherwise. I enjoy playing for this manager <b>[Silva]</b>. There are only positives about him. The manager is very positive and has a lot of respect from the players. He gets 100% from all of us. This is my best form so far</p>

  <p><b>[Marko Grujic urged to find Liverpool exit but avoid Lazar Markovic mistake. Zoran Stojadinovic said]</b> Grujic has to go somewhere in January in a loan, in a team where he will play. It must be an English club, so as not to make a mistake like Lazar Markovic did<br /><br />Had Lazar been my client, I would never advise him to leave England. He changed the country, the style of football, the temperament, the climate, and therefore his return to Liverpool was an impossible mission. To return to Grujic, he is very much appreciated in Liverpool and therefore he did not go anywhere because they did not want to let him go. But he needs more minutes in the field and that’s why the loan is the best solution for him in January to return to Liverpool after his return to the starting line-up</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool attacker Lazar Markovic has dismissed claims that his proposed deadline day transfer to Anderlecht collapsed due to his wage demands]</b> Thank you for making such a great effort for trying to get me back in the club. However, money was not the issue! Good luck in the future Anderlecht.</p>
