  <p><b>[Ronny Johnsen says a strange season could yet see <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> slip up and hand his former club <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title]</b> It’s been a strange season this time, because if it was another season either <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> or <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> could win the league with such a point. It’s been an interesting season for neutrals because it is very tight at the top. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have been fantastic lately but I’ve seen <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> lose points when you don’t believe they’re going to lose points so you never know<br /><br /><b>[Former Norwegian international Johnsen pinpointed key injuries to star performers such as <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> and <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a> for the reason why United don’t sit at the top of the pile]</b> United have had some injuries to key players and some unlucky results. When you saw them at the <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> game here at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> I’ve probably never seen them as good as they were for 25 minutes. That’s football. Sometimes you’re lucky and sometimes you’re very unlucky which they were in that game - as I said, a strange season<br /><br /><b>[Johnsen was back at the <a href="manchester-united.html">Theatre of Dreams</a> to play in a charity match to raise money for Sport Relief and the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> Foundation. He couldn’t wait to walk out again on to the famous turf at the stadium]</b> It’s been eight years since I was here so it is going down memory lane almost. I’m looking forward to going down the tunnel again so it’s going to be a strange but fantastic feeling. As you know, I played at United for a long time and won lots of things. I am really looking forward to going on the pitch again even though the legs are not the same!</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="john-arne-riise.html">John Arne Riise</a> and Ronny Johnsen looking for nothing less than a win]</b> Yes, that’s the reason we want to play again you know so we can try to win again here in Singapore. Although we did beat them in Bangkok. We will have a few more good players e.g. (Luis Garcia), (Vladimir Smicer), (Paul Walsh) and it’s all about getting the right result. The competitiveness will be there when the first whistle blows and the only goal in our mind will be to win<br /><br /><b>[When Ronny was asked about the rivalry between <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I think those games (United v Liverpool), they live their own lives. If people say they have written off United for that game, I will say it’s never going to happen. Because when these two teams are on the pitch, their league position does not matter. United currently are not getting the right results and when that doesn’t happen, there is no confidence. But I think Ole (Gunnar Solksjaer), knows the way and I think he will get time to show he is a good manager<br /><br /><b>[Finally, when asked for predictions for the scoreline when <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Masters take on United Masters later in November]</b> 3-0 for United, no doubt</p>

  <p><b>[Johnsen was full of praise for the <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> striker]</b> <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> (Ibrahimovic) is a fantastic footballer. He’s already 35 and he can still score so many goals - it’s unreal. You have to ‘learn’ a player to find out how to stop him. It’s difficult (to handle someone like Zlatan), but it also depends on your teammates</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> defender Ronny Johnsen has admitted he was initially unsure about <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>]</b> It’s so important that you have the base and the foundation in the team since it calms down the team as well. You know that we’re defensively strong and it works and you trust each other.<br /><br />I think every game they play together now it will benefit them. They get to know each other even better. As a centre-back or a defensive player it’s so important that you know each other, know each other’s strengths and weaknesses so when you do that it will progress to another level. Looking back on the last games we’ve seen with United I think it looks really good</p>

  <p><b>[Ronny Johnsen says <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> has brought a sense of calm to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s defence]</b> He’s come into the team, took the team, he’s a captain so everything seems to calm down. It was a very good signing for United. I was a little bit unsure of him at the beginning when he came from <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. But he seems like he lifts his game with better players around him and that’s part of it as well<br /><br />You get to play with better players every day and you go out there and have the confidence to meet the best players in the league and you get to know each other so it builds on everything. It looks really good, I have to say<br /><br /><b>[Johnsen added on <a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a>’s partnership with <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Lindelof</a>]</b> It’s so important that you have the base and the foundation in the team since it calms down the team as well.<br /><br />You know that we’re defensively strong and it works and you trust each other.
