  <p><b>[Justin Hoyte says <a href="jerome-boateng.html">Jerome Boateng</a> would demand respect at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and be another useful senior addition to sit alongside <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> and act as a mentor for the club’s younger defenders]</b> Yeah, 100 per cent. You have to respect him for what he’s won. What a player. You can look at him as a leader of the team. All the younger players will look up to him and want to achieve what he has. Even the experienced players at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> now can learn a lot from him<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on similarities to the Luiz deal]</b> I think it would work out. <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> is the player he is. Boateng is a different type of player. Luiz wants to get on the ball and play it around, he’s more midfield minded but Boateng is defensive minded. He’s more of an organiser and he’d be solid at the back for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I think he wants to come back and prove himself. He wants to prove he can still to a job in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. That’s a prime example why <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> want him, because he’s got unfinished business</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Arsenal star recalls moment <a href="cesc-fabregas.html">Fabregas</a> hit <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> with pizza]</b> It kicked off. I saw the pizza, but I didn’t see it hit him <b>[Ferguson]</b>. I just remember looking at everyone’s reactions after it happened because no-one could believe it. Everyone was just like, ‘wow someone has just thrown a pizza’. Obviously no-one expected that to happen because no-one has thrown pizza before at anyone. But all the emotions were just coming out. Everyone was going back and forwards with each other and then security was in there<br /><br />Everyone blamed <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a> at the time, but it wasn’t even him. We all knew <b>[it was Fabregas]</b> but no-one said anything really because there wasn’t much to say. It was just more that everyone was disappointed about losing rather than the pizza being thrown. We were just disappointed we’d lost, but everyone was laughing about it afterwards</p>

  <p><b>[former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> right-back Justin Hoyte explain Why <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>’s <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> never recovered from Eduardo injury &amp; <a href="william-gallas.html">Gallas</a> meltdown]</b> What happened that day knocked everyone for six really. What happened that day knocked everyone for six really. I was on the bench next to Gilberto and we heard it happen. There was just a sense of shock all around the stadium.<br /><br />I really feel if we’d won the league that season it would have taken <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to another level and kept that momentum the club had built up in terms of winning trophies and having a winning mentality. I think it could have been a period of domination if we’d gone on and won that title. A lot of players wouldn’t have thought they had to go elsewhere to win the league and a lot more players would have wanted to join us as well. Winning that title would have given them the belief that they could achieve what they wanted to achieve at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. But what happened that season instead allowed some doubts to get into people’s minds and once that doubt starts, it’s a downward spiral really because you start getting negative thoughts rather than positive ones.</p>
