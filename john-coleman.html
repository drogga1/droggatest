<blockquote>
  <p><b>[How Liverpool fan John Coleman has made it happen]</b> I told them we were going for automatic promotion. We said ‘look, we’ve got to have a proper go at this’. We had to act like promotion candidates, the players had to live like promotion candidates, they had to stick their chests out when they played and create that fear factor. We needed everyone pulling in the right direction and playing their part. That’s what we’ve had.<br /><br />They have all bought into it. We had a good run at the back end of last season, and we knew we were capable of competing if we found a bit more consistency. We had a blip in December where we lost a few games and we questioned ourselves. I sat our five most experienced players down and I told them now was the time where we needed them. To be fair, it didn’t happen overnight, but they got into the lads and led by example. It’s snowballed from then<br /><br /><b>[Stanley were denied promotion on the final day]</b> It still hurts now to be honest. It was heartbreaking. In the 93rd minute we hit the bar and it gets cleared. That same minute, Bristol Rovers hit the post and score the rebound. That stopped us going up. It killed us at the time, and it affected us at the start of the following season, but this season it has driven us on, I know that. We wanted to put it right<br /><br />I probably learned more in a year at Rochdale and six months at Southport than I did in the previous 19. Myself and Jimmy have evolved for the better zover the years. I don’t lose my rag as much as I did, that’s for sure. I’m not going after referees and opponents as much, I’m focused on the things I can control. I don’t know, maybe you just mellow as you grow older!<br /><br />If someone had said to me in 1999 that we’d be playing Coventry in a league game, beating them home and away, away in front of 25,000, I’d have said they were mad. But that’s how far these players have taken this club. The new owners came in three years ago and have tried to make us self-sufficient. But before that there was a lot of hard work from a lot of people just to keep the club afloat, and that should never be forgotten. Think of all the clubs who have been in administration down the years. Accrington should be a prime target for that, yeah? But we haven’t been down that route, where 45 other clubs have used that ‘legal tool’ to sort their problems. Some of them have used in more than once! Of all the things I’m proud of, the fact that I’ve never taken this club into administration is one of the biggest<br /><br />Give me a League Two game. It’s a more exciting product.<br /><br />I couldn’t be any other way. I can’t relate to people who are not passionate about football. It doesn’t make sense to me<br /><br />One of my big problems will be making sure my head overrules my heart in terms of player recruitment. The tendency will be to keep everyone because they’ve done so well, but realistically not everyone will be good enough to make the step up. Honestly, that’s a job I’m not looking forward to whatsoever!<br /><br />I have watched a lot of League One, I go to Wigan when I can because Paul Cook is a good friend of mine. I don’t see a great deal of difference between the bottom end of League One and the top end of League Two. Obviously clubs like Blackburn and Wigan up the top end, their finances would make your eyes bleed. We’re talking wage bills of £15m a year - that’s 20 years’ worth of money to us! At some point, though, you have to compete with these teams. I’m under no illusions. We won’t be able to compete with the teams at the top end of League One. But then budget-wise we shouldn’t be able to compete with the teams at the top end of League Two, should we? At the end of the day, it’s football. It’s only 11 v 11, isn’t it? Bring them on I say.</p>
