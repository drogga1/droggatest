  <p><b>[Alf Ingve Berntsen warns <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> is not at <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a>’s level yet]</b> The tactical requirements at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would be a bit too high for now - after all, he has only played in Norway and Austria so far. And also there for a short time. Joining <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> would be difficult for him at the moment. Because, of course, he still some way to go before he reaches the level of <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a>. Erling is a dominant character, sitting on the bench would not be easy for him. As long as <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> plays at this level, a move to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> would therefore not make sense.<br /><br />What many forget: <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> was not even a regular player at Salzburg recently. He did not play regularly until August this year. Of course he caused hype with his goals, but it would probably be advisable to stay at Salzburg for another year. The most important thing for Erling is to play regularly at the highest possible level. It would be bad for him not to play at his new club. He needs playing time at the highest level in order to evolve. To be a substitute at a top club would be a hindrance to this development<br /><br /><b>[Berntsen wants that to act as a warning to <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> and those clamouring to secure his services]</b> It’s similar hype to Odegaard. People are a little bit more careful with <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> because of Odegaard, but there is still hope that they will lead a new, successful era. Odegaard as playmaker, <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> as scorer. The newspapers are almost exclusively about the two. Erling’s way is completely different from Odegaard’s though. He only moved to a big club in Norway at the age of 16 and then not to a giant, but to Salzburg in Austria. There he had much more silence than Odegaard had during every minute since he had moved to Real. His father, who is also his agent, has always made smart decisions. For Odegaard, the idea was not that he can play at this level immediately. Erling was better protected than Odegaard<br /><br /><b>[While calling for patience with <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>, Berntsen believes an ambitious performer is destined to scale greater heights at some stage]</b> He often stayed longer with a group of other talented guys to keep training. They were very focused and ambitious, four of them playing in the youth national team. They often played outside the match days in football cages. He only did it because he had an iron will to make it to the top. Still, he was a very humorous boy, a guy who made others laugh with his special humour in the locker room</p>

  <p><b>[Alf Ingve Berntsen worked with <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> during his formative years at Bryne FK]</b> He still has some way to go before he reaches the level of <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a>.

  <p><b>[<a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> urged to make <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> move as former coach questions <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> &amp; <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> for missing out]</b> I’m a fan of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, so of course I would like to see him play for them. English football is by far the most popular in Norway. And most young Norwegian footballers dream of playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, as did Erling’s father (former <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> midfielder Alf Inge Haaland). I sincerely believe that he has the skills to play at such a club<br /><br />He is already very good, he has shown a great personality, he scores a lot of goals whatever the level of the opponents, and he is only 19 years old. He will continue to develop and in two years he will be one of the best</p>

  <p><b>[Former Byrne FK manager Alf Ingve Berntsen says <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> is ready to play for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> If I were the coach of any of the five best teams in the world, I would buy him <b>[<a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>]</b> immediately. I think he is ready to play for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and I think he could succeed there. Erling is only 19 years old and he can still improve in all facets and parts of the game. I think that if the great clubs don’t sign him… they may regret it later<br /><br />Erling is strong and fast. He has good technique and a great mentality. He is smart in the area, he scores many goals and he can give many assists. So I think he could play with <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a>. I think <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> can play alongside another striker and, of course, he can play as a lone forward as well</p>
