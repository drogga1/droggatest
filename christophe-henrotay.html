  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois’ representative has urged Chelsea to allow the goalkeeper to join Real Madrid]</b> I have been reading everywhere that Chelsea are saying it is up to Thibaut, but he has made it clear to the club that the best option for him is to move to Madrid. For him this is a big decision because he wants to be near his family, and there is an offer in place for Chelsea to accept.<br /><br />We have seen suggestions that it is about money, and it is true he could get an increase with a move. But he has turned down a better offer elsewhere because this is more than a financial decision. Throughout this it has important for everyone to be reasonable, and the buying club has come up with a reasonable offer for a player who has one year left on his contract when they know they could sign him without a fee in 12 months. Chelsea could get a fair fee for him now and sign a replacement. Or they would still have to sign a replacement next summer, but without getting a fee for Thibaut. It is understandable people might be upset because he wants to leave the club, we accept that. But this is a human decision based on someone wanting to be close to his children - and that is a reasonable thing too.</p>

  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois would not have left Chelsea for Real Madrid if his children lived in London]</b> There has been a misunderstanding that he wanted to get a move for the wrong reasons, but he was pushing to go out of Chelsea because of his children. If the family were in London it would have been totally different. He would have stayed, there is no reason to leave a club like Chelsea, he could have won trophies. Unfortunately his kids are living with the mother in Madrid. He had the contract and it depended on Chelsea, but running close to the end of his contract, Chelsea had an interest to find a deal with Madrid, which they did. It is personal reasons so we have to respect this. Chelsea understood the situation and really helped to get the deal. They did a really quick and easy deal together, understanding the humanity of the situation. It is not doing something against their fans it is about getting the best of a situation that is not ideal<br /><br />It’s a move he wanted because of his family and he had the opportunity to go back to Madrid - a city he loves and to such a big club in Real Madrid. When we arrived in Madrid to make the signing, I had his parents, his brother, his sister, his child, the mother of the child, everyone is there and I said to him that I am delighted to make a great deal for him in going to Real Madrid but also it’s a family coming together. I could see tears in their eyes and it delighted me to be able to do something not only for a player, for a client, but for a family, which is great. I fully understand the fans of Chelsea and no one has reason to blame that feeling. Thibaut is such a great goalkeeper and he did his best at Chelsea to bring titles and trophies so it is not a great feeling to lose such a player</p>
