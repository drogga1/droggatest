  <p><b>[Denmark Under-21 star Mikel Duelund has admitted that seeing the rise of compatriot Kasper Dolberg has inspired him]</b> I know Kasper very well having played with him from the U16 to U19 for Denmark, and I am so happy for him for his success with Ajax. He has had an explosive development this season, and that gives me a lot of inspiration.<br /><br />It’s been great for my development to play a lot of games, scoring quite a few goals at the highest Danish level. It was important for me to reach double figures in all competitions this season, because I am a goal scoring type of player, even though I am a midfielder and not a striker.<br /><br />I am never satisfied with myself and would have liked to get more assists, score more goals. But I am happy with my development, and I am happy with the decision not to leave FC Midtjylland earlier to join a bigger club, where I could have ended up as a teenager in a youth squad with a long way to the first team.<br /><br />I feel that this season I have made my breakthrough into senior football in the Danish league, and I feel ready to take the next step if the right offer comes. On the other hand, I am sure that I could also develop myself for maybe one more year in Denmark. So I am not in panic to make a move here and now<br /><br />It makes me proud, and it proves that I am moving in the right direction. But I am only 19, and in Denmark they are both legends. Laudrup as our best player ever - and Tomasson for his goal scoring records for Denmark. So I can’t compare myself to them in any way. This winter I scored two goals for Denmark U-21 in a test game against the Uzbekistan A-team, and Jon Dahl Thomasson was there in the stadium in Dubai. I watched him scoring so many goals and admired him - and there he was watching me scoring goals. That felt great. The goalscoring stats for both my club and the U19 are important to me. I am a midfielder, but it has always - both as a youth player and in my first years as a senior - been an important part of my game to score goals and deliver assists for my team mates<br /><br />Christian Eriksen is doing an amazing job for Tottenham, and he has developed into being such an important part of their attacking game, setting up so many goals. Eriksen is so decisive for his team, really clever and calm on the ball. When I watch him, I try to learn from him, and I have managed to turn my own game a bit in his direction, not only making goals and assists, but also by striving to make a footprint in every attack of my team. I want to make a difference in games. I admire midfielders like Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard for their goal scoring skills, and when I watch Liverpool, Real Madrid and Tottenham, I study Philippe Coutinho, Isco and Eriksen. Not to copy them, but to get inspiration for my own game<br /><br />It is a huge opportunity. The Euros is a shop window, really, but it depends on so many things. I am quite new in the Denmark U21 team, stepping up from U19, so I don’t know what my role will be in the games. We have a good group of ambitious players, and most of them have been playing together for a few years now. I will do anything to grab my chance to show what I can do for the team on this level. It is a chance to measure yourself up against the best young players from the biggest leagues. If you can perform here, you can perform anywhere.<br /><br />Every tournament is all about hitting your top level exactly in this short space of time. This time the format of the U21 Euros is extremely competitive and could turn every group into a dogfight for first place.<br /><br />At my age it is all about developing, and being a part of such a competitive tournament is a great challenge - and a great experience to pick up. In the last U21 Euros, Denmark qualified for the semis, and even though that achievement will be even more difficult with this format, of course it’s our ambition to qualify from the group and go as far as possible</p>
