He has lots of <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> appearances and has a very good record for the Switzerland national team. He has had a difficult couple of years with injuries, but we feel he is the full package. Two or three years ago, some of the biggest clubs in Europe were interested in him. He is a great character and a good guy, and we feel his best days are still to come</p>

It is the toughest task you can get to start. It’s the first time they play back at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> after winning the Champions League title so there will be lots of optimism and they will be focused.

I don’t worry about how many goals Teemu can score. He can score 70 goals but if we don’t stay up it doesn’t matter. If he stayed on four goals and we stayed up we are all happy and delighted.<br /><br /><b>[It is this emphasis on the collective that the former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> reserve boss believes will lay the foundation for survival]</b> There was this scene in the first half when he ran back 80 yards and won the ball. Pretty often strikers are greedy to score goals and assists but a win of the ball is also important. That is important for the team because they know they can trust each other. Only one can wear the captain’s armband but I want all the lads to take responsibility</p>

Even if I wanted to, I can’t park the bus because I have no defensive players anymore. We will have to concentrate on our skills. There were more lads today <b>[Friday]</b> on the physio bench than on the training pitch. It is a tricky situation for us.

We have training Sunday morning and we have to analyse the game so for that I have to watch the game back. So it will be a pretty late night for me to be prepared, but hopefully on Sunday afternoon on the sofa I can have a coffee and a piece of cake, I will celebrate with this. All our supporters are definitely allowed to celebrate and enjoy this day because if you don’t value these moments you lose your motivation, but we will definitely stay calm<br /><br />It is definitely a proud night, without any doubt. To win against the best team in the world, with world-class players, a world-class coach, a top club, as <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich City</a>, as a newly promoted side who has no chance to spend an unbelievable amount of money in the summer in a situation with an unbelievable amount of injured players, it’s really special. I always believe in my players. We know we were not the favourites and everything has to come together. But we play football to reach something excellent, not just realistic things. We have had several good games but the outcome in terms of points was not perfect because we played some really decent sides and so you struggle with self-confidence.<br /><br />It was important to give them back the belief and some self-confidence - but it seems like we found the right words and decisions. Against such quality you have to play slightly different because you can’t control possession against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. We had to try and allow <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> possession in certain areas and with certain players. It was complicated to prepare this game, but my lads fulfilled everything we tried to work on in the last few days in a perfect way.</p>

Sadly when Man United call, there is no chance for <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> to get a player. I’m not surprised he has become a key player for them so early.

He also has great ability in terms of end product, scoring many goals and delivering many assists. Luxembourg is a completely different level so we will need to give him some time, but he has proven he can deliver in the Europa League.

It would be outstanding and something extraordinary if we can handle this. Once you are there with a draw against <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> after 90 minutes and you were actually the better side, that says a lot about you are capable to be successful against each and every team. As long as you are capable to do this then you can also win games on this evidence<br /><br />We know that there is a bit of pressure on us in terms of delivering with results. We are not naive but we still have a chance. It is difficult but it’s possible and doable. Performance-wise we are heading to the right direction and if we can go further this way, I’m pretty sure we’ll win definitely a few points in the last games, hopefully we can start with a win tomorrow<br /><br /><b>[Despite relegation seeming extremely likely, the 43-year-old is confident he retains the backing of City’s board]</b> I know that I’m in an unbelievably privileged role. I can’t ask for a better relationship to a sporting director (Stuart Webber), I can’t ask for better owners, I can’t ask for a better relationship to our board. Also, to our supporters, who are there with so much trust in the good times and the bad times. I’m unbelievably thankful and grateful for this. On the other way, they also know they have a head coach who is not complaining and just crying and asking to spend more money. I totally accept we went into this season with a bunch of young lads and some players who have never played on this level. Our relationship is full of trust. I can’t ask for better people to work with.</p>

It doesn’t take anything away that we are highly motivated because we want to finish as strongly as possible but right now we know that it’s no more in our hands so we accept our situation. We’re not less motivated, not at all. We want to win some points, we want to be there with a good performance, we want to show our pride and our responsibility for the yellow shirt. But even if we win the last four games, I would say with at least a 99 per cent guarantee it would not be enough to stay in this league. It’s not the time right now to give fighting messages, it’s just a realistic judgement<br /><br />We went into the season more or less like the same group and just a bunch of young lads and players who hadn’t experience at this level. We wanted to create a miracle and because of that we are still a bit disappointed that it’s just a realistic outcome and not a miracle outcome and for that it’s a bit too early to be excited about the Championship season.

I’ve been saying this the last couple of weeks. It’s mentally tough when we pick ourselves up and we try to go again, we try to be brave, but at the end everything the other teams get, we are sloppy and not marking or we make mistakes and we get punished for it. It doesn’t feel like you are on the front foot on things, everything you get punished, everything goes against you.

Ben Godfrey was the player with highest potential of all centre backs in the Championship.

They will definitely be a few players who will leave us and definitely a few who will come in. We want to return back to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> sooner rather than later and establish it there. Hopefully also one day we can also spend and invest in the group of players. It is not that we are unable completely to spend money, but it was due to the necessities and sins in the past. It was important to invest in the infrastructure, the training ground. Hopefully one day we can invest more in the team</p>
