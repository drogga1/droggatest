<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Art Langeler on youth level]</b> What we especially look for is creativity and intrinsic motivation. We are couriers. We expect guys to ask why they are doing things. The Dutch way of coaching is always to lay the responsibility with the players<br /><br />Sometimes it’s difficult because the guys are going to annoy by asking every time ‘why this, why that?’, but it grows a self-educated player who is self-responsible<br /><br /><b>[Art Langeler on De Jong]</b> At 14, 15, 16, he was still a little guy. That is one of the cases where we want to influence them all the time<br /><br /><b>[Art Langeler on arranging matches outside Europe]</b> It was a really good experience because the football was not so great but everything around it - bad pitches, the hostile crowd - they looked their eyes out. It is about team building but also giving them some extras. Yesterday they became Under-17 champions and they are all going to sign some big contracts. Some of them are going to go to England, some to Germany, some of them are going to play for the <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> first team. So when they are 18, 19 they are going to be millionaires<br /><br />How do you cope with normal behaviour and normal society when you are a guy like that? We can’t do everything about it, but one of the things we can do is get them in environments, like for instance Bolivia, where many people are very poor and talk about those things<br /><br /><b>[Art Langeler talks with Ruben Jongkind, the mastermind of Plan Cruyff]</b> At the moment we are looking at rebuilding the coaching academy and looking for some connections with the <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> legacy. <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Johan Cruyff</a> was the example of how the Dutch players want to be. He was always wondering, always curious and always doing something, things that you didn’t expect. As a player as well as a coach. There are some differences in the way the <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> legacy has taken place and the way we want to do it</p>
