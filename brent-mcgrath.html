  <p><b>[Esbjerg winger Awer Mabil deserves a Socceroos call-up for next month’s World Cup qualifiers]</b> I really hope he is. He’s <b>[Mabil]</b> done well, he’s done extremely well and it’s about game-time and he’s playing extremely well. I think he’s adapted to Danish football, obviously he’s been through hard patch at Midtjylland not playing and he’s come here on loan and started playing and started scoring, and I think he deserves it.<br /><br />He’s had to do the extra yards on the training pitch and overtake a few players two or three times just because of the red card. He’s one of those players who can make something happen out of nothing and the coach that we’ve got in now <b>[Lars Lungi Sorensen]</b> believes in his philosophy of football, so <b>[Mabil]</b> has been given a more free role to be able to express himself because we know that he can be so lethal<br /><br />I’ve gone from basically getting told I can find something else to starting in the first game. Obviously, confidence-wise it’s positive because things can happen quite fast in football<br /><br />As a striker, we are judged on our goals but I believe if I keep working hard and keep getting game-time, I’m sure the goals will come as they have done previously</p>
