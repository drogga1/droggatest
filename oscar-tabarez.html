  <p><b>[Uruguay head coach Oscar Tabarez is confident star forward <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> will be fit for the Copa America in Brazil]</b> I think yes, I hope so, he’s working well. I can’t give you details but he keeps us updated through videos and images. He’s working on his recovery and I know the meaning Luis gives to these things, I know he’ll give 100 per cent to be fit when the competition starts. I don’t want to rush, injuries are always due to circumstances, not to the players’ will, he’s got his mind set on the recovery. He’s very professional about it and he has a good record on it, so I have high hopes to have him ready on our team, he’s very important to us.</p>

  <p><b>[Oscar Tabarez applauded the commitment of his team after opening their Copa America campaign with a 4-0 win over Ecuador despite pre-tournament injury worries]</b> I always expect the best from these players here in the national team, because they have a huge commitment to the team. But there were some cases like Suarez, this is the first game he plays after his injury, he played just some training matches we did. <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a>, he also had an important injury and just played the last games in his league. Cristhian Stuani, Jonathan Rodriguez <b>[also had problems]</b> - there was a lot of uncertainty.<br /><br />We can almost be completely happy about this win, but Matias Vecino has muscular pain and we will look at the nature of it <b>[on Monday]</b> in <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> Alegre. Football always carries its surprises, we must be ready for everything. Maybe we should have rested those players I said, but just when I was going to change Suarez, we got this <b>[injury]</b> with Vecino. However, we are glad about this <b>[win]</b> because we assumed this game was going to be hard, as every game is in South American competitions, and this win is something important for us, it is what we wanted</p>

  <p><b>[Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez offered no excuses after his side slumped out of the Copa America with a 5-4 penalty shoot-out defeat to Peru. <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>’s miss with Uruguay’s opening spot-kick proved costly in Salvador, with Peru converting all of their penalties to book their place in the last four]</b> The result caused us a great disappointment, but we must accept it. We came with the idea of winning, we tried to impose our game and could not. You have to know how to lose. We failed in one aspect, the offsides. We committed seven offsides, three of them ended in a goal.<br /><br />There is no excuse. I do not come here to justify anything. We could not win, we misjudged. The opponent came with a plan and it was not possible to win. I see it from that point of view. There are no teams that always win and there are no teams that always lose. We are going to continue on this path, learning from this defeat to keep growing</p>

  <p><b>[Uruguay head coach Oscar Tabarez said it is premature to think <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>’s time with the national team is over]</b> Every player wears out during his career. In the 60’s I read an article about <a href="pele.html">Pele</a>, I don’t need to introduce him, written by doctors saying that <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> had the body of someone 20 years older than him. So, how long has Suarez been on the national team? He’s here from 2007. How many games he played? How many goals he scored? How many times did he play injured? How many times he had surprising recoveries?<br /><br />For how quick they were or how they scaped normal things like the necessary recovery time and he overcame that, so I think it’s rushed and it’s not knowing the player <b>[Suarez]</b> saying he’s over. Not at all. Time will tell who’s right. We have a lot of confidence on him being fit. It’s very hard to guess the future of a player. I didn’t guess what <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> has achieved in football. In 2006, when he first came here to train I saw things on him that weren’t normal, but there was no way I could imagine, from there, all the career he had. I don’t take credit on that either. The credit is his. He did all that. He had ups and downs, he made mistakes, but every time he came, he brought something new.<br /><br />He was the top scorer in Groningen, he went to <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, he became <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>’s captain with just 21 years old, then moving to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, all the goals he scored, he keeps breaking records… With a huge wear out that has given him some problems but he always keeps his head up. That’s the kind of player that sets an era in a national team, and in a given time those players were youngsters. So you have to pay attention to them sometime and if you see something, you help them out. What <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> has given to Uruguayan football is huge. Never mind the chance that he can give something little from now on. I hope he can still give us something. I’m not 100 per cent sure, he can have some problem. But we can’t worry just for one injury or missing one game</p>

  <p><b>[On Goncalves’ advice, Uruguay Under-15 coach Alejandro Garay called him up at the end of 2012, and <a href="fede-valverde.html">Valverde</a> went on to represent the Celeste at every age group until Oscar Tabarez gave the youngster his senior bow in 2017, less than a month after his 19th birthday]</b> I have known <a href="fede-valverde.html">Valverde</a> since he came to the <b>[Celeste youth academy]</b> Complex when he was 13. I have followed all his progress. He was a very different footballer to what he is now. He was tiny, skinny. And he was different in terms of his personality: he was extremely shy. But the youth trainers at his club and in the national team could see that he had things normal players do not have, above all a vision of the game which was surprising at such a young age. I was not 100 per cent sure he would turn out as good as he has, because I knew I was putting a lot of pressure on him <b>[…]</b> but I think he has taken a big step and I have the satisfaction of his contribution to our win and that he answered me. He made sure I was not wrong</p>
