  <p><b>[Norwich City have defended their decision to furlough staff during the coronavirus pandemic]</b> We won’t change just to be seen as changing for a little public perception. We stick to our beliefs and believe we’ve done it for the right reasons for our business. That’s what people forget - it’s a business. No-one will criticise Mercedes for doing it, but people do with a football club because they’ve got players and staff earning lots of money. Lots of businesses have lots of staff earning lots of money, who aren’t getting anywhere near the public attention that football clubs are getting<br /><br /><b>[Webber also confirmed at no point did the club consider pay cuts or wage deferrals for the players]</b> They <b>[deferrals]</b> have never been discussed. We’ve taken a different approach and have been in constant dialogue with our players, led by Grant Hanley as club captain and Timm Klose, who’s our <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> <b>[Professional Footballers’ Association]</b> rep. We’ve been in constant dialogue with senior players, their agents and the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a>, and our staff. We had a meeting this week and presented the potential impact. What we believe during this period, as an executive committee and the board above us, is it’s about education. It’s not just about sitting opposite someone behind a camera and backing people into corners. It’s about building trust, being completely transparent and honest. Everyone treats each other like adults. We’ve done that with our players, so they’re fully aware of the economic impact that this may cause. It’s very difficult at this point to say, ‘we are definitely going to lose X which means we need to reclaim Y’. Until that time comes and we get more clarity, we won’t be talking to any of our players or staff about deferrals. However, once the picture becomes clear there is going to be an amount of money which we’ve lost, and of course we’re going to have to talk to players and staff about what we can collectively do to try to fix this</p>

  <p><b>[Norwich City’s sporting director Stuart Webber says club should not be relegated if <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> abandoned]</b> In my opinion, it needs to be settled on the pitch, not off the pitch. A big question we have around restarting is, it’s fine if we restart and three teams get relegated – we look at it as though we’re only six points off 16th rather than being adrift. But if we do <b>[get relegated]</b>, that’s fine, because that’s where football should be played. Football should be played on a pitch and not in the boardroom. But the Championship has to restart and play all their games also. What we could not accept is a situation where we play out all our games, get relegated but then the Championship can’t play - because we don’t even know if the government are going to let them play - and then they automatically promote some teams who haven’t finished the season. It’s a bit like saying, we can’t complete the FA Cup, but we’re in the quarter-finals, we’ve beaten a Championship top-six team away, we’ve beaten two <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> teams away, so does that mean we win the FA Cup then and qualify for Europe and we all get a medal, because the level of games we played were harder than the other teams left in the quarter-finals? That’s a really important sporting point - it needs to be settled on the pitch, both coming up or going down</p>

  <p><b>[Stuart Webber says <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> player tested positive for coronavirus since returned negative sample]</b> Luckily the player in question is completely fine, 100 per cent, there’s nothing wrong with him.<br /><br />He’s actually done an independent test with our doctor which has come back negative, which is confusing, so now he’s got to have a third test to see if that comes back negative and to check if he’s got antibodies which could prove that he has had it in the past but doesn’t have it now.<br /><br />The main thing is that he’s healthy and the rest of the group are healthy, but it’s a good wake-up call. We’ve done all of these measures and one of us could still get it, that’s quite scary really</p>
