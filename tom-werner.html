  <p><b>[Tom Werner has hinted the club are ready to offer <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> a new contract]</b> It’s been a period of constant progress and it’s been a real pleasure to watch the continual improvement of the team. It’s been a wonderful time for the club. I remember when we locked in our position as one of the top four teams qualifying for the Champions League for next season, some people almost took it for granted because our goal really all year was to actually win the league. We are extremely proud of what the whole team at LFC have accomplished. When I say ‘we’, I’m talking about John, Mike and I. Our philosophy is rooted in the belief that when there is an atmosphere where people are empowered to work together as a team, great things can happen. Obviously, it starts with Jurgen and his outstanding leadership. That’s critical to everything that we’ve achieved this year. Everybody is doing an extraordinary job working together and I am very proud of what the organisation has achieved, not simply on the pitch, but off the pitch too.<br /><br /><b>[Werner is reluctant to discuss contracts ahead of Saturday’s final]</b> We don’t really want to discuss his situation publicly, especially so close to the final. But I think you know that we think the world of him. We have already extended his contract once. All I can say is that it’s obviously important that he stays for as long as he likes. We believe that he’s committed to Liverpool</p>

I don’t know very much about what’s going on with the (City) investigations, but all I can say is that we are strong advocates of the rules. We expect all the clubs in the league and all the clubs in Europe to comply. If they don’t comply then there should be punishments</p>

  <p><b>[Tom Werner says <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> ‘probably regrets’ leaving <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> As far as I’m concerned, there’s no reason why any elite player wouldn’t want to be playing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. We have such a strong squad with a strong back office and a manager who I think is one of the greatest managers in world football.

  <p><b>[Tom Werner saw <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> endure Premier League title pain in 2018-19, but he is adamant that English football doesn’t ‘want a league like Serie A where Juventus win it every year without any competition’]</b> I think our fans are like our players, manager and us as owners, they want to win everything. Of course the league title is a big, big ambition but I think last season taught us the key is to focus on just winning the next game and being greedy to keep winning and see where that gets us. There’s so much to compete for this season thanks to our success in Madrid. The Super Cup, the Club World Cup competition, domestic cups, the Champions League again and yes, the Premier League. We go into every one of them knowing we are good enough to be in the conversation to win them. I think that’s pretty cool.<br /><br />The <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team on that pitch over the past year was such a united team. Listen, we have to compliment <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. They played flawless football in the Premier League for the final four months of last season. They didn’t drop a point after January. I’m not taking anything away from our season but City are a magnificent football team and it’s going to be a big challenge for us again. I think last season was very good for the sport. It’s important for the Premier League that the competition is there. We don’t want a league like Serie A where Juventus win it every year without any competition<br /><br />As special as last season was for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it was bittersweet towards the end. As successful as we were, we didn’t finish the job in the Premier League. To have the opportunity to win the Champions League was so special. We came into this experience wanting to win trophies for the team and for our fans. It was really gratifying to witness that in Madrid. It was an extraordinary evening</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> has been billed as perfect for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> by club chairman Tom Werner]</b> What comes through from Jurgen is what a kind, humble, intelligent, confident and good humoured leader he is. He’s obviously the right person for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. We were convinced of that the first time John Henry, Mike Gordon and I met him in New York. The match between the aspirations of our fan base, the history of the club and Jurgen, they match up in a way that is really perfect. I’m sure he could have taken a job at any other top club but I think this has been a great match.<br /><br />I think he would be a brilliant psychologist if he wasn’t such a great manager. He brings out the best in players. The moment I’ll remember more than any other from the final in Madrid is when the players embraced Jurgen and then threw him up in the air on the pitch. We can talk about what a remarkable coach he is but the love that you felt in that moment between Jurgen and his players was so great. There’s so much respect for him and what he’s done for them. There was great love in that moment<br /><br />I don’t think it makes strategic sense for an owner to comment on transfer policy while a transfer window remains open. What I would say is that, as always, Jurgen has articulated the situation really well by pointing not only to the strength we already have but the strength we have to come back. <a href="alex-oxlade-chamberlain.html">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> is back, <a href="rhian-brewster.html">Rhian Brewster</a> is available properly for the first time I’d say, Naby Keita a year on, I could go on … It’s also a very high-quality team and squad, which makes signing players who are better than we currently have more challenging. What I would say is that we always remain ambitious and we remain committed to keeping this amazing squad together and at a level where it can be competitive for all the big trophies</p>

  <p><b>[New <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> contract thrills FSG]</b> As we are sure our supporters would agree, it is truly wonderful news and we are all extremely thrilled, not only professionally, but personally too. We feel this represents one of the big moments of our stewardship of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club so far as we believe there is no better manager than Jurgen. The decision also keeps with the club’s overall strategy of building from a position of strength. It means Jurgen will oversee the ongoing transition from Melwood to the new Kirkby training base as the club continues to pursue a vision of being elite in all facets of the industry<br /><br />It also provides us with continuity with the existing football operations management structure, overseen by sporting director Michael Edwards, whose input into the project cannot be overestimated. He has been - and will continue to be - as indispensably important as anyone else to the direction of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club. In Jurgen and Michael we are blessed with world-class leadership.<br /><br />This is a collective partnership that has seen the club reach and then re-establish itself as an elite performer at home and abroad. Back in 2015 we used the phrase ‘ideal fit’ when we appointed Jürgen. This continues to apply today and, if anything, the circumstances make it more pertinent. We consider him to be the best there is. If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club were looking to appoint the most outstanding, elite manager for our current status today, Jürgen would be the first choice - no question. We believe this deal cements a relationship built on trust and mutual benefit: Jürgen has delivered for LFC and LFC has delivered for Jürgen. Both parties have come to the conclusion that by continuing to work together and build on the work of the last four years, the opportunity exists to maximise each other’s potential</p>

The level of competition in this league is so great eventually you think you are going to have an off day. But that hasn’t happened yet, which is a great compliment to Jurgen because obviously, the team is playing at peak talent every week. As Jurgen said, we haven’t done the job. We haven’t accomplished anything yet.

I just know that the league is extremely competitive and when we first became involved in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> over 10 years ago, we were not even thinking about winning the league.

My first thought was to just share that moment with our supporters because without them, the club is nothing.

Even though none of us could be at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, it doesn’t diminish the magnificent achievement of this team.
