<blockquote>
  <p>Ban Ba Ngo could be any other rural primary school in Thailand. Under palm trees off a potholed road, students sit at desks reciting lines. Drawings celebrating the king’s recent birthday adorn walls; metal posts and a patch of sandy grassland mark out a football pitch. At lunchtime on December 11, 2012, five armed men arrived at the canteen, separated the only two Buddhist teachers - one of them the female director - from the other staff and executed them with gunshots to the head<br /><br />Following a lull in the 1990s, the conflict slowly restarted in late 2001 with a sinister new side: violence against the education system, particularly against Buddhist teachers in government-run schools<br /><br />The renewed insurgency that accelerated with a January 2004 raid on an arms depot in Narathiwat also saw armed men burning 19 schools. There have been scores of further arson attacks on schools and the intimidation of education officials through anonymous messages<br /><br />Of the more than 5,300 people killed since the return of conflict, nearly 160 have been teachers or education workers, according to rights groups	<br /><br />The army has been escorting teachers to and from schools for several years; now six soldiers armed with M16 assault rifles sit around the corridors and courtyard of Ban Ba Ngo. Yet increasingly fortified schools have not alleviated feelings of insecurity among staff, students and parents	<br /><br />On January 23, gunmen shot dead a Muslim primary school teacher in Narathiwat in front of other staff and students<br /><br />In addition to the killings, anonymous messages have ordered them to flee the Deep South: ‘Leave now if you don’t want any more damage to lives and property,’ a 2005 letter to a Pattani principal said. ‘If you continue to stay, we will not guarantee your safety’	<br /><br />The armed men may also be targeting schools as part of a slow war of attrition to divide communities and shatter the social fabric of the Deep South. Despite decades of insurgency against Thai authorities, many Buddhist and Muslim communities have lived side by side in peace. The new militant movement, which differs significantly from prior incarnations, appears intent on changing that. In contrast to past separatist campaigns - waged through formal groups such as PULO (Pattani United Liberation Organisation) - the current crop of armed men are thought to be loosely affiliated and operate in autonomous cells	<br /><br />A 2010 Lowy Institute report noted some division within the separatist movement over this development. Some of the ‘old guard’ leaders - those active in the 1960s and 1970s - said killing civilians such as teachers was wrong and undermined their cause. The fact school attacks have continued regardless suggests the ‘juwae’ <b>[The name for BRN fighters in Malay. They were cultivated at a network of pondok schools, which focus on Islamic religious learning, in the 1990s]</b> leading the new fight disagree, and are calling the shots	<br /><br />Meanwhile, numerous interviewees also told Al Jazeera that armed men attacked teachers because they were easy targets and received more attention than the death of a policeman or solider	<br /><br />McCargo has argued <b>[PDF]</b> that Bangkok is unwilling to make any compromises in fear of challenging the fundamentals of the modern Thai state: a unitary system built on centralised power and the three pillars of monarchy, nation and religion. There is little indication attitudes are changing, despite none of these pillars holding much popular appeal among Malay-Muslims in the Deep South</p>
