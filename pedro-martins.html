  <p><b>[<a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> coach <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> Martins says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title contenders, but we’ll show our value against them]</b> There’s no secret. It’s <b>[about]</b> working. We have a good team with ambitions. <b>[We are]</b> young with a mix of experience. Most importantly, we have a good team with quality. We are working for 16, 17 months so it’s easy when everybody understands our processes. After that the ambition of the employers and the quality makes the difference<br /><br /><a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> is a big club in Greece so everybody expects us to win the championship. We have about five million fans so all the time they expect it. In the last 10 years, <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> won the championship seven times. We broke one cycle two years ago. We are starting a new cycle, a new team. Last year we changed about 21 players and we started a new sequence with new players and a new philosophy. After one year with our work, the team is more ready, we have more experience in the national championship. But every year <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> is the favourite all the time<br /><br />Unfortunately, what happened is not good for football. It’s not good for our kids. This is not football, it is a problem of society. This is outside football. This is different to what we want for our future, for our kids and our football<br /><br /><b>[But on the field <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> have got their act together. Martins has won plaudits for the way his team play their football and his ability to get results]</b> I want to see my team’s quality. Good games, good shows for the fans; the people who pay for the tickets. For me it’s important to have this<br /><br /><b>[This season, at the heart of it all, is a vintage talent in the shape of French playmaker Mathieu Valbuena. He arrived on a free from Fenerbahce]</b> He has quality, he has experience and he’s different. He’s a different player from the common players in the world. When he’s in good shape like he is now, it’s a pleasure to see him in the pitch. He’s in good shape. He is ready for this. He is happy; the passion, the motivation<br /><br /><b>[There is no doubting the financial gap between the sides meeting on Wednesday]</b> This is football. We know the value of our team. We don’t see the money as the kind of thing to win the game. If you have money you can buy the best players of course but on Wednesday, it’s just the players and they want to show they also have value<br /><br /><b>[That financial chasm has grown more pronounced in the past few years with teams from countries like Greece and Portugal ever more cut adrift from the top clubs in England, Spain, Italy and Germany]</b> We have a problem. Our championship is not competitive. We have structural problems. We don’t have a competitive league. We are selling all the time the best players and we are losing competitiveness for that. In Portugal you are all the time selling the best players because the clubs need money year by year and so when we compare against teams from England, Spain, Germany, Italy, it’s difficult. But Greece is one step lower. It’s different for Greece. Greece must increase a lot of parts of its championship. They need to change the competition in Greece<br /><br /><b>[He is nonetheless impressed with the continuity <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have demonstrated under <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>]</b> You have one game it was at home, they lost against <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. This is the negative point. But they drew in <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, they drew in <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. Difficult stadiums and teams. I saw all the games and they are a very good team. They will fight for the championship in England. They were in the Champions League final. They keep the same team, the same roster, the same coach … It was one day negative against <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> but the other results are positive and normal<br /><br /><b>[<a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> might well be heading into the group stage as rank outsiders behind <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and Red Star Belgrade, Martins has no problem with his team’s status as underdogs]</b> I understand if in England they see it like that. For us, we are just focused on our game, what we must do as a strategy for the game. We are not concerned about what people say about that. It will be 34,000, they will shout and support us in the Karaiskakis. It will be an amazing environment</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> coach <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> Martins says This is <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> and you will see that in London!]</b> Everybody in England saw during the games against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> that they were two games that were balanced. They were two amazing games. It was tough for us, but it was also tough for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. We have our quality and we will never change our identity, never. This is <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> and you will see that again in London. I believe in this team because there is a good environment inside and a good spirit. I believe we can win at Arsenal<br /><br />I think we played a good game. Almost all the time it was balanced. I think the best result would have been a draw, but this is football. It’s small details. When something fails defensively against teams like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, they enjoy those moments because they have killer instinct. But this was only the first half. We have now the second 90 minutes to fight and I believe in my group. I believe we can do it.<br /><br />We have a lot still to do. Until now we don’t have any defeats in Greece, but this is nothing. I hope we can finish our championship without losing, but the most important thing is just to be champions. It was an important victory at PAOK, but our focus now is the game against Arsenal<br /><br />What I saw was one team like <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, with experience, with great players and I saw one team like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, with young players who were not of the same maturity. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is building a new team and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> is the same team that it was three or four years ago. This is a huge difference. It’s not about the quality, it’s about maturity, experience<br /><br />That 15-day stop in the championship was good for him. Before, he didn’t have time <b>[to work with his players]</b>; now, they have improved a lot. The spirit they have now is hugely different to before. Against us, they showed competence and in the last few games they are not conceding many goals. Ok, against <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, they conceded two. But the last four games I think it was just in that match they suffered and this wasn’t normal before. Before they suffered a lot of goals and now the team is more balanced</p>

  <p><b>[While it was a heartbreaking evening for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, it was a memorable outing for <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> Martins and <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a>]</b> It’s a historic night for <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a>. We deserved this qualification, not only for these two games against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> but also for our spirited performances in Europe throughout the season regardless of the results. We were determined, we believed we could qualify and we made it. Tactical intelligence, effectiveness, inner strength, courage … they all weighed in this success</p>
