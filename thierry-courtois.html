  <p><b>[Thierry Courtois has not taken too kindly to the mole accusations levelled at him by Marc Wilmots]</b> I never in my life communicated a team composition to any journalist! Being a top player and also in a technical staff of a European level club, I know how delicate it is. My teammates and players also knew it. We work together for a long time to get results, I hate leaks!</p>

  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois’ father believes that the Real Madrid goalkeeper is being treated unfairly by the media]</b> I feel that everyone is targeting Thibaut. The Spanish press, and also the Flemish. As a father, I cannot ignore that. A goalkeeper is always the first target, it is part of the job. For right or wrong, I let you judge that. But after the match against Ajax, he was targeted because of the fourth goal after he’d played well. This single mistake has taken on huge proportions. There are also personal things that come out in the press. I see the intentions of journalists to my son. I’m struggling with that, but luckily Thibaut is above that. He knows what to do and is aware of his qualities and he will not doubt himself</p>
