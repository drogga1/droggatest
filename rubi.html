  <p><b>[Real <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a> coach Rubi has joked he hopes <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> star <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> comes down with a cold ahead of his expected return from injury in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> on Sunday]</b> I think <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is going to play from the start. It’s what I think. I’d prefer <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> to have a cold, not an injury, but a cold so he cannot play. We have to go with a point of courage but knowing that any player they put out will be good. If you go with excessive respect you are losing 1-0. You have to be brave but not commit nonsense, because they will take advantage of that<br /><br /><b>[Rubi, who joined the club in June from Espanyol, was asked to weigh in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s protracted pursuit of <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and declared it can only help the Catalans to have such a player]</b> I am nobody to say if <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> should sign <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> or not, but I have worked with him and he is one of the five best in the world. Having one of the five best in the world is wonderful</p>

  <p><b>[Real <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a> coach Rubi is happy to see <a href="joaquin.html">Joaquin</a> continue to defy his age but believes he should have ended the night with four goals and not just three]</b> It was a shame he missed his chance for the fourth goal, it was probably his easiest opportunity to score. He keeps showing how good he is despite his age<br /><br />I am very happy because we saw those positives before the results arrived and they justify that feeling. I am very happy for the fans, for the club, because we did not deserve so many adversities. Now, to learn from the mistakes of the past and to look more and more forward</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> had an approach for Loren Moron rejected as they continue to explore options to ease their injury woes]</b> Loren is going to end the season with <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a>. They have asked, but the operation is 99 per cent not done. We don’t want him to leave and they have looked at many <b>[players]</b>. Loren trains just as well as always. This is something that happens in football. We couldn’t sign another player unless his release clause is paid. Loren’s €50 million, so 99 per cent it is not done. The information I have is that he is <b>[staying]</b> here and that is what we all want.</p>
