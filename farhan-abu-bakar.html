<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Kedah goalkeeper Farhan Abu Bakar has defended himself against the contempt expressed by Red Eagles fans’ towards him]</b> To my father, I am sorry for discouraging you from attending the match last night <b>[Friday]</b>, as I had expected what would happen. I don’t care if 20,000 fans berated me, as long as you are not hurt. May this test from God make me stronger in the future.<br /><br />To my late mother, who passed away when I was 10 years old. She was a Kedah fan. When she was still in confinement <b>[after delivering him]</b>, she took me on a bus to watch a game… If my mother was still around, she would have loved to see her own son in action. At least among the contempt of the thousands of fans, there’s still someone out there still praying for me<br /><br />Yes, life has its ups and downs. Honestly, when I read the comments on Facebook, Instagram and social media I see many people condemning and ridiculing me, which makes me upset and demotivated. But my journey is still long. I will take all the negativivity as a challenge to push on. Everybody stumbles now and then. But they will not stay down forever. Let them say what they like, what is important is that I will work harder for my family and friends who have been behind me throughout my struggle<br /><br />…I want to apologise if I have infuriated the supporters. At the moment I just need moral support, instead of scorn. To my teammates, I also want to apologise if I have made any mistakes. They are among the best whom I’ve ever worked in throughout my career. God willing, I will come back stronger!</p>
