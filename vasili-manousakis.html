  <p><b>[Cape Town City’s Nedbank Cup opponents Kaizer Chiefs have the advantage]</b> We’ve been 150 percent focused on the Cup and look forward to the showdown with Amakhosi at the Mbombela Stadium. They have home advantage and will have a strong crowd behind them, but that’s fine with us, we seem to raise our game for the big occasions and enjoy being tagged as the underdogs. We played them in a pre-season friendly and won 1-0 away and then took a 4-1 beating in the first league game at Cape Town Stadium, before exacting our revenge at the FNB Stadium at the end of January thanks to a never-say-die attitude and an error from their side to win 1-0. But now it’s a one-off encounter and we haven’t planned to exit the competition. It will be a hard game and we expect to feel pressure from the home side, who won’t sit back and allow us to dictate matters</p>

  <p><b>[Cape Town City assistant coach Vasili Manousakis has revealed the reasons behind their signing of Mark Mayambela]</b> As a club we are lacking that presence, experience and calm to get us through some situations, and we know what he is all about. He can play in a number of positions, we’ve seen some good qualities in the couple of weeks in training with him, he’s just got better and better, a positive influence on the team, that’s what the coach wants. Injuries we have are making it hard for us to have a consistent line-up, and Gift Links <b>[moving to Europe]</b> is a big loss for us, which is adding pressure on the team</p>

  <p><b>[Cape Town City assistant Vasili Manousakis says the club’s technical team and players cannot wait to start working with new head coach Jan Olde Riekerink]</b> I learnt an incredible amount from coach Benni and you just look at the pedigree of coach Jan who has come in now. Not just me‚ but the entire technical team are going‚ ‘Shew‚ just to soak up some of that knowledge’. We have got a fantastic‚ experienced coach waiting in the wings‚ licking his lips and saying‚ ‘I want to get stuck into this lot’. We were always going to turn the corner. The timing is unfortunate … I would be the first one to say if we were playing poor football before‚ but we have been playing some really good football. I always knew that it <b>[the win]</b> would come<br /><br /><b>[He added that the players were highly motivated to get a result in midweek‚ not least as a tribute to McCarthy]</b> The motivating factors were simple‚ we needed closure on the previous chapter. Some of these boys had not had the chance to say goodbye to the coach and that is the way they wanted to do it. At the same time‚ they wanted to show the new coach‚ ‘We are here’ and put their hand up. So it was about closing one chapter and opening a new one<br /><br /><b>[Leopards loom large for City now as they seek back-to-back league wins for the first time since January]</b> A really tough trip‚ hard to play there at 3.30pm on Sunday‚ maybe over 30 degrees <b>[Celsius]</b>. The new Greek boy‚ <b>[Ioannis]</b> Potouridis‚ he might find those conditions challenging. But if you are to start building momentum‚ you have to go there believing you can get something out of the game. If you are going to go there with a defensive mindset and try to just keep them out – you can’t keep Black Leopards out for 90 minutes‚ it’s not going to happen. There is very little time to plan tactically‚ then you get on the bus – the upside of it is the long trip. He <b>[Olde Riekerink]</b> will be on the bus with us‚ so it gives us a lot of time to talk‚ to analyse the videos and to unpack things</p>
