  <p><b>[East Bengal fans vandalize Mohun Bagan club gate in shameful incident]</b> We have got video footage and we will register a FIR against the miscreants. But more importantly, we are waiting for East Bengal club to take a stern action against this set of fans. The Kolkata Derby is coming up and such reactions from the East Bengal fans may create serious consequences.</p>

  <p><b>[East Bengal officials visit Mohun Bagan to pacify fans before derby]</b> We discussed yesterday’s issue and agreed that these things are unwanted. We share a fierce rivalry, but that is limited to the 90 minutes of the game. We request both sets of fans not to repeat such acts.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohun Bagan to question Kamo Bayi over performance against East Bengal]</b> The technical committee is not satisfied with his performance in last three matches. We have noticed a lack of effort. We will meet him to understand as to why he couldn’t perform in the key games. We are not blaming him for anything. However, we are keen to understand his side of the story.</p>
