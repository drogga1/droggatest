  <p><b>[Who is Duane Holmes? The USMNT’s new midfielder is enjoying a career renaissance]</b> When I got released by <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> it was a massive wake-up call to me. When that realization hit when I was leaving the training ground that I needed a job basically.<br /><br /><b>[Almost three months went by from the day Holmes left <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> to the day Holmes received a fateful phone call from then-Scunthorpe United manager <a href="graham-alexander.html">Graham Alexander</a> offering him a lifeline]</b> I did have a conversation with my mum about how long I would leave it before I’d have to start maybe looking at going to the conference, or non-league football or take up a university course. That’s when I got the call from <a href="graham-alexander.html">Graham Alexander</a>, it was a no-brainer. I had a point to prove, I felt I was good enough to play (at Huddersfield), and in that division, but I decided to take a step down in leagues and just go and prove myself and get games. I got a manager that trusted me and gave me every chance in the world. I owe a lot to him<br /><br /><b>[He was performing well enough to catch the attention of <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> and their new manager, <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>]</b> There were other offers on the table earlier in the transfer window, but my agent told him to wait, then Derby came along. Frank (Lampard), obviously with the career he had, you can’t get a better educator if you want to play in the middle of the pitch so it was a no-brainer when that offer came<br /><br /><b>[Holmes said of <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>]</b> He’s helped me mix up my game a lot. I used to hold on to the ball a bit too long and stuff like that. He’s always trying to tell me when to dribble, when to pass, when to hit a long ball and short ball, and where to be on the field. He knows better than most midfielders in the history of the game how to arrive into the box<br /><br /><b>[Though he was raised in England since the age of 4, Holmes wasn’t a dual national who U.S. Soccer had to go and recruit]</b> I’ve always told my mom that I wanted to play for America, and represent the country where I’m from so it’s always been an ambition of mine. I remember going to watch the USA versus Scotland a fair few years ago and that’s when it hit home that it was something I could do<br /><br /><b>[Holmes found out about his first national team call-up in, of all places, the movie theatre. He was watching Avengers: Endgame with his girlfriend when an unfamiliar U.S. phone number flashed on his phone. He answered it and heard Berhalter on the other line]</b> I was like ‘Oh my word’, I ran out of the cinema and just got really excited. I was in shock<br /><br /><b>[His father - who lives in Georgia - was able to go to the match and see Holmes play in person for the first time since Holmes became a professional]</b> He was just proud as punch. He shed a few tears, and wore my jersey, and sat outside the team hotel waiting for everyone to sign it. He’s been a proper fan, which is nice</p>

  <p><b>[Duane Holmes has praised <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> for helping him to improve his all-around game at <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a>]</b> Wayne coming in gives me the freedom for me to get forward more and I feel like I am performing better since he’s come in. I think the team are too in general. Having a player like Wayne helps a lot. He’s a winner. He wants to win all the time. He gets frustrated when he’s not winning and his quality on the ball comes out every day. It’s good for us to learn off a player like him<br /><br />For the <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> FA Cup tie last month, we had Wayne and Tom Huddlestone in the hole in midfield and it was like they were having a passing competition. It was great to watch and appreciate how good Wayne is. The crowd love to see the long sweeping passes and the one to <a href="nigel-martyn.html">Martyn</a> Waghorn against Northampton Town late in the game was a great pass. It just shows his class to be able to do that in the 90th minute and as players, we can only get better playing with him</p>
