  <p><b>[Duane Holmes has praised <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> for helping him to improve his all-around game at Derby County]</b> Wayne coming in gives me the freedom for me to get forward more and I feel like I am performing better since he’s come in. I think the team are too in general. Having a player like Wayne helps a lot. He’s a winner. He wants to win all the time. He gets frustrated when he’s not winning and his quality on the ball comes out every day. It’s good for us to learn off a player like him<br /><br />For the Crystal Palace FA Cup tie last month, we had Wayne and Tom Huddlestone in the hole in midfield and it was like they were having a passing competition. It was great to watch and appreciate how good Wayne is. The crowd love to see the long sweeping passes and the one to <a href="nigel-martyn.html">Martyn</a> Waghorn against Northampton Town late in the game was a great pass. It just shows his class to be able to do that in the 90th minute and as players, we can only get better playing with him</p>
