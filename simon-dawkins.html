<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Chris Wondolowski]</b> We didn’t do well last season and he still got 12 goals. He was our top scorer and still up there with the goal scorers in the league. If he can continue to do that, I don’t see why he needs to hang it up. Obviously, it will be his decision when he wants to, when he’s probably had enough because his body’s slowing down, but as long as he’s scoring goals, I’d urge him to keep going.<br /><br />He keeps us together in the locker room and on the field as well. He brings his experience from all his years playing and also being involved in the national team as well. He’s great with the younger lads<br /><br />He’s always been a good goal scorer. I think even me coming back last season I’ve seen a lot of his movement - it’s even better than it was in 2012. Obviously that comes with age and experience. Hopefully, we can get him scoring more goals this season</p>
