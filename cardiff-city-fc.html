  <p><b>[Cardiff are also still coming to terms with the events which unfolded on January 21]</b> It is with great sadness that we report the following statement, issued on February 7th 2019 by the Dorset Police: The body brought to Portland Port today, Thursday 7 February 2019, has been formally identified by HM Coroner for Dorset as that of professional footballer Emiliano Sala. The families of Mr Sala and the pilot David Ibbotson have been updated with this news and will continue to be supported by specially-trained family liaison officers.<br /><br />We offer our most heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the family of Emiliano. He and David will forever remain in our thoughts. #CityAsOne.</p>

  <p><b>[Nantes complain to FIFA as Cardiff miss first Emiliano Sala payment]</b> We have grave concerns that questions still remain over the validity of the pilot’s licence and rating to undertake such a journey, as identified in the bulletin. We are also concerned to discover that the trip involved an aircraft which did not conform to either UK CAA or US FAA requirements for commercial activity and therefore may have been operating unlawfully</p>

We continue to believe that those who were instrumental in arranging its usage are held to account for this tragedy.</p>

  <p><b>[Cardiff City have been told by the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Players’ Status Committee to pay <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a> €6 million for the late <a href="emiliano-sala.html">Emiliano Sala</a>]</b> In a meeting held on 25 September 2019, the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Players’ Status Committee established that Cardiff City FC must pay FC <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a> the sum of EUR 6,000,000, corresponding to the first instalment due in accordance with the transfer agreement concluded between the parties on 19 January 2019 for the transfer of the late <a href="emiliano-sala.html">Emiliano Sala</a> from FC <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a> to Cardiff City FC.<br /><br />The <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Players’ Status Committee, which never lost sight of the specific and unique circumstances of this tragic situation during its deliberations on the dispute at stake, refrained from imposing procedural costs on the parties.<br /><br />The findings of the decision were notified to the parties concerned today. Within a deadline of ten days, Cardiff City FC and FC <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a> can request a copy of the grounds of the decision, which can be appealed to the <a href="cas.html">Court of Arbitration for Sport</a> (CAS) in Lausanne</p>

  <p><b>[Cardiff City are to appeal to the <a href="cas.html">Court of Arbitration for Sport</a> after the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Players’ Status Committee ruled they must pay <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a> €6 million for the late <a href="emiliano-sala.html">Emiliano Sala</a>]</b> Cardiff City FC is extremely disappointed at the decision of the Players’ Status Committee to award against the club. It would appear the committee has reached its conclusion on a narrow aspect of the overall dispute, without considering the full documentation presented by Cardiff City FC to <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>.<br /><br />Nevertheless there remains clear evidence that the transfer agreement was never completed in accordance with multiple contractual requirements which were requested by <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a>, thereby rendering it null and void. We shall be appealing to CAS in order to seek a decision which considers all of the relevant contractual information and provides clarity on the full legal situation between our two clubs. This is a complex matter, which includes ongoing civil and criminal considerations both in the UK and abroad, which will likely have an impact on the validity of the transfer. It is therefore vital that a comprehensive judgement is reached following a full assessment and review of the facts</p>

  <p><b>[Cardiff City has submitted several documents to French prosecutors regarding <a href="emiliano-sala.html">Emiliano Sala</a> to help with the decision on whether <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a> will face criminal proceedings for the death of their former player]</b> Cardiff City Football Club has been clear throughout the past 12 months that a full investigation of the facts leading up to the tragedy is required. Not only to fully understand what led to the downing of the Piper PA-46 Malibu plane, but to answer the wider questions that have been highlighted in this case, specifically related to the use of illegal flights in the football industry and the role of intermediaries in player transfers.<br /><br />As a result of our investigation we believe there is sufficient evidence of wrongdoing that necessitates investigation by the French authorities of those responsible for the arrangement of the transfer on behalf of FC <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a> and for arranging the doomed flight. We have therefore passed over information to the Parquet de <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a> to assist their efforts. We remain committed to establishing the full facts and adhering to any final decision on our financial liability in the transfer</p>

  <p><b>[Former Cardiff and <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> midfielder Peter Whittingham has passed away at the age of 35]</b> It is with an immeasurable amount of sorrow that we must inform supporters that Peter Whittingham has passed away at the age of 35. We are heartbroken. The news of Peter’s sudden and untimely passing has shaken us to our very foundation. Our love goes out to his wife Amanda, their young son and family. They are at the forefront of our thoughts and, on their behalf, we ask for their privacy to be respected at this unfathomably cruel and difficult time. First and foremost, Peter was a family man - and somebody who could light up a room with his sense of humour, warmth and personality. Then, as a professional footballer - as a Bluebird - he excelled with talent, ease, grace and humility. Nobody did it better. The loss of Peter will be painfully felt by our city, supporters and indeed all who ever had the pleasure of knowing him. We love you Pete and your memory will eternally stay with us</p>
