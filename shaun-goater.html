  <p><b>[Sergio Aguero was never world class until he started working with Pep Guardiola this summer]</b> Aguero’s work-rate is night and day compared to even last season. For all his great talent, he was not a complete player under Manuel Pellegrini, but Pep has turned him into one now. Pep told him in the summer what was expected of him and he has responded magnificently. He’s now world class and I’m not sure you could say that before.<br /><br />I’ve seen him in areas of the pitch that I had never seen him in. Now you see him dropping deep, pulling defenders away to create space and getting involved in build-ups. Pep wants his players to be interchangeable and told Aguero that he almost has to add a midfielder’s mentality to his talents. I think the penny has dropped with Aguero. It was a huge match for Aguero <b>[against Barcelona]</b> because he is desperate to win the Champions League with City. He admitted he wouldn’t leave until he has done so.<br /><br />He didn’t score against Barca, but his performance was outstanding. He left the pitch with a huge smile on his face and I never thought I’d see him do that without getting on the scoresheet. As a striker myself, I know how we can be obsessed with scoring goals. After all, it is how we are judged, and that was Aguero’s thinking, too. There was always huge pressure on Aguero to score, but Guardiola has freed him up a bit by saying that there is more to your game that just scoring goals. Pep values assists as much as goals because ultimately it’s about results.</p>

  <p><b>[Summer transfer target Romelu Lukaku would offer more to Chelsea than current centre-forward Diego Costa]</b> I’m going to go with Lukaku. He’s not as consistent as he should be, but I’ll go with Lukaku. He’s 23, there’s a lot more to come from him in the years to come. He’s a big target man, he can hold it up, he can give you that relief as a team. He’s a decent finisher but he can improve as well. Diego Costa is about 28 so he’s probably peaking at this time, but he’s still a quality striker.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have to keep ‘man mountain’ Vincent Kompany on their books]</b> He has been an absolute rock, a man mountain. But it’s his leadership, not only on the field but off it as well. Whenever you hear him speak, he speaks about this club in the highest way. For me, he’s been the best captain the club could ever have wanted, and he just has to remain involved in and around this club. I, like Vincent, believe he has another few seasons, so we can hope that he’s involved from that angle, but if not, we’re hoping he’s involved in the club at some level</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> legend would be ‘amazed’ if Kompany isn’t offered new contract]</b> Off the field he’s a leader. On the field he’s a leader. He represents Manchester, the Manchester fans. Not only here, but globally in the right way. Quite frankly, I would be amazed if he isn’t at the club as a player because he still has the ability to play a number of games. I think the feel-good factor from the fans would love it. And not only that, we all know that Vincent Kompany won’t let anyone down if he’s given another year or two.</p>

  <p><b>[Outgoing captain Vincent Kompany is the DNA of Manchester City]</b> What a way to bow out, what he’s done for the club. He is the DNA of the club. I’m so proud for him to have being captain, him leading the club, everything he’s done for the club. Couldn’t speak highly enough of him. He’s evolved as a player. He was a holding midfielder then evolved into a world class centre-back. A brilliant player. You still see the midfield assets of his when he drives forward from the defensive third.</p>

  <p><b>[Shaun Goater admires <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> and considered him to be the ultimate frontman]</b> Oh yes. I would not have minded <b>[playing with <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a>]</b>. Sergio makes things look easy! Sergio is a goal scorer. When you see him go deep, he gets it, a couple touches, he’s in the final third and that’s when he becomes deadly. He’s added another bow to his armour. Sergio can score that beautiful goal outside the box; I’d get a nosebleed if I did that! My goals were inside the box. For someone who’s not that tall and knows how we play, he holds the ball up well, he’s intelligent, he’s gifted technically, and got a great eye for goal. I run out of adjectives to describe him, but it would have been absolutely brilliant to play alongside him.<br /><br /><b>[His most notable contribution, though, came on the final day of his debut campaign when he netted a stoppage-time winner against Queens Park Rangers to secure a stunning title triumph]</b> <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a>’s moment was so special … I think that was the change of the guard. That period has been total dominance by City, and I think there’s still more to come with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> and his never-say-die, his winning mentality to win. Pep is a serial winner and he has won so many finals. He’s unbelievable so, as I say, we know that there’s more to come. The 2018-19 season has been brilliant, and it just makes us all look forward to next season</p>

  <p><b>[Shaun Goater says <a href="gabriel-jesus.html">Gabriel Jesus</a> is capable of matching the goal return of <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> I think that Gabriel will have a huge part to play this season. He won the Copa America with Brazil, scoring some vital goals and since the start of the season, he has looked really sharp and at it. Gabriel has scored some vital goals for Brazil and for City and I think there’s a belief not only in himself but with the supporters and also with Pep.<br /><br />I think there was a period last season where he maybe lost a bit of belief for a number of games, but that belief has come back in him. I really think we could see him playing a huge part and I think he will really be pushing Sergio this season when it comes to goals. That will be what Pep is looking for - for the guys to be pushing each other and I think we’ll get that this season. Gab handled all that pressure in Brazil. If we put a neutral hat on, what’s more pressure than playing for England? You’d probably say Brazil. So, his confidence is right up there. He has started great and I think he’ll just carry on from there<br /><br /><b>[Goater added on Jesus, who has recorded 46 goals in 102 appearances for City]</b> Gabriel wants to prove a point, and as a striker knowing what the challenges are and competing against Sergio, he knows the standards and I’m sure he will be able to deliver. There will be a lot of games this season so it’s important for the guys that when they play, they know they have to score as those are the standards they have set themselves and what’s required for the team.<br /><br />I think we have got two absolute quality strikers. We have a Brazilian striker that leads for Brazil and an Argentine striker that is Argentina’s spearhead. We are blessed to have these quality players and to have the best manager in charge of them. These two players play for two of the biggest countries in the world and handle that pressure. They will see each other in training and know each other’s qualities and the reality is they are both going to push each other and that’s great for them and the team. That just drives up the standards and with the two of them I think we are in for a heck of a season</p>

  <p><b>[Shaun Goater says Replacing <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> will not be easy for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> The goals tell you that. The stats don’t lie. The man is a machine and I think if you ask all them, he will be the first name they all say. He’s an absolute phenomenal striker - he’s a machine<br /><br />I don’t know if you can develop that type of player. I think it comes down to exceptional recruitment. To find a player around 19, 20 and to see the vision that this player has, a high intellectual understanding of the game, good body strength, good physique in terms of conditioning to be able to play week in, week out, fast - because the modern day forward needs to be quick. To recruit a Sergio-type striker, to see that, that’s a great eye and every club wants a great recruitment officer like that.<br /><br />There are loads of kids around the world, say in South America that have this low centre of gravity, this agility. You look at <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a>. On the eye you think ‘What a player’. Maybe over the next year or two he will become more prolific, because we see the quality he has already. But does he go to the next level of being a scoring player? I know he’s not an out and out centre forward. But there are players out there. I’m sure the club will eventually recruit and find somebody, but it’s not an easy task. That’s what everybody wants.</p>

  <p><b>[Shaun Goater says <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> will not head the same way as <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> I think Phil staying is an easy decision. He’s with some of the best players in the world, the best manager in the world tactically, learning all what he’s learning. If Phil decides to leave City at 22, 23, 24, he’s still got a lifetime of football ahead of him. If he was only playing two games a season, you’d think, ‘You need to be playing.’ But Phil is getting in the region of 12 games, they are not all starts. I think each year he will get more games. <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> is going to be finishing, so it’s an easy decision for him to stay. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> was never in the first team on the bench, so that was an easy decision for him<br /><br /><b>[Goater added on the challenges facing <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a>, who has taken in just nine appearances for City this season]</b> What I know from the game is the more a player plays, the more he adjusts to it, the more they adjust to that level. If Phil was to play between now and the end of the season we’d all just come away thinking, ‘Why hasn’t he been playing all this time?’ Every time he plays I don’t see a player that looks like he’s way off the mark. I don’t see a drop in our game. No one can tell me if Phil was playing between now and the end of the season that he wouldn’t improve. Now Pep will probably argue, will we win what we will win <b>[with him in the team]</b>? That’s really the question. He’s probably wanting the players to come in to take the team to another level and not just do the same. He will probably say at this moment in time that Phil can’t take the team to another level, hence the minutes that he’s getting</p>

  <p><b>[Shaun Goater says <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> will regret not bringing another defender into <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> but is unlikely to admit as much in public]</b> When you start a season, you don’t anticipate one of your main, key players would be out for six, seven months, and I think that’s what’s caught City. And they thought, well, if a player was injured, if he was out two or three weeks, you’ve got a kid that can come in and do a job. Obviously, Pep’s thinking is he could have <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> that could do a job and I’m sure he also thinks even <a href="rodri.html">Rodri</a> could do a job for two or three games.

  <p><b>[Shaun Goater says <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>’s dip in form has dropped him out of the <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> conversation]</b> I think he’ll be certainly looking into that because without the chances falling to <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> it doesn’t seem as though City are putting them away right now. I think Sterling’s going through a bad patch, and this has probably been two or three weeks, and we’re seeing Sterling miss a couple of chances he’s had in one-on-ones.<br /><br />There have been chances with balls that just need to be put over the line, I don’t know from six, seven yards out and he’s missing them. In any other season, these would have been tap-ins and we’d have thought nothing of it.<br /><br /><a href="gabriel-jesus.html">Gabriel Jesus</a> seems to hit form and then sort of go in and out of form. So I think he’ll be having a real good look at a centre-forward, certainly over the summer. But with <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>, at the start of the season he was absolutely on fire and then <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> dropped him. So is it not Pep’s own fault really for his drop in form, because you can’t score a goal from the bench?<br /><br />Yes, it’s interesting because when a player’s on form you want to play, but this is when the rotation comes in and resting players. And some games you could say yes, he warranted it to just leave him and keep him hot for the following game. But we’re now looking at it because it’s <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>. I was one of those that was saying he needs to be part of that conversation when you talk about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and these players. But his form, certainly in the last two or three weeks, has just dropped off that much that it’s nowhere near that conversation. But yes, Pep rested him in the early part of the season and now we’re probably looking back and thinking he should have just let him keep going</p>

I think his thing will be to get out there, play his first game and give himself a good solid number of minutes - whatever that is, whether he plays a full game, or 60 minutes, or minutes off the bench, for him to feel assured within himself that he’s back. Only a player knows when you come back, ‘yeah I feel like myself’. But I have no doubts that he will still have a great career because he is an exceptional player. I hope that his future career is at City because I love what he does, what type of player he is. But for him, his mental state will be proving to himself that he is back at his best</p>
