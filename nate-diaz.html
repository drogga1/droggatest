<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Nate Diaz walked into the post-fight press conference he told <a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a> he wouldn’t attend 40 minutes late and plopped down in front of a microphone]</b> The only reason I’m here right now is I want a rematch against you <b>[<a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a>]</b>. I think I’m maybe a better matchup for Anderson Silva as well<br /><br /><b>[Among them were that his training partners didn’t help him enough in preparation for St. Pierre, that his stomach hurt and that he never adjusted to three-hour time difference from his home]</b> I was so confused. I wish I had some kind of coach to tell me, ‘you need to go to sleep dude’. The guy had five rounds and woke me up. Now I’m ready to fight. That’s just how I feel.<br /><br />Everything was about head games. It was crazy. It was the first time anyone ever did head games with me. It was tough. It was very demanding, very stressful. <b>[Dana White said the UFC confiscated the hand wraps to analyze them after the fight, and there was no sign of anything illegal. Diaz complained, however, about one punch that he claimed didn’t feel right and opened a cut]</b> This guy has no punching power, no offense. <b>[Diaz said, turning to St. Pierre]</b> I wanted him to try to hurt me, to try to finish me. If you noticed, he didn’t try to put me in side control or try to put in two hooks. Maybe he couldn’t do it or maybe he just had a plan to shake me down, shake me down and hit me with small shots<br /><br /><b>[Nate Diaz wasn’t sure about anything after UFC 158]</b> I’ve never paid taxes in my life. so I’m probably going to jail</p>
