  <p><b>[Japan starlet Genki Haraguchi content in J-League but admits European dream]</b> Of course I want to play in Europe, for sure. In order to do that I want to improve here, get into the national team and then make the move overseas. It makes me very happy to see that all the hard work and effort I have put in on the training ground is bearing fruit, but I’m not finished yet and there is still plenty of room to grow. I’ve got better in a lot of areas, but if you look at the numbers you can see I have scored more goals and played more minutes than I have before. I think that’s proof of the improvement in my game<br /><br /><b>[Usami, who will head to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> later this month, also netted in the contest and Haraguchi admitted matching his compatriot’s achievements was a source of motivation for him]</b> Usami is a great player, and even though he’s a year younger than me he has been able to leave his mark on the J-League. For me he’s a real incentive. I don’t want to lose out to him, and because of that we spur each other on to work hard and succeed. Usami scored the first goal and that made me feel like I had to score one too</p>
