  <p><b>[Brighton chairman Tony Bloom described the decision to sack Hughton as one of the most difficult in his career]</b> Our run of three wins from 23 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> matches put our status at significant risk. It is with that in mind, and the performances during that period, that I now feel it’s the right time for a change. Undoubtedly, this has been one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make as chairman of Brighton, but ultimately one I have made due to how we struggled in the second half of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton have sacked manager Chris Hughton following a final day defeat to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> Chris has done an excellent job over the past four and a half years. First stabilising our club, reaching the play-offs in his first full season, securing our first ever promotion to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and retaining our status in two successive seasons. Undoubtedly, this has been one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make as chairman of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, but ultimately one I have made due to how we struggled in the second half of the season.<br /><br />Our run of three wins from 23 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> matches put our status at significant risk. It is with that in mind, and the performances during that period, that I now feel it’s the right time for a change. Chris will always be very fondly remembered by Albion staff and fans as one of our club’s finest and most-respected managers. I would like to wish Chris, Paul and Paul - who have all worked extremely hard throughout their time here - every success for the future, and thank them on behalf of everyone at the club. They will always be welcome at the Amex, and will be remembered here with great affection</p>

  <p><b>[Graham Potter replaces Chris Hughton as Brighton coach]</b> We are delighted to have secured the services of one of the brightest young English coaches. Graham Potter has an excellent record of developing teams with an attractive playing style, fierce determination and a strong collective spirit. We are excited about our third successive season in the Premier League and we now wish to build on the solid foundations laid by Chris Hughton. We believe that Graham is an excellent fit for our club and we are very much looking forward to working with him</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton owner Tony Bloom believes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> deserve to be <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> champions]</b> I don’t foresee a situation, if the season’s not played out, that teams will get relegated on a points-per-game basis. I just don’t think it’s fathomable that a team which is not allowed to play out the season, may lose out on 0.2 of a point based on this system. Also it does not take into account the strength of the teams you have not played. You may get a title winner, obviously <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> deserve it, you may use that criteria for European qualification but I do not see how anyone can vote for that, certainly the per cent needed, for teams to get relegated</p>
