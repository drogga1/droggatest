  <p><b>[Why Barca signed Sevilla star Clement Lenglet]</b> Monchi spoke to my parents when I was 17. My parents came to Seville and they thought the city was incredible. From that moment, I wanted to come, but my club didn’t want to let me go. So when they called to sign me last January, I fulfilled a dream, something I had been dreaming of since the age of 17.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona defender Clement Lenglet is hoping to open his account for the club in the Clasico against Real Madrid]</b> Today could not be. Hopefully Sunday.<br /><br />We played a good game all together and when we play like that, it is much harder for the opponent to hurt us. It has been a very good match both in defense and in attack. We prefer to play with Messi than without him, but in these three weeks we have to try to make his absence is felt as little as possible.<br /><br />We are very happy for today’s game, but Sunday’s game will be totally different from this one</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona defender Clement Lenglet admits that it is a privilege to share the field with Lionel]</b> a rival you can try and stop <b>[Messi]</b> but we always knew that it was very difficult. As a team-mate it is different because he can change the face of the game and he is still a very humble person, he has a lot of respect for everybody and that makes him even more legendary. We talk about a lot of things, he asks me about French football and we speak about how to play on the pitch. Chatting with him is a different experience, when the best player in the world talks you have to listen attentively. You also have to open your eyes and just watch what he does.<br /><br /><b>[I get along]</b> with many team-mates, they are all great people and I have a good relationship with everybody. I am close to Arthur Melo, because he is a new signing like me and we talk a lot. Also with the French guys and with Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic. In truth, there is not a single person with whom I do not speak. <b>[Umtiti]</b> is doing well, he has got back feeling in his knee and he is ramping up his training sessions every day to play as soon as possible. He is a player with great talent and we have to help him recover as quickly as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Clement Lenglet has moved to deny reports that Ousmane Dembele is restless at Barcelona]</b> If Dembele looked serious in the stands I think that is understandable. We were losing and if he started to laugh people would not understand that either. I don’t think there is any problem with him, he was ill, he couldn’t make training and the coach chose another player. These are things that happen at every club and we all have to pull in the same direction to reach our goals.<br /><br /><b>[The defender was overlooked again by Didier Deschamps for November’s clashes against Netherlands and Uruguay]</b> I have a lot to learn still. If I am not on the list it is because there are still things I have to improve but I am working at Barcelona with the best in the world and that helps me to grow. I am not impatient. If the call comes I will be very happy but in the meantime I will keep working as always to wait for my moment, I am focused on enjoying the day-to-day<br /><br />It is a different style to that of any other club. You have to think before receiving the ball, always position yourself well to go from one side to the other and think about the pitch all the time. It is hard for defenders because we defend far from our goal and we have to press constantly. That is difficult to adapt to but it is a great thing. When we manage it we will be able to play the way we want to, and that is the toughest thing in football</p>

  <p><b>[Ousmane Dembele has been defended by Clement Lenglet after turning up two hours late to training]</b> I don’t have much idea about what is happening with him, but what I do know is that he is doing very well on the pitch. I don’t know if <b>[a punishment]</b> is the right thing to do or not, you’d have to ask that question to those with the power because I don’t know if he has to be sanctioned. He’s doing a lot of things well on the pitch. He’s playing very well for the team and that’s what interests me most about him<br /><br /><b>[The Spanish champions face Tottenham]</b> This game is still an important one for us because it is a Champions League game and you don’t play many of them in a year. You have to enjoy these games because they are a chance for you to play against the best in the world. We aren’t happy about conceding goals, though, and that’s a very important issue for us because we want to win things. In recent games, we have suffered a little, but it is difficult to complete a full 90 minutes without having tough moments</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi is considered to have mastered football to perfection]</b> I remember when I first arrived, he said hello, gave me a little hug - I felt immediately at ease. He is a technical leader. On the field, he makes the difference so often, in almost every game. He’s a leader through his experience. He watches football, knows all types of football and has mastered it to perfection. There’s only one Messi and, when he gives advice, you listen.<br /><br />This month is pivotal. There is the Champions League and these two games against Real, when we can qualify for a cup final and then gain or lose points on them in the league. We have to manage them properly. It could be pivotal for the rest of the season<br /><br />I could never have imagined I’d come so far so quickly. I went to Seville, and for me that was a big jump. No disrespect to Nancy, but they were worlds apart. To then be at Barcelona a year and a half later, I could never have imagined it. We now live with the best players in the world and that makes you learn quickly. I’m more thoughtful now about when to release the ball, when to clear and when to keep it, when to be more patient. It’s about managing the game</p>

  <p><b>[Clement Lenglet is prepared to put his body and teeth on the line for the good of the Barcelona cause]</b> I lost a little bit of a tooth but it’s not serious. But I’m happy to lose bits of teeth again on a regular basis! Lenglet did struggle to get to grips with the challenge posed by Mohamed Salah early on in a heavyweight continental clash, with a yellow card picked up shortly before half-time<br /><br />I had a difficult first 20 minutes. During that period of the game, I needed to adapt to the distance I needed to stand off <b>[Salah]</b>. You can’t let the ball be played deep but <b>[you have to]</b> be quite close to step in as well. It was a little easier after that <b>[first 20 minutes]</b>, even if these games are always difficult. I found it a little easier to position myself and analyse how close I needed to be to keep his back to goal as often as possible and - when he did turn - be able to play for time and get help from my teammates</p>

It’s a totally different game to Atletico.

He’s a positive person who always has a smile on his face. When he arrives in the French team that fact doesn’t change. He loves to make jokes, you know him. He hasn’t changed, whether it’s in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or in the France squad.<br /><br />He’s someone who has just arrived and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is a different club from the other clubs, which plays a different game - a different game from Atletico. He has scored three goals, I think he’s the club’s second-best scorer, even though it’s only the beginning of the season. It’s still something quite positive. He works a lot for the team. He used to play as second striker at Atletico and now he plays on one side. He helps us a lot with his talent and his defensive efforts in every game. He’s sacrificing himself for the team.

He’s in a dressing room with a lot of international players and very good players in his position. He took advantage of some absences to have playing time. He was very good when he played. He has some minor problems given his age to follow the rhythm of matches and training, but he is very well cared for. He is very professional. It’s a very pleasant surprise. I think he’s a good player for the future but also for the present because he has many qualities</p>

Some players are already there and have a history together. Like in the French national team, there is a very specific way of playing - how we’re positioned is different than what Antoine knew at Atletico, where he was starting from far back. You need time to adapt to feel better on the pitch and play as well as possible.<br /><br />At <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, we’re trying to recover the ball as high as possible on the pitch with a lot of efforts on 20 to 30 metre runs. With Atletico, it was a bit different, they were falling back, and it was 50 to 60 metre runs. So you have to learn that, you need time. Physically it’s different, and mentally as well, you need to prepare. Antoine is working on that every day during training, and it’s going to be better and better during games, I’m sure of it.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> performs differently for his country]</b> Different is a big word, but when he’s with the national team, he’s having a lot of fun. He’s been there for a long time, he played a few big tournaments with the team, and he won a really beautiful one. Of course, he knows this place very well, he’s very happy to be here, he has a strong history with the team. But he’s also very happy to be at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, even if you’re saying otherwise. He’s smiling every day and likes to be happy on and off the pitch</p>
