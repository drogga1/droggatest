  <p><b>[Guinea captain Ibrahima Traore tells about the team’s rocky road to the CAF Africa Cup of Nations]</b> We went to many countries where the people did not want us. The spectators in the stadiums were chanting ‘Ebola, Ebola.’ But that also made us stronger and more determined. Now that we are here, so nobody is saying those things anymore</p>

  <p><b>[Ozil didn’t want to commit to Erdogan’s policies]</b> I do not think that Ozil deliberately wanted to commit to Erdogan’s policies. Above all, the timing was unfortunate considering what is happening politically in Germany. For me, football is football and politics is politics. If both are mixed, something like this can happen. It’s clear that this story has massively harmed the national team. Germany has played politics at the World Cup, not football, and that can never go well. If there is a problem between two parties, the one who doesn’t talk always loses. Then if you talk about it, it’s too late.<br /><br /><b>[I only experience racism]</b> once at a game, that was relatively early. Otherwise it hasn’t happened again, and it doesn’t happen to me in every day life. Of course, there is clearly a problem with racism - and not just in Germany. It’s in every country<br /><br />“I have no Playstation and no Nintendo. Honestly, I’m worried that they’d make me stupid! I have a cell phone and books. When I’m on the bus, the other guys play Fortnite or Mario Kart against each other and I read. Yann Sommer always has a book with him, too<br /><br />I always wanted to be a writer more than I wanted to be a footballer. I never went to a football academy and that was lucky, because I was able to do other things, not just football. That would have been too one-dimensional for me and I certainly would not have made it to being a professional</p>
