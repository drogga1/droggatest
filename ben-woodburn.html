  <p><b>[On himself]</b> It wasn’t through my school like with Trent. I was at Crewe and Everton before, and a scout told to come for one of the same kind of days. I really enjoyed it and that was it then - I wanted the same experience with Liverpool all the time.<br /><br />As far back as I can remember now, I just wanted to be with the ball every day. My dad used to coach a Sunday League team and we shared the same dream. My brother, him and myself would kick about a lot - on the path, in the field daily. He has helped and pushed me a lot<br /><br /><b>[Ben Woodburn was introduced on 67 minutes and by the 81st, he’d broken Michael Owen’s record to become the club’s youngest goalscorer]</b> I couldn’t contain myself; I went mad really. Everything felt like it was in slow motion before the ball came to me from Gini, then it felt like I was jumping out of my body when I hit it. As soon as I saw Gini lay it off, I knew I would score.</p>

  <p><b>[Ben Woodburn puffs his cheeks out and smiles]</b> The manager <b>[Jurgen Klopp]</b> is still thinking about what’s best for me. I’ll agree with whatever he thinks. I’ll trust his decision and do what he wants me to do. I think when you’re young playing lots of different positions is going to help. Obviously there will be a stage where I need to think about which position I do want to play. I think that will come in the next few years. It hasn’t yet! I’ve grown up a bit in the past few seasons, but I’ve been doing a lot of stuff in the gym with the lads and it’s definitely filled me out and I feel a lot bigger and like I have more of a presence as a player<br /><br />I think it will improve me as a player. I think training with all the players that we have made me a better player. Even though I didn’t get too much game time, I think the experiences I got with the Champions League was definitely a good thing for me<br /><br />The fans last year were unbelievable and they helped the team a lot to get to the final. That day in Rome was crazy - I’ve never experienced anything like it! It was good to see Trent play in the game and he did well. But afterwards it was just … crazy!<br /><br /><b>[Lijnders has been a big influence on Woodburn]</b> Definitely. He was the link to the first team when I was at the academy. That season we had with him as coach at U16 level, he’s stayed the same and he’s helped me a lot. He’s so enthusiastic and his football brain is crazy. He knows so much about football that I think none of the players now even know. You can see on the pitch how much he wants to be there and I think it pays off and shows with the squad on the pitch<br /><br />Every game is a chance to impress the manager. And especially against top teams like Dortmund, United and City. It will be a good test</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool will consider recalling Ben Woodburn from his loan spell at Sheffield United in January]</b> It taught me a lot of valuable lessons. It gave me experiences that I would never have got by playing Academy football. I learned that in senior football it’s about managing the game. People are playing for contracts and playing for careers, so when you’re 1-0 up or 2-0 up, you have to see the game out</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> youngster Ben Woodburn reveals <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Gnabry</a> inspiration: Watching him develop is a big help]</b> I feel like I have had so much experience and yet I am still only young and learning. Watching someone like <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Serge Gnabry</a> develop is a big help. I saw his four goals for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in the Champions League. When he was 20, he couldn’t get a game on loan at West Brom. He has shown you can push through if you keep working hard and hopefully I can do something like he’s done<br /><br /><b>[Since then, he has spent four months on loan at then-Championship outfit <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, where he failed to break into the starting XI after a succession of substitute appearances, but he harbours hope of breaking into <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s plans]</b> I think my eyes are always going to be set on playing at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. That is my main goal, that is who I grew up supporting and have been for years. <a href="harry-wilson.html">Harry Wilson</a> did well at Derby last season and is on loan at <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> now, he’s a couple of years older than me. A lot of managers look at who is trustworthy, who has games under their belt and that’s what I am aiming for with Oxford this season. If I am back in the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> squad, I have to show everyone I am ready</p>
