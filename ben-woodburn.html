  <p><b>[Liverpool youngster Ben Woodburn reveals <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Gnabry</a> inspiration: Watching him develop is a big help]</b> I feel like I have had so much experience and yet I am still only young and learning. Watching someone like <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Serge Gnabry</a> develop is a big help. I saw his four goals for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in the Champions League. When he was 20, he couldn’t get a game on loan at West Brom. He has shown you can push through if you keep working hard and hopefully I can do something like he’s done<br /><br /><b>[Since then, he has spent four months on loan at then-Championship outfit <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, where he failed to break into the starting XI after a succession of substitute appearances, but he harbours hope of breaking into <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s plans]</b> I think my eyes are always going to be set on playing at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. That is my main goal, that is who I grew up supporting and have been for years. <a href="harry-wilson.html">Harry Wilson</a> did well at Derby last season and is on loan at Bournemouth now, he’s a couple of years older than me. A lot of managers look at who is trustworthy, who has games under their belt and that’s what I am aiming for with Oxford this season. If I am back in the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> squad, I have to show everyone I am ready</p>
