  <p><b>[<a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a> commissioner Don Garber ahead of the league’s Cup final]</b> We believe we have one of the most competitive leagues in the world. I embrace the fact that two of our smallest markets are in the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup because it validates this idea that in our world every fan should believe that their team has the chance to win the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup. It is not a league of haves and have-nots. It’s a league that if you’re smart, you get rewarded. And if you’re not smart, you get penalised. That’s something that I think is empowering to fans and, frankly, should be something that has everybody around the league feeling good about</p>

The national anthem provides our clubs and fans an important and time-honored opportunity to salute our country and stand up for its principles - whether in the United States or in Canada.<br /><br />At the same time, freedom of speech - and the right to peaceful protest - are the hallmarks of both countries. Though we encourage our players to stand during the national anthem, we respect and support their right to express their personal beliefs.</p>

I’m very close friends with Enrique <b>[Bonilla]</b> and Yon de Luisa, and they were bold and they made a very aggressive move to get Tata who, by the way, before he came to MLS might not have been on the radar screen for the Mexican national team. So what does that say about success in Major League Soccer, something that we’ve been working hard to try and raise the profile of our league and what it can do to develop players and technical staff? U.S. Soccer is in the midst of finalizing their decision on a U.S. national team coach. I’m sure he’ll be great. It’s possible he could be coming from Major League Soccer. So I think both federations end up with two great coaches, and that’s what it’s all about.</p>

He has brought a level of respect and credibility to our league through what he has done with Atlanta United that shows that we can be a league of choice. But coaches come and go like players come and go. I love Tata, I wish him well. I was disappointed, in many ways heartbroken when they weren’t able to re-sign him. It wasn’t about anything other than he is ready for a new challenge</p>

  <p><b>[Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber says the league needs to embrace its status as a selling league]</b> We need to become more of a selling league. As a person who has been selling this league for nearly 20 years, I’ve always believed that you have to have the players that resonate in the market to be the aspirations for young kids peaking through the fence when they see them train. We all need to get used to the fact that, in the world of global soccer, players get sold. I viewed a whole list of them over the past couple of days and (Romelu) Lukaku is 25 and he’s already had four or five teams that he’s played for. Those clubs, starting at Anderlecht, in those countries they don’t have to worry about building a league because their league is already built.<br /><br /><b>[On youth clubs are not entitled to training compensation]</b> I don’t know that it’s entirely about young players chasing their dreams as it is about international clubs chasing our young players. That’s something that we have to wrap our collective minds around and figure out how we manage that in a way that justifies our owners investing north of 100 million outside of our first team rosters. We are not, as a country, participants in solidarity and training compensation, and I think that probably has to change. We have to find a way that that’s going to happen. How do we at least get compensated? I don’t know how we can justify making those kind of investments that we’ve been making. Our view on this whole area is very, very different than it was two,three four or five years ago. The product that we’re developing has become some of the more important assets, and we need to start finding ways of protecting or finding some ways to get compensated if we can’t protect them or can’t sign them<br /><br />Many of you know that I had a pretty public confrontation with Jurgen Klinsmann regarding his views and what needed to happen with our clubs being more competitive. Many years later, as I look at the competitiveness of our teams, we need to have the kinds of clubs that exist all over the world where you have to earn your way onto that field as a young player and you have to earn the money that is now available</p>

  <p><b>[Garber expecting more MLS-Liga MX interleague competition]</b> We and Liga MX believe that there’s an opportunity to expand beyond that. In what ways can we have more compelling content or competition for our teams and doing it in a way where our mutual fan bases, particularly as it relates to trying to get the game more popular leading to ‘26? We were down in Mexico meeting with Liga MX when we were there for World Leagues Forum. We’ll continue to have those conversations.<br /><br />We’re certainly going to do that in cooperation with Concacaf, but I’d like to think that we can go beyond where we are now which was our first iteration of interleague play which was a championship. The Camepon de Camepones champion playing against our champion in the Campeones Cup. I think you’ll see some changes to that format next year, but we’re big believers in it. You should know that on Univision that game had 1.3 million viewers, and that was a game that took place in Canada, so there’s a real opportunity to build on rivalry that exists between our national team between our club teams<br /><br />We’re trying hard to put more meat on the bone, and I think you’ll start seeing over the next year more and more announcements coming out of that cooperation group<br /><br />We’ve been thinking about playing in competition with the Mexican league for a really, really long time. They are our neighbors. We are members, really in many ways drivers of Concacaf. Our national team games are some of the biggest sporting events on the sporting calendar regardless of what sport it is, so we’ve been trying to make this bigger and bigger</p>

  <p><b>[Garber expects MLS to expand past 28 teams]</b> We will grant the 28th team and make that decision sometime in the next 12 months. There’s no rush. Then we’re going to have to decide if we want to go forward beyond 28 teams. That’s a discussion that is taking place. We’ll begin to introduce the subject at our board meeting in the middle of next week. I don’t expect or anticipate there will be an announcement coming out of that, but there’s no doubt in my mind that we can support having more than 28 teams in Major League Soccer, no doubt in my mind.<br /><br />This is a big country. I could remember when we first started looking at the expansion. I came in at 12, went down to 10. We went up to 14 in 2005. I don’t know that at that time we ever thought we’d be at the size we are now. There has been so much that’s gone on over the last decade or more in this sport, that has been empowering a lot of the interest in cities across the U.S. and Canada<br /><br />When I came into the league, this was a league that was founded almost as counter-seasonal programming for NFL teams with their clubs playing in an NFL football stadium. We realized pretty quickly that wasn’t a good model, that we needed to build soccer stadiums and have them centrally located, have them be right sized. I still believe that this is about building soccer-specific stadiums in the right locations. But every now and again you have something that happens that shocks you. What’s been happening in Seattle was the first example of that. That team is still averaging over 40,000 fans a game. What’s happening here in Atlanta continues to astound me. So I think we’re probably more open to thinking about it now that we’ve seen two examples of success with large stadiums</p>

I don’t know what this league will look like in terms of size when I’m no longer commissioner in 10 or five or 20 years from now, but right now we’re focused on making sure that we properly onboard these expansion teams, get them successful in managing all of that leading up to the World Cup in 2026<br /><br /><b>[Garber does say changes need to be made to make the stadium <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> ready]</b> All of those international games were not a secret.

That has been my view from the beginning. It shouldn’t be about one or two leagues trying to do something just because one or two clubs are pushing for it, when it is probably not even in the interests of that league</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="mls.html">MLS</a> commissioner Don Garber says that the league is considering alternative formats]</b> We have a bunch of cool ideas. Could we go to a handful of locations and perhaps play a tournament? Could that lead into a new way of selecting the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> champion if we’re unable to get into local markets? And then if we’re into local markets, what will those markets be and how will they roll out across the U.S. and Canada? Would it be a regular-season continuation, or maybe it could even be a part of this tournament concept? All of it requires testing and all of it requires us to be able to get our players back to training as soon as possible. The moratorium was through the end of the month, that likely will be extended pretty soon because the prohibition on people in Canada being in groups is going to continue to stay in place for some time<br /><br />Players play to win trophies. Win trophies for themselves, for their team, for their community. They want to be written in the history book and it is such a driver of our entire industry. We are doing everything that we can to ensure that we can crown a champion in 2020.<br /><br />That could be a tournament that we play in select markets, if we’re able to manage testing and we’re able to manage the health and safety of players and stadium personnel and obviously team personnel. It could be a form of an abridged <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> season, remember, we’re only through two games so we have some time between now and the end of the year to play games.<br /><br />We’re looking at studio games, games without fans that would be produced in a way that might be really cool and fun and entertaining. It might be innovative in ways that, frankly, we would want to see going forward as we start breaking some of the formal traditions of how games have been produced.<br /><br />Ultimately, sports is about fans and we want to get our fans back into cheering for their favorite players and their favorite clubs. That decision will be made by the authorities in Canada and the authorities in the United States, either at the provincial level or at the state level and we still don’t know when that time will be</p>

  <p><b>[Don Garber admits that <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> was ‘pessimistic’ about return several weeks ago]</b> We’re more optimistic about what a return to play plan could look like. I think a month ago we were very pessimistic. I think our country has done a pretty good job of flattening the curve, which is what the objective was. We need to be mindful of and focused on continuing to follow local guidelines because flattening the curve requires us all to be very focused and committed to all the guidelines local health authorities set out. So I would say we’re cautiously optimistic<br /><br />I think every player and every club that has been able to get back to individual training has been very pleased. There was a lot of coverage as we were one of the first leagues to be able to do that. That’s not anything that matters much in the big swing of things, but you have to remember we only played two games of our season. We have a whole year ahead of us to try to get games in, get players back into shape, figure out what our plan will be for broader return to training and then ultimately what will the rest of 2020 look like? It is too premature to talk about that, but obviously there is a lot of planning going into what those scenarios would possibly be throughout the league</p>

  <p><b>[American soccer has long lived in the shadow of basketball, baseball, American football and ice hockey but it will be the only show in town on July 8. It’s not often that <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a> commands attention in the American sports landscape. <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> commissioner Don Garber would have liked to have come back even sooner]</b> It’s very important. It’s why we were in such close and at times challenging discussions with the players related to an agreement for the work rules this year, and we lost some time. We had hoped to be out way earlier than we were able to finalize with a July 8 start. We had, frankly, hoped to be able to start at the latter part of June, and we are just not able to do that. So, getting out early is important, and it’s not necessarily getting out first, because you’ve got to get it right. Getting out there and ensuring that we have the certainty to play games is crucial to the future success of the league. With no certainty as to when we are going to get back into our home markets, we knew that should we be able to manage the medical protocols, reach agreement with Disney, reach agreement with our players, that we would be able to get out and get games started in July. Without the concept of a tournament, we’d still be sitting here waiting like other leagues are to determine whether or not we’d be receiving the approvals to be able to have enough stadia open to be able to have a schedule of games, regular-season games, in home markets<br /><br /><b>[They chose the latter option, coming up with a tournament that will not only give <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> a chance to win the public relations battle but also give the league a chance to recoup some of the money lost through a lack of ticket sales]</b> The first focus is to retain some of the revenue that we have planned for in our agreements with sponsors and broadcasters. Being able to have a tournament like this, that has will have as many as three games a day, will allow us to fulfil some of our obligations to our media partners and sponsors, both nationally and locally, and that’s important<br /><br /><b>[for one brief moment, <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> will be the center of attention in a world where the league is so used to being left on the outside]</b> It starts by getting back. We’ll be playing games before many other leagues in this country, albeit not by as much as we had previously hoped. More importantly, though, we wanted to continue the momentum that we have and continue our relationship with our fans, who translate into viewers. So, getting back, getting back in a unique format, getting our fans engaged and getting some momentum back into the league are things that I’m sure will help MLS</p>
