  <p><b>[Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber ahead of the league’s Cup final]</b> We believe we have one of the most competitive leagues in the world. I embrace the fact that two of our smallest markets are in the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup because it validates this idea that in our world every fan should believe that their team has the chance to win the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup. It is not a league of haves and have-nots. It’s a league that if you’re smart, you get rewarded. And if you’re not smart, you get penalised. That’s something that I think is empowering to fans and, frankly, should be something that has everybody around the league feeling good about</p>

Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Vela are among the big names to be selected to the Major League Soccer All-Star XI ahead of their clash with Atletico Madrid. The MLS squad will face off against the Spanish giants on July 31 in Orlando, with a team selected by a combination of fan vote, Orlando City head coach James O’Connor and league commissioner Don Garber.</p>

Then we’re getting into a situation which is unmanageable and really not why the vast, vast majority of fans go to games</p>

  <p><b>[Garber wouldn’t confirm the exact dollar figure, but he did reveal that the reported $300-325 million figure was accurate for Charlotte’s spot in MLS]</b> I think it just speaks to value. Our teams are becoming more valuable. Part of that is the sport is growing and the revenues are increasing. Part of it is this idea that it has a limited supply in professional sports teams, generally. There’s a limited supply of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> teams, and David really wanted the club. All of that goes into negotiating<br /><br />We have expanded very rapidly over the last number of years. We have five teams, now six, coming in between now and 2022. That’s a lot of onboarding and a lot of capacity we need to manage, not the least of seven new soccer stadiums that are coming online. ‘For life’ is a long time. I don’t know what this league will look like in terms of size when I’m no longer commissioner in 10 or five or 20 years from now, but right now we’re focused on making sure that we properly onboard these expansion teams, get them successful in managing all of that leading up to the World Cup in 2026<br /><br /><b>[Garber does say changes need to be made to make the stadium <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> ready]</b> All of those international games were not a secret.

  <p><b>[MLS commissioner Don Garber says that the league is considering alternative formats]</b> We have a bunch of cool ideas. Could we go to a handful of locations and perhaps play a tournament? Could that lead into a new way of selecting the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> champion if we’re unable to get into local markets? And then if we’re into local markets, what will those markets be and how will they roll out across the U.S. and Canada? Would it be a regular-season continuation, or maybe it could even be a part of this tournament concept? All of it requires testing and all of it requires us to be able to get our players back to training as soon as possible. The moratorium was through the end of the month, that likely will be extended pretty soon because the prohibition on people in Canada being in groups is going to continue to stay in place for some time<br /><br />Players play to win trophies. Win trophies for themselves, for their team, for their community. They want to be written in the history book and it is such a driver of our entire industry. We are doing everything that we can to ensure that we can crown a champion in 2020. <br /><br />That could be a tournament that we play in select markets, if we’re able to manage testing and we’re able to manage the health and safety of players and stadium personnel and obviously team personnel. It could be a form of an abridged <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> season, remember, we’re only through two games so we have some time between now and the end of the year to play games.<br /><br />We’re looking at studio games, games without fans that would be produced in a way that might be really cool and fun and entertaining. It might be innovative in ways that, frankly, we would want to see going forward as we start breaking some of the formal traditions of how games have been produced.<br /><br />Ultimately, sports is about fans and we want to get our fans back into cheering for their favorite players and their favorite clubs. That decision will be made by the authorities in Canada and the authorities in the United States, either at the provincial level or at the state level and we still don’t know when that time will be</p>

  <p><b>[Don Garber admits that <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> was ‘pessimistic’ about return several weeks ago]</b> We’re more optimistic about what a return to play plan could look like. I think a month ago we were very pessimistic. I think our country has done a pretty good job of flattening the curve, which is what the objective was. We need to be mindful of and focused on continuing to follow local guidelines because flattening the curve requires us all to be very focused and committed to all the guidelines local health authorities set out. So I would say we’re cautiously optimistic<br /><br />I think every player and every club that has been able to get back to individual training has been very pleased. There was a lot of coverage as we were one of the first leagues to be able to do that. That’s not anything that matters much in the big swing of things, but you have to remember we only played two games of our season. We have a whole year ahead of us to try to get games in, get players back into shape, figure out what our plan will be for broader return to training and then ultimately what will the rest of 2020 look like? It is too premature to talk about that, but obviously there is a lot of planning going into what those scenarios would possibly be throughout the league</p>

We, as a league, have, I think, been leaning into addressing issues of discrimination and equality and standing for our core values of diversity for as long as I’ve been commissioner. That doesn’t mean that we’ve gotten everything right<br /><br /><b>[While there has been plenty of growth when it comes to diversity among assistants and executives, there’s still lots of work to be done]</b> It’s easy for people to post on social media. It’s easy to show support by pledging solidarity with the things that you say. It is much harder to marshal the power of a platform to actually effect change. And that’s what we need to start digging deep and understanding. We’ve got 800-plus players and we’ve got 26, soon to be 30 teams, in the United States and Canada, all that have lots of fans and impact. And we’ve got to figure out how to marshal all of that</p>

It’s why we were in such close and at times challenging discussions with the players related to an agreement for the work rules this year, and we lost some time. We had hoped to be out way earlier than we were able to finalize with a July 8 start. We had, frankly, hoped to be able to start at the latter part of June, and we are just not able to do that. So, getting out early is important, and it’s not necessarily getting out first, because you’ve got to get it right. Getting out there and ensuring that we have the certainty to play games is crucial to the future success of the league. With no certainty as to when we are going to get back into our home markets, we knew that should we be able to manage the medical protocols, reach agreement with Disney, reach agreement with our players, that we would be able to get out and get games started in July. Without the concept of a tournament, we’d still be sitting here waiting like other leagues are to determine whether or not we’d be receiving the approvals to be able to have enough stadia open to be able to have a schedule of games, regular-season games, in home markets<br /><br /><b>[They chose the latter option, coming up with a tournament that will not only give <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> a chance to win the public relations battle but also give the league a chance to recoup some of the money lost through a lack of ticket sales]</b> The first focus is to retain some of the revenue that we have planned for in our agreements with sponsors and broadcasters. Being able to have a tournament like this, that has will have as many as three games a day, will allow us to fulfil some of our obligations to our media partners and sponsors, both nationally and locally, and that’s important<br /><br /><b>[for one brief moment, <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> will be the center of attention in a world where the league is so used to being left on the outside]</b> It starts by getting back. We’ll be playing games before many other leagues in this country, albeit not by as much as we had previously hoped. More importantly, though, we wanted to continue the momentum that we have and continue our relationship with our fans, who translate into viewers. So, getting back, getting back in a unique format, getting our fans engaged and getting some momentum back into the league are things that I’m sure will help MLS</p>
