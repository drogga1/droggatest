He’s better than them at the moment. Mo is also the African Player of the Year, which - considering the standard of their players throughout Europe - is a great honour. There’s already been talk of Real ­Madrid looking at him - and who can blame them? In today’s inflated market, it wouldn’t surprise me if Liverpool one day received a £200m bid for him. Hopefully, he is happy where he is - after all, he only arrived last summer. There’s a time and a place to sell a player if the right money comes in, but, for Liverpool, it’s certainly not now</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah has been warned by Ian Rush than collective trophies at Liverpool mean more than records]</b> Even when I broke Roger Hunt’s record, he told me that records are there to be broken. Of course you want to hold on to your records, but being connected with Liverpool Football Club now, you don’t mind them being broken because that means they’re doing well. Maybe a difference is that when I scored 47 goals, we won three trophies. That’s what we’ve got to start doing now. It’s great having individual trophies, but in my season we won three trophies. I’m more pleased that we won three trophies than I did scoring 47 goals.<br /><br />You know next season people will be looking out for you. People will be out there saying: ‘If you stop Salah from playing, then you stop Liverpool from playing and winning’. You’re always looking to improve each season because the opposition will be doing exactly the same. If you can’t add one or two things to your makeup, then you’re not going to do that</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah sits behind only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in world football’s pecking order]</b> You can look at Fernando Torres and Luis Suarez and he is up there with any Liverpool forward to have come in <b>[during the Premier League era]</b>. He’s been absolutely amazing but the thing with Salah is that he is so down-to-earth as well. The game against Watford was the best I have ever seen him play, he was untouchable - not just because of his four goals but also because he wasn’t selfish and was trying to make goals for his team-mates. There are only two players I have seen that can play at that level, and that’s Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo<br /><br /><b>[On Roberto Firmino]</b> Everyone knows how amazing Mohamed Salah is but if you’re looking at one player Liverpool rely on it’s Bobby Firmino. With his closing down he reminds me a little bit of myself. Not only does he work hard for the team, he’s also very skilful - he does everything. He may not be regularly getting 30 goals a season but he makes the opposition make mistakes. He is a rare breed of a Brazilian and I think his talents suit the Premier League down to. He is tireless and every manager would love a player like that in his team. We are very, very lucky that we have him in our side</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend Ian Rush says the Brazil players are in for a treat when they run out at Anfield next month on the Brasil Global Tour]</b> The way Liverpool have been playing this season, it’s almost been like watching Brazil, but it will be very exciting to have the Brazilians at Anfield and for Liverpool supporters to see this great footballing country try to entertain the fans. Playing at Anfield is special and Firmino will be telling his teammates that it’s a special atmosphere any time you walk out there. Seeing Anfield empty gives you goose bumps and when it’s a full house with everyone singing, it’s incredible.</p>

  <p><b>[Premier League title success for Liverpool in 2018-19 would make a star-studded squad legends and Jurgen Klopp like a god]</b> You’ve seen so many great ­Liverpool players who haven’t won the league. Players like Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler, Steven Gerrard, Jamie ­Carragher have missed out. The current squad has to realise that, if they do win the league, they will become legends. And the manager will be like a god. It’s been such a long time since the last title. I was part of that side under Kenny, which won the championship back in 1990. If someone had said it would be another 30 years or so before Liverpool won it again, you wouldn’t have believed them. You would have thought they were joking. That title in 1990 was the club’s 18th. At the time, Manchester United had won it seven times, but since then they have ­overtaken us and have 20, which, for any Liverpool fan, is hard to take. But that is the stark reality of it.<br /><br />Everyone loves Jurgen Klopp. He has been a breath of fresh air. He is charismatic, but, of course, he has to win things. Everybody is behind him, but now is the time where he has to deliver. For a few weeks, we had the most ­expensive goalkeeper in the world. We also brought in a central defender <b>[Van Dijk]</b> for a world-record fee and, when you do that, you have to look at ­winning major trophies. And they don’t come much bigger than the Premier League title, especially when you analyse Liverpool’s proud history. Reaching the Champions League final last season was unexpected, but it has served to set the ­standards for the current team. The challenge is to meet those standards - or even better them. Ask most Liverpool fans now what they most want to win and I ­believe it would be the Premier League, ahead of the Champions League. Liverpool have a good record in the Champions League but the older generation especially would sacrifice that to finish top of the League next May.</p>

  <p><b>[Who would Liverpool get if Klopp leaves?]</b> He said three years <b>[to win a trophy]</b> and he’s in his third year now. But if he leaves who are you going to get? Everyone loves him, the supporters love him, and there’s no better manager in my book. We need to see progression, and last year we were looking at the top four. This year we’re looking at the top two, so we are progressing with him.<br /><br />We did enough at Napoli but they scored in the last minute. Maybe we underestimated Red Star a little bit. Paris Saint-Germain need to beat Liverpool but it could come down to the Napoli game, that’s like a final now and the atmosphere will be electric at Anfield. I’d like to see us progress in the Champions League and still put Man City under pressure in the Premier League. Last season it was too easy for them. This time if they lose a game we need to be there to overtake them</p>

  <p><b>[Asked about Jamie Carragher’s assessment that Virgil van Dijk could be remembered like Alan Hansen]</b> Well, he’s still got a long way to go, for me. If Alan Hansen would be playing football today, he’d be an absolute world-beater. Even in our day, he never tackled anyone, but on the ball he was absolutely unbelievable. He was like a midfielder. I think Van Dijk and Joe Gomez could be absolutely incredible. But whoever plays with Van Dijk plays well - Lovren, Matip - Van Dijk organises the defence and helps them all round. That’s how good he has been</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> exit backed by former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> &amp; Wales star Rush says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> special but Ramsey can be too]</b> I think <b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> is a fantastic move for him. When I went there it was an industrial city but it’s come on a million times better since I was there. I think <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are an amazing club. They’ve still got connections with the <a href="andrea-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> family, <a href="andrea-agnelli.html">Andrea Agnelli</a> is the president there and Gianni <a href="andrea-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> was the owner when I was there. So they are very passionate about it. I think he’d do really well, you’ve got <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> there to play with and all that, so that’s something special. But I think Aaron will be something special for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and I’m sure he’ll enjoy it<br /><br />Times have changed. When I was there I had to do everything myself. Now it’s moved on that much that everything is done for them and the most important thing for him is to concentrate on his football, his attacking play and all that. He’ll learn the language when he’s ready and that’s what it’s all about. He’s got six months to learn it, I had 12 months as well<br /><br />The most important thing in Italy is you have to be confident in what you do. If I went to Italy now, I would tell them: ‘I’m Ian Rush, I’m the best footballer in the world.’ If I had done that for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, the other teams would say: ‘OK, let’s see how good you are.’ It’s completely different to the English way, the English helped each other. First impressions <b>[are]</b> a big thing in Italy and I would say to Aaron: ‘Go there, be confident and tell them how good you are’ and all that, give them one sentence in Italian and his first impression that will be job done for him</p>

  <p><b>[Talk of Mohamed Salah being involved in a potential swap deal with Paulo Dybala will come to nothing]</b> I think Salah will stay at Liverpool. The fans love him and he is fine here. He signed a new contract, I do not think the exchange will be made<br /><br />Aaron Ramsey’s a fantastic player, a very reserved person, a man of the family. Juventus care a lot about how their players act off the pitch and he’s a genuine person, the right man for the Bianconeri. Why Juve? I spoke to him a couple weeks ago, he’s always been convinced of this choice because he wants to win trophies and Juve has always been the first choice for him. He believes that they have more chances to win than other teams<br /><br />Cristiano Ronaldo’s a fantastic football player, maybe the best in the world. He won in England, Spain and now wants to do it in Italy. He is blatantly fit for his age, he is good for all Italian football. He could have chosen China but he came to Italy, it was a big step for him. When Ramsey is there, I cannot wait to come to Turin to see them play together</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend Ian Rush believes that the Reds’ trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United will be a huge match]</b> I think it will take on more importance for Man United because it’s normally the other way around. I’m sure Man United’s supporters are saying ‘we want to beat Liverpool and stop them winning the league’. Liverpool supporters have been saying that for a long time and now it’s the other way around. That brings out the best in Manchester United. It’s going to be one hell of a game. Manchester United play good football now and Liverpool are playing good football. It’s going to be one hell of a game<br /><br />There’s a lot of games to go. There’s 12 games to go, and although people saying Manchester City are favourites, there’s still 12 games to go. Man City are favourites with the bookies, but we’ve got a game in hand. I think there will be lots of ups and downs both from Liverpool and Manchester City. If we can get to the final month of the season and still have a chance, Manchester City could still be in all competitions. That’s one thing you have to use to your advantage. I don’t think they can afford to rest players. You can’t think that you’re comfortable and this is a game we can afford to rest players for. The Premier League is the best league in the world because the bottom teams can beat the top. So if we get to the final month, Manchester City will think ‘we can’t rest players here’ and Liverpool can use that to their advantage<br /><br />The longer it gets, the more pressure mounts. I played the last time we won the league. It is about experience and Manchester City do have that experience. Just take it one game at a time. Klopp’s got experience in Germany so he’ll know to take it one game at a time. I think it’s right for the supporters to get excited. If they don’t get excited now they’ll never get excited. But the players have to keep their feet firmly on the ground. That will come with the coaching and management team helping them to do it</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah is considered to have lost confidence in front of goal on the back of a seven-game barren run]</b> The only thing with Mo is he is probably having one or two extra touches where last year he was instinctively just hitting it. Now he is in a stage where he is trying to get the ball perfect on his left foot. It doesn’t matter what training you do, it is match day that counts. A fluke goal normally gets you up and running and brings the confidence back.<br /><br />You have to switch off. Bob Paisley always said to me if you read the papers when you play well, then read them when you play badly or don’t read them at all. So I didn’t bother. You just have to focus on yourself, although with social media nowadays it is a million times worse</p>

  <p><b>[Club legend Ian Rush of the opinion that Jurgen Klopp has found the right blend in his squad]</b> The title race will go down to the wire, there is no doubt about that. There are just a few games to go and as long as they keep winning they are one step closer, but I think they are starting to believe now that it can be done. People are saying all the fans are getting excited, but why not? Why shouldn’t they be excited? If they don’t get excited now, they’ll never get excited! The most important thing is that the players - with the help of the coaching staff and the manager - keep their feet on the ground. I think the team is a bit more resistant now and you can see that in the way they’ve come back from a goal down to win a game quite a few times this season. They’ve got a winning formula and there is no need to change anything<br /><br />When I played, I would 100 per cent say the main reason we were so successful was because of our team spirit. In the dressing room, we had the banter and the laughing and the joking, but when we went onto the pitch we were serious, and the success we had was down to team spirit. Individuals can win you a game but only a team can win the league and I can see a bit of that in Jurgen Klopp and his team now</p>

  <p><b>[Ian Rush feels that Liverpool’s season will still be an amazing success]</b> I’m enjoying watching Liverpool play and enjoying the winning brand of football they are playing at the moment. Even if Liverpool win nothing the season would have been an amazing success. Liverpool over-achieved by getting to the Champions League final last year but we set ourselves standards there by getting to that final and we have met those standards, and even beaten them this year. Even if we don’t win anything I think we have still improved and I am really happy with the way it has gone this season. Hopefully it will still be Liverpool’s league and also Liverpool’s Champions League as well.<br /><br />It’s amazing to think Liverpool could get beaten once this season and still not win the league. To get this far and have gotten so many points and not be guaranteed to win the league is amazing, but it’s still all to play for. It just goes to show good Man City are that we could get 97 points and still not win the league. If you look at their squad you would have to say it is better than Liverpool’s even if Liverpool have shown they can beat Man City 11 vs 11, no problem. They’ve got two, maybe even three, different teams and that shows how strong Man City are</p>
