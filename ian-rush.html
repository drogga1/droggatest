  <p><b>[He remembers the Old Lady as ‘the right club at the wrong time’]</b> I couldn’t settle in Italy, it was like living in a foreign country<br /><br /><b>[Speaking in 2016]</b> I didn’t actually say Italy was ‘like living in a foreign country’. No one has ever seen a direct quote from me saying that. I’m blaming <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Kenny Dalglish</a>. When he re-signed me, a reporter asked me, ‘Why have you come back?’ He said it was like playing in a foreign country. He’s got a lot to answer for!</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal exit backed by former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> &amp; Wales star Rush says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> special but Ramsey can be too]</b> I think <b>[Juventus]</b> is a fantastic move for him. When I went there it was an industrial city but it’s come on a million times better since I was there. I think <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are an amazing club. They’ve still got connections with the <a href="andrea-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> family, <a href="andrea-agnelli.html">Andrea Agnelli</a> is the president there and Gianni <a href="andrea-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> was the owner when I was there. So they are very passionate about it. I think he’d do really well, you’ve got <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> there to play with and all that, so that’s something special. But I think Aaron will be something special for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and I’m sure he’ll enjoy it<br /><br />Times have changed. When I was there I had to do everything myself. Now it’s moved on that much that everything is done for them and the most important thing for him is to concentrate on his football, his attacking play and all that. He’ll learn the language when he’s ready and that’s what it’s all about. He’s got six months to learn it, I had 12 months as well<br /><br />The most important thing in Italy is you have to be confident in what you do. If I went to Italy now, I would tell them: ‘I’m Ian Rush, I’m the best footballer in the world.’ If I had done that for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, the other teams would say: ‘OK, let’s see how good you are.’ It’s completely different to the English way, the English helped each other. First impressions <b>[are]</b> a big thing in Italy and I would say to Aaron: ‘Go there, be confident and tell them how good you are’ and all that, give them one sentence in Italian and his first impression that will be job done for him</p>

  <p><b>[Former Liverpool and Wales striker Ian Rush has admitted he is baffled by the way his fellow countryman Gareth Bale has been treated by Real Madrid’s fans]</b> When I look at his record at Real, he has an incredible record and I don’t know what happens there<br /><br />At the end of the day, he’s got to go where he wants to go. Clubs don’t tell him where to go. If Gareth wants to stay there, stay there. But I’m sure if he wants to come back (to English football), there’ll be lots of clubs after him. I think people are seeing things that I haven’t been seeing. They should be applauding Gareth Bale because I was there last year (For the Champions League final) - he scored a wonder goal against Liverpool. As soon as he came on as sub, I knew he was going to score, but I didn’t think he’d score a goal that good and they should be saying to him ‘thank you so much for your service’</p>

  <p><b>[Ian Rush says Gareth Bale would ‘walk into’ the Manchester United team. When quizzed on the Tottenham and Red Devils rumours]</b> Apart from that, where else are you looking at? Looking at Manchester United last season, I think he’d walk into that side now.<br /><br /><b>[Rush added on the troublesome situation Bale finds himself in]</b> When a club wants to get rid of you and he wants to stay, it’s very difficult and I feel for him because like I’ve said before, Real Madrid supporters should be applauding him. You get to a stage now where different managers have different ways. You just hope that Gareth gets back, hopefully, in the Premier League because everyone wants to see him play. In the last two Wales games he hasn’t been the player he is, but sometimes even the greatest players have to have a couple of bad games<br /><br /><b>[Many believe a move can help him to rediscover his spark]</b> He’s still got a few years left in him and it depends which club wants to take him</p>

  <p><b>[Dalglish sensationally resigned as manager on February 22, 1991, two days after a 4-4 draw with <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> at Goodison Park]</b> We had all come in for training and were told to meet in the dressing room. Kenny walked in and said he was leaving. It was complete shock and surprise in there. He couldn’t say too much but there were tears in his eyes as he spoke</p>

  <p><b>[Ian Rush decry prospect of football without fans amid coronavirus]</b> I’ve never played a game behind closed doors, so I don’t know what it’s like, but I don’t think it would bring the best out of me. If you’re playing in front of no one it begs the question, would you be any good? Would you be up for it, first of all? Would it be the same as a normal game in front of a big crowd? I don’t think so. If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are at home and they can win the league I want to be there even if we all have to be two metres apart. But seriously, if it doesn’t happen and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is declared null and void then you have to move on and not let it affect you. This <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team is the best I’ve ever seen and I’m certain they will come again. There’s no way <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can be awarded the title without the season being finished</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend Ian Rush believes the current <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team may actually be better than some of his legendary Reds teams of the past]</b> To be on a par, they need success but looking back at records they’re actually better. But you do need trophies - it does help!<br /><br />Look at last season, they got 96 points and didn’t win the league so they have upped their game again. To not win the league, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> had to say, ‘we’ve got to do even better.’ They have done. They’ve been absolutely incredible<br /><br />What <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> has done as well - we called it the boot room with Bob Paisley manager, Ronnie Moran, Joe Fagan and Roy Evans - he has a great team behind him with his coaching staff. It’s the coaching staff that keep the players happy, entertained and you need a leader. Paisley was that leader in our day and Jurgen is that leader today and that makes all the difference</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend Rush says <a href="graeme-souness.html">Souness</a> would be one of the best managers in the world]</b> He won the league easily at Rangers and came down thinking maybe he can do the same <b>[at Liverpool]</b> but he changed things too quickly, simple as that. He lost the young players and the old ones by changing things too quickly - what he did have was the right ideas. If <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a> was manager of the team now, he’d be up there with the likes of <b>[Jurgen]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, <b>[Pep]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> and <b>[Jose]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> because I think he knows he’d made mistakes. He’d be an absolutely incredible manager if he was managing now<br /><br /><b>[Rush went on to talk about his own decorated career]</b> I didn’t even have a player liaison officer in Italy. So I had to learn about silly little things like going to the bank in Italy, opening your own bank account at a time when I couldn’t speak Italian and they couldn’t speak English. It was weighing me down. I ended up having chicken pox and shingles at the end of the season because I was so run down</p>
