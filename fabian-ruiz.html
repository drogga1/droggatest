  <p><b>[Fabian Ruiz says James Rodriguez and Rodrigo would be welcome at Napoli]</b> Playing with great players is always better. I think Rodrigo is a great striker, every team would like to have him and I would be very happy if he came to us. Both he and James are great names. They would be welcome in Naples.<br /><br /><b>[One player who Napoli will hope to hold onto is Belgium international Dries Mertens]</b> With Dries, we talk almost every day. We have been together since the first moment I arrived in Naples, he has welcomed me very well. I, like all the others, would be very happy if he signed. For us, he is a very important player</p>

  <p><b>[Fabian Ruiz cited Spain’s togetherness in overcoming adversity as a key factor in their European Under-21 Championship triumph]</b> I’m delighted to have won the award but winning the tournament was more important. We started badly against Italy, and things were difficult. We had to beat Poland by more than three goals. But the side was confident, and we deserved to be champions. The key has been to be together - we’ve got a great team spirit. We had to give our best. Germany are a great side and we had to suffer together. They’re great players but the 2-0 <b>[advantage]</b> gave us peace of mind and confidence and I think we are deserved winners.</p>
