  <p><b>[Napoli star Amin Younes has revealed his admiration for Serie A rivals Juventus]</b> Results like the draws against Chievo or Sassuolo were completely unnecessary. Juventus might have been a bit more clever than us this season. Their football is not beautiful but effective. With players like Cristiano <b>[Ronaldo]</b>, <b>[Giorgio]</b> Chiellini or <b>[Mario]</b> Mandzukic they have a lot of experience and also a huge mental strength<br /><br />It is huge. The entire city is craving the title. The thing is that everybody knows that it is not too far away right now, they know that we are totally capable of winning it. For sure not this season, but one day we will. To be honest: Our players do not want to win it for themselves, they want to win it for these passionate people here. I don’t want to leave before winning the Scudetto with this team<br /><br /><b>[Unai Emery’s Arsenal stand in their way in the quarter-finals]</b> Arsenal are a great team and in great shape. But we do not have to hide from anyone. We will not lack motivation. I have been with Ajax in the final of the Europa League and I really want to play the final again</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[<a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>’s Amin Younes says footballers are taught to ‘stay stupid’]</b> Us football players are helped to stay stupid. Nearly everything gets taken care of for us and because of that players don’t look left or right anymore. Everyone knows how to clean their shoes, but not everyone is able to take care of their finances. Most players don’t know what a savings account is. Young players shouldn’t be squeezed like a lemon just because of their talent. They should be helped in every way possible. A player could get paid only half of his salary right away until he reaches a certain age and the rest could go into another account, which he can then only access after his career is over</p>
