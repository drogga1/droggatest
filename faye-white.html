  <p><b>[When asked if England can win the competition]</b> Yes. It’ll come down to fine margins I’m sure in some of the games, but we do just need our game management to be better over the 90 minutes. I think we’ve shown that we can take chances and make chances, but it is just about being solid defensively when we are challenged more. We’ve still got to be questioned a little bit about that, especially when we come up against some of the physical teams like France or the USA, who are in our side of the draw. We’ve been getting the job done, basically. There’s been some good performances, certainly first half against Scotland and even Argentina, but we’ve lost our way a little bit when teams have stepped up and started to fight back.<br /><br />Playing a third-placed team doesn’t give us that chance and challenge, and then the next game it might be more of a shock as we get lured into a false sense of security maybe. It’s not that we don’t have the ability, it’s just the mentality issue of needing people to get their foot on the ball and get free-kicks and do whatever to take the pressure off. But equally, credit to the fact that when we did go up <b>[and attack, against Japan]</b> we did it with precision. In years gone by, we would’ve struggled and not gone up the other end and scored, so we can’t be too critical as now thankfully Ellen White is in firing form<br /><br /><b>[the 41-year-old was also full of praise for Rachel Daly and <a href="georgia-stanway.html">Georgia Stanway</a>]</b> I know everyone raves about <a href="nikita-parris.html">Nikita Parris</a>, but sometimes I think her final product <b>[is lacking]</b> or <b>[she is]</b> losing the ball when she shouldn’t. I know she’s still learning but, for me, there’s still a few question marks. She’s not a Lucy Bronze. I mean, it was one game for Rachel Daly, but to do that when she’s not been a regular starter, I think was great. The fact that we’ve got her to come on if need be is great<br /><br /><b>[Daly and Stanway]</b> will be full of confidence now and know they can go and deliver. I’m glad Georgia was given her chance. I was hoping she would be because she is something special. And Jodie Taylor’s on the bench, and Fran Kirby, you can bring them on. It must be a nice position <b>[Phil Neville]</b> is in.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal defender Faye White believes <a href="vivianne-miedema.html">Vivianne Miedema</a> can be one of the greatest strikers ever - backing her to reach the level of USWNT legend <a href="abby-wambach.html">Abby Wambach</a>]</b> She’s such a good player. I do think she’ll go on to be one of the greats. You look at her goalscoring record for the country and Arsenal now, it’s ridiculous. I’m sure she will go on to be one of the great strikers, on the level of <a href="abby-wambach.html">Wambach</a>, hitting records and all sorts. She’s a special player.<br /><br />She’s not quick, but the amount of time she makes and her ability to deceive defenders and get a shot in from like half a yard … Or sometimes you think how’s she got that out with three defenders around her and still put it in the back of the net? And that’s happening, week in, week out in the WSL for Arsenal. I think she’s a very special player and someone of that calibre who can put away a header, can put away a long shot, can put away a ball running at players. She’s got a bit of everything in her game<br /><br />The favourites would be the USA, again, and France. I don’t think England are favourites, purely because we haven’t got the history and the performances, although we’ve got the win, haven’t been emphatic. We do have the ability, don’t get me wrong, but at the moment England wouldn’t be favourites. The other one I would pick out on the other side of the draw would be the Netherlands. Just because of the way the draw is, they could go all the way to the final and with their experience of the Euros and the team that they have as well</p>

  <p><b>[Former England international Faye White believes it would be ‘wise’ for Phil Neville to bring in Jade Moore for <a href="keira-walsh.html">Keira Walsh</a> as the Lionesses prepare to take on the USA in Tuesday’s Women’s World Cup semi-final]</b> My question is, will he go with Jade Moore, to get a little bit more steel in there? As opposed to Keira <b>[Walsh]</b>, it’s someone more defensive. It might be a wise thing to do. I’m not saying Keira’s played bad, but it’s whether he thinks he wants to disrupt that or not and add that extra bit of experience. I looked at the team he played in the SheBelieves <b>[Cup]</b> and he played Walsh and Jill Scott didn’t play.<br /><br />The suggestion in putting Bronze in there was that he needed someone with a bit more physicality and fitness. Scott gives that, but that would be my only change, one he might be thinking about. I think Lucy Bronze has the quality to handle <a href="megan-rapinoe.html">Rapinoe</a>’s experience.<br /><br />She’s been playing with some of the best players in the world and handling that experience. That’s going to be intriguing. Bronze will need to attack too to allow us to affect the game and play. She’s important in our attack and can be such a threat. It’s going to be how the team and the back line can cope with, when we lose it, can we gain shape quickly and maybe the midfielders protect that space? It’s the same with their full-backs, too. It is a game that I think will be won by which wide players play best<br /><br /><b>[But the Lionesses are certainly not fazed by the challenge, and White believes the lack of pressure can help Neville’s side]</b> They’ve almost got nothing to lose really. The expectation when you’re expected to win is so much harder to deal with. People expect America to win and go through, really. I think, if anything, the players will use it as something else to motivate them. These games are the ones where we’re going to play proper football. Both teams are going to attack, both teams are confident in how they’re going to build up.<br /><br />America will have another level again to raise and also they have the quality and confidence to deliver on the big stage and handle the pressure. There will be times where England are going to have to accept they’re going to be under pressure, defensively, and being able to keep composed, keep compact, and when we do get it, keep it. Build ourselves into the game. It’s going to be really, really close and competitive and entertaining I’m sure. Technically, tactically, and as long as we are switched on to deal with set-pieces and avoid errors, we are going to be in this game</p>
