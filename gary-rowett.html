  <p><b>[Birmingham City passed up the opportunity to sign Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof because he was not strong enough]</b> We had a few phone calls about him when I was manager of Birmingham City about three years ago. An agent called us and said Benfica were trying to get some of the younger players out to expose them to different levels. We had a look at him. It’s ironic actually. I put it to the staff and some of them felt he wasn’t quite tough enough. Then suddenly he’s being touted around at £20-30 million so I think we made a mistake! He got straight back into the Benfica team very quickly and, of course, went from strength to strength. We had a look at him but the staff felt that he wasn’t strong enough.</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle United midfielder Matt Ritchie is the level of player Stoke City are hoping to sign this summer]</b> We’ve got a very varied target list out there and I’ve always said the same, when you’re linked with players they are not always true … but often some of them are. We want the level of player we are being linked with. That’s the type and the level of player we are trying to bring into the club. A lot of those players will be different styles, they won’t all be the type of player. But there are players we think can come in and make a difference. We are working very hard. Tony <b>[Scholes]</b> and Mark <b>[Cartwright]</b> are working very hard to try to get some of the targets we have all agreed upon and, ultimately, it’s like anything: I want them tomorrow and they want the best deals! We then work together to try to find the middle ground.</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke City and St Pauli entered into a strategic partnership 12 months ago]</b> I think it will be interesting on two levels. It will be nice to see how the link-up we’ve got with St. Pauli works. They are a club that I’ve seen a lot of and I’ve got an admiration for the way that they work with their fans and what they are as a club. And it will be interesting to see whether us as a team are a step further ahead than we were against Wolves the other night. But I’ll say it again, I’ve had pre-seasons where we haven’t won game and we’ve started the season brilliantly and I’ve had pre-seasons that we’ve done so well in that you think you’re going to walk the league and didn’t win a game for six. Let’s see if we’re another step further forward on Saturday against decent opposition.</p>

  <p><b>[Speaking after the club’s 2-0 friendly defeat to St Pauli]</b> It’s easy for me with a week to go to start criticising the performance but this is about preparation, getting ourselves ready for next weekend. At the moment we’ve got a lot of work to do, an awful lot of work, and that’s what it is. I was disappointed and I told the players I was disappointed - and if this was next week I would be really disappointed. It gives us a little bit of a kick up the backside about what we need to do - and we’ve got a lot to do.</p>

  <p><b>[Nottingham Forest vs Stoke]</b> Every game is important and we won’t be prioritising one over the other. But the trip to Forest is a one-off and a nice distraction from the league</p>

  <p><b>[Derby’s Bradley Johnson attempted to bite Stoke City rival Joe Allen during a large-scale melee during the Championship showdown]</b> We are not going to make any complaints. I spoke to Joe and he said it wasn’t anything massively problematic. It was part of the melee, a moment in the game that probably looked worse than it was.<br /><br />It took a lot of discipline and great determination to win with 10 men. That was the biggest performance of our season. We didn’t crumble. I’m taking one of those snakes home with me!</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> the manager]</b> What you’ve got to say is it’s his first managerial job, it’s not an easy job at Derby, as I can testify. I know it’s only Wembley, so he’s on the verge - but what you would say is he’s done an incredible job. Even if they don’t win the final, he’s done an incredible job so far.<br /><br />They started to have that dip in late December and January, and that is when you are tested as a manager. When you are winning games, everything is rosy. As soon as you start losing games, you’ve got to get that team out of that dip.<br /><br />I think it also coincided with <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> coming back from injury, he’s been a big player for them, and probably <a href="harry-wilson.html">Harry Wilson</a>’s form kicking on. But you’ve got to credit <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> for that</p>

  <p><b>[Barnsley slipped to the bottom of Championship table after a 0-0 draw with Millwall that did little to help their survival chances]</b> We should have won the game but lacked a bit of quality in that final action, it doesn’t seem to be quite there at the moment. It was a game we should have gone on to win. At the moment, we have to win games, we have to try and achieve something<br /><br />We are at a point where we need to find momentum. We need a big week, we certainly need to go and win on Tuesday. If we win on Tuesday we at least give ourselves an opportunity, if we don’t win on Tuesday I think it is going to be tough. My mindset is we wanted to give ourselves a chance, we were always going to be an outside bet</p>

  <p><b>[Millwall and <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a>’s hopes of reaching the Championship play-offs took a hit as they played out a 1-1 draw at The Den on Tuesday evening]</b> I think we can still make it. In this division two or three wins changes the whole outlook very quickly. At the moment my thought process is, we are tinged with still trying to get something out of this season and also learning some things for next season. That will be a real challenge because we want both. We’ve done everything we could to win the game and, until we’re out of it, we’ll keep fighting<br /><br />We need our fans here. They give us that 20 minutes of pressure which other teams struggle to cope with. Our fans give us a lift. I know other teams do the same, but we’re a unique club in that sense. What I would say is it makes you realise how important our fans are to us</p>

  <p><b>[Millwall kept their play-off hopes alive with a late 1-0 win at Charlton in the Championship on Friday night]</b> I’m really pleased. We’ve played well in the last two games with this new 5-3-2 system and have deserved more, but nevertheless it was encouraging. It requires a lot of interchange, movement and gettnig the passing right, and two or three times in the first half we didn’t get it right and we allowed them to counter-attack. But I thought on the whole we controlled the first half, and they had to change shape to combat what we were doing. We tried everything we could to win the game, and you could see that by Jake Cooper, our left-sided centre-half, ending up in the box to score the winner! Then after that we saw the game out really well</p>

  <p><b>[Britt Assombalonga’s controversial finish handed Middlesbrough a Championship survival boost in a 2-0 win at Millwall]</b> What looked like a trip, what felt like a trip, was a trip. In a tight game, very physical, very direct, it always felt as though one moment would decide the game. I’m not going to excuse our performance, because it wasn’t good enough, but it was a blatant trip<br /><br />We’re still in the mix for the play-offs but we’re running out of games and if we play like that we won’t get there anyway. There are some big games still to come. We go to Hull, and the simple fact is we’ve got to go there and put in a much better performance</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Leonard’s second-minute stunner sealed Sky Bet Championship play-off hopefuls Millwall a narrow victory at beleaguered Hull]</b> We’re seeing at this stage, and we’ve found it in a couple of games, that it’s really difficult to win games at this stage because everyone’s nervous. Everyone all over the league is fighting for their lives, so people are starting to get desperate and it’s been tough<br /><br />Obviously we’re at a point where you’ve got to win games to stay in the mix because other teams are going to. Listen, it makes it exciting. I think the team deserve an awful lot of credit, where they’ve come to even be in the conversation</p>

  <p><b>[Jude Bellingham: The story behind the record-breaking move to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>]</b> When he was about 12, I used to bring him down to my office now and again before a match just to have a chat to show how much the club appreciated him and how much the club valued him. The word at that time was that every single top European club had tried to buy him and had been watching him. I think the words were that he was probably the most sought-after 12-year-old in Europe at one stage. I’m sure there was a little bit of propaganda with that, but ultimately that’s how well sought-after he’s been from four or five years ago<br /><br />He’s got so much humility and he’s such a level-headed young boy who comes from a very level-headed family and I think that’s been part of the reason he’s come through.</p>
