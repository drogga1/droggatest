  <p><b>[Daniel Agger says I Have A Lot More To Give To Liverpool]</b> I’m getting there, but I still think I have a lot more to give. You learn to enjoy every single game when you’ve been out so long and I’m definitely doing that now. I love playing football and I want to show that, but I know I have a lot more to give</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool vice-captain Daniel Agger is confident the club can deal with the pressure of being in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title mix]</b> When you play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, there is always pressure and that won’t change between now and the end of the season. Part of playing for this club is being able to handle that pressure. I think the players here have proved over the course of this season that they are more than capable of doing that. We have had some great results and there have been a few times when we have been all the way up there at the top. It’s always difficult to compare squads and teams. This is a completely different team to the one in 2009. There aren’t many players left from that side. We are in a good position but we are only in March. There is still a long way to go and a lot of points to play for. We haven’t achieved anything yet and we need to keep going over the final 10 games. We have some big games against teams close to us in the table. They are games we have to win</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Denmark defender Daniel Agger has shed light on his dangerous use of anti-inflammatory drugs during his professional career]</b> I have taken too much anti-inflammatories in my career. I know that full well, and it sucks, but I did stop it <b>[in the end]</b>. I am not gaining anything personally from saying this but I can only hope that other athletes do. It could be that others take a pill or two less.<br /><br /><b>[Agger, who compensated for the sluggishness the medication brought on with a heavy caffeine intake, felt unwell during the warm-up for the Copenhagen match and did not remember his eventual exit to the physio room at Parken]</b> I only had one thought and that was to remain in the dressing room after the warm-up but then I put the shirt on and decided to play. The body could not cope with it. The maximum dose should be taken for only three days. The body reacts to what is put into it and it was my body’s way of telling me that it had had enough. When the head can’t work it out, then the body had to do it.<br /><br /><b>[Agger stopped using anti-inflammatories altogether after that experience and he conceded his retirement has come as a relief to his wife Sofie]</b> She has said it time and time again, that I should stop taking the medicine but it has gone in one ear and out the other. So <b>[when I decided to stop playing]</b> she was pleased too because of the pain I have had and because I have taken so much <b>[medicine]</b> just to keep standing. I am in a place where I have had enough, mentally and physically. I wanted to quit somewhere near the top. I have always said that that was important for me and therefore I stop now</p>

  <p><b>[Daniel Agger’s got <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> under his skin and is itching to be back at Anfield]</b> I’m always happy to be back here. It’s really an experience. It’s so difficult to explain what being here means to me, because I can never really put the feeling into words. Quickly, it was like I belonged, and the longer you’re in a place that suits you, the more it gets under your skin and becomes a part of you. The people, the place, just everything about it felt right, which is why I stayed here for almost nine years. I miss it. I bet if you ask a lot of other players they would say the same. When you leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, you notice the grass is not always greener on the other side. Sometimes you have to hold tight to what you’ve got, especially if it’s a good thing - and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club is definitely a good thing<br /><br /><b>[Agger has a memory bank full of wonderful moments at the stadium and is itching to get back on the turf on Saturday]</b> I’ve tried before to say what it’s like to walk out onto the pitch at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, to play there, but I just never get close to describing it properly. I’ve tried before to say what it’s like to walk out onto the pitch at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, to play there, but I just never get close to describing it properly. For me, personally, there were a lot of great memories at Anfield; looking around, listening to the songs and that’s part of why I’m so eager to be back<br /><br /><b>[Agger returned to Brondby in the summer of 2014 and the centre-back, who for a long period was courted by Europe’s elite, has not been involved in a game since calling time on his career]</b> I’m also excited to play football again. I haven’t done so since May so it’ll be good to touch the ball again. I miss the atmosphere and that rush you get in a competitive game - nothing compares to it. I haven’t seen a lot of my former team-mates for a long time so it’ll be good to spend time with them on and off the pitch. It’s definitely a few days full of positives</p>
