  <p><b>[Paulo Dybala is no closer to leaving Juventus, according to the club’s chief football officer]</b> The market is open and there is interest, but there are no names closer to a sale. Dybala is a Juve player - indeed, he is a great Juve player. As I said, during the transfer market, there are discussions and negotiations<br /><br />Right now he’s an Inter player and we don’t talk about him. We have Gonzalo Higuain and Mario Mandzukic who are great attackers: I wouldn’t talk about others, but about ours. We are happy with those we have<br /><br /><b>[Paratici admits there is a need to move players on, with Luca Pellegrini close to a loan move to Cagliari, but says it will be difficult to find exits for Mattia Perin and Marko Pjaca while they recover from injuries]</b> As with all transfer windows, there is a lot of chatter and not many actual deals done, but we are calm and confident. It’s not that there is an excess of players, but rather a list that neither the coach nor I can do anything about. We can only use 21, and just one ‘local’ homegrown player. Therefore, the players who are not in that list of 22 have to go. At the moment there are six extra players, but two of these, Perin and Pjaca, are unlikely to be transferred in this market and another, Luca Pellegrini, will probably go to Cagliari in the next few hours</p>

For us, he is an important player like Cancelo was, and we decided that this operation worked well for us. We are at the very beginning of the season.

Having said that, we have a large squad with a lot of quality that can replace him in the best possible way. The transfer market is planning and opportunity, so you need to keep your eyes out for the unpredictable elements. There are always opportunities for players coming in and going out, but if there aren’t over the next couple of days, we’ll remain as we are</p>

On an international level, he is one of the most wanted players, but I think he can be important for our project. Rabiot arrived here after not playing for eight months.

Therefore, it seems unlikely we’d need to bring in any more in January. We are evaluating with Marko Pjaca, as he has been injured and needs playing time. We’re also evaluating if he could remain with us, if there aren’t options that satisfy all parties<br /><br />I can exclude right now that <a href="daniele-rugani.html">Daniele Rugani</a> will leave. We need to see what happens with <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Giorgio Chiellini</a>. People tend to forget he has played quite a few games and won important trophies.
