The first contact was in the Champions League quarter-finals, Jorge Mendes told me that Cristiano Ronaldo wanted to sign for Juventus.<br /><br />I thought it was a joke, then we met to discuss Cancelo and he brought Ronaldo up again. At that point, I realised we could try, and I went to talk to <b>[president Andrea]</b> Agnelli. It wasn’t easy, but he was immediately positive from a technical point of view, as well as the player’s motivation and what he could bring to our brand.

  <p><b>[Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici has disclosed how the summer signing of Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> It all started when we played vs Real Madrid in the Champions League. I met <b>[agent]</b> Jorge Mendes, like I always do and he told me: you may not believe it but if Cristiano leaves Real he’d want to join Juventus. Then I started to study the move. During the talks to close a deal for the phenomenal <b>[Joao]</b> Cancelo, Mendes looked at me and said: remember what we talked about? ‘If you want him, he is ready’. Then, in our next meeting, I asked Mendes: so what figures are we talking about? He replied: this is the salary and this is the transfer fee. So I told him I would get back to him in a few days, because if I had said no, he would’ve contacted other clubs.<br /><br />There were hours of extreme tension and energy. Many thoughts started crossed my mind: we have <b>[Gonzalo]</b> Higuain who we’ll need to sell, but Ronaldo is a star who will open various channels: technical and commercial. Finally I convinced myself that we must at least try. Up to this point, I had not told anything to anyone (at Juventus). I met with Andrea (Agnelli) and Pavel (Nedved) and we all agreed. We must give the entire environment a shock. A positive shock that can project Juventus to a new level. So, I told Agnelli and Nedved: I have an idea…but it is yet to be evaluated, so do not laugh and do not throw yourselves out of the window.<br /><br />There are two ways to galvanise the team: one which I cannot disclose now and the other is to sign Cristiano Ronaldo. The first way? It was to buy Icardi and unleash an incredible fiasco or we can sign Cristiano Ronaldo. I told them: Mendes told me to tell you that if Juve wants Cristiano and meets his demands, he is going to come to Juventus. He does not want anyone else other than Juventus. You must also understand that Andrea is not just a president. He knows football and business very well. And always wants to make Juventus bigger. So he said ‘give me a moment to think about it’. At that point I was happy I wasn’t thrown out of the window! On the same day, during the afternoon, he told me to confirm all the numbers that we had discussed, because if it was like I said it was, we are going to go forward with the operation.</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus go cold on Paul Pogba return]</b> Will Pogba return to Juventus? No. In football, you never know, but I think it is very difficult.<br /><br /><b>[On James Rodriguez]</b> He’s certainly a great player, we must see. Improving a squad like ours is not easy. To improve on <b>[Paulo]</b> Dybala, <b>[Douglas]</b> Costa, <b>[Juan]</b> Cuadrado and <b>[Federico]</b> <a href="federico-bernardeschi.html">Bernardeschi</a> is really hard.

He has more technique, but is less defensive and tactical. I think Ramsey has never found his best position, because he hasn’t played as a mezz’ala in a three-man midfield. That’s his position</p>

Dybala is someone who is always there, until the end<br /><br /><b>[Giuseppe Marotta was responsible for many of those cut-price arrivals.
