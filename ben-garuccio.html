<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Adelaide United struggled to deal with Gamba Osaka’s quality in the AFC Champions League]</b> They <b>[Gamba]</b> were using the ball a lot more efficiently, especially in the first 20 minutes. You could tell with their first goal they were very sharp and it was a good move, good cross and a great header. They were finding those spaces inside us a little bit. Their centre-backs were looking for that ball into the midfielder, which we weren’t compact enough in the middle. That let us down a little bit but they were very sharp and they are a good team and it showed tonight.<br /><br />I had a good chance in the box and maybe I could have cut back. We score that and we go 1-1 and you just never know how the game can go. That second goal on the stroke of half-time is a killer … it’s hard to come back from that. The second half was alright but I don’t think we created enough quality chances to really be in the game tonight<br /><br />Me personally it took a little bit of adjusting that first 15-20 minutes I was very quiet but once you come into the game but once you find your feet it’s enjoyable. It’s unbelievable to play against these players, in your career these are the sorts of players you want to be coming up against. It’s a great experience for all of us</p>
