  <p><b>[Nice full-back Youcef Atal says he is good enough to play for a big club]</b> Yes, there are clubs that wanted me at that time. Last year it was too early <b>[for a departure]</b>. And even today, I’m focusing on another great season. Yes, I can play in a big club, that’s part of my goals. I work for that. There is not a player who will tell you that he would not like to play for a big club<br /><br /><b>[When asked about his style of play and preferred position]</b> I’m hard-hitting and I’ve been playing like that since I was little. I have never changed. These are my natural qualities and I try to enjoy them. On the flanks, you have to be fast anyway. I prefer to play right-back, but these are the coach’s choices. I was trained in this job. I see better when I am at the back. But whether I attack or defend, I play whole-heartedly. I give 100 per cent all the time</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea target Youcef Atal suffers serious knee injury in Nice’s win over Metz]</b> Bad news for Youcef Atal and Les Aiglons. Forced to go off half an hour into the game against Metz this Saturday, the Algerian international has undergone additional examinations. The diagnosis revealed a meniscal lesion in the right knee. The 23-year-old, who will be operated on soon, will unfortunately be out of action for a long time. <a href="nice-fc.html">OGC Nice</a> wishes him a speedy recovery</p>
