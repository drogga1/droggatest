  <p><b>[Daniel Crowley on his remarkable road to redemption]</b> I do see players from my age group playing in the Premier League now and I think, ‘How are they playing there and I’m not? Do I think I’m good enough to still be at Arsenal? One hundred per cent. But there are no real regrets because that’s just the way I am. Every career is different<br /><br /><b>[All he wanted to do was play football]</b> I had no choice. I had quite a bad name in England, which was fair, but the thing is - I was still a kid. I was this kid in a man’s world and it was really hard. Just because I was ready with my feet footballing-wise, it doesn’t mean that I was ready maturity-wise and I think that that is what people forget in football. That side of things is not really fair. You have to grow up so fast and I wasn’t ready to do that. I feel like I was a bit of a scapegoat at times. But don’t get me wrong, I didn’t always handle things in the right way<br /><br />The thing with Arsenal is they play a certain way and not many teams play that way - and I think that’s a problem as well. They don’t teach you about going on loan to the lower league clubs: to go from such a big club like Arsenal, playing with great players, to then playing a completely different way in League One. That’s what’s wrong with the youth system in England. That’s nothing against the first team because the first team have to win, they don’t have the time really to worry about the young players. So, I don’t put any blame on them. But something does have to change and that’s why everyone is coming out to Holland and Germany, because they need game time<br /><br />I had to take quite a big cut to my wages to go out and play. Not many players would have done that but I can’t sit on the bench; it drives me crazy. The second division was not where I wanted to be. It hurts your ego a little bit having to drop down but you just have to get over that and do it. Once I was there, I was really happy because I was playing. That’s all I want to do, I just want to play - that’s what makes me happy<br /><br />I haven’t had any problems out here. There hasn’t been anything in the papers about me and that was an issue when I was in England. People questioned my attitude and my maturity but I think I’ve proven that now. I’ve grown up a lot and I needed to. Before, I was falling out with people because I wasn’t playing but I’ve learned you can’t do that because you just become disruptive for the team and it’s not their fault. The thing with me is I have a strong personality. I’m a bit like marmite. You either really like me or you don’t understand me. I’ve had to change because sometimes I would say things in the wrong places. I’d speak my mind in the wrong situation when it wasn’t needed or it was out of order. But there is no malice in me; it’s just I don’t sugar-coat what I say<br /><br />It’s going to be massive. You don’t actually realise how big it is for the people of Tilburg until you actually speak to them. The place is buzzing. We’re the underdogs and you do think sometimes, ‘How are we going to stop them?’ But you just never know in football. We’ve lost both times in the league to them this season but the final will be a completely different game. We have to try and test them, to get around them and cause them problems<br /><br />I am ambitious. I do massively believe in myself, I think I can be one of the best No.10s in Europe. We’ve done really well this season, but it’s been tough at times. I want to go to a team where you are playing top five, top six. The next team I want to go to I want it to be about attacking, when we have the ball and dominate the game. I do miss home, I do miss England and I would love to play there again but I’m not the type of person just to go to a team in England because it’s in England. If there is a better team for me in Holland or Belgium, or somewhere else, then I would do it. But I want to play in higher-paced football. I think it makes you better and that’s what I’m looking for next</p>
