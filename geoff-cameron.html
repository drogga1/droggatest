  <p><b>[Geoff Cameron played 15 minutes in his return from a concussion. It may not sound like much, but the defender told the media last week he harbored concern for his long-term future]</b> You don’t know when it’s going to get right and there’s situations like Andy Wilkinson. After the second or third week, it was like, ‘Am I going to be in a tough position now? Is this the end of me?’ Speaking to one of my very close friends who actually studies concussions, a doctor I’ve known back in the States, he reassured me I would get better over time</p>

  <p><b>[U.S. national team defender Geoff Cameron has laid the blame for the country’s World Cup qualifying failure at the feet of former coach Bruce Arena]</b> Listen: I hold my hand up - I didn’t play well against Costa Rica. I made a mistake; their second goal was my fault. But it was the 88th minute and we were down 1-nil. I tried to do something to help the team and I got caught out. But I would have more respect for a coach to say: ‘You know what, Geoff? I don’t fancy you today. I think this is a better lineup.’ I’d say: ‘OK, no problem, you told me the truth.’ But if you tell me I’m not fit enough, that’s like an insult to me as a professional. Bruce Arena made decisions that cost us going to the World Cup. And I don’t have a problem saying it, because we had the right group of guys<br /><br />I’m convinced if they would have kept Jurgen and not done such a drastic change, I think we would have qualified. I know we would have qualified</p>

  <p><b>[Geoff Cameron has opened up about the USA national team’s failure to qualify for the World Cup]</b> It was almost incomprehensible, you know? It was pure embarrassment and shame. It was the most depressing moment I’ve had in my entire career. Everyone wanted to know how. How could we lose to Trinidad &amp; Tobago with the World Cup on the line? But to me, the problems run deeper than just one game. Over the past year, U.S. Soccer has gone back in time. For too long, we have seen a revolving-door system. We saw the return of an old-school regime, one that may have worked a decade ago, but not now. Not anymore. One that did not adapt to a changing soccer culture. One that couldn’t lead a team - that despite what some may feel - had plenty of talent and depth. And this was a regime that certainly wasn’t equipped to lead us to the next level and the next phase in U.S. Soccer. After Jurgen Klinsmann was fired, and Bruce Arena took over, we got too comfortable. We lost our ambition and sense of progress. But more than anything, we lost any sense of competitiveness.<br /><br />He threw his two central defenders under the bus - after the single most depressing day of all of our careers - because they ‘couldn’t dribble out of the back’ on one of the worst pitches I’ve ever trained on. You throw your own players under the bus? When we played a 4-1-3-2? When we only needed one point? One freaking point. To go to the World Cup<br /><br />I had my differences with Jurgen over the years, but the one thing you cannot deny is that Jurgen and his staff brought a sense of true professional competitiveness and ambition to the national team. The real difference was that Jurgen challenged guys to push themselves to the absolute limits. He encouraged them to go play abroad in the top leagues, even if they didn’t speak the language, or were going to have to scratch and claw to get minutes. That was the whole point, actually. He created a mindset of never letting yourself get too comfortable. He held us to a higher standard.<br /><br />Our best young players need to be playing in the top European leagues. Period. It shouldn’t be looked at as a negative thing. It should be a huge source of pride to send a 20-year-old American kid to play in the Bundesliga or the Premier League. Even better if they came up in MLS for a few years. Right now, those future World Cup stars are 16 and 17 years old, playing in America. We need to groom those players in our system until they hit their ceiling, and then we need to encourage them to get on a plane and on to the next challenge. We need a president and a national team manager who embrace that mentality</p>

  <p><b>[Geoff Cameron is switching clubs in the Championship, having agreed a loan move to Queens Park Rangers from Stoke City]</b> I’m extremely excited and happy to be here. It’s a fresh start and new beginning for me. I decided over the summer that I wanted a change and something new. The boss here has been interested in me before and I’m excited to play for him. He wanted me here which is always a big part when they believe in your ability. I want to help the team and get us up the table.</p>
