  <p><b>[Geoff Cameron made his return to Stoke’s XI on Saturday]</b> It’s been a long four months but I’m just happy to get some minutes under my belt and obviously with the 2-0 result. Hopefully we can just keep kicking on. There were some dark moments and frustration for sure. I didn’t know if I was going to play again this season or not so I’m just happy to have come back and been able to kick a ball. I wasn’t expecting to start today, just to be involved and hopefully get some minutes - fortunately enough I started and lasted 90 minutes. I’ll be sore tomorrow but I’ll do all the recovery and take on all the stuff for my system</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Moses needed a change of manager to make it at Chelsea]</b> He is a very good footballer and a real good guy. You can sense that he is relishing this opportunity now and he is blossoming into the player that everybody has known he could become. When he was here we all saw the qualities he possessed. He is quick, powerful and athletic and is very dangerous with the ball at his feet too. I think it is fair to say that he is one of their main guys now, which is fantastic for him. For a while, when he was on loan here and at West Ham United, it appeared that his future may well have been away from the club, but credit to him for getting into the side and making that position his own. Sometimes you just need a change in management to get an opportunity and he is thriving under Antonio Conte. I am really pleased to see him doing so well, just as a lot of other guys at the club are</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke City man made it clear he was capable of, and committed to, handling any role Arena gives him]</b> I’ve played 60 something <b>[games]</b> in the Premier League <b>[at right back]</b>. I’ve played 40 something games at center mid and center <b>[back]</b>, and I’m playing against the best players in the world in the best league in the world. My play speaks for itself. I can go into a number of positions. For me, it’s a plus because I’m on the field. I don’t think there’s many players that can play those three positions consistently every single weekend.<br /><br />But if the team needs me, if Bruce needs me to play at right back because he believes in me that I can perform and shut down one of their good players, then I’ll do it because I’m helping the team. But he knows that, and I’ve told him, that my best position is either center <b>[back]</b> or defensive midfield. That’s where I rate myself, but I also rate myself as a right back and I can do the job and I’ve done it before for Jurgen <b>[Klinsmann]</b>, and I’m sure I’ll do it for Bruce when he needs me.</p>

  <p><b>[When asked what would be the key to breaking down a defensive-minded team]</b> It’s just a matter of those key moments and making sure that you’re aware and you’re fully concentrated for 90 minutes and not taking a step off and not being in la la land. You have to be 100 percent focused because it only takes one play to be switched off and they’re on a counterattack.</p>

  <p><b>[USA international Geoff Cameron has urged the Potters to ‘get in Arsenal’s faces’ on Saturday after back-to-back defeats in the league last season]</b> Last season was disappointing against Arsenal and we can all say we didn’t play well. But if we go out with the attitude we showed at Everton - running, chasing down balls, getting in their faces - it will be tough for them. As you can see in their first game, Leicester made it very difficult for them and I’m sure they’re kicking themselves because they deserved more. We can look at that and go forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Geoff Cameron’s Saturday was bittersweet]</b> I pulled up and felt a sharp zing in my hamstring. I tried to continue on and jog off the field and we assessed at halftime. It was too much for me to carry on and too much of a risk. I was disappointed I couldn’t finish the game but the guys dug in deep and got a point</p>

It may not sound like much, but the defender told the media last week he harbored concern for his long-term future]</b> You don’t know when it’s going to get right and there’s situations like Andy Wilkinson. After the second or third week, it was like, ‘Am I going to be in a tough position now? Is this the end of me?’ Speaking to one of my very close friends who actually studies concussions, a doctor I’ve known back in the States, he reassured me I would get better over time</p>

  <p><b>[U.S. national team defender Geoff Cameron has laid the blame for the country’s World Cup qualifying failure at the feet of former coach Bruce Arena]</b> Listen: I hold my hand up - I didn’t play well against Costa Rica. I made a mistake; their second goal was my fault. But it was the 88th minute and we were down 1-nil. I tried to do something to help the team and I got caught out. But I would have more respect for a coach to say: ‘You know what, Geoff? I don’t fancy you today. I think this is a better lineup.’ I’d say: ‘OK, no problem, you told me the truth.’ But if you tell me I’m not fit enough, that’s like an insult to me as a professional. Bruce Arena made decisions that cost us going to the World Cup. And I don’t have a problem saying it, because we had the right group of guys<br /><br />I’m convinced if they would have kept Jurgen and not done such a drastic change, I think we would have qualified. I know we would have qualified</p>

  <p><b>[Geoff Cameron has opened up about the USA national team’s failure to qualify for the World Cup]</b> It was almost incomprehensible, you know? It was pure embarrassment and shame. It was the most depressing moment I’ve had in my entire career. Everyone wanted to know how. How could we lose to Trinidad &amp; Tobago with the World Cup on the line? But to me, the problems run deeper than just one game. Over the past year, U.S. Soccer has gone back in time. For too long, we have seen a revolving-door system. We saw the return of an old-school regime, one that may have worked a decade ago, but not now. Not anymore. One that did not adapt to a changing soccer culture. One that couldn’t lead a team - that despite what some may feel - had plenty of talent and depth. And this was a regime that certainly wasn’t equipped to lead us to the next level and the next phase in U.S. Soccer. After Jurgen Klinsmann was fired, and Bruce Arena took over, we got too comfortable. We lost our ambition and sense of progress. But more than anything, we lost any sense of competitiveness.<br /><br />He threw his two central defenders under the bus - after the single most depressing day of all of our careers - because they ‘couldn’t dribble out of the back’ on one of the worst pitches I’ve ever trained on. You throw your own players under the bus? When we played a 4-1-3-2? When we only needed one point? One freaking point. To go to the World Cup<br /><br />I had my differences with Jurgen over the years, but the one thing you cannot deny is that Jurgen and his staff brought a sense of true professional competitiveness and ambition to the national team. The real difference was that Jurgen challenged guys to push themselves to the absolute limits. He encouraged them to go play abroad in the top leagues, even if they didn’t speak the language, or were going to have to scratch and claw to get minutes. That was the whole point, actually. He created a mindset of never letting yourself get too comfortable. He held us to a higher standard.<br /><br />Our best young players need to be playing in the top European leagues. Period. It shouldn’t be looked at as a negative thing. It should be a huge source of pride to send a 20-year-old American kid to play in the Bundesliga or the Premier League. Even better if they came up in MLS for a few years. Right now, those future World Cup stars are 16 and 17 years old, playing in America. We need to groom those players in our system until they hit their ceiling, and then we need to encourage them to get on a plane and on to the next challenge. We need a president and a national team manager who embrace that mentality</p>

It’s a fresh start and new beginning for me. I decided over the summer that I wanted a change and something new. The boss here has been interested in me before and I’m excited to play for him. He wanted me here which is always a big part when they believe in your ability. I want to help the team and get us up the table.</p>
