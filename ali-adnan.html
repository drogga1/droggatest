  <p><b>[Iraq defender Ali Adnan speaks about the joy he feels playing for his country on the road to Qatar 2022]</b> I’ve been playing for the national team for a long time now and, for me, it’s still the best – there’s a different feeling than playing for your club. You can feel the millions of people looking to you, wanting you to win, and that’s very special</p>

  <p><b>[Vancouver Whitecaps defender Ali Adnan fighting to help his homeland]</b> Everyone loves this country, but I feel like I’m a different person. If somebody loves his country 90 percent, I love my country 200 percent. Really, I love my country so much. That’s why this means for me a lot. When I see people, they fight for a better life. The people there, they look forward to having a good country, better life, but they don’t have it. We have everything in this country. We have people living without a war, we have people without food problems<br /><br />Now is the moment for everyone to support Iraq, because I think Iraq as a country is very important for everyone in the world. I hope to help my country. After I finished my season here, I can have a vacation, but I didn’t go to vacation. I prefer to go to Iraq. Everyone told me, ‘It’s very dangerous.’ Also, the team here, the staff, they called me, ‘What are you doing there? It’s dangerous.’ I said, ‘No. For me, this is nothing. It’s not dangerous, because I’ve always been with the people and it’s never been a problem for me.’<br /><br />People from the outside look at Iraq and they think of it as the country they only see on TV. When you look on the TV, they say, ‘F<strong>* this s</strong>* country’, you know? That’s normal, but when you’re there, and you’re inside, you see the people, how much they love each other, how much they help each other. If you’re coming from a different country and you go there, and if you have no food, you have no money, they gonna give you everything you want and they’ll let you be there for as long as you want. Everything is nice there. I love to help my country. I hope this year, we can have a better life<br /><br />When I <b>[first]</b> came here, let’s be honest, I didn’t feel like <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> was a big enough league for me <b>[since]</b> I was coming from Italy, but after I came here, it was actually a surprise. Everything was beautiful here. People, stadiums, fans and the teams here actually have a lot of good players, like big teams here have many <b>[good]</b> players. I found it difficult to play here<br /><br />When I was first coming here, I thought this would be an easy league, but I didn’t know it was gonna be this hard for me. I actually love this league so much now. I felt like there would be a big difference between here and Europe, but when I came here, it really wasn’t that different. The only major difference is the time. It takes more than 10 hours sometimes just to travel. <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is gonna be one of the best leagues in the world soon<br /><br /><b>[Adnan believes a trip to Qatar in 2022 is still possible, and he’ll do whatever it takes to make Iraq better in the process, on and off the field]</b> If you look at the players, like we have Justin <b>[Meram]</b>, who was born here in America. We have two who were born in Sweden. One in England, too many players who were born outside of our country. But I’m gonna tell you something. That’s because they’re the best players. We have awesome players<br /><br />When we play for the national team, in the first meeting, we say, if there’s any new young player, we say, ‘We’re playing for the country.’ No one here plays for himself. No one plays for something different. If you’re like this, you’ll be here for two weeks and after that, you’re not gonna be here anymore<br /><br />The people they understand very well, when you play for your country, nothing is about yourself. The players there, when they come for the national team, they only have one thing on their mind. We just fight to win the game and to make the country happy. That’s it</p>
