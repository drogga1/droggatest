  <p><b>[PSV have sacked head coach <a href="mark-van-bommel.html">Mark van Bommel</a> in the wake of a 3-1 Eredivisie defeat to Feyenoord on Sunday]</b> The decline is too large and unworthy of PSV. The matches are the defining moments, but the process around them is also decisive. We monitor this intensively. PSV is a club where we try to help and support each other. That has also been the case in recent months. The club’s interest has always been paramount and the evaluation ultimately resulted in this painful decision. We have all done everything to turn the tide. Unfortunately, that did not work</p>
