  <p><b>[Pep Segura, the former La Masia technical director, said of <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>’s influence on <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s youth system]</b> It is about creating one philosophy, one mentality, from the bottom of the club to the top. <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> is the one who started it all. He has been the club’s most influential figure. We all have the ability to do certain things, but I would not have been able to build something from scratch like <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> did. I learned a lot of things from him. I cannot imagine the current <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> without <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>’s work</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona are yet to make a decision on whether Ernesto Valverde will remain their manager past the end of the current campaign]</b> Ernesto Valverde? He is on a two-year deal and there is an option to add a third, we will come to a decision which suits both parties. We have a stronger squad than last season and that was the objective, we have achieved that.<br /><br /><b>[On Arturo Vidal]</b> He has made a mistake and he must fix it. He has shown disrespect towards his fellow team-mates and now there is the opportunity to put that right, which I am sure he will take</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s hijacking of <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Arturo Vidal</a> from <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> has backfired badly]</b> In general, the situation with <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> is very clear. Firstly, with his protests, it’s a clear demonstration that he wants to play for and serve <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, contributing to winning everything, as he said when he was presented<br /><br />The negative part is he doesn’t have the delicate touch that a professional should have, out of respect for his coach and his team-mates. In a club as big as <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, with the great professionals here, <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> knows he has done wrong, that he lacked respect for his team-mates and I’m sure he will correct that</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar not a target for Barcelona]</b> Neymar is a player who is not on the table at the moment. I have already said that no young player that leaves for money will return. We stand by that. But the circumstances with Neymar are totally different. We always must evaluate the circumstances of the market and assess what the best moves for us will be in relation to those.<br /><br />Thiago Alcantara? He left us as a professional footballer, so he enters the same parameters as Neymar and he could also return if that is what is requested</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona have sought to quash talk of Ousmane Dembele moving to Liverpool]</b> If you have information from the English press, ask the English press. If you have information about Liverpool, ask Liverpool. As of today we have nothing for Dembele and we have no desire to change the structure of the template. It is true that I had a meeting with Dembele’s agents. But I had three meetings with three other representatives. My job is to meet with representatives, they are common things.<br /><br />There is no problem with Dembele. It is a normal situation for a young player who has a lot of talent and has reached a very big club like Barca, with great players and teammates. He has never had this before and this generates a process of adaptation that has to happen. He is very young and has never had to make the effort to adapt to this way of playing and we recognise that it is costing him. He also recognises it. What we will do is work so that this adaptation is possible</p>
