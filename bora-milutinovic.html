  <p><b>[Former USA and Mexico coach Bora Milutinovic gives his assessment of the two sides in conversation with <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>.com ahead of the pair’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Confederations Cup Russia 2017 play-off. It was wisdom that proved correct as Mexico won 3-2 after extra time.]</b> At the moment Mexico have greater quality in their squad. USA aren’t the same team they were a few years ago. What wins matches is the quality of your players. History doesn’t play and neither do the jerseys. If a team has greater quality and is aware of that fact, then they have to be favourites</p>

  <p><b>[World Cup record holder Bora Milutinovic shares secrets to managerial success]</b> A manager has to be able to adapt to any context. We must always find a way to convey our experience and work with young players. We adapt to each era because that’s what football demands.<br /><br />When you practice and have opportunities to go somewhere, you don’t look at it like that. But what is certain is that it’s very rewarding to discover a new world each time. I was like a traveller on a boat, going left, going right, discovering new continents - it was extraordinary. I got to share my experiences and there was always a new challenge. I’m very happy to have been able to adapt perfectly to each new country<br /><br />You need to have good players but above all you need to have a good team spirit. There also needs to be accountability for everyone. You need a lot of things: efficiency, experience, a good coach… I’ve always said that skills are not enough - you need the whole package. Everything needs to be in place for players to express themselves in the best way. I’m not an expert on African football but I know you need all those things to triumph at the highest level<br /><br />Mexico have a lot of quality but they face Germany first in a difficult group. Regarding Costa Rica… they’re in a group with Serbia and I am Serbian so I need to support my country! Regarding Nigeria, they play Argentina, Croatia and Iceland. I think of my three former teams they have the best chance of advancing. The favourites remain the same with each edition. In South America there’s Brazil and Argentina, even if the Argentines had a poor qualifying campaign. They have Lionel Messi. In Europe you have France, Germany and Spain. I think these five teams will compete for the title. I hope there’s a surprise but I think it’ll be difficult<br /><br />Never say never. It’s my country and I’m a big supporter of the team, but it’s hard to imagine anyone wanting to talk to Bora at this age! I have no regrets because the teams I trained always achieved great results. Training a big club would have been good but I’m very happy with what I achieved in my career. It’s been a dream. I couldn’t have asked for more</p>
