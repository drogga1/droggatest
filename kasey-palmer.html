  <p><b>[Kasey Palmer seems ready to fulfill their Chelsea dreams]</b> It was a dream from the start really. I think it was my first touch on the pitch and the ball just fell to me. It was kind of a lucky goal but I’ll take that on my debut. That’s probably been the highlight of my career so far, to be a part of something special for the club and for myself to achieve promotion in my first season in men’s football. It’s one I’ll never forget that’s for sure.<br /><br />For me it’s the dream to come back and play for Chelsea after being out on loan. But you have to earn it and going out on loan gives you the opportunity to showcase what you can do. Being away with the first team now and a new manager is a great chance to show what we can do and hopefully we can take our chance.</p>

  <p><b>[Young Chelsea midfielder Kasey Palmer will spend the 2018-19 season at Blackburn Rovers after agreeing a loan move to Ewood Park]</b> I think once you are told of the interest you just want to get it done and get to the club straight away. I’ve just wanted to get out there and get training with the team. I’m happy to be here and want to be a part of something exciting in the Championship next season. Moving forward I want to achieve something special here. As soon as I spoke to the manager and heard what he wanted to do here, the way he likes to play and having watched a couple of games last season, I felt it is a club heading in the right direction. I am good friends with Jack Payne from our time at Huddersfield and I made sure I watched the games that were on Sky Sports when he was at the club last season.</p>
