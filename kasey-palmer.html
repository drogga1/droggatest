  <p><b>[Chelsea loanee Kasey Palmer wants to stay at Huddersfield Town for another year]</b> Of course, I want to stay. To be part of it this season, I feel like I don’t want to leave it now. It is unfinished work. So hopefully we can enjoy the next few days and then the talks will begin ahead of the next season.<br /><br />I think if we would have stayed in the league <b>[Championship]</b> then I would have loved to have come back anyway. We have gone up so it is an even bigger incentive to come back so we will just see what happens over the next few weeks and take it from there.<br /><br />It is unbelievable for me because I was out for four months and I didn’t think I was going to play for the club again and to be involved and win at Wembley is unbelievable. I can’t describe my feeling at the minute. To be promoted to the Premier League in my first season at 20 years old… It is the best feeling ever. My best footballing moment by far. You can play Under-23s for years and win Youth Cups, that’s been unbelievable but from the first game in a professional environment where the fans have been really passionate. Everyone is playing well, it means the world to everyone, it is a completely different experience.<br /><br />I feel like everyone is <b>[delighted to make the Premier League]</b>. The commotion in the dressing room was great. Some of the guys have been Championship players for years and to get promoted as the underdog has been the best feeling. Everyone wrote us off and to come out on top again and again just sums us up. No disrespect to the Reading fans but you can sees who’s fans <b>[were the loudest]</b> today. So it is just a pleasure to be a part of it, it has just been an unbelievable season and we have created history<br /><br />To be fair, I think there’s a few <b>[loanees who have been successful]</b>. Christian Atsu <b>[at Newcastle]</b>, Fikayo Tomori <b>[at Brighton]</b> and me and Izzy. It has been a successful season for the Chelsea loan boys so it has been good for everyone really. Because I got injured we didn’t really get to play together as much as we liked. It is great for Izzy, just as much as me to come on loan and get promotion at 20 years old. I can’t think of anything better</p>

  <p><b>[Kasey Palmer seems ready to fulfill their Chelsea dreams]</b> It was a dream from the start really. I think it was my first touch on the pitch and the ball just fell to me. It was kind of a lucky goal but I’ll take that on my debut. That’s probably been the highlight of my career so far, to be a part of something special for the club and for myself to achieve promotion in my first season in men’s football. It’s one I’ll never forget that’s for sure.<br /><br />For me it’s the dream to come back and play for Chelsea after being out on loan. But you have to earn it and going out on loan gives you the opportunity to showcase what you can do. Being away with the first team now and a new manager is a great chance to show what we can do and hopefully we can take our chance.</p>

  <p><b>[Young Chelsea midfielder Kasey Palmer will spend the 2018-19 season at Blackburn Rovers after agreeing a loan move to Ewood Park]</b> I think once you are told of the interest you just want to get it done and get to the club straight away. I’ve just wanted to get out there and get training with the team. I’m happy to be here and want to be a part of something exciting in the Championship next season. Moving forward I want to achieve something special here. As soon as I spoke to the manager and heard what he wanted to do here, the way he likes to play and having watched a couple of games last season, I felt it is a club heading in the right direction. I am good friends with Jack Payne from our time at Huddersfield and I made sure I watched the games that were on Sky Sports when he was at the club last season.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea midfielder Kasey Palmer has joined Bristol City on loan until the end of the season]</b> My preferred position is playing centrally behind the striker, in an attacking role and hopefully create and score goals to help the team go and reach the play-offs. We’re nine unbeaten at the minute, five points off the play-offs so hopefully I can get as many games as possible to help the team with goals, assists, play well and add something.<br /><br /><b>[Palmer joins two of his Chelsea team-mates at Ashton Gate - Jay Dasilva and Tomas Kalas]</b> I spoke to Jay when making the decision. He told me it was a great club to be at and it’s the right club for me. My first impressions are all good. I’ve walked around the stadium, got a feel for the place, I’ve met the staff and I’m raring to go. Hopefully I can repay the trust that the head coach has shown in me. The first day is always difficult, getting to know everyone but hopefully I can get down to business quickly, train with the boys and get to know everyone and hopefully produce the goods on the pitch</p>
