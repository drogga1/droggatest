  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have avoided being kicked out of the Carabao Cup as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> were fined £200,000 for fielding an ineligible player in their third-round tie with Milton Keynes Dons. <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> Chirivella played in that match, a 2-0 <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> win, despite having not received international clearance after the expiry of his loan last season with Spanish club Extremadura Union Deportiva]</b> The board noted that the club had sought the assistance of the <a href="fa.html">Football Association</a> in securing the return of the international clearance prior to the start of this season. And the club had been able to include the player on team sheets for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> Two matches (under <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> Rules) and one Leasing.com Trophy match, which resulted in the breach not being identified until the club reported the issue to the EFL and <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> following the MK Dons match<br /><br />The rules of the Carabao Cup require clubs to ensure all players are registered and eligible in line with their respective League’s rules before they play. The player was always contracted to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool FC</a> during this period, and the reason he was not eligible was because the club did not have the relevant international clearance following expiry of an earlier loan agreement. The club’s breach was in part due to the challenges it encountered with securing the correct international clearance, and its subsequent ability to include the player on teamsheets despite the lack of clearance. As a result the board concluded the most appropriate sanction was a financial penalty</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> Chirivella says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s young stars are determined to make the first team proud by booking a place in the Carabao Cup semi-finals]</b> Well, it’s a big night for everyone.

We want to make the first team proud and we want to be in the next round and that is what we will try to do<br /><br />We are playing against a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> team and that’s the level everyone should get to and wants to get to so it’s a big night, especially for the younger lads. It will be a very proud moment for them and we are looking forward to it. I’m just very excited. It has been a long time since I have had a spell playing for the first team and hopefully I can show what I can do. Tuesday is a big opportunity for everyone, I think we are ready for it and want to show what we can do</p>

I know he has this special thing that only a few players have and I’m very, very happy that finally he is showing what a talent he is<br /><br /><b>[The 22-year-old is expected to leave the club on loan in January]</b> It was great, something I was waiting for for a long time. Finally I played a good game and the team won! We are very happy. We got told just to give everything, not to worry if we are not right in the press or are not pressing well, just give everything and run for each other. Everyone was responsible for everyone and I think we did that and we are very proud of it. I played with the likes of Neco, Harvey, Curtis for a long time. At the end of the day, we just play football and it doesn’t matter if it’s U23s or first team, we have to give everything and just be ready for every chance we get. I think we showed that we are ready<br /><br /><b>[Asked about the atmosphere for the 235th Merseyside derby]</b> It was unbelievable. I can’t wait to see my family to see what they tell me, how it looked from the stands. But I don’t expect anything else from the best fans in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Much-improved Chirivella inches closer to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> first team with strong Shrewsbury showing]</b> Unbelievable! We fully deserve to go through to the next round. It was a proper <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team. A night for everyone to be proud<br /><br />Mentally I feel ready. I train every day with the first team and I feel I am getting closer to the level. I came <b>[to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> very early, when I was only 17, and maybe I was not ready yet. Now I feel I am getting there. I am getting very good feedback from the players. My mentality has changed and hopefully I can carry on<br /><br /><b>[Chirivella ceded responsibility to <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a> for Carabao Cup quarter-final defeat to <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>]</b> He’s a real leader on the pitch. There are different types of captain, and he’s the one who shows always on the biggest stage. He’s a fantastic player, when you don’t know what to do with the ball, you just give it to him and he will do something, or win a foul or whatever. He’s a great friend of mine as well, and I’m very happy for him</p>
