The All India Football Federation is doing its best to ensure knowledge and ideas from the event are preserved and used in the future for the betterment of Indian football<br /><br />Asia is a huge continent and home to more than 60 per cent of the world’s population. There cannot be one solution towards professionalising the whole of the continent. It is a sum total of many regions and countries having their own distinct business models</p>
