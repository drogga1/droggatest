<blockquote>
  <p>[Melbourne City defender Manny Muscat claimed Saturday’s dominant 5-1 win over Wellington Phoenix shows his side can deal with end-of-season pressure] Melbourne City is a big club. We strive to the best we can. Last week we were 2-0 down [against Roar] and we showed a bit of spirit and got the draw. We played some good football today and hopefully we can carry it on into next week and the following weeks coming into finals. Pressure-wise, we’ll take it when it comes.<br /><br />It’s always hard to come back to your old stomping ground but today was all about Melbourne City. We came here with a job to do. To get the three points and the way we did it, credit to the boys.<br /><br />[Wellington defensive midfielder Vince Lia called out his team-mates for not sticking to their tasks] We’ve got to watch the video. There were five goals there that we didn’t defend well at all. We’re going to have to look at them and pick apart the game and figure out why we’re not doing our jobs and why things aren’t going right. The second half was poor. We’ll lick our wounds and regroup for next week</p>
