<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Winning Soccer for Girls]</b> Unlike the sports of basketball, badminton, or volleyball, soccer can’t trace its roots back to a specific person, place, or time. In fact, it’s completely likely that a variation of the sport was played in prehistoric times.<br /><br />Generally it’s believed that a game like soccer was played around 400 B.C. in China, and there’s evidence of a similar game that was played in A.D. 300 in Rome. These games, while similar to today’s soccer in the sense that there were goal lines and passing, didn’t have the hand restrictions that today’s game has. <br /><br />During the Middle Ages, adults and children played a form of soccer in the streets of London, but the rules changed depending on who was playing, and so did the size of the game; entire towns participated. These games became so addictive and absorbing that in the 1300s the king of England actually tried to ban the sport because it was interfering with young men’s military training</p>
