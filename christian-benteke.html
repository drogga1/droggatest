  <p><b>[Christian Benteke, who departed Anfield for Selhurst Park last summer, will be determined to give Liverpool a further headache in defence]</b> When the ball is in the air, he is the main threat. We felt it a lot of times here when we trained together. He is in a good run. Like it is always when you play against Zlatan <b>[Ibrahimovic]</b> and these kind of strikers - tall, good with their back to the goal - you have to avoid the crosses and you have to avoid the passes. That’s how it works. If we let them cross 50 balls it’s pretty likely Christian will have a few dangerous headers. That’s not his only strength, of course, but that’s a real strength. You have to avoid passes in this area, but it’s not only for him. If you are only concentrated on Christian then <b>[Wilfried]</b> Zaha and <b>[Andros]</b> Townsend are around you. That’s really one of the best offensive lines in the Premier League. Then they have all the experience and size in their backline. We respect this. We know how to play against it, but nevertheless we have to show it.</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Benteke represents further evidence of Liverpool’s muddled thinking]</b> I wasn’t able to express myself. I almost never played. And despite that, I still scored nine league goals.</p>

  <p><b>[Palace striker Christian Benteke relieved to end 358-day goal drought]</b> I’m really happy and really pleased to get back on the scoresheet. It’s been a tough, tough year for me, first with injury then with having to wait my turn. I’m happy about my performance (at Arsenal) because it’s not just the goal - we work really hard, myself and Wilf up front. We know how hard it is to play against Arsenal, especially when they play at home, so we can be really pleased. I’m not someone who shows emotion, but inside I was really, really happy with myself. I will just keep doing the same that I’ve been doing before when I’ve been scoring and in form. I know that when I’m in form, when I’m 100 per cent fit, I know what I’m capable of doing. It feels good when you play this kind of game, especially against the big teams. We’re not just talking about relegation anymore because we know we’re much better than that.</p>

I understood his decision.<br /><br /><b>[Benteke is keen to return to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and regain the form that saw him star for Villa]</b> I started well in England, I want to finish in style too. I don’t want to run away like a thief in the night. I injured my knee last season and played through pain. I never felt 100% this season</p>

  <p><b>[Quizzed on whether he could have been a success in that side]</b> Yeah. It’s easy to say now because I play for Palace and they play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but when you train every day with the same players and the manager believes in you, it’s easier<br /><br /><b>[Benteke, who was moved on as <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> put his faith in <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>]</b> People will say I’m making excuses, but everyone knows the club was going through a transition when I was there. If you compare the team from when I was there to the current team, I think there are only three, four players still in the first 11, most of them are new<br /><br />I started well, but he <b>[<a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a>]</b> was already under pressure from the previous season because they almost won the league and then <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> came and everything changed. When he came to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> he said: ‘Sorry, I want to play different football I want to have a quick, small, sharp player’. I tried to fight for my spot, but at the end of the season he said: ‘It’s best if you find a new situation too, I won’t hold you up’<br /><br /><b>[The goals have, however, dried up as just one was recorded last season and he is still waiting to open his account for 2019-20]</b> Let me tell you, it’s been the hardest time in my career so far. But I haven’t lost my confidence. It’s more frustration because the thing that I was doing before - scoring goals - I can still do it.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether he could push for a move in January]</b> No. It’s too soon to talk about this. I don’t feel that I finished my job. I can do well here. We’ve only played six games, there’s another 32 to play. A lot of things can happen, that’s the beauty of this game</p>

  <p><b>[Yet to score for <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> this season, but surfing the wave of confidence that comes with scoring twice in a 6-1 victory for his country over Cyprus, Christian Benteke is pondering the possibility of a fresh start elsewhere]</b> Playing for your club is always different from the national team. I hope the Cyprus game will give me my confidence back and give me the chance to score for Palace. But I also have to think about the January transfer window. I will give it some thought and I’ll see what can be done.</p>
