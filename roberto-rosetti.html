  <p>[Will VAR be used in the 2019-20 Champions League?] VAR is not perfect but it will help referees to take correct decisions. Accuracy is definitely more important than speed. Nevertheless, time matters and we want to make reviews as efficient as possible</p>

  <p>[Roberto Rosetti believes the video technology worked well] I am very happy with the way VAR was implemented. The technology worked perfectly, and the refereeing teams performed at a very high level. It showed all the hard work we have put in. As we communicated after the match on UEFA’s social media platforms, the referee identified that the Ajax player was in an offside position and interfering with the goalkeeper preventing him from playing or being able to play the ball - as the header was being made. This was in line with VAR protocol and the goal was correctly overturned and an indirect free-kick given for offside.<br /><br />The most important thing is that the referee took the right decision. Accuracy is more important than speed. Nevertheless we want to be as efficient as possible and we will try to improve this even more in the future. But we have to take into account that this was a very complex situation where the VAR had to check two possible offside situations and the referee also had to consider the interference of the attacking player</p>
