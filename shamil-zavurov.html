  <p><b>[Shamil Zavurov on Islam]</b> First in my heart is my religion, sport the second. If my sporting career was to ever interfere with my religion, then I would leave competing. In the Caucasus, wrestling is a traditional sport. In Dagestan, I started to wrestle when I was about 5-6 years old. In 2003, we began to train and develop skills in combat sambo. My wrestling helped me succeed in Sambo<br /><br />I’m always mentally ready to win; with every fight there is always a possibility of losing but I do my best to mitigate making any potential mistakes. The main difference is time. In Sambo you have 5 minutes to do your job and win. In MMA, you have to calculate and manage the time and the energy you expel. In MMA, you have to work non-stop; it’s more difficult to me<br /><br /><b>[Zavurov defends his title against Sengoku veteran Yasubey Enomoto in St. Petersburg, Russia. Enomoto caught him in a Kimura hold, putting serious pressure on the same arm that was severally damaged against Seydina Seck a year prior. It looked like the end of the fight - but Zavurov refused to yield]</b> When Enomoto had me in that kimura, I felt the support of the crowd - I could hear them yelling ‘Don’t give up!’. I’m glad we put on an amazing show for the crowd. I never even thought about tapping out. There’s no way, I was going to give up. It certainly was in deep but I survived it - as soon as he relaxed a little but I was able to pull my arm out</p>
