  <p><b>[Ex-Arsenal winger Gervinho rolling back the years at Parma after George Weah-like wonder goal]</b> I was nine at the time and we didn’t have a TV in my home in Ivory Coast. It was already enough if there was something to eat. Anyway, Weah’s goal was a masterpiece, although mine against Cagliari, it wasn’t too bad, right?<br /><br />When I saw all the people so happy for my goal. For me, that was the most beautiful gift. Entertaining those who come to see me is my objective<br /><br />I played barefoot. They only gave you boots after three years of training and if you past a certain number of tests. The first was: 50 headers against a wall without letting the ball hit the ground. Then, 50 with your thigh, then your feet, first the right and then the left. The academy at Abidjan was my school of education. At 16, they sent me the boots and jersey with my name on the back. You can imagine how I felt: in the clouds<br /><br /><b>[on Rudi Garcia]</b> Everything I know how to do on the field he taught me. And with Lille, when we won the league and the French Cup in 2011, mamma mia, what fun!<br /><br /><b>[he intends to play his part in putting Parma back among Europe’s elite]</b> Dreaming costs nothing, no?</p>

  <p><b>[Gervinho gets his third person on in this chat with Fabrizio Romano]</b> Everyone thought I went to China to retire and get paid. They thought that I was on vacation for a few years. I had some <b>[knack]</b> problems and that’s why people started to say Gervinho was done. But they were very wrong</p>

  <p><b>[Gervinho on his dream of playing for Arsenal]</b> Many young players tell you that they want to play for Manchester United or Arsenal. My dream was to play for Arsenal and I realised it. When I arrived, I thought: ‘Wow, I’m here!’ . Each of my clubs made an impression on me, but Arsenal was special. When Arsene Wenger called me to tell me that he would like me to come to his club, I don’t think you imagine the satisfaction I felt just after hanging up the phone. Arsenal is an historic club. At the time, it was a club that made a lot of young people dream, with a style of its own and a coach like Wenger who had all of England at his feet. There was not one player who did not like watching Arsenal, with Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and others.<br /><br /><b>[On Arsene Wenger]</b> He will remain one of the great gentlemen I encountered during my career. He taught me a lot. This is someone to whom I owe a lot of respect. It allowed me to realise my dream, and showed all his quality as a manager. He made Arsenal the club it is today<br /><br /><b>[Gervinho returned to Italy in August after his spell in China, joining Parma on a three-year contract]</b> It was time to come back, I think. I still spent two and a half years in China. I wanted to take more pleasure, continue to play in an atmosphere that I like. I really like the atmosphere in Italian football and I think I still have things to do here. We don’t know the rest, but I hope to stay at this level for a few more years. I have good memories of my visit to China. It was a beautiful experience for me. I learned a lot of things. I hope Chinese football is still evolving, that they have the chance to sign other players to develop the league. We did our part of the job by bringing what we had to bring to Chinese football. It is a country that also loved me in other circumstances, I will always wish them the best</p>
