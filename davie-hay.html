  <p>[Celtic legend Davie Hay says <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> will be a sensation for Arsenal] The moment <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> burst onto the scene four years ago as a 17-year-old, which is when he made his debut, and who played as if he was a seasoned pro, I quickly concluded that one day a club from a bigger league, and importantly with a lot of money, would come in with a record bid. It didn’t take long for most of us to realise the Celtic had produced a real gem. The best we’ve seen in a long time. That this was a lad who could play anywhere he wanted. Keeping Tierney a secret was never on the cards. Arsenal bid £10million for him when he was 19. That was knocked back. They were never going to go away forever. Everton had a nibble a year ago. God knows how many other clubs have sent a scout to Celtic Park. KT was always, one day, going to say his goodbye to the club he will always support to go on an adventure<br /><br />Arsenal have done well to get him for £25million and I’m sure most Celtic supporters, while disappointed, understand why one of their own is now an English Premier League player. How good is he? I was fortunate to play with Tommy Gemmell and Danny McGrain. I have no hesitation putting young Kieran in that bracket in terms of the great full-backs produced by Celtic. My guess is that Tierney didn’t want to leave Celtic. There was no banging on Neil Lennon’s door, he didn’t put in a transfer request and never once spoke about playing elsewhere. However, some opportunities are too good for anyone to turn down. Arsenal haven’t won so much in recent times; however, we are talking about a huge club in a fantastic league, and it’s a team which I believe is getting better. I have no fear about Tierney being good enough. He is going to be a sensation</p>
