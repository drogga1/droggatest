  <p><b>[Tammy Abraham remains uncertain where his future lies]</b> If <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> say they need me there, I will put my 100 per cent in.

A team like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is always difficult because they have got world-class players. It is always going to be difficult to bring in youngsters and bring in people like myself - it is a big role. But for me, it is about believing in myself and just keep doing what I do.<br /><br />It looked like I was going to <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> <b>[in January]</b>. I think certain situations happened with <a href="fa.html">the FA</a>, something about playing for three teams in one year or something like that … but the coach spoke to me he said: ‘Listen, stay here, we believe in you, the boys believe in you, the fans believe in you and we’ll get promoted’. I am glad I did. It wasn’t my first choice to come to the Championship, but I don’t look back on it <b>[badly]</b>. It has been a fantastic year for me and the boys as well, and to clinch it off we got promoted<br /><br /><b>[With Villa now a top-tier outfit once more, Abraham admits that he could be tempted back to the club if he is forced to look outside of west London for minutes once more]</b> I love being here. It is a massive club. It is an honour to wear the badge, so I am proud. I just need to enjoy my night with the boys before I think about the future. I have got the <b>[U21]</b> Euros coming up as well so I have to focus on that. You can never say never. You never know what could happen</p>

We just have to build, go into the game on Sunday. Hopefully, get three points.<br /><br />I can’t ask for a better bunch of lads. I just have to push this season and hopefully we can be up there to fight for the title. Yeah we would’ve liked to win today and at United. Still early doors. Still got a long season ahead. Still in big competitions as well. It’s about how we react now. The points on Sunday will be massive for us. I think the fans will be behind us <b>[against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> City]</b>. We’ve given two good performances and they can see that. I believe they’ll be behind us and hopefully, we can give them a performance.</p>

I am ready for it. I have to step up and do what I do best. I’ve spoken to Marcus. <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is someone I’ve always idolised. Hopefully he can be back because he is a player that England definitely need and Marcus as well. They are both great young talents. I’ve watched England on TV <b>[at tournaments]</b> and actually going to the Euros would be a dream come true. But first of all, it’s about knuckling down at Chelsea</p>

  <p><b>[How <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> built the best youth teams since the <a href="matt-busby.html">Busby</a> Babes]</b> My youth career just gave me confidence. Knowing I could score goals - it comes naturally. I just put it into every game I play, take chances and score goals. It helped give me that confidence I show now</p>

  <p><b>[Tammy Abraham admits to having taken inspiration from Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan while watching ‘The Last Dance’ on Netflix]</b> Watching this motivates me and there’s one thing that caught my mind. Michael Jordan lost a game and he made up things in his head about what someone said to him. That person didn’t actually say it but he used that to go into the next game and to drive him on to be the best. The incident did happen against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> where I missed a penalty and received a lot of abuse and for me it’s just like Michael Jordan, it’s about coming out and proving them wrong. It’s about being at this club, being the main man, being the striker. My dad spoke to me at breakfast and he said, ‘I know you’ve watched Michael Jordan and you’re motivated to go back to football. When you’re ready go out there and do the best you can’. I miss football, just miss scoring goals, seeing the fans and being with my team-mates, having a smile on my face. If it’s safe to do so, I want to finish the job. If not, then go into the next season<br /><br />I’ve stayed in good shape. I’m a young lad and I don’t feel I ever lose fitness. If there was a game tomorrow, I’d say I’m ready but I know a 90-minute game is different to going on the bike and doing 20 minutes or 30 minutes outside running. The tempo is different. You need a few sessions<br /><br /><b>[England international Abraham said of a difficult situation]</b> Germany have planned it out well. The coronavirus has not been as big as it’s been in England. I feel they’re going the right way. As players, we’ve just got to be patient and wait for the clubs, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and the government to come to a decision about whether it’s safe for us to do so. We’ll take it on from there. If they bring back <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> then it’s clearly safe enough to do so. If they don’t then it’s clearly not</p>

  <p><b>[Tammy Abraham has expressed his concerns around returning to training during the pandemic due to his father Anthony having asthma]</b> My dad has asthma, so if I was to return to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and, God forbid, I do catch this disease and bring it home, it’s the worst thing possible. The last thing I need is to catch the virus myself or be in contact with anyone with the virus</p>

  <p><b>[Tammy Abraham is aware that he has big boots to fill as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s No.9]</b> When I was at <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a>, I had very few chances and if I didn’t take them I knew that was it. That’s my only chance and I didn’t take it. It was hard to take. That season I lost a lot of confidence, I was beating myself up a lot. It was my first <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> experience and it was tough. We started off playing well and scoring goals but then it got to a stage where there was a lack of chances, we weren’t playing well, losing a lot of games. That was something I had to learn about really quick because it was so different from playing for the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> youth teams<br /><br />I know my abilities and what I’m capable of doing. The next season, my plan was to remain in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but it didn’t happen that way. Thankfully, I went to a good club like <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, I could build that confidence back and do my thing there.<br /><br />In my head, I knew that if I didn’t score then it could be my last starting chance gone. When I scored, the emotions just got to me. I ran over to the manager and I was thinking ‘I’ve just scored my first goal for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>!’. That’s when the confidence started to come back. I scored the winner in that game as well so from there the confidence came back gradually. The <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans started to believe in me and I could kick on. As a striker, you need to believe in yourself and have that confidence. Being <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s number nine, you’ve got big boots to fill so I need to believe that I’m the man, that I can score and do well for the team. You need that feeling going into every game</p>

  <p><b>[Tammy Abraham has revealed that <a href="fikayo-tomori.html">Fikayo Tomori</a> persuaded him to ‘stay on the pitch’ in order to grab his first hat-trick for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> at the start of the season]</b> It was one of those feelings where you score in two consecutive games so you’re not under pressure to score. In my head, I felt there was no pressure. Fikayo had already scored a banger, then my first chance came and I took it. Then there was another one and I scored again, so we were in a great position at half-time. I said to Fikayo, ‘I’m tired, man, I might just tell the manager to replace me’. Fik was like: ‘Stay on the pitch, try and get your hat-trick’ because it was the second game in a row I’d scored two goals. I came out for the second half and then I just remember I was one-on-one with <a href="conor-coady.html">Conor Coady</a> and the confidence that I had inside me took the tiredness away, I did that skill to get away from him and scored. After the game me, Mason and Fikayo were all talking and realising that we’d all just scored for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, so it was crazy and amazing feelings that day.</p>
