<blockquote>
  <p><b>[on <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>]</b> I was with him at Aberdeen between 16 and 23. He has an insatiable appetite to continually climb the next peak. He has a fabulous work-rate and he constantly demands of his players - he constantly demands certain levels of his players and himself.<br /><br />Without doubt there was fear. I certainly feared him in some regards. That was what he wanted to instil. You either climbed the peaks with him or you disappeared. It was a constant test and constant demand. Only now looking back, do I see how rigorous it was.<br /><br />You knew when you were playing badly. At half-time I would look at my boots and hope I wasn’t the one he would be coming for.<br /><br />He is prepared to tell you what he wants and if you are not prepared to deliver he will tell you. There are numerous moments I was on the end of it; I think it was his way of forming us.<br /><br />He was constantly challenging, even in training. He would not accept second best. You have that fear but you also don’t want to let him down. I enjoyed some of the best parts of my career at Aberdeen</p>
