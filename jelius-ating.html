  <p><b>[Sabah Football Association has made the decision to install Jelius Ating as the new man in charge following poor results in the Premier League]</b> The appointments of these former players is testimony to SAFA’s commitment to improve the team’s performance including all three leagues. It is my hope that with these appointments, the State football team can be competitive within the national league.</p>

  <p><b>[Jelius Ating recalls the late David Rocastle’s time in at Sabah and how he was perceived by a star-struck team graced by this former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> man]</b> Before he came, we already heard rumours that he will be joining. We knew that David was a former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> player but not more than that because it was a different time compared to the internet-age that we are in right now. Some of the boys obviously knew more than me because they followed the English league!<br /><br />We only had one season with him but he was someone who was extremely professional. We had other import players before him but he was the first to arrive with such a high-profile. The way he speaks, the way he mixed around during training and in matches was top notch<br /><br />In training, he takes the effort to help, guide and motivate the younger players. Because the game in England was physical, he showed that in training as well. Yet, the harder stuff was left to the actual competitive matches where he really showed how strong he was<br /><br />He wasn’t one who was talkative but it didn’t come across to us as a form of arrogance. It was just his character. Compared to the other import players who came from lower leagues than him, he supported and respected us more than what the others did<br /><br />There was once that the team had to do a centralised training outside of Kota Kinabalu when we had to go to a plantation and he followed us there the entire two weeks. The plantation had a pitch, hall and hostel inside but of course it wasn’t a five star accommodation, and he still did not make a single complaint<br /><br />We went around in Land Rovers, ate at the plantation manager’s home. David joined in with the rest with no special treatment and did not ask for any. He was a great footballer but more than that, he was an incredible human being<br /><br />When he played for us, he had trouble with his ankle, which we knew of course. But he did not let that bother him in games. Still trained well and played well. We weren’t aware of his health problems and it was sad to find out about the news</p>
