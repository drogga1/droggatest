Of the three options we had, <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> was the worst for me, because I have to go back to live in Milan with the kids. But I thought of what was best for him.

  <p><b>[Wanda Nara says Inter will always be <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a>’s priority despite <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> loan move]</b> Inter needed to sell <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a>. As captain, Mauro would never have left the club. It was a strategy to sell him. In January, he refused to transfer to another team. I won’t tell the team’s name. The other player, however, came to Milan, but not to Inter… <b>[<a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a>]</b> replied: ‘I am the captain and I will not leave this team’. That’s when the relationship broke. They had another idea<br /><br /><b>[Despite the rift, Nara claims <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a> still views the <a href="inter-milan.html">Nerazzurri</a> as his preferred <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> home]</b> He likes playing in Italy, he knows the league well. I think he will come back. I don’t know where and how. Inter will always be the priority. <b>[There have been]</b> many misunderstandings, but the desire to play for Inter and the love of the fans remains. There are crises in a long relationship. In the end we leave each other with a repaired relationship, without any betrayal<br /><br /><b>[The ex-Sampdoria star spent almost two months out of Inter’s first team last season before <a href="luciano-spalletti.html">Luciano Spalletti</a> ended the exile in April.

They have everything needed to win, it’s a club full of stars and Mauro is honoured to be part of it. At the end of the season we will choose whatever is best. I work for him; the choices are his</p>

The only thing that interests me is his happiness and he is very happy at PSG<br /><br />I have wonderful memories of <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> and the Interisti. And as I always say, the real heartfelt Interisti know that we have always been on the team’s side. And this choice to go to Paris was also made so as not to betray the <a href="inter-milan.html">Nerazzurri</a>. We left each other without betrayal, Mauro went to a club that he couldn’t say no to and even for Inter it went well</p>

  <p><b>[Wanda Nara is not impressed with <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a>’s impact at <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a>]</b> would be good to see <b>[<a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>]</b> in big games too. He hasn’t scored in the Champions League, he’ll watch the knockout rounds on TV. The last No. 9 only scored about 150 goals for Inter. I think <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> is Inter’s real asset. He makes the difference, he has only played three times with the first-choice midfield he put together at the start. So <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> makes the difference. Then we’ll change our minds week by week. <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> had been criticised after the Champions League, now he is praised like a phenomenon. I am an Inter fan, but I cannot stand the disrespect because we are talking about the former No. 9 and I am right here. I saw a No. 9 that scored 150 goals</p>

The only thing that interests me is his happiness and he is very happy at PSG<br /><br />I feel well in Paris, for the moment we still haven’t spoken with the club. There are still four months until the end of the season. When the season ends in May, we’ll sit down and talk. If I have the chance to stay I would be happy</p>
