  <p><b>[Mauro Icardi’s agent Wanda Nara confident of new Inter Milan contract]</b> I cannot foresee the future, but I can say that we like the project of the Zhang family. They want to grow and get Inter back among the great clubs. In these years we have also remained without the Champions League. It is clear that we would like to achieve that this year. Mauro makes noise on the pitch, where he must make noise. We are all very relaxed about it. We are confident about the renewal and, when I meet the sports director at the stadium, we laugh and joke. I sometimes make the joke: every day that goes by, he is always worth more. But there is serenity in the air, no tension. Will the salary increase? When you renew a contract, it is done to improve the current situation. But we have not yet thought about the conditions and the figures.<br /><br /><b>[Icardi’s working relationship with head coach Luciano Spalletti]</b> It is a healthy relationship, a sincere relationship, as it must be between the captain and the head coach. Mauro loves listening and Spalletti is helping him to grow</p>

  <p><b>[Mauro Icardi has a €110 million release clause at Inter]</b> There are some big clubs ready to pay the release clause, which is very high, but considering the figures that are circulating in football right now and the kind of player Mauro is, it’s not even that remarkable. There are many clubs putting pressure on, but his priority is Inter. There will be a meeting with their director of sport and the priority as of today is to stay here.<br /><br />It irritates me when people underestimate Mauro, as he is wanted by the three best teams in the world. We’ll see what he does with Inter, the situation is he’ll either sign a renewal or leave, but the priority is to remain here and resolve the issue before we can go on vacation</p>

  <p><b>[Agent Wanda explained that Mauro Icardi’s priority was Inter]</b> There has been a lot of nonsense said about Mauro, for example a supposed fine that did not exist. I would like Mauro to be more protected by the team. I cannot understand if these bad things come from outside or within.<br /><br />Why is Icardi not scoring. He has always scored. Lautaro netted thanks to some great movement by Mauro, who was rarely accompanied. Maybe Spalletti should have put Lautaro in earlier. He is taking advantage of the fact that Mauro and Lautaro are friends and that there is no rivalry between them</p>

  <p><b>[Stripping Inter captaincy was like taking one of Mauro Icardi’s legs]</b> Some say the armband is meaningless, but for Mauro it’s like taking away a leg more than an arm. He wears that jersey with such pride and if there were decisions to be made in the past about money or love of the shirt, he always chooses the shirt. I had no warning at all. I am always in contact with Inter, I have them on speed dial, but I only found out about the decision to revoke his captaincy on Twitter. I had a three-hour meeting with people very high up in the club and they never told me anything about it. Mauro scored 120 goals with this jersey and when nobody believed, he was the first to pick up the ball and call everyone forward, because he believes in this team. We are a family of Interisti, whether he is on the field or not.<br /><br /><b>[Saturday]</b> morning I woke up as usual and was driving with the kids to their training session and fortunately the incident occurred in an area where there are security cameras. I was in shock, I called someone at Inter and five minutes later <b>[chief executive Beppe]</b> Marotta called. They were very reassuring and helpful<br /><br />He was very kind and I thank him, because Mauro was so upset. He was in terrible condition. When he’s upset, he clams up and tries to bottle things up, tries to be the strong one. I asked Moratti if he could please help get Mauro to play again, because it means so much to him. It is not our intention to leave Inter, not at all</p>

  <p><b>[Keeping up with the Icardashians!]</b> Icardi’s renewal with Inter is a very long way off. We have not received a satisfactory offer. It is not logical for Mauro to renew on the same salary he receives now - we believe he is at a superior level. We have a very good relationship with the two biggest clubs in Spain who are very interested in Mauro, as well as one in France and one in England.</p>

  <p><b>[Wanda Nara defiant amid Icardi drama]</b> This is a very macho world and what I’m doing is revolutionary. Although there are many relatives who represent players, the role of women in football is more linked to ‘staying at home with the kids and keeping quiet’. That’s why I’m a revolutionary. I have friends who are wives of players and many laugh at me. They see that what I’m doing as strange, but they’ve asked me to represent their husbands because they know me, they know how I act and defend my interests. There is no crisis with Mauro, nor was there one. The stories that have come out are fantasy and very little to do with real life. We’re really happy together. It’s very difficult to be a woman in this macho world, but I have people who respect me. Some people have made things up to destabilise me. They’ve got very far. Mauro gives me courage. He isn’t the macho type and he’s the first to believe in me. I would never speak ill of any relative.<br /><br />The truth is that Mauro has two more years left on his contract with Inter and we’re super happy here. There’s a lot of talk about whether we’ll move or not, but perhaps the press are the ones who are pressing the most. I’ve always said that being Mauro’s representative is easy because he’s a very important player in Europe</p>

Enough of this rubbish! He’s done nothing. It’s all non-existent drama.<br /><br />In football, there are so many injustices, like this penalty, Perisic’s attitude and keeping Icardi at home. He is someone who gave everything to Inter but is now being painted like a monster, which he’s not</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Wanda Nara?]</b> I started first with one of his image contracts, little things, which then developed naturally over time. Mauro had concluded his contract with his attorney and saw that I followed in the footsteps of my sister’s career. I had begun to study law in Argentina but then I gave up. He knows that I know about these types of things. Everyone has always respected me in this field, because they know the role that Mauro has assigned to me.<br /><br />More than giving Mauro a new contract, I’d prefer Inter to sign someone capable of giving him five good balls in every game.<br /><br />Some say the armband is meaningless, but for Mauro it’s like taking away a leg more than an arm</p>

I’m working to make him feel good and make peace with the club. We also chose a lawyer who’s an Inter fan!<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the absence of Icardi for Inter’s 2-0 win over SPAL on Sunday]</b> We saw the match from home, with the family, of course, we wanted to avoid any kind of controversy. Marotta knew we would not go, I talk more with him than with Mauro<br /><br />The knee problem isn’t an invention. He’s taking care of himself 24 hours a day.

He didn’t skip a day and before he always played through pain, to show how much he cares about Inter. As soon as he is able he will come back, there are no problems with the team. We’ve reviewed all the players’ statements and no one has ever spoken ill of Icardi. They say so many things but people confuse me with my husband, what he thinks is not what I think. He never asked for a raise and not it has never been a question of money</p>
