  <p><b>[Christian Bassogog speaks about his success at the CAF Africa Cup of Nations Gabon 2017 and subsequent transfer to Henan Jianye in the Chinese Super League]</b> It’s hard for me to find the words to explain it. Even sometimes when I am going to sleep or when I am waking up, I ask myself: ‘What did I do to be where I am today?’ I am grateful for it but one of the things I know is that I still don’t believe it</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Bassogog has insisted that Cameroon cannot afford to spill against Nigeria in their quest to claim a place in next year’s Fifa World Cup]</b> Nigeria are a strong team. They have very good players and many of them are playing in Europe. But we must defeat them if we are to maintain our qualifying hopes. We should take the game to them. We need to fight to defeat them.<br /><br /><b>[On Hugo Broos]</b> Our players are young, but we are strong as a team. He is a good coach. He knows what the players are good at so he can get the best out of us. In this team, everyone has his chance. These are matches I want to win. We are not in an ideal position but these are qualifying games for the World Cup. I will do my utmost to help our team</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Bassogog has revealed his love for Arsenal]</b> Yes, it’s still a dream for me to come back to Europe. I would like to play in the biggest league in the world, in the Premier League. My favourite club since I was very small is Arsenal. I like playing with the ball and this club suits me. When I was a child, Thierry Henry was a model for me. It’s someone who impressed me a lot.<br /><br /><b>[Bassogog also spoke about Cameroon’s appointment of Patrick Kluivert and Clarence Seedorf as coaches]</b> From a personal point of view, I think it’s a very good thing. These are two great legends. They will motivate young players to surpass themselves. Their work will pay with time, so don’t judge now. As Cameroonians, we want results now but it takes time. What this duo has to transmit to us is a new rigour. because today observers say that we have lost this concentration. From inside, I assure you that what they will allow the team to move on the right track<br /><br />Few people know this but <b>[Samuel Eto’o]</b> is someone who inspired me because we left the same neighbourhood in Douala. He lives and breathes just for this sport. He gave a lot of happiness to Cameroon. This is an example for me and the nation. I don’t have words to describe this man</p>
