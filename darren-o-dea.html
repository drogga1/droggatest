<blockquote>
  <p><b>[<a href="damien-duff.html">Damien Duff</a> makes big leap from fan pariah to Irish messiah]</b> Duffer is a fantastic coach. He’s an iconic figure in football and everyone knows his reputation as a player. People respect him for that, but the biggest compliment I can give him is that his coaching has overtaken it. At the club, he is judged solely as a coach and that’s how I look at him. I listen to him not because of the career he had, but because of the coach he has become.<br /><br />I’m blessed that I can look above and below me at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> and there are coaches with a wealth of experience. Damien is another part of that and has done fantastically well and is loved by everyone as a coach<br /><br />He’s one of the most driven people I know and he wants to prove himself. He was part of Shamrock Rovers and learned the ropes there. The type of person he is and the player he was, he’s not one to cut corners. For all his talent, his worth ethic and professionalism was always second to none and that hasn’t changed</p>
