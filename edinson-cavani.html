  <p><b>[Edinson Cavani tells about what helps him have an eye for goal]</b> Fishing gives me peace, tranquility. And also, as a forward player, it helps me, with my eyes. You have to wait for the moment to attack to catch the fish. And in football my position is basically the same. You have to wait for the precise moment to attack. I wait for the fish to catch them</p>

  <p><b>[Edinson Cavani on team-mate Kylian Mbappe]</b> I believe there are some who are born with talent, who have been touched by God’s magic wand and who have class from a young age. And then there are other players who make it with lots of work. Both can turn out to be stars, but with different paths. <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>, for example, is a player who has an enormous potential and who is acquiring experience</p>

  <p><b>[Edinson Cavani thinks Neymar can grow as a person after a summer spent in the limelight and believes he still has a lot to offer at Paris Saint-Germain]</b> I hope that everything that has happened to him will give him the experience to grow as an individual. I think he still has a lot to give PSG, until the last day he is here as a player. He has a lot to give to football as well<br /><br />Playing with great players like him, like Kylian Mbappe, I really enjoy it. Now it’s time to find the connection between us, to create a good team, a good working atmosphere of work, sacrifice and professionalism<br /><br /><b>[Later in the season, Neymar was booed by some PSG fans after taking another penalty. 7-0 up and with the Brazilian already having a hat-trick under his belt, Cavani was only one goal from breaking the club’s all-time scoring record. Once again, Neymar took and scored the spot-kick]</b> A lot of things have been said about us. It’s true that we had some differences in the first few months after his arrival, but it’s good to come together and talk it over. After that, the social networks, the external communication… it has been exaggerated, a lot of things have been said that aren’t true</p>

  <p><b>[Edinson Cavani says he is fully focused on the season ahead at Paris Saint-Germain]</b> I already spoke about this last season and I promised, not only to the fans but also to myself, that I wanted to finish my contract here. My decision might be that I go back home to Uruguay but I’ve promised myself that I will finish this contract. That’s a certainty. And then football doesn’t always depend just on you; there’s the will of the club, the supporters<br /><br /><b>[It has been suggested PSG could look to offer Cavani a new contract]</b> Honestly, I’m not even thinking about it. We haven’t even talked about it with the club. PSG had a bit of a difficult time at the end of last season, but everything is now being put in order. Maybe we could discuss it afterwards. I’m relaxed, whether I’m staying or not staying after the end of my contract. The only thing I know is that, like since the first day I arrived in Paris, I’m going to give everything for this shirt, this club, this city. After six years here, it’s like home, like my family. Until the very last moment, I’ll give everything</p>

We take positives from our performance and the fact that we were able to score two goals. We still need to improve, but it’s good to end the year like this</p>
