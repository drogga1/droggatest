  <p><b>[Edinson Cavani has said he wants to sign a new contract with Paris Saint-Germain]</b> My stats are good. But this is not what concerns me most. What interests me is that PSG can win and be champions. I want to stay in Paris. I am doing very well here and I love this city so I think all conditions will be there to extend. I had a meeting with the president and I hope that it will happen.<br /><br />We do very good things. There are some things that we can improve, but it is a PSG that is more dynamic, more conquering than last season</p>

  <p><b>[PSG forward Edinson Cavani believes that anyone can win the Champions League]</b> Winning the Champions League depends on many things. Only one team gets to win it, and in football, you never know. Even if a team has the best players, it doesn’t mean they will always win. See for example Atletico Madrid or Juventus, a very agressive team, that didn’t seem to have a chance against the other with the best players of the world, but ​they got to the finals. I wish this year we win the Champions League, but if not, we will continue working hard to achieve that big goal.<br /><br />One of the reasons that helped me make the decision to want to stay at PSG are the goals of the club. The team is growing and aims to be a big team, win big things, and become one of the best teams on the world. They are doing great work, and I appreciate that. All those objectives are appealing to me, and make me want to stay. I’d like to accomplish the goals with them and give the best I have. To stay and to be able to live that is special. That’s the first thing I thought when I got to PSG and this beautiful city</p>

  <p><b>[Edinson Cavani admits that his career peaked in 2011, as Uruguay won the Copa America]</b> This is not the best time in my career. The best year was 2011, when we won Copa America. In Uruguay everyone breathes football since childhood. That makes you very passionate, then when you get onto the field you feel it. You can see players with so much passion and you know they’ve done it since they were boys. They love the team and they give it all for the others beside them.<br /><br /><b>[Cavani, who has scored a total of 37 goals for his country, has already set his sights on the tournament in Russia]</b> Some people see the ​table and get crazy. Look at Uruguay’s position! I think there’s a reason for that position. Sometimes it’s difficult to get around the idea that we do have good players and great fans, and that’s what got us where we are. It’s definitely not by chance. We have some key matches ahead, and against Brazil we have to give it all and work our socks off to earn the 3 points.​ The players and the whole team, we have the same dream for 2017: qualify for the World Cup. For that we will fight, and we want to get it</p>

  <p><b>[Edinson Cavani tells about what helps him have an eye for goal]</b> Fishing gives me peace, tranquility. And also, as a forward player, it helps me, with my eyes. You have to wait for the moment to attack to catch the fish. And in football my position is basically the same. You have to wait for the precise moment to attack. I wait for the fish to catch them</p>

  <p><b>[Cavani reveals what Kylian Mbappe needs to become world class]</b> I believe there are some who are born with talent, who have been touched by God’s magic wand and who have class from a young age. And then there are other players who make it with lots of work. Both can turn out to be stars, but with different paths. Mbappe, for example, is a player who has an enormous potential and who is acquiring experience. He’s already a worldwide figure, but it’s up to him to be more and more. He is very young, even though he is recognised around the globe. To be a world-class name you can’t just be a great player, but you also need to have personality and a certain behaviour and education. That’s how you make it. That’s the footballing life.<br /><br />I believe a history and a myth has been created around the Champions League. Obviously, it is the best competition, but for me the league is very important. It’s the result of a whole year of work. This legend of the Champions League makes supporters and players who come to Paris very excited. But I don’t believe that a club like PSG, which is growing despite the big signings, has this need to win the Champions League, no matter what</p>

I would like to see Premier League teams play in Ligue 1 so we could see how good they are. I wouldn’t disparage the French league, as France are the current world champions and many of their players play in Ligue 1. French teams have been playing in the later stages of the Champions League in the last few years. So I just think, this is football. It is what it is.</p>
