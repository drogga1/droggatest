  <p><b>[New Adelaide United midfielder Kim Jae-sung has revealed he had two main reasons for joining the A-League club after 11 years playing in South Korea]</b> As a player, I think I have achieved a lot. I’ve been to the 2010 World Cup and been a national team player for my country, won championships, won the <b>[AFC]</b> Champions League with my club in Korea. So I felt like I had achieved everything I could football-wise, but there was just one challenge I always had - and a dream I had - and that was to play overseas. To be able to achieve that goal in this late period of my career, it’s just been an honour.<br /><br />One of the main reasons for joining Adelaide was to be able to play in the Champions League with this club, and coincidentally we’re in the same group as my old club - Jeju United - so it’s going to be weird. It’s going to be a different experience but, for me, no matter which club I play for I’m out there to win</p>

  <p><b>[Adelaide United midfielder Kim Jae-sung hopes to stay with the A-League club next season]</b> Adelaide are having a slow season with less victories than expected with only six victories. After I joined I was part of four victories from the total six. Every time we win is a memorable moment. I want to always be of help to my team which is why I joined. I was hoping to be a positive influence to the team and a victory is the most exact proof of my role. It always makes me happy when I hear Adelaide fans tell me to stay in the team after the season is over and to be part of the team until next year. I would like to be part of the team next season as well.<br /><br />Adelaide is a very quiet and cosy city with people who are easy going and this is making a difference with reducing my stress levels. When I go to the team, I concentrate only on the training but on my spare time I am enjoying my time with my wife by visiting the many parks and enjoying the amazing weather<br /><br />It all happened very quickly. As soon as I saw that I scored I considered in doing a celebration and my body was reacting to it but at the same time my mind completely controlled my actions. This was the right thing to do. My team-mates were running towards me and were celebrating but I couldn’t react</p>
