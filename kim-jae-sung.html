<blockquote>
  <p>[New Adelaide United midfielder Kim Jae-sung has revealed he had two main reasons for joining the A-League club after 11 years playing in South Korea] As a player, I think I have achieved a lot. I’ve been to the 2010 World Cup and been a national team player for my country, won championships, won the [AFC] Champions League with my club in Korea. So I felt like I had achieved everything I could football-wise, but there was just one challenge I always had - and a dream I had - and that was to play overseas. To be able to achieve that goal in this late period of my career, it’s just been an honour.<br /><br />One of the main reasons for joining Adelaide was to be able to play in the Champions League with this club, and coincidentally we’re in the same group as my old club - Jeju United - so it’s going to be weird. It’s going to be a different experience but, for me, no matter which club I play for I’m out there to win</p>
