  <p><b>[Wigan made it nine matches unbeaten, and seven clean sheets in a row, with a 3-0 thumping of Championship strugglers Stoke]</b> That was an absolute top-class performance from us tonight. The only disappointment possibly was that it was only 1-0 at half-time. We created clear-cut chances, we dominated possession, and our appetite for work when we didn’t have the ball was so impressive. It was as good as I’ve seen us play for a long time, and I’m really delighted for all the players. I could go right through the team with compliments, but it was just a really special performance from a very good group of players</p>

  <p><b>[Wigan boss Paul Cook sends defiant message after club’s shock slide into administration]</b> From all the staff and players, we thank them so much for what they’re doing. We see all the messages of support; the good wishes that they’re feeling. Today was a tough day for us; travelling down with everything that’s gone on. We’re aware of all the positive energy at Wigan. The only thing I can guarantee the supporters is that we won’t be lying down and just fading away. We’ve got a massive game against QPR at the DW Stadium on Wednesday. I guarantee the supporters - I give them my word - we will lift these players the best way we can. And we will fight until someone says its mathematically impossible to stay in the league. At the moment there is a realistic chance that we can. So the appreciation from the staff and the players in abundance to the supporters. We know they’ll always be there for Wigan Athletic. We appreciate it so much<br /><br />My message from the staff and the players is that we had a bad day today. It was a flat performance. Credit to Brentford. They’re a good side. It was always going to be difficult. But we’ll pick ourselves up for the last five games and we’ll do our best to make the supporters proud of us - that’s for sure</p>

  <p><b>[Said Benrahma grabbed a hat-trick as Brentford kept up their bid for automatic promotion with a 3-0 victory over crisis club Wigan]</b> As you can imagine, today was a tough day for us. Travelling down with everything that’s going on, we’re aware of everything with all of the positive energy at the club. The one thing we can all guarantee to the supporters is that we will not be lying down and fading away. At the moment there’s a realistic chance that we can stay in the league. My message from the game itself is that we had a bad day today. It was a flat performance and disappointing, but credit to Brentford because they’re a really good side. We’ll pick ourselves up for the last five games and we’ll do our best to make you proud of us.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Cook says his players will not be lying down as he thanked fans for their support]</b> This points deduction should be stopped and postponed until every avenue has been investigated before we get this deduction put in place. We will put our hands up if it’s our fault. The administrators have said is a well-run, financially viable football club with no creditors. This club should not be in administration</p>

  <p><b>[Wigan’s hopes of avoiding the drop were boosted as Kieffer Moore’s first-half strike earned the beleaguered Championship outfit a 1-0 win over QPR at a rain-soaked DW Stadium]</b> We were flat on Saturday - we are not as flat as the people who have been made unemployed. We had to win for them tonight, for Wigan Athletic and the town, and we did that. For whatever I feel, for how much sleep I don’t get, for the worst, toughest week of my football career by far, to see what goes on to other people makes my job even worse.<br /><br />People have written us off, the 12 points but we’re still fighting. We’re not going to get ahead of ourselves. We are not stupid, we have a real big mountain to climb. We are in administration, it’s a 12-point deduction. I just hope the EFL hand
punishments out for other clubs that have been breaking the rules.<br /><br />At the minute we’re accepting it, if that’s going to be the case. But we’ve still got plenty of fight in us. None of us know the future but one thing I do know, this club must be here for a long, long time.</p>

  <p><b>[Wigan scored seven goals in an incredible first half as they thrashed fellow Championship relegation battlers Hull 8-0 at the DW Stadium]</b> Of course I’m delighted but I’ve also got sympathy for Grant and Hull. It’s great for us to win as we have, but management is tough at the minute and I’ve got a little bit of feelings for them, because it’s very tough to be on (the end of) a scoreline like that<br /><br />The players deserve so much credit but there is two big games to go. We’re climbing a mountain but we’re not at the top. We’re very proud of our supporters and the town, to raise the money and give us the support they have, and I think tonight we’ve gone a long way towards repaying that.<br /><br />Can we go the extra yard to give them that full satisfaction of overturning possibly a 12-point deduction? We have to keep believing we can</p>
