  <p><b>[Alphonso Davies’ former youth coach says the Canadian star has everything it takes to not only thrive in Germany]</b> I believe that he will inspire a whole generation. Guys who are five, six or seven years old today will say in ten years, ‘I want to be Alphonso Davies’. I really believe that. He will not let up in the next two or three years. He will prevail at Bayern Munich and be there, in a few years, a superstar or maybe move on to another big club.<br /><br />Every boy wants to be Messi, but Messi is unique in his playing style. Alphonso may be half Messi, half Ronaldo. I would say that it resembles Kylian Mbappe, because of the power and the speed. Or earlier Thierry Henry. Let’s see how it develops over the next few years<br /><br /><b>[The 18-year-old recently traveled to Munich]</b> I remember telling our youth coach that Alphonso would play in the first team in two years. I was completely wrong, everything went much faster. We knew relatively soon that Alphonso would attract interest. To be honest, I am so glad that it has become FC Bayern. I am firmly convinced that FC Bayern is exactly the right club at the right time for Alphonso. The situation is just perfect for him. Bayern has made clear from the beginning what they intend to do with Alphonso. They want to develop him further, but they also want to give it equal deployment time in the first team. Alphonso has to play, that’s crucial. And he still has to face new challenges. I am sure that he will grow and be successful in Munich</p>
