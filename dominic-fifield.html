  <p>José <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> accused <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> of trying to humiliate him as he endured his worst defeat in English football on his return to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, and tensions spilled over into the tunnel post-match as back-room staff members of both clubs clashed. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> conceded after just 30 seconds to Pedro Rodríguez and succumbed 4-0 at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>, potentially losing their centre-half Eric Bailly<br /><br /><a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>, speaking in Italian, appeared to tell <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> he should behave like that ‘at 1-0, not at 4-0’, and suggested he had actually been seeking to humiliate him in front of his former fans. <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> denied that had been his motivation, explaining post‑match that he had simply been seeking to generate a positive reaction from the crowd after his team’s most impressive performance to date under his stewardship. However, when a member of the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> coaching staff ignored <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>’s outstretched hand as they turned to retreat down the tunnel, it provoked a heated argument with a member of the Italian’s own back-room team<br /><br /><a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> had regularly called upon the crowd at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> to be more raucous in his second spell at the club, which ended with his dismissal in December 2015 when his ailing team were hovering a point above the relegation zone</p>
