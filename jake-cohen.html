  <p><b>[Esteemed sports lawyer Jake Cohen explains how discussions around release clauses are usually mapped out]</b> In football, we generally see two types of release clauses: actual release clauses, and what are called ‘good faith’ release clauses.<br /><br />Actual release clauses will oblige the player’s club to sell the player to a club who meets the terms and conditions specified in the clause. These terms and conditions can vary, but clubs will often try to structure it in way that will prevent a direct competitor from activating the clause.<br /><br />For example, a Premier League club may disqualify other English top-flight clubs from activating the clause. Also, Portuguese sides tend to set the triggering amount for clubs in their division at triple or even quadruple the amount set for all others.<br /><br />Release clauses can also include terms and conditions which may cause the the triggering amount to fluctuate. For example, if the club is relegated or fails to meet a performance condition, the triggering amount may be reduced. Alternatively, the triggering amount may increase based on performance conditions or simply based on subsequent contract years.<br /><br />A ‘good faith’ release clause is essentially meaningless, as it merely obliges the player’s club to consider the bid and enter into good faith discussions over the potential sale of the player. An example of a ‘good faith’ release clause was with Luis Suarez.<br /><br />When Arsenal offered Liverpool more than £40m <b>[specifically, £1 more]</b> for Suarez in August 2013, this did not place Liverpool under any obligation to sell the Uruguayan to the Gunners<br /><br />Can will likely be able to exert substantial leverage in negotiations with Liverpool. Generally, the time left on a top player’s existing contract directly correlates to the amount of leverage the player will be able to exert in negotiations.<br /><br />As the player’s contract winds down, his leverage will increase, as his value as an asset to the club will depreciate, and there is always a risk that the player will play out his contract.<br /><br />Furthermore, if the midfielder does decide to leave on a free transfer, Liverpool will not be entitled to a compensation fee set by the PFCC, as he will have turned 24 by the time his contract expires in June.<br /><br />In Can’s case, if a suitor would otherwise be willing to pay a substantial transfer fee for his services and then sign him to a long-term contract, it follows that if that same suitor could sign Can on a free transfer, it would be willing to divert some portion of the transfer fee it would have otherwise had to pay to Liverpool into the player’s personal compensation package.<br /><br />This is a strong position to be negotiating from</p>
