  <p><b>[Simon Jordan has been left unimpressed by the efforts of those at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> to prise a top talent away from rivals at Selhurst Park]</b> This is a liberty. As much as a £40m transfer becomes a liberty, this is a liberty. You’ve got <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> trading on a currency of trying to create division between the player and the football club. If you want to buy a player like <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> … if <b>[Riyad]</b> <a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Mahrez</a> can go to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> for £60m, then <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> can go for £60m to £80m to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. If they can’t afford him, they can’t afford him</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Jordan on Daniel Sturridge]</b> Not in any parallel universe would I sign <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Daniel Sturridge</a>. Not for me. I wouldn’t even give him a pay-as-you-play deal. I wouldn’t want <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Sturridge</a> in my dressing room or at my training ground around younger players. He’s a very, very, very talented footballer but he’s a divisive influence. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> has never had him since day one he arrived at Liverpool<br /><br />I think the conventional wisdom in the game is that <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Daniel Sturridge</a> is a troubled, problem player</p>

  <p><b>[Former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> appears to be becoming more and more arrogant]</b> I’ve noticed a slight change in <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, in the language and robustness of his position. I thought his post-match interview <b>[after Saturday’s <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> game]</b> was very brusque and irritable, and I know that journalists can drive you mad with ridiculous questions, in his explanation of Salah and what happened to him.<br /><br />I didn’t see him complain about what <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> had done to molest a player by dragging his studs down the back of his Achilles. He was very aggressive and on the front foot about what happened to Salah. I’m just wondering, part and parcel of the appeal of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> that’s gotten him away with certain things over the last two-and-a-half years – before he won the Champions League he was a perennial final loser for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> – and I’m now looking at him thinking, ‘you have now won something for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, are you changing your demeanour?’. There was a mesmeric million dollar smile that brought all aspects of the media to be a universal admirer of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>. But is he changing? Is he becoming infected by this disease of arrogance that lots of football managers get?</p>
