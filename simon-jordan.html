  <p><b>[Wilfried Zaha has been valued at £70 million by former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan]</b> I think Wilfried Zaha is a £50 million to £70 million player in this market place. Given the inflated market place, given his age, given the fact he’s performed at such a level in a side this season which hasn’t been great. If you put him in a side that has some real balance and poise about it, you’d only get more from him. I think £50m would be the lowest he should go for. I think he’ll go for nearer £70m.</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Jordan says Wilfried Zaha is every bit as good as Riyad Mahrez and worth £60 million]</b> Without wanting to alienate myself from a group of fans I adore, I think now is the time for Zaha to go. I think Palace need a change of direction and probably need to be able to rebuild with the right amount of monies being achieved for Zaha. Now, I don’t think that right amount of monies is likely to be £80m, but I certainly think it’s in the £50m or £60m bracket and I think he can play for any of the top-six clubs. I think he’s a £60m player - I think he’s every bit as good as Mahrez. He hasn’t played in sides quite as fashionable, because Leicester won the league when Mahrez was in his pomp and now he is at Manchester City, while Wilfried has played at Crystal Palace. So I’m not surprised now Wilf wants the opportunity to ply his trade somewhere else<br /><br />When he signed a contract, my mindset was that it’s merely Crystal Palace maintaining the value and negotiation for in a year’s time. If they’ve got Wilfried on a four or five-year contract there can be no leverage that any football club can put on them to be able to get this player for a fraction of his worth. So I’m not surprised we are now at the point where Wilfried is making his intentions very clear</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Jordan has been left unimpressed by the efforts of those at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> to prise a top talent away from rivals at <a href="crystal-palace.html">Selhurst Park</a>]</b> This is a liberty. As much as a £40m transfer becomes a liberty, this is a liberty. You’ve got <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> trading on a currency of trying to create division between the player and the football club. If you want to buy a player like <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> … if <b>[Riyad]</b> <a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Mahrez</a> can go to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> for £60m, then <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> can go for £60m to £80m to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. If they can’t afford him, they can’t afford him</p>

  <p><b>[Simon Jordan on <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Daniel Sturridge</a>]</b> Not in any parallel universe would I sign <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Daniel Sturridge</a>. Not for me. I wouldn’t even give him a pay-as-you-play deal. I wouldn’t want <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Sturridge</a> in my dressing room or at my training ground around younger players. He’s a very, very, very talented footballer but he’s a divisive influence. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> has never had him since day one he arrived at Liverpool<br /><br />I think the conventional wisdom in the game is that <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Daniel Sturridge</a> is a troubled, problem player</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> chairman Simon Jordan says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> appears to be becoming more and more arrogant]</b> I’ve noticed a slight change in <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, in the language and robustness of his position. I thought his post-match interview <b>[after Saturday’s <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> game]</b> was very brusque and irritable, and I know that journalists can drive you mad with ridiculous questions, in his explanation of <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and what happened to him.<br /><br />I didn’t see him complain about what <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> had done to molest a player by dragging his studs down the back of his Achilles. He was very aggressive and on the front foot about what happened to <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>. I’m just wondering, part and parcel of the appeal of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> that’s gotten him away with certain things over the last two-and-a-half years - before he won the Champions League he was a perennial final loser for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - and I’m now looking at him thinking, ‘you have now won something for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, are you changing your demeanour?’. There was a mesmeric million dollar smile that brought all aspects of the media to be a universal admirer of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>. But is he changing? Is he becoming infected by this disease of arrogance that lots of football managers get?</p>
