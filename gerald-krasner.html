  <p><b>[Wigan enter administration; EFL to hand club 12-point penalty]</b> Our immediate objectives are to ensure the club completes all its fixtures this season and to urgently find interested parties to save Wigan Athletic FC and the jobs of the people who work for the club. Wigan Athletic has been a focal point and source of pride for the town since 1932 and anyone who is interested in buying this historic sporting institution should contact the joint administrators directly</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Wigan Athletic appeal 12-point deduction; Wigan Warriors intend to bid for football club]</b> I can tell you all that the initial appeal has already been made by our solicitors and we have until Friday this week to put in a substantive defence as to why the 12 points should not be deducted<br /><br />That will be done on time. It will cost the club/the administrators costs they have to be incurred. I’m not giving any guarantees that the penalty won’t be imposed by the Football League in accordance with their regulations. But we are taking all steps possible to either avoid it or at least minimise it.<br /><br />You should also be aware that there is a second potential points deduction if creditors are not paid 25p in the pound under what’s known as a CVA, which is a Company Voluntary Arrangement, or informally it can be done by the administrators. That is going to cost quite a bit of money and the penalty can be 15 points next season. <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> had that penalty imposed a number of years ago when they were in administration. Once again, I am giving no guarantees but we are working on a strategy how to deal with this problem if we have a successful sale. I want to see the club going forward without any points deduction next season if at all possible.</p>
