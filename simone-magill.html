  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s Simone Magill keeping positive during coronavirus pandemic]</b> Obviously, we’re used to being busy every single day playing football and that’s all stopped now. For the people in the community, watching football and going to football, even if they play as well, that’s stopped for them too. If by us <b>[players]</b> picking up the phone and phoning various people in the community, checking in, can make them smile in this difficult time, then we’re going to do it, aren’t we?<br /><br />This time has maybe shown the things that we did take for granted. We’re in this situation now and it does make you realise how blessed we are to have various people around us, to be a part of the team and be a part of a club that really cares about the people involved. It has really brought through and shown us exactly how grateful we should be<br /><br />It is weird, not that I really go over too often. I would only really get the opportunity to go across when we have an international camp or whatever. But now that’s kind of stopped and there’s the uncertainty around it, not knowing when I’ll get that opportunity <b>[to go home]</b> again, it’s really weird. It’s just the unknown really. To try and combat that is difficult because you’ve no idea when we’re going to be out of this situation. For now, it’s the best thing to do, you’ve just kind of got to sit tight and just take it day by day really. I’m on FaceTime quite regularly, just trying to keep up. My brother and his wife are expecting a child which makes it even harder, because during this time I would obviously be trying to get home to meet the new-born. Obviously, it’s quite difficult, but hopefully everything is well with the baby, everyone is healthy. When I can, I’ll get across and hopefully get to meet the little one<br /><br />We’ve obviously all been given our individual programmes to be cracking on with and we report back every day with what we’re doing and how things have been going. The club have been really good. We’re doing other things as well just to get us socially interactive. We’re doing quizzes every week and little things like that to kind of keep us all chatting and interacting with each other. It’s been making the best out of the situation that we’re in really. As far as that’s gone, I think they’re doing really, really well<br /><br />It’s quite refreshing to know that if you do need to speak to anybody, all we have to do is pick up the phone and somebody is always there<br /><br /><b>[The forward herself has her own form of therapy at home though, on hand to help her through this time]</b> As frustrating as <b>[this time]</b> is for humans, it’s amazing for the dog</p>
