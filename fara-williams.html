  <p><b>[Phil Neville urging top Premier League clubs to stage women’s matches at their home stadiums]</b> If you had asked me five years ago whether the game would be in the place where it is now, I would definitely have said no. It’s fantastic to see the growth, both in participation levels and media coverage, as well as with the sponsorship deals that are coming into the women’s game now. Signing a multi-million pound deal with Barclays to sponsor the Women’s Super League was evidence that the women’s game is on the up and big companies want to be involved. Now we should look to start playing women’s matches in the big Premier League grounds. Phil Neville is right about that and hopefully someone of his stature saying that will make it happen. Look at the attendances in the last few weeks and there have been some incredible sights. We have seen a match between Atletico Madrid v Barcelona played in front of a crowd in excess of 60,000, Lyon had a big crowd for their Champions League game against Wolfsburg and Juventus sold out their stadium for a women’s game. It would be great to see Chelsea’s women’s team playing a game at Stamford Bridge or Tottenham playing at their new stadium. It feels like the women’s game is ready for that now<br /><br />Seeing Alex and Rachel involved as pundits in the men’s game proves that doors are opening and there are opportunities for women to get involved in the game in areas we have not seen before. They knew there would be some people who didn’t want them there and would not be shy in letting them know about it, but Alex and Rachel were willing to step forward and they were brave to do that. They are being hired to give their expertise on the game, from their perspective as ex-players. Their gender, the colour of their skin, their sexuality is not a factor when you are being a football pundit and that is where we want to get to. They are putting themselves in that high-profile position and have to be ready to deal with everything that goes with it. That is equality. We need everyone to be labelled as pundits and not have a star next to their name to make them different if they are male or female. When that happens, we will have had a big breakthrough. This is an environment that has been male-only so far, so some barriers are being broken down. You need to be brave, to be a strong person and be willing to accept criticism</p>

  <p><b>[Reading striker and England icon Fara Williams believes that the appointment a female coach at a big-name club side will happen at some point in the near future]</b> I think there will be a female coach in a men’s club team one day, as long as they are good enough. I wouldn’t want to see a female coach take a job just to say that there is one now in the men’s game. I think <a href="emma-hayes.html">Emma Hayes</a> is a fantastic manager and coach. She has proved that. If she gets an opportunity and wants to apply for one, then I would say she is as good as anyone else</p>

  <p><b>[Neville, who was due to lead hosts England at the European Championships prior to its postponement to 2022, revealed he always intended to use the position to gain experience and then ‘cut his teeth’ at a club]</b> The comments … I was disappointed with <b>[them]</b>. The fact that you can come out and say you was using our national team as a stepping stone, that disappointed me. I was hurt by those comments. I am no longer with that squad but I certainly know what it means to me to play for England. I know what it means for the girls there currently, staff that are there currently <b>[and]</b> that were there before. Comments like that are not needed in my opinion. I think he could have probably handled that, or the comments could have been made a little bit better. I just think it shows a little lack of respect for our game and, as I say, where it was and where we are trying to get it to</p>
