  <p><b>[Reading striker and England icon Fara Williams believes that the appointment a female coach at a big-name club side will happen at some point in the near future]</b> I think there will be a female coach in a men’s club team one day, as long as they are good enough. I wouldn’t want to see a female coach take a job just to say that there is one now in the men’s game. I think <a href="emma-hayes.html">Emma Hayes</a> is a fantastic manager and coach. She has proved that. If she gets an opportunity and wants to apply for one, then I would say she is as good as anyone else</p>

  <p><b>[Neville, who was due to lead hosts England at the European Championships prior to its postponement to 2022, revealed he always intended to use the position to gain experience and then ‘cut his teeth’ at a club]</b> The comments … I was disappointed with <b>[them]</b>. The fact that you can come out and say you was using our national team as a stepping stone, that disappointed me. I was hurt by those comments. I am no longer with that squad but I certainly know what it means to me to play for England. I know what it means for the girls there currently, staff that are there currently <b>[and]</b> that were there before. Comments like that are not needed in my opinion. I think he could have probably handled that, or the comments could have been made a little bit better. I just think it shows a little lack of respect for our game and, as I say, where it was and where we are trying to get it to</p>
