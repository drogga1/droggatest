<blockquote>
  <p>[Time is what Malaysia U19 set up needs] I agree with Hodak, because we are not entirely sure of the other teams’ strengths. For this tournament, we are simply there to do our best. We have had limited time; only two weeks for preparations, and we spent one whole week just to identify the 23 players to be taken to Yangon. We had only 10 training sessions to form a team and to work on tactics, and it would be unfair for a lofty target to be set simply on the back of the 10-day preparations. The real target is the 2018 AFC U-19 Championship qualification in South Korea in October.<br /><br />We the coaching staff admit that more than half of the players have never been exposed to matches at a higher level, they have only played in the Youth Cup, and that is only for a limited number of matches. That is not enough exposure for them to play at the international level. FAM must give us time to work on the team, but Hodak too must be given opportunity to form the team<br /><br />What I mean is in terms of exposure, such as playing in friendlies overseas so that the boys are constantly exposed to competitive matches. From my observation, the boys lack match exposure. They have good speed and technique, but they don’t know, for example the right time to attack, when to slow down the tempo. These aspects matter in football and the boys need to work on them so they are familiar</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Hairuddin Omar reveals reasons behind Malaysia U18’s exceptional form] Bojan earlier spoke about the boys’ lack of tactical knowledge as well as the short time had to prepare for the tournament, and he meant it. But he made up for it by instilling a winning mentality in the team, to spark that desire to win among the boys. And we the coaching staff also made sure we do our homework. Before each match we would attend the match involving our coming opponents, note down their weaknesses and focus on them in the match<br /><br />Honestly, I’m surprised at how well they have been able to follow Bojan’s instructions in the matches, in light of the insufficient preparation time. They’ve shown the character needed to win matches. A lot of players are good technically, but they lack the desire to win matches. But not these boys. I can say that despite what everyone has been saying, I can’t pinpoint the squad key players yet, simply because how good almost all of them are. All 23 have a shot at being picked for matches. And the string of wins have further improved boosted their confidence, and they now have the belief they can make it to the final</p>
