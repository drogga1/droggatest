  <p>[Kevin Thelwell has denied that Jorge Mendes is to thank for the club’s promotion to the Premier League] Jorge is an agent just like any other. We’ve taken some of Jorge’s clients but also taken clients from other agents. My perspective on it is we haven’t broken any of the rules, we are very clear on that and the EFL suggest we are very clear on that and Jorge is an agent that has helped us to improve the squad, just like some other agencies have. All I can say is that we were very clear on what the plan would look like in that second year. In the first year our recruitment didn’t go so well and there was not so many people talking about us then. In the second year we managed to pull it all together.<br /><br />We took some risks, Ruben Neves would have been offered to a number of people - not just Wolverhampton Wanderers, as would have some of the other players. You can’t take away from the players like John Ruddy, on a free from Norwich and Ryan Bennett, on a free. I think from our perspective we are not keen to put a ceiling on it really [the club’s ambitions], it’s almost dare to dream stuff. It sounds a little bit ridiculous when you look at the recent history where Wolves have been. But, why not is the answer from my perspective. They [Fosun] are Uber ambitious, and they have been Uber supportive. With the squad we’ve got, the age of the players, the coach we’ve got, sky’s the limit really. Who knows [where we can finish next season]? It’s such an unforgivable league. We are just enjoying the moment, for sure. We are starting to plan in earnest, and hopefully we will get a head start on other clubs.<br /><br />They’ve all done very well for us, but there’s no hard and fast decisions made for us just yet in terms of what we are going to do with those guys. We are going to let the moment sink in and get to the end of the season. We will then sit down and have a strategy meeting and see what we are going to do next with them</p>

  <p>[Kevin Thelwell has said of the deal to keep Raul Jimenez alongside Diogo Jota at Molineux] The impact Raul has made during his short time at the club has been fantastic and we’re delighted that he’ll be part of the club’s long-term future. From the second he walked through the door, he settled straight into the group, and that reflects in his performance, with Raul providing assists and overall selfless performances, as well as obviously goals. His goals in the Premier League and FA Cup have been vital to this season’s success and we’re looking forward to seeing him contribute even more during what will be an exciting end to the season in both competitions. Raul’s permanent signing shows the ambition of this football club and the determination to make sure the future is an exciting one</p>

  <p>[<a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> sporting director Kevin Thelwell on <a href="patrick-cutrone.html">Patrick Cutrone</a>] Patrick is an exciting signing at a very exciting period for this football club. We have a strong philosophy under the leadership of Nuno [Espirito Santo] of bringing in the right type of people and developing young talent while staying humble and grounded as individuals, and we feel Patrick perfectly fits into our philosophy. We are very pleased to have a player of Patrick’s ability join the club and look forward to him being a part of Nuno’s squad in another historic season for Wolves</p>

  <p>[Kevin Thelwell said Portuguese youth international duo <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> <a href="neto.html">Neto</a> and Bruno Jordao would be given time to settle into their new surroundings before being edged through the ranks towards the club’s senior side] They’re two very talented individuals in positions we’re keen to add to. But with both <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> and Bruno it’s more about their potential for the future. We see signing young talent as a way forward; for example, Morgan Gibbs-White from the Academy, several other young players from the Academy who have been in the first-team recently, and Ruben Vinagre, who we signed at a very young age.<br /><br />We think these two guys are right up there at that level and have both got high potential to be successful here at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>. However, we expect it will take time for them to break into the first-team as they’re so young and they’re playing in a new country and a new environment, but we will try to integrate them into the first-team group as much as possible. We don’t want to put too much pressure on them in the early stages of their time here, but in due course we hope we will see good examples of their true potential and quality at first-team level</p>
