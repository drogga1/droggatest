<blockquote>
  <p>[Wolves sporting director Kevin Thelwell on Patrick Cutrone] Patrick is an exciting signing at a very exciting period for this football club. We have a strong philosophy under the leadership of Nuno [Espirito Santo] of bringing in the right type of people and developing young talent while staying humble and grounded as individuals, and we feel Patrick perfectly fits into our philosophy. We are very pleased to have a player of Patrick’s ability join the club and look forward to him being a part of Nuno’s squad in another historic season for Wolves</p>

  <p>[Kevin Thelwell said Portuguese youth international duo Pedro Neto and Bruno Jordao would be given time to settle into their new surroundings before being edged through the ranks towards the club’s senior side] They’re two very talented individuals in positions we’re keen to add to. But with both Pedro and Bruno it’s more about their potential for the future. We see signing young talent as a way forward; for example, Morgan Gibbs-White from the Academy, several other young players from the Academy who have been in the first-team recently, and Ruben Vinagre, who we signed at a very young age.<br /><br />We think these two guys are right up there at that level and have both got high potential to be successful here at Wolves. However, we expect it will take time for them to break into the first-team as they’re so young and they’re playing in a new country and a new environment, but we will try to integrate them into the first-team group as much as possible. We don’t want to put too much pressure on them in the early stages of their time here, but in due course we hope we will see good examples of their true potential and quality at first-team level</p>
