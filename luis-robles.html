  <p><b>[On Tyler Adams]</b> Over the last six months, <b>[Adams]</b> has been put in situations that could be overwhelming for a player his age and with his lack of experience. Yet, no matter what the situation is, you don’t ever get the sense that he’s overwhelmed by the challenge. If anything, he embraces it, and because he embraces it in that way, it brings confidence to the group. We’re not thinking we’re just putting a young player in there that could get caught up or swept up by what’s happening. We’re putting in someone that’s capable. It doesn’t matter how young or inexperienced he is. He’s capable. That sort of characteristic lends to thinking that this person has greatness in his future. I’m one of those people and I think absolutely, that he’s not just great for the Red Bull organization, but U.S. Soccer in general.</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas and Red Bulls set for Round 2 after physical CCL semifinal first leg]</b> We’ll continue to play the way that we’ve been playing. We eliminated their chances, outside of the goal I felt like they didn’t have much. I know that when they come and play at our place it’s going to be even more difficult for them to create. For us, we’ve got to create chances, we’ve got to get some goals but obviously continue to limit their opportunities.</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if Tuesday’s elimination felt different from past disappointments]</b> Trust me, they all hurt. It’s hard to say one hurts more than the other. Bradley sits next to me, and he’s sat next to me since 2013, and tonight he just says, ‘Hey, we’ve got to stop having this feeling, where we’re sitting here trying to figure out how to get over the hump’. At the end of the day there’s a hump there we can’t seem to get over<br /><br />We’re in the beginning of the season. It feels like it’s the middle of the season but we’re in the beginning of the season and we need to somehow get over this because we have to regroup. We have a lot to play for in 2018</p>

  <p><b>[United bid victory has MLS and USMNT players excited for lead-up to 2026]</b> It introduced me to the game, because I didn’t play soccer to that point. I played it on the school yard, I played rec one year, but I was a baseball player. But then all of a sudden there’s the World Cup and this game of soccer. The stadiums were full and it really was amazing and it introduced me to the beautiful game. After that I knew players like Alexi Lalas and Tony Meola, so when I was 11 and they asked me if I want to play goalie I thought ‘Hey, Tony Meola plays goalie so I’m going to do that.’ It was a pretty good introduction and it’s pretty exciting to see what that’s going to do for soccer in this country.<br /><br />My son will be 13 in 2026, and it’s going to be such a great experience for him. I know what it meant for me, and I’m just looking forward to being able to see him have that same experience</p>

  <p><b>[New York Red Bulls to wear special boots in support of Tackle Kids Cancer]</b> Over the past couple of years, through Tackle Kids Cancer and our partnership with Hackensack Meridian Health, we have been able to provide opportunities for players to make a difference in the lives of others, but in the end, the players end up realizing that with those visits and those experiences that the kids make a difference in their lives as well.<br /><br />I know with this organization we constantly say that we want to be a part of the community, we want to be in the community and it is through Tackle Kids Cancer that we have an opportunity to serve our community, and through the sport of soccer we can make a difference in the lives of others</p>

  <p><b>[Underrated Tim Parker has helped transform Red Bulls defense into the toughest in MLS]</b> You look at that trade and it’s been the best trade all year, across the league. For us to get a guy that solidifies our spine, to be such a character guy, and a huge addition to our locker room. He’s had a great year, gets called up to the national team, but the plaudits aren’t there. He just continues about his business because he knows it’s about the team being successful. We knew when we went to go get Tim he was going to be a game-changer for us. But the most important part is he fits into the locker room, and our culture of the team being the star.<br /><br />It’s crazy when you look at the candidates and you’re like ‘San Jose has two candidates? Orlando has two candidates? Didn’t they just set the record for the most goals conceded?’. We should have had all four guys on there. Obviously the rules are the rules, but it is frustrating</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls exorcise some playoff demons, but a tougher test awaits in Atlanta United]</b> I told the guys to stay focused and disciplined. We’re going to shut them out. We’re going to do everything it takes to get the shutout so that there’s no question going into the end of the game how this is going to end up. It just continues to show what this group is capable of, and what we’ve building on each and every year.</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls pay the price for changing their style in costly loss to Atlanta]</b> I think, just looking at the way that we gave up the goals, we lacked some discipline. We made it a little too easy for them. When you have a team as talented as them, and you make mistakes, they are going to punish you.</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls more focused on stopping Ibrahimovic than potential trash talk]</b> He didn’t score last year (against the Red Bulls), but he set up both goals. You even look at the RSL game (last week) he had a hand in both goals. That’s really what they spent all the money for. He really makes a difference for his team. Even when the offense isn’t necessarily running through him, it ends up ending with him. These are things we have to be mindful of. In order to defend Ibra it’s not going to be a one-v-one,” Robles added. “It’s going to take the entire group knowing where he’s at, but then because of the challenge he creates you can’t just focus on him because they have other good pieces that have been playing well</p>

  <p><b>[Zlatan hitting New York and Texas Derby headline Week 10]</b> Red Bull Arena is a great place to play and when it’s full, in my opinion, it’s one of the top places in the league to play. If it means that Zlatan has to come into town for that to be the case I’m OK with that. I remember in 2014 Arsenal came and it was filled to beyond capacity. The energy inside the stadium was electric. It was an away game, and it was a really fun experience, so if it ends up being the case that when we play LA it ends up being full everybody’s going to be really up for it and excited about it because when that stadium is full it’s an incredible place to be.</p>

  <p><b>[LAFC vs New York Red Bulls.

So I’m hoping that plays out the same way against LAFC because they’re the top team. They’re the team that everyone’s gunning for. And it’s going to be a really good test for us</p>

  <p><b>[How Inter Miami is staying fit and finding togetherness in coronavirus quarantine]</b> I don’t have weights at home, so one of the examples that I’ve had to use is filling up a milk jug, a gallon and using that as a weight. I use it for some of the exercises, but it is a creative way to do the training. It’s never going to be perfect, but because of the training regiment, it does allow us to continue to train<br /><br />Unfortunately, the quick answer is running, and I just am not a runner by any stretch of the imagination. There are guys that live close to me, so we go out for a run and running with them keeps me motivated and held accountable because they’re really quick and in way better shape than I am. When I consider what a professional athlete is like, I look at those guys and think of how incredible they are from these workouts but it is motivating and it allows me to work on a part of my game that is often overlooked. As a goalkeeper, there are different requirements for us to compete at a high level, but the one thing from the last two weeks of these workouts, this is probably an aspect of my training regiment that I could look to include once things get back to normal<br /><br />The thing I miss the most is the locker room, the camaraderie of being around the guys. We have a group text that is ongoing with banter, but it’s not the same. You’re not going to have that personal element of being in the locker room or on the training field and bantering about. That I definitely miss<br /><br />Sooner or later, we’ll get back to normal, and what it’s going to look like on the other side, we’re not entirely sure but guys are looking forward to that. I’m looking forward to it. And when we get there, we’ll compete again</p>

  <p><b>[Family life and fatherhood are helping <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> stars cope with coronavirus quarantine]</b> It’s been an adventure. It’s been fun. I think the one thing that has been apparent to my wife and myself is that we’re not cut out for homeschooling, but we are making adjustments and we are learning on the fly. And the real big positive is we get to spend a lot of family time together, whether that’s doing puzzles or just being outside riding your bike<br /><br />It is definitely different and it’s not what anyone could have expected but you’re right, there’s a really huge positive in all of that is that we get to spend a lot of time as a family and that’s something that we are grateful for</p>
