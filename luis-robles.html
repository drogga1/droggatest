  <p><b>[Dax McCarty is focused on his U.S. national team return right now rather than his surprising trade to the Chicago Fire]</b> Chicago got an incredible player, and more than anything they got a leader on the field. He’s a guy who is going to make everyone better, so I’m exciting not only for his future, but it seems like the <b>[Fire]</b> are making some big moves to head in the right direction<br /><br />It was really tough, and it was something that I never really gave up hope, so I always tried to keep my frustrations to myself. I respect the guys that came out and talked about it. I think there’s not enough of that. I think there’s not enough guys that are willing to speak their minds and show fans that players go through a lot of emotions<br /><br />I kept to myself and tried to keep working hard, and I thought if my performances with the Red Bulls were really good I’d always have a chance. I tried to keep a high level with my club team and keep my fingers crossed that a call would come, but it never did. Obviously it came in 2014 but I never got a chance to play in a game, and after that it was nothing. Every coach has their own preferences, and you have to respect that as a player. I never held a grudge against Jurgen at all and wish him well in whatever’s next for him<br /><br /><b>[McCarty and Feilhaber became poster children for the handful of top MLS players who Klinsmann didn’t bring into the national team]</b> We exchanged a couple of texts and I told him he was candid and honest and I have a lot of respect for guys that come out and say that. Benny and I have a good relationship. I enjoy playing with Benny whenever we get a chance to play together. We see the game the same way, and I have a high amount of respect for him as a player, so for him to not get the chances that he was getting, I also felt the same way, that he deserved more chances for what his qualities are and what he brings to Sporting Kansas City<br /><br />Right now my main focus is just being out here with my current teammates, trying to enjoy my soccer, trying to get back into shape because the wedding took a lot out of me. Obviously there’s a lot of competition for spots, but the good part about Bruce being in is it’s a set of fresh eyes and I think everyone is starting on equal footing</p>

  <p><b>[Five years ago, Luis Robles wasn’t thinking about things like U.S. national team call-ups, Goalkeeper of the Year awards or a place in the MLS record books. His wife Cara didn’t let him give up his playing career that easily though]</b> She’s the catalyst behind all of this, because when I was sitting in Arizona in July of 2012, in my mind I was ready to just move on. I thought it was a good little run, I could say that I was a professional soccer player, and it was time for life to really start. My parents supported whatever decision I made, but my wife told me to keep trying and trying, and if it wasn’t for her motivating me, there’s no way I could see this out.<br /><br />No, I couldn’t have imagined it. And to be honest it hasn’t completely set in. It’s hard to really understand the full measure of what it is because I’m really focused, more than anything, on this team doing well. I’ve been very fortunate, not only to have Hans Backe believe in me and give me my first start, but Mike <b>[Petke]</b>, even when things weren’t going well to keep sticking with me. And then of course when Jesse <b>[Marsch]</b> came, he just said, ‘Hey, you’re going to be a big part of this.’ It seems like the responsibility keeps getting bigger and bigger, and I know I have to keep improving, as a goalkeeper, and as a leader<br /><br />I thought Tim had a great game. It’s obviously important for him to come home to New Jersey and play well in front of friends and family and of course in front of a fan base that idolizes him. He’s an icon here at this organization, and even when things are going well for me, I know I have big shoes to fill. Tim, Tony <b>[Meola]</b>, just to name a few. When you go up against a guy like Tim, not only do you want to show well, you want the team to do well<br /><br />I would be lying to you if I said <b>[the national team]</b> wasn’t on my mind, but not to the point where it’s a distraction. That’s so out of my control. The only thing I can control is my performance each and every day. So if they decide to call me in, it’ll be an honor and I’m really going to do anything I can to help this team, whether it’s an ancillary role or a primary role. It doesn’t matter, I’ll do whatever it takes to help the team</p>

  <p><b>[On young player]</b> You’re starting to see in more franchises throughout Major League Soccer lean on young players. It’s not only important from the club, it makes fiscal sense, but also for U.S. Soccer you want to see these young guys play in big games and big situations so that you get to test your mettle. When you see the opportunities these guys get, it’s not necessarily some cute thing where we’re just mixing young guys with experienced guys. Young guys need to come in and make an impact. They know what’s expected of them, but they also know we have the utmost confidence in them</p>

  <p><b>[New York Red Bulls hitting stride with key win against Columbus Crew]</b> You look at the last couple of games, what we’ve been able to do is see games out. Even the gamesmanship in the very end, the last five, six minutes, that’s part of our development that was missing last year. For us to get the shutout is great. For us to get three points is even better. For us to do it against a good team in our conference is probably the best part.<br /><br />There’s a comfort level with <b>[the 4-2-3-1]</b>, a familiarity. We’ve played the last two years with it, and have had a great deal of success so making the transition back to it is pretty simple, pretty easy for us, and the results have been there with that. That being said, it’s not as if we’re not going to make tactical shifts against opponents. We may go back to how we were playing before, but nonetheless, just to show the development over the past couple of years, and the familiarity with that formation has suited us well<br /><br />I think the East is a tougher conference. Any time you go against a conference opponent you know there’s going to be a little more on the line when it comes to position in the standings, but when you go against a top team there’s even more on the line. You want to be able to make a statement and I feel tonight was an opportunity to make a statement. Did we play our best soccer? No, but we played well enough to limit their opportunities and take advantage of our opportunities</p>

  <p><b>[On Tyler Adams]</b> Over the last six months, <b>[Adams]</b> has been put in situations that could be overwhelming for a player his age and with his lack of experience. Yet, no matter what the situation is, you don’t ever get the sense that he’s overwhelmed by the challenge. If anything, he embraces it, and because he embraces it in that way, it brings confidence to the group. We’re not thinking we’re just putting a young player in there that could get caught up or swept up by what’s happening. We’re putting in someone that’s capable. It doesn’t matter how young or inexperienced he is. He’s capable. That sort of characteristic lends to thinking that this person has greatness in his future. I’m one of those people and I think absolutely, that he’s not just great for the Red Bull organization, but U.S. Soccer in general.</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas and Red Bulls set for Round 2 after physical CCL semifinal first leg]</b> We’ll continue to play the way that we’ve been playing. We eliminated their chances, outside of the goal I felt like they didn’t have much. I know that when they come and play at our place it’s going to be even more difficult for them to create. For us, we’ve got to create chances, we’ve got to get some goals but obviously continue to limit their opportunities.</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if Tuesday’s elimination felt different from past disappointments]</b> Trust me, they all hurt. It’s hard to say one hurts more than the other. Bradley sits next to me, and he’s sat next to me since 2013, and tonight he just says, ‘Hey, we’ve got to stop having this feeling, where we’re sitting here trying to figure out how to get over the hump’. At the end of the day there’s a hump there we can’t seem to get over<br /><br />We’re in the beginning of the season. It feels like it’s the middle of the season but we’re in the beginning of the season and we need to somehow get over this because we have to regroup. We have a lot to play for in 2018</p>

  <p><b>[United bid victory has MLS and USMNT players excited for lead-up to 2026]</b> It introduced me to the game, because I didn’t play soccer to that point. I played it on the school yard, I played rec one year, but I was a baseball player. But then all of a sudden there’s the World Cup and this game of soccer. The stadiums were full and it really was amazing and it introduced me to the beautiful game. After that I knew players like Alexi Lalas and Tony Meola, so when I was 11 and they asked me if I want to play goalie I thought ‘Hey, Tony Meola plays goalie so I’m going to do that.’ It was a pretty good introduction and it’s pretty exciting to see what that’s going to do for soccer in this country.<br /><br />My son will be 13 in 2026, and it’s going to be such a great experience for him. I know what it meant for me, and I’m just looking forward to being able to see him have that same experience</p>

  <p><b>[Underrated Tim Parker has helped transform Red Bulls defense into the toughest in MLS]</b> You look at that trade and it’s been the best trade all year, across the league. For us to get a guy that solidifies our spine, to be such a character guy, and a huge addition to our locker room. He’s had a great year, gets called up to the national team, but the plaudits aren’t there. He just continues about his business because he knows it’s about the team being successful. We knew when we went to go get Tim he was going to be a game-changer for us. But the most important part is he fits into the locker room, and our culture of the team being the star.<br /><br />It’s crazy when you look at the candidates and you’re like ‘San Jose has two candidates? Orlando has two candidates? Didn’t they just set the record for the most goals conceded?’. We should have had all four guys on there. Obviously the rules are the rules, but it is frustrating</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls more focused on stopping Ibrahimovic than potential trash talk]</b> He didn’t score last year (against the Red Bulls), but he set up both goals. You even look at the RSL game (last week) he had a hand in both goals. That’s really what they spent all the money for. He really makes a difference for his team. Even when the offense isn’t necessarily running through him, it ends up ending with him. These are things we have to be mindful of. In order to defend Ibra it’s not going to be a one-v-one. It’s going to take the entire group knowing where he’s at, but then because of the challenge he creates you can’t just focus on him because they have other good pieces that have been playing well</p>

  <p><b>[Zlatan hitting New York and Texas Derby headline Week 10]</b> Red Bull Arena is a great place to play and when it’s full, in my opinion, it’s one of the top places in the league to play. If it means that Zlatan has to come into town for that to be the case I’m OK with that. I remember in 2014 Arsenal came and it was filled to beyond capacity. The energy inside the stadium was electric. It was an away game, and it was a really fun experience, so if it ends up being the case that when we play LA it ends up being full everybody’s going to be really up for it and excited about it because when that stadium is full it’s an incredible place to be.</p>

  <p><b>[How Inter Miami is staying fit and finding togetherness in coronavirus quarantine]</b> I don’t have weights at home, so one of the examples that I’ve had to use is filling up a milk jug, a gallon and using that as a weight. I use it for some of the exercises, but it is a creative way to do the training. It’s never going to be perfect, but because of the training regiment, it does allow us to continue to train<br /><br />Unfortunately, the quick answer is running, and I just am not a runner by any stretch of the imagination. There are guys that live close to me, so we go out for a run and running with them keeps me motivated and held accountable because they’re really quick and in way better shape than I am. When I consider what a professional athlete is like, I look at those guys and think of how incredible they are from these workouts but it is motivating and it allows me to work on a part of my game that is often overlooked. As a goalkeeper, there are different requirements for us to compete at a high level, but the one thing from the last two weeks of these workouts, this is probably an aspect of my training regiment that I could look to include once things get back to normal<br /><br />The thing I miss the most is the locker room, the camaraderie of being around the guys. We have a group text that is ongoing with banter, but it’s not the same. You’re not going to have that personal element of being in the locker room or on the training field and bantering about. That I definitely miss<br /><br />Sooner or later, we’ll get back to normal, and what it’s going to look like on the other side, we’re not entirely sure but guys are looking forward to that. I’m looking forward to it. And when we get there, we’ll compete again</p>

I think the one thing that has been apparent to my wife and myself is that we’re not cut out for homeschooling, but we are making adjustments and we are learning on the fly. And the real big positive is we get to spend a lot of family time together, whether that’s doing puzzles or just being outside riding your bike<br /><br />It is definitely different and it’s not what anyone could have expected but you’re right, there’s a really huge positive in all of that is that we get to spend a lot of time as a family and that’s something that we are grateful for</p>
