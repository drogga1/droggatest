  <p><b>[LAFC vs New York Red Bulls. Goalkeeper Luis Robles admitted, it will have to be at its best to take the points on Sunday]</b> Something that has become apparent this season is that we play to the level of our opponent. So I’m hoping that plays out the same way against LAFC because they’re the top team. They’re the team that everyone’s gunning for. And it’s going to be a really good test for us</p>

  <p><b>[After Inter Miami’s <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> debut ends in defeat]</b> I felt like we played well enough to get a point, I really thought optimistically that we’d nick one at the end and it’d be a fair result</p>

  <p><b>[How Inter Miami is staying fit and finding togetherness in coronavirus quarantine]</b> I don’t have weights at home, so one of the examples that I’ve had to use is filling up a milk jug, a gallon and using that as a weight. I use it for some of the exercises, but it is a creative way to do the training. It’s never going to be perfect, but because of the training regiment, it does allow us to continue to train<br /><br />Unfortunately, the quick answer is running, and I just am not a runner by any stretch of the imagination. There are guys that live close to me, so we go out for a run and running with them keeps me motivated and held accountable because they’re really quick and in way better shape than I am. When I consider what a professional athlete is like, I look at those guys and think of how incredible they are from these workouts but it is motivating and it allows me to work on a part of my game that is often overlooked. As a goalkeeper, there are different requirements for us to compete at a high level, but the one thing from the last two weeks of these workouts, this is probably an aspect of my training regiment that I could look to include once things get back to normal<br /><br />The thing I miss the most is the locker room, the camaraderie of being around the guys. We have a group text that is ongoing with banter, but it’s not the same. You’re not going to have that personal element of being in the locker room or on the training field and bantering about. That I definitely miss<br /><br />Sooner or later, we’ll get back to normal, and what it’s going to look like on the other side, we’re not entirely sure but guys are looking forward to that. I’m looking forward to it. And when we get there, we’ll compete again</p>

  <p><b>[Family life and fatherhood are helping <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> stars cope with coronavirus quarantine]</b> It’s been an adventure. It’s been fun. I think the one thing that has been apparent to my wife and myself is that we’re not cut out for homeschooling, but we are making adjustments and we are learning on the fly. And the real big positive is we get to spend a lot of family time together, whether that’s doing puzzles or just being outside riding your bike<br /><br />It is definitely different and it’s not what anyone could have expected but you’re right, there’s a really huge positive in all of that is that we get to spend a lot of time as a family and that’s something that we are grateful for</p>
