  <p><b>[Indonesian side Persib Bandung have confirmed that they have completed the signing of Michael Essien]</b> I hope I am the prelude to other world players moving to Indonesia. Hopefully this is a good beginning for Indonesian football and also for Persib. Thank you for bringing me here. I’m excited and want to give my best.</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku and Jose Mourinho would have no problem working together at Manchester United]</b> Yes why not? If Jose wants him and he wants to play for Jose then yes they can work together. They both have to want to work with each other for that to happen and if the desire is there then, yes, they can work together<br /><br />In general it was good and normal. We all had different relationships with Jose and mine, as everyone knows, is like a father and son. I won’t say Romelu’s relationship with Jose was the same as mine but, in general, it was normal and they respected each other</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United taking the decision to sack Jose Mourinho would be unfair]</b> It’s all part of the game. When things are not going right, clubs start making changes. It would be unfair <b>[if they sacked him]</b> but, as I said, it’s part of the game. Managers come and go but we’ll have to wait and see what happens.<br /><br />They’ve had a very bad start to the season. Knowing Jose and the players, I am sure they will work hard and start to change things around. He’s a good man, first and foremost, and he always knows how to get the best out of his players. He knows when things are not going right and he knows what to do and the words to say to pick them up. I am sure he will do that and hopefully things will begin to change for him. He is <b>[charismatic in training]</b>. He is always close to his players. He’s such a good man but people see him differently on camera. But, off camera, he is such a lovely person</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard may end up leaving Chelsea for Real Madrid]</b> Hazard is one of the best players in the world. The interest of Real Madrid, I only hear from people in the media. But I mean when Real Madrid come calling … every player would love to play for them. He’s happy at Chelsea though and hopefully we can keep him.<br /><br />Every player wants to play. Chelsea isn’t an easy place to come and the competition is very fierce. At the end of the day, all the players work but it’s the manager who will pick who he wants to play. When you’re not playing you get frustrated and you want to look elsewhere. It’s up to them really but they have to keep working and then everyone gets their chance</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien has played down concerns about the team’s style of play under Maurizio Sarri]</b> For me it’s not so much about styles but rather how players apply themselves on the pitch regardless of the style. Whatever style you are asked to play, as a very good player you just get on with it and that’s what the players are trying to do. The coach is the boss and all the players have to listen to him and carry out his instructions for the good of the team and the club.<br /><br /><b>[Essien has refused to join in with the criticism]</b> That switch is down to the coach and it doesn’t matter what the rest of us think. The coach has his style of playing, he sees the players every day in training and knows their strengths and weaknesses. So on that basis if he decides this player has to play here and the other in a different position, there is nothing anyone can do. All we can do as Chelsea fans is to support the team to win regardless of who is playing where</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Ghana midfielder Michael Essien not ruling out a move to the PSL]</b> South Africa is not bad, I would like to come here. You can never say never, I am keeping my options open. I love football, I love football…I have played it my whole life. So, I am not thinking about retirement at all (for now). I don’t know <b>[why South Africa hasn’t exported many players]</b>. In football you can’t really explain what’s going wrong. On a personal level, I think they have to just keep pushing and working hard. Take their chances and see what happens. However, I think they did well because they beat Egypt</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> midfielder Michael Essien has revealed he came close to signing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> at separate times, before ultimately joining <a href="chelsea-fc.html">the Blues</a> in 2005]</b> I had lot of offers <b>[when I was at Bastia]</b>. I was close to signing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> when <a href="gerard-houllier.html">Gerard Houllier</a> was their coach. I even went to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> to meet the coach. We had a talk and I returned to France but the offers were still coming. <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, Olympique <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> et al, but I told Bastia I didn’t want to move and they also didn’t want to sell me at that time because they wanted me to stay for another year which was fine with me because I also didn’t want to leave the club. So I stayed for another season, that’s my third year with the club. <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> joined the three aforementioned clubs to enquire about me but I thought it was too early to move to England. That was why I joined <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> and later moved to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> under <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> <b>[in 2005]</b>. <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> were my favourite team when I went to France because they were winning everything. I told my agent that if <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> have come into the picture I’d like to join them<br /><br /><a href="psg.html">PSG</a> were then serious about signing me to the extent that they made an offer. I was back home at that time and the call came that <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> had made a bid for me. It was even on national television that I had signed for <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, which I had not because I was still in Ghana. There were a lot of controversies going on between the board and my agent so when I went back to Bastia, we met with the board members and the president, and I told them I’d prefer to join <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> although I liked Paris. I was really caught between <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> but my preference was always <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. I had then spoken to the president and their coach. I gave them my word that when I return from my holidays in Ghana, I’ll do everything to sign for them but It was not easy</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> star Essien reveals frustrations with <a href="roberto-di-matteo.html">Di Matteo</a> forced <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> move]</b> Every injury I had when I was playing for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> I came back stronger. I remember my first injury was around September 2008, I came back much stronger and took my position in the team. 2010 was the same but when <a href="andre-villas-boas.html">Villas-Boas</a> came, I was unlucky because I was part of his plans. I knew him long ago because he worked with Jose <b>[<a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>]</b>. I was part of his plans but then I got injured so I didn’t play any game for him. I returned from injury and played like just five minutes for him so he didn’t really have a chance to work with me. Another coach that was very good to me was <b>[Carlo]</b> <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a>. He’s one of the best but he was unlucky because I started the season with him but didn’t finish. The second year I didn’t start but finished with him so he got only like a year from me which was sad. It was due to injuries.<br /><br /><b>[The season before Essien’s departure, the Ghanaian helped <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> reach the final of the Champions League but only watched from the bench as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">the Blues</a>, under <a href="roberto-di-matteo.html">Di Matteo</a> beat <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> to lift the trophy for a historic first time]</b> <a href="roberto-di-matteo.html">Di Matteo</a> came and obviously I was coming back from injury and I remember we played a Champions League <b>[first leg]</b> game against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and we lost. It was an away game. I think that was the last game for <a href="andre-villas-boas.html">Villas-Boas</a>. The return game, <a href="roberto-di-matteo.html">Di Matteo</a> made the decision to put all the big boys in the game - <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a>, <a href="claude-makelele.html">Claude Makelele</a> and me,and we won <b>[4-1]</b> after extra time and qualified. A couple of weeks later, he said I was not match fit which I didn’t appreciate because if that’s the case, why did I play 120 minutes some few weeks ago against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>? But anyway everyone sees things differently so I didn’t mind because I was working for the team. That’s when things started declining because I felt a bit down, but then I had gotten an opportunity to go to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> so I proved to them that I’m back. I was playing at right-back at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> which was one of the most difficult positions on the pitch but I managed to do it</p>
