  <p><b>[Benevento midfielder Oliver Kragl says Former Inter star and current <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> coach Walter Zenga is a real a<em>sh</em>le]</b> <b>[Davide]</b> Nicola was followed as coach by Walter Zenga, the goalkeeping icon at <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a>. He was a real a<em>sh</em>le. He kept promising to let me play, but never kept his promise. Zenga was just kidding me. Maybe he just lacked the balls to go against the club bosses. I know well what I am capable of doing and I should have played in this team. If Crotone had <a href="franck-ribery.html">Franck Ribery</a> on the left wing I would have made no protest, but, of course, that was not the case. On the last matchday before the winter holidays, I was able to play against Milan for a few minutes. I was happy because I wanted to start after the break. Two days later, I was in Dubai and my adviser called. He informed me that Crotone wanted to get rid of me. I said: All right, f*ck you, I’ll be gone immediately!<br /><br /><b>[Kragl currently features under <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> icon <a href="filippo-inzaghi.html">Filippo Inzaghi</a> at Benevento]</b> The trick is to keep a well-functioning team on the go, so that - despite the big lead - there is no lethargy. <a href="filippo-inzaghi.html">Filippo Inzaghi</a> does that very well. He won the Champions League as a player and became world champion. He may not have been the greatest technician, but as a striker he always knew where to stand. It is not for nothing that he was one of the most prolific Milan players of all time. He communicates his experiences to us in the best possible way and passes on the attitude he previously displayed to us. Pippo called me. I was a bit perplexed, but I was happy that he got in touch personally. This cannot be taken for granted in football. I knew his interest was real because Pippo wanted to sign me when he was still <a href="bologna-fc.html">Bologna</a> coach. The problem was Foggia, my club at the time, asked for €3 million for me, which <a href="bologna-fc.html">Bologna</a> could not afford. So Pippo’s second attempt worked better. He’s not a big and loud guy in the dressing room. He clearly says that we should do the things we go through in training</p>

  <p><b>[German midfielder Oliver Kragl says Red Bull Salzburg could buy <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> tomorrow if they wanted to]</b> Red Bull Salzburg made the reigning Champions League holders <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> give everything at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and got a draw in Naples. Red Bull could probably buy <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> tomorrow if they wanted to. I think Salzburg could do well in the German Bundesliga<br /><br /><b>[Kragl says that talent was on full display even during Mane’s early years in Austria]</b> He was my opponent several times. Once he brutally destroyed me. Salzburg sent us home with a 5-0 defeat. I did a little better in the other games. But you could already see where Sadio’s journey would go and that he is an exceptional player. He is fast, technically excellent and always knows where to go. It is not for nothing that he is idolised at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I saw Sadio as a very calm, polite person. An impressive interview, which he gave some time ago, also supports my view of him. He said that luxury cars or expensive watches are not important to him at all. Instead, he donates a lot of money to his home country and tries to help the people there. That shows what a fine guy Sadio is</p>
