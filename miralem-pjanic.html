  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo will offer Juventus what he’s always given at other clubs]</b> Cristiano’s added something to Juve. I must admit that he’s very good at shooting! He’ll give us so much and we’re very happy to have him with us. He’s showed himself to be the best in the world for the last few years. Having him with us is very important and we can only benefit from what he’ll give us. I hope he feels comfortable with us, but from what he’s said to us, he’s very happy to be here, so we hope that in the future, like he’s always done, he gives us what he’s always given at other clubs.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba would be welcome again at Juventus]</b> It’s the dream of our fans. The club has signed some amazing players and are thinking of improving the team even more. He would be welcome again here.<br /><br />My dream is to win the Champions League and we’ll do everything we can to do it. The treble is a dream and an objective for us. When I arrived the president showed me a picture taken after Juventus’ fifth successive Scudetto. He told me we should have done more. We did it but it’s not over now<br /><br />Our team is very strong, we are working to improve. <b>[Massimiliano]</b> Allegri knows exactly how to manage the team and which players should be rotated. Cristiano is a plus for us. I think this is the best Juventus side in the history of the club<br /><br /><b>[On Gianluigi Buffon]</b> He is probably the best goalkeepers of all time. He was an important part of the dressing room, he was a true example. Now <b>[Giorgio]</b> Chiellini is the reference point, an even bigger reference point than what he used to be. When you play with Gigi and Chiello you learn what Juventus is about</p>

  <p><b>[Miralem Pjanic has admitted to attracting interest during a window]</b> There was some interest, it’s true, but I had no reason to change club. I don’t know if Juventus will be my last big club, because transfers don’t just depend on the player, but also on the club and who might or might not need you in that role.<br /><br /><b>[On Christiano Ronaldo]</b> He has always been decisive in the big games, he was born to score important goals. And now we have him in our team. It’s up to us to make the most of his presence. When we have a chat, he tells me that he is happy and confident in the strength of this Juve side. I can see that the Champions League will come to Juventus over the next few years. It’s my dream to win it and I am in the ideal place to achieve that dream</p>

  <p><b>[Blaise Matuidi will walk off the pitch if he hears more racist abuse]</b> Blaise is very upset. He told us if it happens again he will walk off the pitch.<br /><br />I don’t believe that a celebration can have anything to do with these chants. Everyone can celebrate in whichever way they want. Even I could have scored and celebrated in the same way and the same thing would have happened. This is the second year that Matuidi has been here and he still has to live like this, it’s a horrible thing. We are so sorry that they have to live like this because we have seen how upset the boys were after the game. And I’m not referring only to Kean and Matuidi, there’s also Alex Sandro and Cagliari have some black players too.<br /><br />Racism is linked to the person - what does a celebration have to do with the chanting? Absolutely nothing. If the referee thinks a player is provoking the fans then he can go to Kean and warn him. But regardless of what happens on the field, these chants shouldn’t exist. I hope the right people do the necessary things so this sort of stuff never happens again. The fact that Kean is young doesn’t matter. I’ve said it before and I’ll repeat it: these things shouldn’t happen because of a celebration. You can do what you want and if the referee thinks he has to then he’ll warn you, but celebrating has nothing to do with racism. It’s a situation that no one should have to live with and, given this isn’t the first time, I hope that something will change</p>

  <p><b>[Miralem Pjanic says his future at Juventus is still to be decided]</b> PSG is among the best European clubs. In the Champions League, they want to take a step. It’s a club where all players are ready to go,” he told Canal+ when asked about reported interest from the Ligue 1 champions. This club is respected and there is a good chance of winning the Champions League there.<br /><br /><b>[Pjanic says he still needs to hold talks over his future with the Juventus hierarchy]</b> Yes, everything is possible. It’s been eight years I’ve been in Italy.<br /><br />I’m at a very big club. We must find an agreement <b>[with Juventus]</b> but I don’t think about all that right now. I just think about finishing my season. We’ll see what happens during the holidays, but I respect this club and we have good players there. I can say my aim for the next few years is to win the Champions League. With my family, I feel good in Italy. The country lives football and as a player you live well there. You see the difference with France, for example. It’s good to live.</p>

I lived in Luxembourg, a very small country, then I moved by myself to France, still young, to follow the dream of football. I am happy to have chosen to play for Bosnia even if I could have played for France instead. I was only 18 at the time and <b>[France coach]</b> <a href="raymond-domenech.html">Raymond Domenech</a> called me to see what my plans were. I went to see a Bosnia-Denmark game when I was 13 and from that moment on, I knew I wanted to represent Bosnia</p>

I repeat, I’m not worried about <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. They’ll announce the new manager soon. As everyone is saying, our new manager will be a great one, for sure.<br /><br /><b>[Italy top Group J with three wins from as many games, five points clear of third-placed Bosnia ahead of Tuesday’s clash]</b> It was not simple <b>[for Italy]</b> to come back. It was possible thanks to the experience of <b>[head coach]</b> <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a> but also to the leaders of this group. Great professional that helped a lot even the young players after a bad moment for the national team. It’s very unusual a World Cup without Italy.

We deserved it. We had to score one more goal to secure the result but in the end they are three precious points, after the <b>[international]</b> break it is never easy.

  <p><b>[Miralem Pjanic admits <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are putting themselves in a bit of danger by failing to be more ruthless in front of goal]</b> What I like about <b>[Sarri’s]</b> vision is the one, two-touch game, making the ball move more than us, because the ball always travels faster. Although, recently we’ve been seeing out matches with few goals compared to what we’re creating, and this puts us in a bit of danger and doesn’t give us all the satisfaction we could have for how we play. We have to be more clinical and take more chances. This will also make opponents have more respect and fear than us. Calm and clarity will come once we start to score more, and we’ll then keep doing so because this team has so much quality that we’ll be able to score goals from every angle. But we have to be more clinical<br /><br /><b>[<a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was guilty of missing opportunities against Genoa but Pjanic was mostly relieved they got the win in the end, given <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> remain just a point behind them in the table]</b> It happens to everyone, but luckily we won in the end and they’re three important points, given the results: Inter had won, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> lost points. It was important to keep up and move forward and to do so until March, which will be the most important month, and maybe see if we can stretch ahead a little</p>

Now, it’s different. My team-mates always look for me and I like that. It all depends on what the coach asks of me but I play more passes and now I want to touch the ball 150 times per game<br /><br /><b>[<a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> himself has acknowledged that his primary strikers - <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> and <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Paulo Dybala</a> - have yet to find their shooting boots]</b> We have a very low average of shots finding the net. In my view, it’s more of a mental issue than anything else. I expressed my fear with the players about that and we’ll try to prepare some training exercises to help, but we also need to be more determined in front of goal</p>

  <p><b>[Barca-bound Miralem Pjanic pens heartfelt goodbye to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> Breathe, Mire, this is the mantra I keep repeating in my mind during the decisive moments of a match. This is what I continue to repeat now, while I try to write down what I am feeling in this moment. I arrived four years ago so I could try to win everything. Because even when you don’t manage it, a <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> player must always try. These were four intense years, experienced alongside great professionals, but above all real friends, with whom I shared victories and records, but also bitter defeats on the cusp of triumph. These are years in which I matured as a man and a father. This is the city where Edin grew up, becoming the biggest fan of this team, and where, with my family, we built the best memories of our lives<br /><br />I don’t think I can ever thank you enough, so: Thank you to the <a href="andrea-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> Family. Thank you to all those team-mates who shared this journey with me. Thank you to all the employees and members of the staff, who helped me to grow. Thank you to the fans who made me feel special every day. Because if there’s one thing I have learned, it’s that there is no minimum time in which you can fall in love. At the end of the day, it’s very simple: you wear this jersey like a second skin, you always give everything, and you’ll never go wrong. Now we don’t have much time to lose and there’s so much to win from here to the end of the season. Therefore, breathe, Mire. Because what today might seem so sad, from tomorrow will be a wonderful memory that you’ll keep in your heart for the rest of your life</p>
