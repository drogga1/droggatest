  <p><b>[Miralem Pjanic has praised <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Massimiliano Allegri</a> for making everything work in the best way]</b> We are a fantastic group and I have to congratulate our coach, who has always managed to make everything work in the best way. With him, we managed to win. In football you always have to work to improve, I have always had this mentality<br /><br /><b>[On <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>]</b> His concentration levels have always been out of the ordinary, both when things are going well and also when that’s not the case<br /><br /><b>[Miralem Pjanic revealed he turned down the chance to represent France, having moved to the country as a teenager to join Metz]</b> I left my country, Bosnia, very young because of the coming war. I lived in Luxembourg, a very small country, then I moved by myself to France, still young, to follow the dream of football. I am happy to have chosen to play for Bosnia even if I could have played for France instead. I was only 18 at the time and <b>[France coach]</b> <a href="raymond-domenech.html">Raymond Domenech</a> called me to see what my plans were. I went to see a Bosnia-Denmark game when I was 13 and from that moment on, I knew I wanted to represent Bosnia</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus midfielder Miralem Pjanic expects the Serie A champions to appoint a great coach amid links to Chelsea boss <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a>]</b> We are not worried at all, Juventus will be strong as always. I’m really happy to play against Italy in Turin. I think my red card against Greece was not fair, fortunately they removed my ban because I wanted to play against Italy in my stadium so badly. I repeat, I’m not worried about Juventus. They’ll announce the new manager soon. As everyone is saying, our new manager will be a great one, for sure.<br /><br /><b>[Italy top Group J with three wins from as many games, five points clear of third-placed Bosnia ahead of Tuesday’s clash]</b> It was not simple <b>[for Italy]</b> to come back. It was possible thanks to the experience of <b>[head coach]</b> <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a> but also to the leaders of this group. Great professional that helped a lot even the young players after a bad moment for the national team. It’s very unusual a World Cup without Italy. They are playing great football, people like watching them playing. It wasn’t easy. We know that they are the favourite of the group, we’ll try to stop them. It will be a difficult match because they have lot of great players</p>

  <p><b>[Miralem Pjanic says he is happy to stay at Juventus]</b> I am calm, I still have a four-year contract with Juventus and we love each other. I feel good in Turin, I am at a serious club and I can still give a lot. I am also very happy with the fans and I repeat I am in a club that is great.</p>

  <p><b>[Pjanic felt Juventus’ victory was merited even though they were hanging on at the end as <a href="bologna-fc.html">Bologna</a> threw caution to the wind in stoppage time]</b> We knew it would be a complicated game, we have seen them play often. <a href="bologna-fc.html">Bologna</a> are in good shape, play well and are organised on the pitch. We deserved it. We had to score one more goal to secure the result but in the end they are three precious points, after the <b>[international]</b> break it is never easy. In the end they too got tired, because they had to run a lot. We are happy and move forward</p>

  <p><b>[Miralem Pjanic admits <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are putting themselves in a bit of danger by failing to be more ruthless in front of goal]</b> What I like about <b>[Sarri’s]</b> vision is the one, two-touch game, making the ball move more than us, because the ball always travels faster. Although, recently we’ve been seeing out matches with few goals compared to what we’re creating, and this puts us in a bit of danger and doesn’t give us all the satisfaction we could have for how we play. We have to be more clinical and take more chances. This will also make opponents have more respect and fear than us. Calm and clarity will come once we start to score more, and we’ll then keep doing so because this team has so much quality that we’ll be able to score goals from every angle. But we have to be more clinical<br /><br /><b>[<a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was guilty of missing opportunities against Genoa but Pjanic was mostly relieved they got the win in the end, given <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> remain just a point behind them in the table]</b> It happens to everyone, but luckily we won in the end and they’re three important points, given the results: Inter had won, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> lost points. It was important to keep up and move forward and to do so until March, which will be the most important month, and maybe see if we can stretch ahead a little</p>

  <p><b>[Pjanic spoke glowingly of <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> when the former <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> boss departed at the end of last season but he has, unsurprisingly, been barely able to contain his delight at how <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>’s play - and his role within in it - has changed this term]</b> Playing under <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> was completely different, as we immediately looked to get the ball wide. Now, it’s different. My team-mates always look for me and I like that. It all depends on what the coach asks of me but I play more passes and now I want to touch the ball 150 times per game<br /><br /><b>[<a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> himself has acknowledged that his primary strikers - <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> and <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Paulo Dybala</a> - have yet to find their shooting boots]</b> We have a very low average of shots finding the net. In my view, it’s more of a mental issue than anything else. I expressed my fear with the players about that and we’ll try to prepare some training exercises to help, but we also need to be more determined in front of goal</p>

  <p><b>[Barca-bound Miralem Pjanic pens heartfelt goodbye to Juventus]</b> Breathe, Mire, this is the mantra I keep repeating in my mind during the decisive moments of a match. This is what I continue to repeat now, while I try to write down what I am feeling in this moment. I arrived four years ago so I could try to win everything. Because even when you don’t manage it, a <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> player must always try. These were four intense years, experienced alongside great professionals, but above all real friends, with whom I shared victories and records, but also bitter defeats on the cusp of triumph. These are years in which I matured as a man and a father. This is the city where Edin grew up, becoming the biggest fan of this team, and where, with my family, we built the best memories of our lives<br /><br />I don’t think I can ever thank you enough, so: Thank you to the <a href="andrea-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> Family. Thank you to all those team-mates who shared this journey with me. Thank you to all the employees and members of the staff, who helped me to grow. Thank you to the fans who made me feel special every day. Because if there’s one thing I have learned, it’s that there is no minimum time in which you can fall in love. At the end of the day, it’s very simple: you wear this jersey like a second skin, you always give everything, and you’ll never go wrong. Now we don’t have much time to lose and there’s so much to win from here to the end of the season. Therefore, breathe, Mire. Because what today might seem so sad, from tomorrow will be a wonderful memory that you’ll keep in your heart for the rest of your life</p>
