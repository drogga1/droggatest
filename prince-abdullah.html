  <p><b>[New <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> owner defends dealings with Bin Laden family]</b> I get offended when people think bin Laden is a bad name. It’s a really good family. It had a black sheep as most families do but it’s a really respectable family and if I do business with them again, I’d be happy to. It’s not a disgraced name. I was trying to help Kevin sell his shares, I never put mine for sale. The family were looking to buy Kevin’s shares, and the million they put was a downpayment to give them time to do due diligence and if they decided not to buy, the money was to be used as a loan for a year without any interest. I’m usually tolerant but when people talk about Bin Laden as a dirty family I get offended. It’s not my family to support but I think it’s the right thing to say<br /><br /><b>[When asked if <a href="chris-wilder.html">Wilder</a> was safe from the sack]</b> I think would be crazy if I said no and the last time I checked, I was not crazy! Of course, we are blessed to have Chris. More important than results is the way we play; it speaks for itself. Chris is the face of this great club and as the crowd like to say, he is one of us. I have good harmony with Chris, and we will always work to this team better. I hope that five years from now, things will be much better, with Chris taking us to a better place</p>

  <p><b>[Manager <a href="chris-wilder.html">Chris Wilder</a> lands new contract with Sheffield United]</b> Chris has played an integral role in our recent and current success and we want him at the helm in the future, driving us forward, hence the new long-term contract. He is a dynamic leader, with whom the supporters connect and it is important that we have someone of his stature leading this club on the field. January is a very important month but securing the signature of Chris was paramount and underpins all the plans we have for the club over the next few years</p>

  <p><b>[Sheffield United repurchase Bramall Lane from former owner Kevin McCabe]</b> When I assumed sole ownership of the club nine months ago, I committed myself to preserving the club’s heritage, upgrading the club’s physical assets and improving the fan experience. The Covid-19 pandemic has certainly brought unexpected challenges but we remain dedicated to our original strategy and bringing the stadium and other properties under the ownership of the club is an important step in executing on this strategy. We now look forward to capitalising on this important step as we establish the Blades in the Premier League</p>
