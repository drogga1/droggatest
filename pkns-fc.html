  <p>[PKNS FC reward Razali and Aina with season-long VIP tickets] Following the security and the facilities issues for disabled people that went viral recently, PKNS FC has invited Selangor’s die hard fans, Razali and his daughter to come to our training session earlier. We promised that we will be more alert when dealing with such issues at Shah Alam Stadium and will work together with the security to ensure that such case will not happen again.</p>

  <p>[PKNS FC reward Razali and Aina with season-long VIP tickets. Razali said] Rela and Police have given us the clearence to watch the game from the track and Ain was very happy at that time. However, around 430pm, we were ordered by the security guards that we are not allowed to be at the track area. I explained to them that we already got the permission, but they insisted on removing us from the area, and followed us until we left the track.<br /><br />I feel very dissapointed because there are still officials or the public who are ignorant with the need of peole with disability [OKU]. I did this so that the everyone needs to know the OKU’s rights and not just blindly asked us to leave the place without any proper inquiries. I respect the authorities, but I don’t feel the love anymore</p>
