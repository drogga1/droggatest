  <p><b>[Orlando City provides A-League stadium blueprint. Populous designer Richard Breslin said]</b> Atmosphere is absolutely critical. What we work very, very hard doing now and what we’ve always spent a lot of time looking at is how do you get that intensity of experience when you’re actually there. What you really want is a continuous <b>[seating]</b> bowl. You want the seating bowl to wrap all the way around, you want to try and capture the atmosphere, the noise, the activity of the crowd. As soon as you start having gaps or breaks in the seating bowl, that’s when the atmosphere escapes.<br /><br />The other thing that we try to do is proximity to the field of play. People want to be as close as they can possibly be to the field of play. So we spend a huge amount of time when it comes to working on the geometry - what we call the cross-section - of the seating bowl to understand how we can get people as close as possible, with the best-possible sightlines<br /><br />One thing we did do at Forsyth-Barr Stadium in Dunedin was we built the shell and the fixed roof based on it being for 30,000 seats but then on the two short ends we built a concrete pad there and the venue managers, they owned 10,000 temporary seats. So we built 20,000 permanent seats and when they need to they can come in … and install the temporary seats in those ends</p>

  <p><b>[Cyle Larin drives on wrong side of road, charged with DUI in Orlando]</b> Orlando City SC takes great pride in the way it represents the Orlando community and expects all players, coaches and front office staff to uphold that standard at all times, both on and off the field. The club is very disappointed in Cyle Larin’s actions that resulted in this charge and does not take this situation lightly. We are working with local authorities, Major League Soccer and Cyle to take appropriate action in line with league protocol.</p>

  <p><b>[Orlando City has issued a statement addressing Kaka’s controversial red card against the New York Red Bulls on Saturday, saying the club disagrees with the decision but will accept the Brazilian star’s one-game suspension]</b> In the closing minutes of Saturday’s match between Orlando City and the New York Red Bulls at Red Bull Arena, Orlando City captain Kaka was issued a straight red card following a playful interaction with former teammate Aurelien Collin.<br /><br />Immediately following the Video Review of the incident, several Orlando City players and Collin approached the referee to explain the friendly nature of the situation<br /><br />After much deliberation, which included conversations about the global attention this incident is receiving from fans and media alike, the Club will respect the decision made by the Video Assistant Referee, the Professional Referee Organization and Major League Soccer to avoid further unjustified consequences that may come from appealing the decision made on the field<br /><br />Though Orlando City SC fully supports MLS, PRO and the new Video Review system, the Club does not support the notion that Kaka - a role model known around the world for his upstanding character and demeanor - is guilty of violent conduct, defined as an attempt to use excessive force or brutality against an opponent when not challenging for the ball. Moreover, we also do not believe he deliberately ‘struck’ an opponent or any other person on the head or face with his hand or arm during the match<br /><br />Kaka has only received two straight red cards in his illustrious club career, both of them in MLS. The Captain will accept the one-game suspension and help our Club and fans focus on the next task - the first home game in nearly a month for the Lions against a strong Eastern Conference opponent, Columbus Crew SC, at Orlando City Stadium this Saturday</p>
