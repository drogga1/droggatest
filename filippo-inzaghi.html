I wish him the best and appreciate Andrea as a player and a man. He will never feel like an opponent<br /><br />I am happy, as it’s a dream to end my career at Milan. I don’t think there were any alternatives, as what happened the other day at <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> was worth so much<br /><br />Everyone came together to make this dream come true of staying for another year. It’s wonderful that there wasn’t the slightest doubt, because we are united as men first and foremost</p>

  <p><b>[Filippo Inzaghi on <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a>]</b> <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> was uncertain whether or not to play me or Alberto Gilardino in the Athens final, but I played and scored twice. Then I scored in the Super Cup final win over <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> and another two against <a href="boca-juniors.html">Boca Juniors</a>. Five goals in three finals, which were three of the most important finals, and we won all of them. Not even <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> will achieve that. It’s a record I will hang on to</p>

He seduced me in five minutes. I realised that I was faced with a lad who was very open, kind and professional. What he has since done on the pitch proves I was right. His approach is perfect. I intend to marry him!</p>

I played with him and I respect him a lot. He doesn’t need money or glory. If he’s back, it means that he believes he can make a mark. It seems to me that he has already shown this during his first games. Even during his debut, his weight was noticed<br /><br /><b>[Waking a sleeping giant from its slumber is proving difficult]</b> It’s bad, but unfortunately it’s nothing new. But I know <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Paolo Maldini</a> and I trust him. I am sure that Paolo and <a href="zvonimir-boban.html">Zvonimir Boban</a> will get the club out of this situation. You have to reset, insert two or three of the right players every year and, above all, be patient. And you will need continuity in the management of the club</p>

  <p><b>[Filippo Inzaghi wants coronavirus-affected Italian season to be completed]</b> Talking about football is difficult. We have all taken a step back for our health, which is the highest priority. By the time everything ends, we want to start playing again - it would be the right thing. We all want to finish what we started eight months ago, and the championships must be finished. It would be the best solution to avoid misunderstandings and prevent someone from being damaged. We are ready to play in June, July and August: we want to end this championship, any other decision will penalise someone. We will go to the courts, some clubs will disappear, so football could risk losing two years, not two months<br /><br /><b>[Filippo Inzaghi has guided Benevento to 21 victories in 28 games so far this season, while brother <a href="simone-inzaghi.html">Simone Inzaghi</a> is enjoying a successful campaign in the top tier with <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>]</b> He is better than me in everything. I can only learn from Simone: he is a modern coach and seeing his <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> side is a spectacle<br /><br /><b>[Asked to name a player similar to himself]</b> I don’t like making comparisons, but I say that <a href="ciro-immobile.html">Immobile</a> is the best Italian player. He always scores, always decisive. He is the centre-forward that I like best</p>

We would give a very nice sign, truly incredible, if the whole city would decorate their balconies, windows, terraces and welcome the players, the technical staff and managers.Those who live in the alleys and not on the main street can be accommodated on the balcony or the terraces of a neighbour. I hope everything goes well</p>
