<blockquote>
  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> have been named as suitors of Sporting Kansas City’s teenage sensation Gianluca Busio, with the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> side’s director of scouting in Europe revealing the interest]</b> He’s a great talent. He is a player who can play safely in Europe. He has great technique, he is a smart player, a box to box and he works hard. For me, if he wants to be successful at a high level, he must change soon. If he wants to make a great career, he has to go to Europe soon. Then the coach will decide his future, and I honestly don’t think he will let him go because he is a great talent, a product of our youth sector and a player of which we are proud. Inter? Yes, I also know about <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. These are things that came out. We also had an offer, even if it was not from Inter. But we didn’t let him go. I don’t know if and when it will happen, maybe in a year or two. But what is certain is that the pressure on Busio is always greater, given the many clubs that are coming forward</p>
