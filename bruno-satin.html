  <p><b>[The agent of Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly, Bruno Satin, has refused to rule out the prospect of his client making a move to Chelsea]</b> Chelsea were interested but then they signed David Luiz and you also have John Terry and Gary Cahill at the club so there is a lot of competition there. So we will see what happens. A lot of the improvements that Koulibaly has made in his game has been down to the coaching of Maurizio Sarri. Whatever happens in the future will depend on the president <b>[Aurelio De Laurentiis]</b> and whether or not he decides to evaluate any offers that may come in.</p>

  <p><b>[The agent of Kalidou Koulibaly is tight-lipped on reports linking the Napoli defender to Chelsea]</b> I don’t know anything, neither do I know if Chelsea will qualify for the Champions League or not. It’s important to understand how the season will end because important players want to play the Champions League<br /><br />Is Koulibaly worth €100m? The market and president Aurelio De Laurentiis will decide because Kalidou has no release clause. The president may also decide to keep him because he considers him important for the team. I don’t know if these three games will be his last for Napoli because there have been offers every year, but Koulibaly has always ended up staying, so he won’t necessarily leave. It’s difficult to make predictions now, plus there’s also a need to understand what Sarri will do</p>

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri could impact Kalidou Koulibaly’s future]</b> Clearly this is a World Cup year, so it’s a particular year and we’ll have to see how the Sarri issue will end, that could definitely have an impact.</p>
