Football is sometimes unfair - sometimes it is in your favour, other times against you. We’ve created a family here. Everyone fought together, even those who did not play were backing us from the bench. We wanted so much to reach the final.<br /><br />I think they were better in the first 15 minutes. But then we had chances on goal. Even in the first half it could have been different. In the second half we controlled the game, we had several occasions where the goalkeeper saved or the ball hit a defender. But football is like this, whoever scores the most goals wins</p>

Zizou was very good to me as he was a professional, and I did everything for him; I ran, I fought, I played injured. Practically, I gave everything for Zidane.<br /><br />I had a very good relationship with Cristiano, his family and his girlfriend. I played nine years with him and it’s normal to be sad. <b>[I was also sad]</b> with <b>[the departure of]</b> Kiko Casilla, who was sitting next to me <b>[in the dressing room]</b>. Every day I was saying, ‘How are you Kiko, how are you doing?’ and now I have no one next to me.

  <p><b>[Marcelo reveals anxiety of playing in the Champions League final]</b> The pressure was the most intense before the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> final. Maybe people will think that is strange. We had already won two trophies in a row. Everybody on the outside wanted <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to win. So what’s the problem? Well, when you have a chance to make history, you feel that weight. But for some reason, I was really feeling it. I had never had such intense anxiety before, so I didn’t know what was happening. I thought about calling for the doctor, but I was worried that he wouldn’t let me play. And I had to play, 100 per cent. I had to prove something to myself.<br /><br />It felt like I had something stuck in my chest. This huge pressure. I am not talking about nerves. Nerves are normal in football. This was something different. I am telling you, brother, it felt like I was suffocating. Everything had started the night before the final. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t sleep. I was thinking only of the match. A little bit of nerves is normal in football. I don’t care who you are, if you’re not feeling anxious before playing in a final, you’re not a real person. You’re just trying not to shit your pants. It’s the truth, brother! So I was sitting at my locker, struggling to breathe, and I thought to myself, ‘How many kids in the world play ball? How many of them dream of playing in a Champions League final? Millions. Calm yourself. Lace up your boots, brother.’<br /><br />I knew that if I could just make it out to the pitch, I would be okay. For me, nothing bad can happen on a football pitch. You could be growing up in chaos, everything could be going crazy around you, but if you have a ball at your feet, you stop thinking. Everything is quiet, peaceful. When I finally stepped onto the grass, I was still having trouble breathing, and I thought, ‘If I have to die out here tonight, fuck it. I’ll die.’</p>

  <p><b>[Marcelo recalls a moment from the 2016 <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League final]</b> All of a sudden, I heard this tiny voice in the distance, so clear. ‘Go, Daddy, go!! Go, Daddy!!’ It was my son, Enzo. In that moment, I was cramping, and hearing his voice gave me so much strength</p>

Now we’re close to getting going again and we can’t wait. It’s been different to what we’re used to. We have to take the positives from it and now we’re used to the routine; it’s not like it used to be but everything’s good. We’re all healthy, the training sessions have been fantastic in recovering our rhythm.

  <p><b>[Marcelo is eager to point out that you win finals at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> The most important thing is that when we win a trophy, we don’t think about stopping and letting time go by. We always think about winning more, even if we’ve won three in a row. When I arrived, Madrid taught me to fight until the end. You win the finals. I’ve learned a lot with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> about this. When we think we’ve won everything, we want to win again.
