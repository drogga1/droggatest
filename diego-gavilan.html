  <p><b>[Former <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> midfielder Diego Gavilan has spoken of his shock at hearing news of <a href="gary-speed.html">Gary Speed</a>’s tragic death, and had high praise for the man who helped him settle in to life at <a href="newcastle-united.html">St James’ Park</a>]</b> <a href="gary-speed.html">Gary Speed</a> won the header and the ball rebounded to Alan <b>[<a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a>]</b>, he played a pass into the space in front of me seeing that I had made a run down the right and I picked up the pass, hit it across the goalkeeper and thanks to God it was a goal. <a href="gary-speed.html">Gary Speed</a> won the header and the ball rebounded to Alan <b>[<a href="alan-shearer.html">Shearer</a>]</b>, he played a pass into the space in front of me seeing that I had made a run down the right and I picked up the pass, hit it across the goalkeeper and thanks to God it was a goal. He would talk to everybody, to the young players the staff. He just said to me ‘cross me the ball, cross me the ball and cross me the ball,’<br /><br /><b>[The smiles end for a moment when the Guarani midfielder is asked about his former team-mate Speed]</b> I was on holiday, I found out on Twitter <b>[…]</b> it was such a shock. I’ll never forget that when I was called up to the 2002 World Cup … <b>[Speed]</b> came up to me and said ‘Congratulations because you are one of three players to represent us at the World Cup with <a href="shay-given.html">Shay Given</a> and Kieron Dyer’.<br /><br />At that time I wasn’t used that much in the first team and that gesture by him to get up and go out of his way to congratulate me is something I’ll remember. He was an example as a professional, a person and a father.<br /><br /><b>[In his first ever start for the club they faced treble-winners <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and as Gavilan raced for a pass over the top he was greeted by a stiff challenge from <a href="jaap-stam.html">Jaap Stam</a>]</b> <b>[Stam]</b> left his leg out for me and said ‘Welcome to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>,’. They weren’t happy, we won 3-0.</p>
