  <p><b>[Zlatko Dalić, Al Ain’s manager, has pointed out additional difficulties his team have to face in their game against Emirates in round 15 of UAE Arabian Gulf League]</b> We do not have many choices due to injuries and suspensions that force us to play several games within a tight schedule. We will miss a number of our regular players against Emirates. Our aim is to return from RAK with the three points regardless of our circumstances. The team who want to compete for the title have to overcome all circumstances, and we are aware that our mission against Emirates won’t be easy. In our game against Emirates, we will miss Mohammad Fayez, Fawzi Fayez, Saed Musabah and Mohammad Ahmed. They are expected to have returned by the end of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Dalic’s strategy]</b> My plan was that we share time for all our players because now is the last chance to check on some players before the World Cup. We have 20 very good players, I want to check everybody, but now is the last time to check them. Especially, about Luka, he was injured a month, he came back now and played in the game. It would be a big risk if Luka played two games in four days. I want to keep him for Real for Champions League and also for us. This was our plan. I think the most important of all is that we’re preparing this plan as well as possible. The plan was designed for everyone. It was each one’s individual decision <b>[whether to follow it]</b>. Fortunately there are concrete cases, Marco, has completed and gone through the plan. Also, Carlos. I think those two are two good examples that the plan is still being followed I wouldn’t say to the letter but 90 percent for the majority of our players. This is gratifying</p>

And I admired Southgate, he showed he’s a gentleman, a sportsman, he congratulated all of us individually on the pitch.<br /><br />In the morning ahead of the England match I had Rakitic with a fever of almost 39 degrees. Ante Rebic said he couldn’t play and I told them only those who were 100% fit will play. But at our last meeting ahead of the match they all said they are ready. And during the game as I wanted to make substitutions, all of the players kept saying ‘Not me, not me’</p>

But maybe. Now we have to try to do something big<br /><br />Throughout my career and my life I’ve always taken the hardest path and had to fight. I didn’t want to stay in Croatia, be a middling coach and live off handouts. So I went abroad. We are not respected in Europe, even though Croatian coaches like <a href="slaven-bilic.html">Slaven Bilic</a> and <a href="niko-kovac.html">Niko Kovac</a> <b>[manager of <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>]</b> have great results<br /><br />I started at the bottom of the ladders and in a year I was the best coach in Asia.

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo has seen his attitude slammed by Zlatko Dalic]</b> Ronaldo not attending the UEFA ceremony and those comments about Luka winning it… it is not worthy of my comment! It only proves what I keep saying: Ronaldo is an egotist and I’d never want him in my team! He is the kind of player that only thinks ‘no matter if we lose, the only thing that matters is that I score a goal!’.<br /><br />Luka Modric is a great player and person and all of the fame and glory, titles with Real, didn’t change him at all. He’s gone through things the hard way, but that’s the way every player should go, not leave the Croatian league at age of 18. It would have been too early for him to retire <b>[from international duty]</b>, he should be at his peak at Euro 2020<br /><br /><b>[On Mario Mandzukic]</b> Mandzukic called me one evening and we chatted for a long time about this and that… and the next morning he calls me again!? So I think ‘Why is he calling me now, we spoke last night?!’. It is then that he announced his decision to quit. Can you imagine, such a fighter, warrior, and he didn’t have the strength to tell me he will not play for Croatia anymore? That’s how hard it was for him</p>

He won’t be easy to replace, so we know we need to find different solutions</p>

  <p><b>[Zlatko Dalic’s side emerged unscathed from their encounter with five-time Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi in Russia]</b> For me, Leo Messi is the best player in the world, and he is showing that week after week. It’s harder for Messi to play for Argentina than Barcelona, and we tried to exploit what we considered small weaknesses in the Argentinian team. The key was to be disciplined and to follow our tactical game plan fully, and our players did exactly that. We tried to stop the ball from reaching Messi and to contain him quickly in the areas where he likes to receive the ball. As good as Messi is, football is a team sport and if one team performs better than the other it’s hard for any individual to turn everything around. Croatia were just a better team than Argentina in that game<br /><br /><b>[on Dejan Lovren]</b> Dejan is a great player and I think he shows that at Liverpool as well. It is not easy to play the centre-back position - you depend on the rest of the team. If the team plays well, and everybody is involved in the defensive play, it makes it easier for centre-backs. If they are left exposed in the big areas of the pitch, not even the best ones can stop the best forwards in the game. When Liverpool played well as a team, Dejan was also great - just like in the Champions League final where he was one of the best players. Our whole team played good, disciplined football during the tournament, and that makes it easier for the centre-backs, and Lovren and Vida played their part accordingly. He was surely among the best defenders at the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Many Croatian football fans may still be wondering if that Croatia team we saw crush Slovakia 0:4 in Trnava was made of magic]</b> Everything’s fine now. We played superbly, all 90 minutes, I said it was one of our best games since I have been the coach. I wouldn’t single out any players because they were all great. We played decisively, aggressively, dominated, we were what Croatia should be<br /><br /><b>[q: In public appearances before Trnava, Dalic announced a solid Croatia, however, during the week, some doubts were raised about how it would all end. Did Dalic believe this would be the result?]</b> This was intensified in the media, journalists emphasized the problems, but it wasn’t like that among us. I said the atmosphere was great, we were ready, and that I believed we would play the right game. We held a meeting together talking about where we are and what awaits us. Of course, the atmosphere is not like the World Cup, because the World Cup is something completely different, but the atmosphere in the team is great, and what <a href="dejan-lovren.html">Dejan Lovren</a> said was not interpreted correctly, it was put in the wrong context<br /><br /><b>[q: Dalic said that he’d let these two games pass, then deal with <a href="ivan-rakitic.html">Rakitic</a>. What will the outcome be?]</b> They’re not over yet. We have a game against Azerbaijan, and now we only have to think about that. No, it doesn’t make sense to emphasize anything about <a href="ivan-rakitic.html">Rakitic</a> right now. That’s what the media does<br /><br /><b>[q: <a href="ivan-perisic.html">Ivan Perisic</a> said that Croatia never played the way did against Slovakia in the World Cup, never for 90 minutes at that level of intensity]</b> It is true that we kept a high pace for all 90 minutes, that we did not stop even when the result was very favorable. We could have scored far more goals. Slovakia is a good quality team, but they are not like Argentina or England, it wasn’t that kind of high profile match, or like some others in Russia, which had their peculiarities. The World Cup is something extraordinary, but Slovakia looked bad because we didn’t let them play. We blocked them, they exploited themselves, they couldn’t develop their game. The development of the match was based on our merit<br /><br /><b>[q: What was the shock of being left without Tin Jedvaj on match day?]</b> When we were told that Tin Jedvaj had a more series injury, we didn’t want to risk anything. It happened to us three times that one of our backs had to come out early in the game and that disrupted us. We played great in Elche twenty minutes into the game against Spain, then Sime Vrsaljko was injured and we fell dramatically. The same thing happened with Vrsaljako at Wembley, where we were also good at the start, and Borna Barisic leaving Budapest is the third case. These forced substitutions turned out to have a bad effect on the team, and we were defeated every time. I didn’t want to gamble with Jedvaj, so it wouldn’t happen again<br /><br /><b>[q: Is Dalic satisfied with Bartolec?]</b> I did not like the option of putting Vida on the right back and <a href="aleksandar-mitrovic.html">Mitrovic</a> as the stopper as it would not affect the team well. Let the stopper play stopper; the right back play right back. If one falls, another specialist comes in the position. Bartolec was trying to make an impression at first, but later he let loose, fit in, played as I asked. He is our gain and we can certainly rely on him in the future<br /><br /><b>[q: Why were the attacking three <a href="ivan-perisic.html">Perisic</a> - <a href="vladimir-petkovic.html">Petkovic</a> - Rebic selected and Brekalo only introduced in the second half?]</b> I decided to play as we did at the World Cup, with Rebic and <a href="ivan-perisic.html">Perisic</a> on . the wings, as they can give the most. Rebic was a midfielder at <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht</a>, however, he plays there in the center, facing the opponent’s goal and has plenty of space. In the national team it is different, he is closer to the net, in a dense space, and does not do so well. This was evident during the match in Budapest when he was imprisoned and could not reap the benefits. That’s why I opted for such a variant<br /><br /><b>[q: <a href="vladimir-petkovic.html">Petkovic</a> was one of the best players in the match]</b> We need a striker who can hold the ball, and he is the only one in that picture. He is a great player, he danced around his opponents, created chances, scored. We prepared with these tactics and <a href="vladimir-petkovic.html">Petkovic</a> executed perfectly. In <a href="vladimir-petkovic.html">Petkovic</a>, we have the type of striker we didn’t have. I’ve said it could bring us a lot<br /><br /><b>[q: In addition to qualifying for Euro, it will also be a huge benefit to form a new core of the national team for years to come. But maybe already for 2020.]</b> If we qualify for Euro, then rejuvenating the national team will make sense. But one thing is clear: they need new aces, hungry, ambitious young men. I said that right after Russia. Brekalo, <a href="vladimir-petkovic.html">Petkovic</a>, Vlasic and some others are increasingly important to us<br /><br /><b>[q: Could Croatia be very dangerous at Euro 2020?]</b> I could tell you something, but this is not the time for such stories. First, we need to collect 15 points, and then we will talk about ambitions for the Euro. We need to stay with our feet on the ground. We only have nine points; this is not enough to qualify<br /><br /><b>[q: How did Dalic conclude that 15 points would be enough? Isn’t Croatia going to need more?]</b> I looked at the final qualification tables in earlier cycles. In a six-team group, more points are needed, 21 or 22, but when there are five teams in the group, 15 points are always enough to pass. That is why I say that this is the limit we must reach<br /><br /><b>[q: So, according to Dalic’s estimation, if Croatia defeats Azerbaijan and Hungary, they will celebrate qualifying for the Euros on October 10th in Split?]</b> That would be the best. According to our wishes. It doesn’t matter how we get those points, just get them in the account, but we want them as soon as possible<br /><br /><b>[q: It is not always easy for a mentality like Croatia’s to continue in a duel against the last-placed team in the table after a significant victory. Azerbaijan doesn’t have a single point, but we must remember what happened in 2015, when the two teams played 0-0]</b> The focus must be completely on Azerbaijan; they are motivated, they have shown in Zagreb that they are good and we have no right to relax. This situation reminds me of the post-Argentina atmosphere, when I said we had to be humble. We need to stay firm on the ground. If we don’t get Azerbaijan, we have done nothing<br /><br /><b>[q: And who congratulated Dalic after the big win in Trnava apart from <a href="mario-mandzukic.html">Mario Mandzukic</a>?]</b> Rakltic also congratulated me; he sent a message. Not only Ivan, but also Corluka, Vrsaljko, and many others. Most of the messages I have not been able to read, my phone is full</p>
