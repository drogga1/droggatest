  <p><b>[Why the old-school <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> shootout remains beloved 20 years later]</b> No other league in the world has the type of salary structure or roster and budget guidelines that we that have so there is some uniqueness. We also have to balance it with being authentic and understanding that this is the world’s game, that this is more than just the United States and Canada, that we are representative of this region<br /><br />What I’ll tell you is from a very selfish standpoint I love the shootout, and I would love to see it come back. I don’t think it’s going to come back but I personally really enjoyed that part of it, but I understand where we are today</p>

  <p><b>[How painted poles, pregame vomiting and a timely goal defined first-ever <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> match]</b> It was probably the field more than anything. We obviously played the Clash on the sixth of April and that was our first official match. We had had a long pre-season, a four-and-a-half-week pre-season where I think when we started, all 10 teams were in the same place in southern California. So it was an interesting way to start the league. Obviously the kickoff against San Jose was a great way, you know, to push the league forward. But I’ll tell you, that field was a really challenging place to play<br /><br />It’s a memory I have fondness for in a certain way as a defender and having to face Eric Wynalda on the 88th or 89th minute in a one-on-one, is not an ideal place to be. Nonetheless, I give Eric an incredible amount of credit for what he was able to accomplish. I do remember at the end of the game in the shower and coming out of our locker room, feeling obviously disappointed in the result, but I felt like the worst outcome we could have had was a 0-0 game, and that everybody had complained about soccer is boring, and that what Eric did and what the team did, what the Clash was able to pull off, the fans, they wanted to come back. They wanted to see another game and we really created a lot of momentum</p>
