  <p><b>[Aad de Mos says Anderlecht Under-21s boss <a href="craig-bellamy.html">Craig Bellamy</a> is nothing as a coach]</b> I saw <a href="craig-bellamy.html">Bellamy</a> at work at the Ottencup in Eindhoven. He knows nothing about it. I have never seen such bad coaching in the last five years at Anderlecht’s youth side. There was no structure in the game. After ten minutes I already understood that he really is nothing as a trainer</p>

  <p><b>[After a particularly disappointing showing in a 4-2 loss against Kortrijk last weekend, <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a>’s position at the club was questioned]</b> In football, you do not have to copy another coach. Kompany wants to do the same thing as <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> in <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and that makes me sick. He should have been forbidden to do both jobs. It is ridiculous. I would give Kompany time until the winter break, but if the results do not improve, we have to look at things again. Finishing the season with the current points average is not an option for a club like Anderlecht. He needs to take points in the next four games, otherwise he’ll be in the eye of the storm like all other coaches<br /><br />He should have been forbidden to do both jobs. It is ridiculous. Vincent is intelligent - he thinks during a match. It is normal that it affects him as a player when his team is not playing well. I would give Kompany time until the winter break, but if the results do not improve, we have to look at things again. Finishing the season with the current points average is not an option for a club like Anderlecht. He needs to take points in the next four games, otherwise he’ll be in the eye of the storm like all other coaches</p>
