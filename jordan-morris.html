  <p><b>[Jordan Morris on scoring his first goal for USA and why he will not leave Stanford University early to become a professional footballer]</b> Unbelievable. It’s something I’ve been dreaming about since I was a little kid, to start for the national team, and to score a goal was just amazing, especially against Mexico in front of a sellout crowd. But I won’t go pro now. Honestly, I just love it <b>[at Stanford University]</b>. The soccer, the school, just the atmosphere of being at Stanford is amazing. I realise that it’s something I’ll never be able to get back <b>[if I leave]</b>. I could go back and finish school in 15-20 years - hopefully after a long career - but this time, when you’re the same age as everyone, you have great friends, and playing soccer there is just an experience I’ll never get back</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Morris says Mexico forward Chicharito and Uruguay star Luis Suarez are among the influences on his style of play]</b> I watch as a casual fan, but I also definitely try to watch guys who play my position. They’re the poachers in the box who make these movements, or don’t make these movements, and how they get so wide open in the box to finish off these plays. For me as a forward, that’s always part of my game. What I’m trying to get better at is my finishing and in the box trying to be more of a poacher. So I look at Chicharito, Suarez, their movement and what they do to get open and make space for themselves and of course the finishing touch they put on it. I definitely like to watch guys like that to see how I can improve my game<br /><br />Honestly, they’re both pretty intense, both work you hard and get your heart rate up, trying to get your fitness going. Bruce’s sessions, they’re a little bit shorter I think and compact, but you get a lot of work in and definitely feel the effects afterward because it’s a tough training. I guess that’s a pretty big difference</p>

  <p><b>[On Michael Bradley and Jozy Altidore]</b> They’re always huge. Jozy’s free kick, you see the quality there, but in the locker room they’re such great guys that calm us down. They’ve been part of those big moments before, so for us it’s learning from them and trying to just be calm in those big moments and they really help with that.</p>

  <p><b>[After overcoming injury and expectations, Jordan Morris has grown into eattle Sounders star]</b> It’s just good to be back, playing in playoff games like this. Last couple of years I’ve been hurt, 2017 the majority of the playoffs, 2018 out for the whole playoffs. So, to be back in these games is just special</p>

  <p><b>[Once youngster, now leader: How Jordan Morris have grown as Sounders prepare for another <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup final]</b> I’m completely happy with my decision. I do get asked sometimes, but I have zero regrets. The team has been very successful and I’ve grown as a player here, especially this last year, I’ve continued to develop and grow. <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is growing and getting better and it’s exciting to be a part of that. But for me personally, it would be a dream come true to win <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup in my hometown. Obviously we got one before and that was super special, but to win one here in front of our fans, they deserve it. This city deserves it</p>
