  <p><b>[Manchester United (1) vs (2) Crystal Palace. Patrick van Aanholt claims to have known at half-time that Crystal Palace would not lose to Manchester United]</b> I saw space and as soon as I see space I want to go forwards. I know I have the pace. I hit the shot and it went in the back of the net. It’s three points. It was a very hard game. We dug in and luck was on our side today<br /><br /><b>[He added on helping Palace to a maiden <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> win over United]</b> There is a first time for everything. I think we played really well. I think we deserved the three points<br /><br /><b>[Daniel James eventually cancelled out Jordan Ayew’s opener in the 89th minute, but Van Aanholt was to have the final say]</b> I was gutted when that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> goal went in. We had worked so hard to get the clean sheet but I am delighted that we could counter and get them back. We knew they were going to have the ball, we knew they were going to attack. We have been working on that all week. At half time we knew we were not going to lose that game. We wanted the three points</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace defender Patrick van Aanholt is convinced that <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> is the best English full-back]</b> Better than <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a>? Without a shadow of doubt. They are different players. Defensively, Aaron is unbelievable, better than Trent. Yes, Trent has got his attacking and his corners, his right foot. But if you ask Wilf <b>[Zaha]</b> who he would want to play against, every other day, Trent or <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a>, I think he will say Trent<br /><br />I have got respect for Trent, because he does everything with his assists and he is great, but defensively, just ask Sterling how good <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a> is. It is a problem, and he will switch. He is one of the best right-backs, I think he could be, his attacking is good, but he needs more goals or assists to his name. Defending comes first, but in the modern game, you need to attack, and at United, you get more of the ball, so go forward and show what you have got, but he has been doing good</p>
