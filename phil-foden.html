  <p><b>[Phil Foden is keen to keep adding to his ever-growing trophy haul as England Under-21s prepare to get their European Championship campaign underway]</b> The collection is not too bad! The cabinet is getting full though. I might need a new one! Sometimes I walk past and just have a look, and realise I’ve won a lot already! The U-17 World Cup with England was the first, biggest one, that I won, and then I started winning trophies with City, cups and leagues. It’s hard to pick one! Every single one is special to me.<br /><br /><b>[Foden revealing that his very first taste of silverware holds a special place in his heart]</b> It was with my team the Reddish Vulcans, winning a little tournament, getting a medal. I still remember that. I was about eight or nine. Made me realise I want to win more and more<br /><br />It’s all about keeping winning the next thing, once you win one thing, you want to win the next thing. For me, I just love winning. Every game I go into I just want to win it. It’s the excitement of winning. And that’s what I want to do</p>

I’m glad to be back and feeling happy and sharp. I feel like I’m getting better and more mature and ready for any challenge that gets thrown at me. The manager has just told me to keep working. He’s not that kind of manager who gives you chances if you’re not playing well. You have to show him each day what you’re capable of and earn your chances</p>

I wouldn’t blame him. It’s massively important to start with a win. It gives your team a boost; when you don’t get off to a good start sometimes it can affect you. It’s going to take a couple of games. We can already see the potential that the group has and we are only going in the right direction</p>

He is the only player that can’t be sold under any circumstances - the only one. Not even for 500m euros. Phil’s going nowhere - Phil is City. We won’t be signing anyone else for that position. When <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> leaves, we know exactly who our new magician will be<br /><br />He’s grown up with us. He’s one of us and he’s going to be brilliant - one of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s best. One thing is clear, Foden has a place in City’s first team. I’d be interested to see if a different manager would have given him his chance to develop, or loaned him out. I don’t like leaving him out of certain games but must think of the whole squad. Phil understands that</p>

It’s a style of play that suits me best too. We don’t stop working either and one of the biggest things is the fact we all trust each other and work for each other. We attack and defend as a team and the minute we lose the ball we hunt to win it back<br /><br />My immediate target is to keep winning with City and play regularly. Beyond that who knows: having won the U17 World Cup it gave me that buzz and made me hungrier for more. To win it again with the first team would be the best.

  <p><b>[How Foden went from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> superfan to future superstar]</b> I was right behind the goal and saw it go in the net - I’ll never forget it. I remember the whistle went and everyone legged it on to the pitch! Me and my mum decided to go on as well. I remember seeing <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> getting swarmed and security guards around him trying to get him to the tunnel. It was just full of people; you couldn’t move. It was massive. I knew how big it was. I could tell by the reaction around me how big it was. I don’t think it will ever be done like that again; it was a special memory.<br /><br /><b>[Foden’s connection with the club already stretches back more than a decade]</b> The first game I remember going to was one Bonfire night (November 5, 2007), when they said I could walk out with a player. I think <a href="stephen-ireland.html">Stephen Ireland</a> scored on the night <b>[against Sunderland]</b>, so that’s my first memory. I would have been about six<br /><br /><b>[Ten years later, he was training with the senior squad]</b> It was crazy. Obviously, I was very nervous. I’d been going to games and watching these players and now I was training with them. It was an unbelievable experience the first time I went up. It didn’t take me too long to settle in because the lads made it comfortable for me. After my first game at the Etihad, I just felt more comfortable. You have all the nerves building up to it but then, you just play and do what you’ve always done<br /><br /><b>[Playing on the streets of Stockport helped to develop his touch, flair and a passion for the game]</b> I just love my street football; that’s what made me who I am. I think I have to stop a little because it’s an injury-risk. I don’t think City would be too happy if I got injured playing street football, so I don’t do it anymore. I train more than enough so I don’t need to be doing stuff like that. I used to love it as a kid, though. I think in pre-season I do it a bit to keep my fitness up because I really enjoy it<br /><br /><b>[It has already been two years since Foden won the Under-17 World Cup as part of an England squad that also included Borussia <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s <a href="rhian-brewster.html">Rhian Brewster</a>]</b> Honestly, they were unbelievable. I don’t think there was a better age group than ours. You can tell by how many have gone onto the first team; most of that team. It just shows how special that group was. We all keep in touch, we’re all good friends and we all try to help each other out. When you see someone make their debut, you’re going to message them. We’re all still so young, so it’s hard to say for now <b>[what we could achieve]</b>. But I’d like to think that in the future, something great could happen<br /><br />Sometimes I pop back over to the Academy and watch a bit of training and see how it’s going. There’s a lot of special talents over there. Hopefully, they can progress to the first team just like I did. Why not?</p>

I want to play for City in big games and I want to play for England. I am excited for the future so hopefully I will play regularly next year. I am so excited to see where that goes.<br /><br /><b>[Foden is considered to be the natural heir to <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> at City]</b> I remember thinking when I made the step up from the academy on the first day of training (with the first team) I was thinking ‘How am I going to handle this?’. But I fitted in quite quickly and training with such great players every day makes you better. It is not what these players ‘teach’ you, it is just watching them in training and playing against the likes of Silva. You have to (absorb) the things he’s done really well and make sure you take something from it every day. I am learning from him all the time. He amazes me all the time in training still. For instance, I’m amazed he is so strong for a little guy and defends really well<br /><br />Sometimes I do get sick of people saying ‘he’s only young’ and sometimes <b>[when I’m not picked]</b> I show respect because this is my boyhood club and I understand where the manager is coming from. But I believe that I can play in big games<br /><br />I would obviously like to be in the England squad sooner rather than later but I can understand Gareth <b>[<a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a>]</b> saying I haven’t played enough minutes.

I am still learning every day but I am happy to put performances in like that<br /><br /><b>[Foden is widely seen by many as the natural successor to Silva, but the player himself refused to be drawn on the matter]</b> How he plays today, he is unbelievable. I don’t want to think about it. I am just enjoying playing with him. He is a legend of the game</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Foden exclusive interview: <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> star on <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>, improvement, position and fishing]</b> You could probably see the smile on my face when I was celebrating. That is what I live for. These are the final moments of his career here so just to be on the same pitch as him right now is special for me. He has been a great player for the club and it is going to be sad to see him go. I am trying not to think about it too much and just enjoy my time playing with him.<br /><br />To be honest, I thought it was a bit cheeky of them to say that. I really thought David was going to have a go at them for that because it is a big statement. He has been my idol growing up. I have tried to learn from him as much as I can and take it into my game. It is not like I am trying to copy everything that he does but if I take his strong points - how he moves into spaces and receives the ball - it can only help me as a player. I think he has brought my game on massively.<br /><br />I am feeling really confident in front of goal. Every chance I get I feel like I am going to score. I just enjoy scoring goals and that is what I always want to do in training. I was in okay form before we broke up, if I am honest, but I have come back flying. Through quarantine I tried to work on some things like one-on-ones and come back stronger. I think I have had good start to the restart and I just want to keep the form going. Everyone is getting game time so I am really enjoying it at the moment.<br /><br /><b>[Pep <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> utilising him as part of the front three rather than in midfield]</b> He has told me that he likes me in and around the box.<br /><br /><b>[The 4-0 victory over <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was even more intriguing]</b> I played in three different positions in that game. I even went up front in the end. I enjoy playing anywhere. It is good if you can play in as many positions as possible. I can play in midfield as well as out wide. I want to play in these different positions. I want to be flexible. The defensive side of the game, pressing from the front and things. I think I have come on a lot more in the last year with that.<br /><br />I have become more physical up top and that is definitely helping my game. You obviously don’t have to be physical to be a footballer but it is good when you have that little bit of physicality and you can use it well. I don’t want to be too big but I just want to be big enough to give me that yard of space. It is something that I have been working on and it has come on a lot. It can still get better. I am still very young and have a lot of things to learn<br /><br /><b>[Patience has been justified. His commitment vindicated]</b> I have worked very hard for the starts and they do not come easy with the manager. He rewards you for training hard and working hard. If everyone sees me starting I know it is because I have earned that. It has not come easy<br /><br /><b>[How did he maintain his focus?]</b> First of all, it is just a love for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. Just having the patience. Wanting to be a massive player for this club. The determination I have inside me to train my best. Behind closed doors, that is what I do every day.</p>
