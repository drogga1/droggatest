  <p><b>[Luther Singh earned himself the first hat trick of the tournament when he scored his third goal in the 57th minute of the match]</b> We won against a very good team, as Cameroon showed tenacity in the whole 90 minutes of the match. We need to ensure that the players move game by game. We relied highly only on tactical abilities and the players managed to stay focused throughout the match.</p>

  <p><b>[Thabo Senong forced to make five changes to Amajita’s squad]</b> This is a minor crisis and something we have become accustomed to, but there is not much we can do about it. We have a pool of players that we are monitoring and therefore we are able to make changes going into the camp. Unfortunately, we are dealing with a difficult age group as these players break into their first teams around the same time we need them at the national set up,<br /><br />But I am happy for players like Reeve Frosler and Grant Margeman because they are getting the much needed game time at the highest level locally and this will help us going forward. I still believe such a training camp would also have helped in their development as players especially at international level</p>
