  <p><b>[Max Davis will create a little piece of history next month when he becomes the first male member of Avon Valley Runners to win an international vest]</b> I didn’t think I had that much chance of getting selected, so this has come as a real shock to me. My coach, Steve Williams, put me forward and we thought I might have an outside chance, but when I received the email saying I had been picked, it was such a surprise. It sounds amazing – and I still cannot believe it<br /><br /><b>[Davis has enjoyed a solid winter, finishing 31st in the English National Cross Country Championships, 40th in the Inter Counties and 22nd in the South of England Championships]</b> The selectors told me they were looking at head-to-head performances against rivals in my own age group, but I still feel that that Telford 10k is the best race I have done yet. It is a great honour to win my first England vest</p>
