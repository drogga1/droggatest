  <p><b>[Ugo Ehiogu: Former England defender dies after suffering cardiac arrest]</b> This is an incredibly sad day for the club and a tragic loss of a talented member of our <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> family. Ugo was an extremely popular and respected academy coach, a tremendous influence on our younger players, both in training and away from the pitch.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> has been sacked from his role as Tottenham coach, it has been confirmed]</b> We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the board has taken lightly, nor in haste. Regrettably, domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing. It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions - this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff - but we do so in the Club’s best interests. Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us. I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here. We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has suggested that Maurico <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> could return to manage the club in the future]</b> Why not? I don’t close the door on anything<br /><br /><b>[Levy admitted that sacking the likeable 47-year-old was difficult]</b> It is not something I ever wanted. Personally, it was incredibly difficult, I told him that and he understood. He’s been in football, he understands. It’s not personal and I’m sure he’ll come back stronger and get an opportunity to manage another great club. I’m not going to sit here and analyse the past. It’s not productive. Mauricio did a fantastic job, we are very grateful. I wish him all the best for the future. I’m still in contact with him. My relationship is very good with him. It just got to the point where it felt we needed a divorce<br /><br />Mauricio and Jose are great coaches. He did an amazing job and I’m sure Jose will do equally an amazing job in a different way. They are different, they have different styles and Mauricio took us a long way<br /><br />We are obsessed in this country with the longevity of the so-called ‘manager,’. In Europe it is normal every two years to get someone else. It isn’t personal. They don’t even sign five-year contracts. They sign for two years and then another coach comes in. There aren’t many managers that manage a club for five years. <b>[Sir]</b> <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a> and <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> is very, very, very unusual.

  <p><b>[Spurs chairman Daniel Levy hopes players &amp; coaches ‘do their bit’ during coronavirus crisis after cutting non-playing staff salaries]</b> The club’s operations have effectively ceased, some of our fans will have lost their jobs and most will be worried about their future. Our sponsors will be concerned about their businesses and our media partners have no certainty when we may play games again or whether we will be allowed to play in front of our fans. In the meantime, the club has an annual cost base running into hundreds of millions of pounds. We have seen some of the biggest clubs in the world such as <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> take steps to reduce their costs. Yesterday, having already taken steps to reduce costs, we ourselves made the difficult decision - in order to protect jobs - to reduce the remuneration of all 550 non-playing directors and employees for April and May by 20% utilising, where appropriate, the Government’s furlough scheme. We shall continue to review this position.<br /><br />When I read or hear stories about player transfers this summer like nothing has happened, people need to wake up to the enormity of what is happening around us. With over 786,000 infected, nearly 38,000 deaths and large segments of the world in lockdown, we need to realise that football cannot operate in a bubble. We may be the eighth largest Club in the world by revenue according to the Deloitte survey but all that historical data is totally irrelevant as this virus has no boundaries. We hope the current discussions between <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> and LMA will result in players and coaches doing their bit for the football ecosystem.<br /><br />I have no doubt we will get through this crisis but life will take some time to get back to normal. I hope we will never take for granted so many basic things such as getting off the train at Seven Sisters, walking along <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> High Road, entering our stadium with our family and friends, and buying a beer and pie ahead of watching <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> play at home. Many families will have lost loved ones, many businesses will have been destroyed, millions of jobs lost and many Clubs whether big or small may struggle to exist. It is incumbent on me as Chairman to ensure we do everything we can to protect our employees, our fans, our partners, our Club for future generations - and equally important - our wider community where we have such an immense sense of responsibility. I wish everyone good health, a speedy return to normal life and watching <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> at home in front of our fans. Stay safe.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, who came in for the brunt of the criticism regarding the club’s use of the furlough scheme, admitted his regret at having misjudged the situation]</b> The criticism the club has received over the last week has been felt all the more keenly because of our track record of good works and our huge sense of responsibility to care for those that rely on us, particularly locally. It was never our intent, as custodians, to do anything other than put measures in place to protect jobs while the club sought to continue to operate in a self-sufficient manner during uncertain times. We regret any concern caused during an anxious time and hope the work our supporters will see us doing in the coming weeks, as our stadium takes on a whole new purpose, will make them proud of their club</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham borrow £175m from Bank of England amid coronavirus crisis]</b> We have always run this club on a self-sustaining commercial basis. I said as early as 18 March that, in all my 20 years at the club, there have been many hurdles along the way but none of this magnitude - the Covid-19 pandemic has shown itself to be the most serious of them all. It is imperative that we now all work together - scientists, technologists, the government and the live events sector - to find a safe way to bring spectators back to sport and entertainment venues. Collectively we have the ability to support the development of new technologies to make this possible and to once again experience the passion of fans at live events.</p>
