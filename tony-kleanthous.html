<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Barnet owner and former FA board member calls for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> to help lower-level clubs]</b> My head is spinning with it, to be honest. I believe in doing these very difficult things properly and have had personal meetings with all the staff across the club and group to put them on notice. It has been really hard, a tough few days, since Friday, when <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, EFL and Women’s Super League suspended their matches and we could see what was coming. Apart from the players who are under contract, everybody who works here is under notice. Footballers are protected in the game, but my sympathies in this crisis lie with the cleaners, the receptionists, the marketing guys straight out of college, the match-day stewards who will lose their money which keeps them going in the week. These are the people nobody thinks of.<br /><br />I’m not looking for a handout from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but they have a duty to football. They have enjoyed their billions for many years, so maybe for one year they need to say they are not spending their money on massive players’ wages and are stepping in for football itself. What form that takes, I leave up to them</p>
