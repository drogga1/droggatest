  <p>[Coach Floyd Pinto says his team can ‘score more goals’!] The game [went] pretty well for us because we won 7-2. For us, we were playing Saudi Arabia. That was the level we set for us. We never knew what to expect from Singapore. But fortunately, we were much higher than the level expected.<br /><br />[Singapore] are miles apart [from Saudi Arabia in terms of quality] but hopefully we can control the game in the second half. We can be much more effective in the final third and score more goals. We usually don’t concede more than two goals against any side. So that’s something we can work on<br /><br />Don’t expect too many changes for the second game. If we’re going to play Saudi Arabia, we need that core of 13 or 14 players</p>

  <p>[Floyd Pinto - The engineer who became one of India’s foremost youth coaches] I have not played much at any level other than the Mumbai University level and Kenkre FC in the Mumbai Elite Division. At the same time, I was persuing my engineering as well. So it was difficult to manage.<br /><br />Through Don Bosco itself, the administrator Fr. Adolph [Furtado] got me into Kenkre FC as a part-time coach. Ever since I picked up there, I spent six years at the Kenkre academy as well as their I-League second division team as the head coach and head of youth development. At that point of time, I played with them [Kenkre] for a year but I soon realised that it’s not going to happen because you need that level of nurturing before you become a good player<br /><br />This is my third year with AIFF. I was with the same team when [Anirudh] Thapa and all were there, that was the Kalyani batch, when all the teams were shifted to Goa from Kalyani and Bengaluru. This group is a mix of Kalyani and Bengaluru boys. That time I joined as an assistant coach under Thomas [Joseph]. Six months into the job, I took over as the head coach. So it’s been effectively around two and a half years as the head coach.<br /><br />The group who passed out last year includes Thapa, Jerry [Lalrinzuala], Prosenjit [Chakraborty], [Baoringdao] Bodo - all of them who went to Chennaiyin FC and FC Pune City from the 1998 [born] group. That time [Shabir] Pasha was in charge of the 97 group, that was the then U-18 team. I was with the U-17 team and now officially two years with the AIFF Elite Academy, as it’s known as, which is the [India] U-19 team. So these are all the 99-born boys who are eligible to play for the SAFF [South Asian Football Federation] and AFC U-19 tournaments<br /><br />There are many [U-17] players who they kept back [from the Europe tour] because they wanted to have a look at them later on. All the players [who were in the U-17 World Cup team], including the injured players, will be called back in August in a view to assess them once the squad [under Luis Norton de Matos] come back from USA and Mexico<br /><br />[Pinto has been conducting trials to hunt for his final squad] We have to see how the boys [on trial] adjust to our training before knowing in about a week how the squad is going to shape and then we start shipping out the boys that we don’t want and keep the core</p>
