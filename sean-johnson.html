  <p>[New York City FC goalkeeper Sean Johnson for picking the Falcons to shut down the Patriots] Most def a Falcons pick! I see it being a little nervy to start but when it settles, 21-13 will be the final. Julio [Jones] is too much to handle.</p>

  <p>[On Patrick Vieira] [Vieira] is a very personable coach, but he’s really demanding as well. He finds the right balance of just knowing every individual in the team. Every player is held to the same expectation and he lets that be known from the first day. Everybody who comes to the club knows that no man is above the club.</p>

  <p>[James Sands began 2019 as a young prospect considered a long shot for regular minutes with New York City FC] He’s shown that he can not only play in the middle of the back three, but can also step into the midfield. He’s got the soccer IQ of a player that’s been playing years and years. I’ve seen a lot of young players come in and obviously it’s a lot to be tossed in for seven, eight straight games, and he’s handled it really well</p>

  <p>[Sean Johnson wasn’t looking to place blame on Zlatan Ibrahimovic following a short scuffle between the two] I don’t think there were any hugs, he is just a competitor. I think you guys will watch the replay and decide for yourselves, but at the end of the day, in the heat of the battle, you want to do what you can to protect the guys, make sure we see the game out no matter what and make sure they know we are here to play, we are not going to be walked over. I think in any moment, anybody is up for the challenge, including myself and you know, Zlatan is a talented player, he obviously knows what he is doing, he is a clever boy and you know, it is a part of the game.<br /><br />I would be frustrated if I were him too, you know, can’t blame him for his frustration at that point in the game. Obviously our boys did a job today to keep him off the scoresheet and he is only happy when he is scoring, so job done. We will take the three points and go back. I think we can look back and say we got the best out of the whole situation today</p>
