  <p><b>[New York City FC goalkeeper Sean Johnson for picking the Falcons to shut down the Patriots]</b> Most def a Falcons pick! I see it being a little nervy to start but when it settles, 21-13 will be the final. Julio <b>[Jones]</b> is too much to handle.</p>

  <p><b>[NYCFC breaks Red Bull Arena drought with big derby win]</b> The pressure on the ball from the front three really helped us out because they really weren’t able to create much in and around our 18 <b>[yard box]</b>. It was tough conditions being so hot, but we knew if we sat back they would create chances and Sacha would find pockets and get the ball to Bradley Wright-Phillips, but instead we limited him to no shots on goal and that’s a testament to all 11 players.</p>

  <p><b>[Sean Johnson returns to scene of his Nashville nightmare a better goalkeeper]</b> We’re staying at the same hotel, we’re training at the same field, playing at the same stadium. It’s not like it’s some dark shadow hanging over my head. Situations like that happen to goalkeepers, it’s cool. Nashville is a great city and when I walk into the stadium on Saturday I don’t think any negative emotions will pop up.<br /><br />Looking back on that situation I really don’t know why I wasn’t playing last year. It’s not something that was really ever communicated to me clearly. For me, the most important thing was that I learned a lot in those months when I didn’t play. As a player you go through certain moments in your career that define your career and either help press you forward or take you backwards, and I think I used it as positive motivation<br /><br />Being able to talk to him through that situation definitely helped. He’s a really genuine guy, a good dude and it’s been great. Ever since we’ve kept in contact and stayed close. He’s been really good for me in helping relate to my experiences<br /><br /><b>[Johnson and Robles are on opposite ends]</b> It’s really cool to compete against him, and also have that relationship off the field. And I think it’s going to be a good one for years to come<br /><br />At the end of the day I ended up in a great position, at a great club, and I’m happy now. I expected <b>[NYCFC]</b> to be top notch, and to have great players, but it’s exceeded all my expectations<br /><br />I never really got a chance to play in a system where building from the back was such an important part of the team’s tactical approach. They’ve always been skills that I’ve had, but being in that environment has allowed me to sharpen my skills. I feel like I’ve gotten better in New York because I’m doing it day in and day out, using the talents that you have allows you to sharpen that<br /><br />As a young guy you want to get in and work hard and learn as much as you can about playing at that level, and it was obviously a good group of guys to learn from. As you experience things, as you grow as a player, things change as far as your mentality. Now, being with New York, and with me and the club doing well, you want to look to press on to be the main guy for the U.S. That’s got to be the mindset now<br /><br />I think going through that showed me that you can be rivals but there’s still that bond you have, that we’re in this together. We’ve been competing with each other for years. I’ve been his backup before. He’s been my backup before. And when we go against each other we’re always trying to outdo each other. There’s a respect there for sure, but I think it’s just a case of us both being very competitive</p>

  <p><b>[On Patrick Vieira]</b> <b>[Vieira]</b> is a very personable coach, but he’s really demanding as well. He finds the right balance of just knowing every individual in the team. Every player is held to the same expectation and he lets that be known from the first day. Everybody who comes to the club knows that no man is above the club.</p>

  <p><b>[James Sands began 2019 as a young prospect considered a long shot for regular minutes with New York City FC]</b> He’s shown that he can not only play in the middle of the back three, but can also step into the midfield. He’s got the soccer IQ of a player that’s been playing years and years. I’ve seen a lot of young players come in and obviously it’s a lot to be tossed in for seven, eight straight games, and he’s handled it really well</p>

  <p><b>[Sean Johnson wasn’t looking to place blame on Zlatan Ibrahimovic following a short scuffle between the two]</b> I don’t think there were any hugs, he is just a competitor. I think you guys will watch the replay and decide for yourselves, but at the end of the day, in the heat of the battle, you want to do what you can to protect the guys, make sure we see the game out no matter what and make sure they know we are here to play, we are not going to be walked over. I think in any moment, anybody is up for the challenge, including myself and you know, Zlatan is a talented player, he obviously knows what he is doing, he is a clever boy and you know, it is a part of the game.<br /><br />I would be frustrated if I were him too, you know, can’t blame him for his frustration at that point in the game. Obviously our boys did a job today to keep him off the scoresheet and he is only happy when he is scoring, so job done. We will take the three points and go back. I think we can look back and say we got the best out of the whole situation today</p>
