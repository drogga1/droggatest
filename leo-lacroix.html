<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Hamburg’s Switzerland international Leo Lacroix has heaped praise on Granit Xhaka]</b> I’ve played with <b>[Xhaka]</b> in the Swiss Under-18 and U-19 teams, then he went straight up <b>[to the seniors]</b>. He has enormous quality, he can make the difference with his passing, his ball recovery, his goals, he’s a true playmaker. He’s the captain of Switzerland and the team is built around him. He plays as a starter in Arsenal. Everything that happens to him is well deserved because he’s a true worker.<br /><br />In Germany, stadiums are full from the first to the third division. People really live for football. Even for unknown teams from the lower divisions. There’s a fanbase, a structure in Hamburg but also in other teams. In terms of fan culture, this is very close to what you can experience in England. Would I play for Hamburg next year in Bundesliga? Absolutely. I have a clause in my contract and if the team goes back up, I can decide to stay. 	I’ll discuss this with my family when the time comes. For now, I’m focused on the club’s main objective</p>
