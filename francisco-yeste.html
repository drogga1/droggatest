  <p><b>[Athletic Club legend Francisco Yeste admits <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> remains a spectacular talent]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has had many years at the highest level and I think he still has that level, but perhaps he is not as decisive as he used to be. His performances are still spectacular though<br /><br /><a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> as a free-kick taker has improved a lot in recent years. I’ve read about him admitting that he has worked so hard on becoming more effective in that area, and he did it. He is now very effective in that aspect, as he is in most other departments, and is the best in the world<br /><br /><b>[Yeste surprised that the Catalan giants took the decision to part with Valverde]</b> I don’t understand <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s decision on Valverde. He is such a great professional and always showed a lot of respect to the players and the club. It is true that maybe the team wasn’t playing that good but their stats were still impressive. Maybe the Champions League defeats had a big influence on that decision, but he had great qualities for Barcelona<br /><br /><b>[Yeste admits that Athletico Madrid face a big ask to reach the last four, but believes anything is possible in a one-off encounter]</b> For Athletic it is going to be very hard because this is a tough rival, but they have already shown they can defeat this <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> side so why can’t they do it again?</p>
