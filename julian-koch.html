  <p><b>[Former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> midfielder Julian Koch has revealed that he was hours away from having his leg amputated after a horror knee injury in 2011]</b> We got there at half past nine and the ER doctors immediately said that an emergency operation was necessary. When I woke up from it, the first information I received was that I would have lost my leg if we had arrived for the scheduled <b>[MRI]</b> appointment at 3pm<br /><br />During this time, the leg was open almost every day, it was incredibly painful. I waited like an addict for the pain pump to work again because I couldn’t stand it. After the first three or four weeks, it felt like I had been in the hospital for half a year<br /><br />The best coach of my career was <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a>. I had a huge desire to start training with him every day because you knew you were learning something new. It was such a cool conversation that really blew me away</p>
