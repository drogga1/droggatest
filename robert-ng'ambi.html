  <p><b>[Black Leopards midfielder Robert Ngambi has backed new coach <a href="cavin-johnson.html">Cavin Johnson</a> to change Lidoda Divha’s fortunes, saying they are not worried about relegation]</b> It’s a great thing to have a coach like Cavin. I worked with him for more than five years at Platinum Stars. He’s like a father-figure. He understands the players and he understands the game. He comes with a lot of experience. It’s a good thing for the younger ones because he is a coach who likes to promote the youth and likes to work with younger ones. For us, it’s a bonus and a good thing to have him here at Leopards. It’s great news for us.<br /><br />Our ambition is to see ourselves in the top eight. We still have a chance. We know it’s not going to be easy but with the team that we have and the supporters that we have, I think we can use that to our advantage for us to be in the top eight. It’s important for us to remain focused and try to work hard and achieve that. It’s possible. We are not concerned much about relegation. We just look at ourselves and with quality that we have in our team, I don’t see us fighting relegation. We want to finish in the top eight for our fans because these people deserve a lot. We have a huge number of supporters here in Venda and we can’t disappoint them.</p>
