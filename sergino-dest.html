Hopefully I will have decided by next month but if I need more time I’ll take it.</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax teenager Sergino Dest has chosen to represent the United States at international level]</b> I have chosen to play for Team USA going forward. I have based this decision on my feeling, however, it was a tough one. Of course, it was a tough decision for me when the Dutch men’s national team showed their interest, but I have built up a very good feeling with Team USA over the last couple of years and I strongly believe in the plans and potential of U.S. Soccer. I am therefore dedicated to making the next 10-15 years a big success and will do my utmost to help the team play for titles<br /><br />I have personally informed the national team coach <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Ronald Koeman</a> because I respect him greatly and didn’t want him to learn from the press. He told me he was disappointed, however, he respected my choice, as in the end it’s my life and I have to live with the choices I make, good or bad</p>

  <p><b>[The American dream! Sergino Dest’s commitment a much-needed win for struggling USMNT]</b> I have played there throughout the youth teams and they embraced me from an early age. In the Netherlands, you would play among the best players in the world and they have a great team. That would have been amazing. In the end, it was a decision based on feelings and emotions, and therefore, I chose Team USA</p>

I want to play one time in my career for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. That’s my biggest goal. I also want to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the biggest league in the world. Right now, I’m not ready for it. I still have to develop a lot of things, but I think I have the potential to reach it<br /><br />A lot of people, they were talking about my decision and some people said I was dumb. Some people appreciated it, but I think it’s a decision for me. It’s my life. I decide what I do in my life and if people don’t want that, that’s their problem. I talked with my family and my friends and they said, ‘you just have to follow your heart’. I said that I think America is the best decision for me. My whole youth, I played for the U.S. They believed in me. That’s why I chose them. They believed in me during the hard times, so that’s why I chose them<br /><br />I believe in them. I think all the young players have developed very well. We’re going to have a different team in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Sergino Dest admits his decision to commit to playing for the United States rather the Netherlands has drawn a mixed reaction from his <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> teammates]</b> Some of them, they didn’t like it. Some of them, they said just: ‘Congratulations: You followed your heart.’ So that’s always good. It’s a hard decision, of course, because you are for both of them. I just made my own decision. It’s my life. If it’s not working out well. I’m the one who is dealing with the trouble. I think I made the right decision.

My decision that I made, I listened to everybody’s advice, but it’s just a decision I’m making<br /><br /><b>[Dest also says his father would have backed him even if he had decided to represent the Netherlands instead]</b> I think if I go play for the Netherlands, he would also be happy. He’s just happy when I’m happy. He’s a dad. They’re just like, ‘OK, if you want to make that decision then, it’s your life. You have to make your own decisions</p>

This is official, so it feels like there’s no way back any more. I’m proud. It’s an honour to play for the national team<br /><br />It’s just a great feeling, to play your first official game for your country. I’m glad that I made this choice<br /><br />I think I just don’t play with stress. I’m never scared to lose a ball. If I lose a ball, I lose a ball, but if you don’t play with confidence, you’re never going to play a really good game. That’s why I always play with confidence. If I lose the ball, that’s it</p>
