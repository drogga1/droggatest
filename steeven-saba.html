  <p>[Coach Marc Collat mainly instructs in French on the steamy morning, but there’s also a strong Haitian Creole influence. As the session ends, a number of players chat with each other in English] Whenever we get together we try to be as much of a family as we can.</p>

  <p>[Haiti’s players left NRG Stadium in a jubilant mood Saturday night after scoring three second-half goals to top Canada 3-2 and move into the Gold Cup semifinals] It feels amazing. I have to tell you, we’re a group of fighters. Every time you get a win like this, you get more excited. You get momentum going. Coming down 2-0 at the half, just like we were losing in the group stage, it always feels amazing.</p>

  <p>[More than a Vela lookalike: Haiti’s Steeven Saba bouncing back after injuries kept him away from soccer. Saba never was able to make good on the promise of playing in Europe, his career derailed by not one, not two, but three knee surgeries] You can’t do what you really love to do. You can’t show the world what you can do. To be honest, it was the worst moments of my life. I can’t thank my parents and my brother and sister enough because if it wasn’t for them I wouldn’t be here today.<br /><br />[If Haiti were to somehow do the same Tuesday and beat Mexico, Saba has no doubt his emotions would overcome him once again] I’d cry on the field again. I’d be the happiest person ever. In Haiti everything is hard. We’re fighters. We’re warriors and we’ll see where it goes from there. I think the entire team is confident. I can’t wait to start the game</p>
