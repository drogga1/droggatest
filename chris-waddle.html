  <p><b>[The team’s supporters rushed to deny the allegations, feeling that such a scandal would cheapen their club’s achievements]</b> With unemployment at 18 percent and the municipal finances in anaemic shape, Marseille’s footballing hegemony represents one of the few sources of civic pride for a population long frustrated by the Paris-dominated centralism of the French state. To defend their football dream many have adopted a siege mentality, refusing to give credence to tales of wrongdoing and ever willing to explain the scandal as a Parisian plot to destroy Tapie and his club<br /><br /><b>[What remains untainted, however, was the beauty of his team’s play and the style with which they attacked]</b> The way that they played, the role that I was given, the team structure, the players that they had – we just had an unbelievable team.

  <p><b>[Chris Waddle admitts he doesn’t think Gazza move to Old Trafford would have worked]</b> He would have drove <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> up the wall! I’m going no.<br /><br />I think Paul was very much an individual. He liked <a href="terry-venables.html">Terry Venables</a>, I think they had a great relationship. Terry knew what buttons to press with Gazza. He knew he was a loose cannon. If you just got him on the park that was the safest place to put him because we didn’t know what else he’d be doing if he wasn’t on the park. You just look back and think Terry handled him very well.<br /><br />I think maybe Sir Alex with his Iron Fist, I don’t think Gazza would have enjoyed that. Gazza wouldn’t have enjoyed being bullied and intimidated at times.<br /><br />There was a lot of players coming towards the end of their time. I remember <a href="viv-anderson.html">Viv Anderson</a> was there, <a href="bryan-robson.html">Bryan Robson</a>, Norman Whiteside, and <a href="paul-mcgrath.html">Paul McGrath</a> and I think at United they were sort of known as liking a drink.

It would have been interesting, I’m going to say no it wouldn’t have made a difference</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Bruce has been warned that he faces a ‘massive challenge’ if he does become the man to succeed Rafa Benitez at Newcastle]</b> The Newcastle job is a massive ­challenge for Steve Bruce. Don’t get me wrong, Newcastle are a huge club, but he’s having to follow ­Benitez, who has been one of the most popular ­managers they’ve ever had. So he’s got his work cut out – it’s the biggest job he’s taken on<br /><br />I would have thought that Old Trafford would have been the job he has always wanted. He’s managed Sunderland too, of course, which the Newcastle fans will pick up on very quickly. I don’t think he’s scared of a c­hallenge, and he’s had some success at a few clubs, and not much success at others. I like the bloke. He talks a lot of sense and wants his players to work hard. He knows the Geordie public, which will stand him in good stead. If he keeps Newcastle up, he will have done well. But he’s not daft – if it isn’t working out, he’ll ­expect a lot of pressure from the fans and the owner</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Waddle says <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> has the potential to help England to Euro 2020 glory]</b> Where is <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a>? It is a mystery to me. England can win Euro 2020 next summer and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s teenage midfielder should be in <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>’s side to help them try. If he was playing regularly for City in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, then he would be doing the same for England. I have no doubt about that. At 19, he is good enough to do both - he is that special. As well as his ability on the ball, what I really like about <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> is that he gets in the box. But he appears to be stuck on the fringes of City’s first team and we are left to wonder why he is not getting any game time this season while his manager <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> tells everyone he is the most talented player he has ever seen.<br /><br />It does not add up. I am not saying that <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> must leave City, far from it. But I am thinking of his development, and something needs to change. He needs to be playing top-level football now, and he should be asking <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> why he isn’t giving him any if he rates him so highly. If I were him, I would be kicking <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s door down, saying: ‘Look, I need to play because I am missing out on so many opportunities here<br /><br /><b>[Waddle added on the challenges facing <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> in a squad which swept to an unprecedented domestic treble last season]</b> Of course, I can understand why <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> is not playing much. City have got so many star names and big hitters who are playing well, so <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> faces a battle just to get on the pitch ahead of Kevin De Bruyne, <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> or <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a>. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s emerging players are in a different situation because of their club’s transfer embargo, but <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> must have seen Blues forward <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> come on in England’s past two Euro 2020 qualifiers and thought: ‘That should have been me’. <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> has still shown us his talent when he has played for the England Under-21 team - look at the goals he scored this month - but that is the only platform he has had. It has meant he has fallen behind Mount in the pecking order, and there are probably four or five players ahead of him for a place in the senior squad right now. That is not going to change while he is a bit-part player at Man City<br /><br /><a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> is seen by many as being the natural successor to <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>, who is leaving City at the end of the season, and it could be that <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> has told him that he will eventually get his place. But that does not help him now, and it is not enough to just say he is one for the future any more. Football does not work like that and if <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> does not do something about his situation, the season will go very quickly. He could end up wasting it</p>

It seems that big clubs need to be linked with big names but if I was <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> I’d have a look first at Troy Parrott before charging into the transfer market. He’s only 17 and has just a handful of first-team appearances under his belt but I’ve seen him play and I like what I see. In fact, the first thing you notice about Parrott is how similar to <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> he is. He’s not blessed with an unbelievable turn of pace but he definitely knows where the goal is.<br /><br />If I was <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> I’d give him a go. The young lad will have the crowd on his side and if he gets a goal or two his confidence could go through the roof. That’s how it all started for <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a>. And if it has not worked out in a couple of weeks, and <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> looks like he might be out for a while, then maybe sign someone until the end of the season. That, of course, is presuming <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> is prepared to finance such a move. He might well have decided that <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> will get money to spend in the summer and that he’s not going to do any panic business now</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Waddle says <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> would be a welcome addition back at Tottenham]</b> <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> might be a short-term solution to <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s goalscoring woes but I wouldn’t be breaking the bank to bring him back. I’m a big fan of <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>, I think he’s a wonderful player and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans would welcome him with open arms. But you’ve got to ask yourself what would you be getting for a vast sum of money. Is he on the pitch enough to make the investment worthwhile?<br /><br />You look at <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and they are on the pitch for 90 per cent or more of the season. <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>? Probably nearer 50 and he’s not getting any younger. If it was the right deal at the right price then without a shadow of a doubt you’d snap him up. But if you were expecting to have to fork out £300k a week or more then I’d be looking elsewhere<br /><br /><a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> knows he needs a new frontman with <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> out for a while but they aren’t easy to come by in the transfer window. <a href="son-heungmin.html">Heung-Min Son</a> and <a href="lucas-moura.html">Lucas Moura</a> can do a job up top on their own but for all the threat they offer, they haven’t got the same presence as Kane in the box which teammates are looking for. They need someone getting on the end of chances and maybe someone like <a href="luka-jovic.html">Luka Jovic</a> is the answer. I know there has been an interest.<br /><br /><a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> seem to be saying that they want him to bed in there rather than go anywhere, yet he’s obviously struggling in Spain. There were big expectations when he came from Germany, where he was prolific in a really good Frankfurt frontline in a league where there are lots of goals scored, but <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> is tougher. It might be a good bit of business for Madrid to say to Spurs: ‘You can have him until the summer, see if you can get him up and firing and then we’ll have him back</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Waddle says Giovani <a href="giovani-lo-celso.html">Lo Celso</a> could prove to be a £30 million ($39m) steal for Tottenham]</b> <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Steven Bergwijn</a> couldn’t have enjoyed a more sparkling debut for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> though the player I think who could make even more difference on the run-in is Giovani <a href="giovani-lo-celso.html">Lo Celso</a>.<br /><br />The Argentinian star is only 23 and struggled to make much of an impact when he first arrived at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. But it seems to me that as soon as he knew <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> was on his way he thought this is my chance and he’s blossomed. He’s hungry, he’s confident, he looks a real player and 18 months from now <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> may well be thinking he was an absolute steal at £30m.<br /><br /><a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Bergwijn</a> needs to add consistency to his game. You look at him and you see a player who’s good on the ball, can spot a pass, can go past players and can score goals. So you’re immediately wondering why he’s not been snapped up by a bigger club before. My sense is that he’ll drift out of games and that might frustrate fans. But if he can sustain his appetite – and with a place in the Holland squad to nail down before the Euros he will certainly be trying – then he’ll be a hit<br /><br />I think <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>’s injury is a blessing in disguise for England – and I don’t think it’s proving such a hindrance for <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> either. <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> last played a game on New Year’s Day and if you believe <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> it’s quite possible he won’t appear again until May. From a <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> perspective that might sound like a nightmare scenario – although it’s interesting that even without him they are up to fifth in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and still in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup.<br /><br />From an England perspective going into Euro 2020 we may well be getting a fully fit, fully refreshed <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> leading our line and that would be fantastic news. Obviously <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> will be having a fairly constant dialogue with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> and he would obviously like his captain to play a game or two before the season is over. But even if <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> is only 80 or 90 per cent fit going into June, <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a> will take him to the Euros because even off the bench he is a match-winner</p>

  <p><b>[Spurs legend Waddle believes <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> have to consider dropping Republic of Ireland international Parrott into their starting XI, with the exciting academy graduate really to follow in the footsteps of illustrious teenage stars before him]</b> You only need to look at the likes of <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> and <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> to see what can happen if you take an early punt on a young striker. <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> was just 16 when he scored for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> with <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> hailing him the brightest talent this country had. Injuries offered <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> a chance when he was a teenager and he scored two goals in a European game for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, kept his place and scored two more against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> three days later. Sometimes you have to give a young striker a go – and now’s the time for <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> to give Troy Parrott a shot<br /><br />Let’s not forget that he’s a full international – he played for Ireland against New Zealand in November – so he’s not a stranger to playing at a high level surrounded by top players. I don’t think <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has much choice or <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s top-four prospects could be in real trouble. He complained on Wednesday that several of his players are jaded and fading. Well, Parrott isn’t. He could be the answer and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans would give him a chance. They’ll be right behind him because he’s one of their own having come through the academy.<br /><br />Now he might crash and burn – but he also might be a natural and take to <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football like a duck to water, like <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> or <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> did. It’s hard to question <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> because of everything he has achieved down the years but I’ve never quite got his reluctance to take chances on kids. If <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> thinks Parrott is going to be so good in three years that he deserves a new contract, then he should have faith in him being good enough now</p>

I also don’t understand why he didn’t play at Sheffield Wednesday in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup just a few days after his man-of-the-match display against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> at Wembley. I’d like to think that perhaps <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> is actually paying him a compliment by keeping him back for the Manchester derby because Kevin De Bruyne is injured. But I’d be playing him all the time because he’s full of energy, young, confident and it isn’t as though he needs a rest.<br /><br />There’s a lot of talk of <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> and <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a>, but this kid’s as good as them if not better. If he was playing week in, week out, he’d be in the England team, never mind the squad. But it’s easy for <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> not to pick him because he could argue that he’s not playing enough first-team football. There is no doubt that if he was playing more at City he’d be ahead of <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> and Maddison but he’s suffering by being at a club full of superstars.<br /><br />He must have the patience of a saint. If I was him I’d be knocking <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s door off its hinges demanding to play because it’s quite possible that this lack of playing time will cost him a place at Euro 2020 and that would be a real shame</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Waddle says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> are biggest challenge <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has ever faced]</b> Managing <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> is the biggest challenge <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> has ever faced – but I still think it’s too early to judge him. He inherited from <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> a squad who were struggling in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and clearly in need of a revamp. His first job was to instil some belief and get them climbing the table again and he’s done that to the point that they are right in the hunt for a Champions League spot. And they need to be in the top four. They’ve got bills to pay – the new stadium wasn’t cheap – and they need to attract the best players, so they have to be in the top competition<br /><br />Suddenly they have lost two goalscorers and results have started to go against them, they are out of <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and probably heading out of Europe, and people are questioning <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>. But I don’t think this is his side yet and you can tell that by the number of goals they are scoring and conceding. <br /><br />Everybody thought life would be boring under <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> with a lot of 1-0 wins and the bus being parked, yet we’ve hardly seen that. Goals have been flying in at both ends of the pitch which isn’t what we associate with a <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> team.<br /><br />It’s quite possible he has just looked at the squad and thought I haven’t got what I need to play the way I would like so I’m going to have to go a different way – almost the old <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> way – and now let’s just see if we can score more than the opposition.<br /><br />He has to get through this season and rebuild in the summer, and I reckon you’ll see a proper <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> side turning out in August. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> hasn’t won two Champions Leagues and countless trophies throughout Europe’s big leagues without knowing what makes a good team and he will know exactly what is required to transform Tottenham<br /><br />He says he’s not looking to change too much, which is out of character for him, and I’m not sure I believe in him. He needs a right-back, he needs a centre-back and he needs at least one holding midfielder to add some protection. He also needs another central striker to back up <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> – although if you believe what you read Kane might not be at the club next season. I don’t know whether that is true or not but it’s another potential headache for <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> to have to deal with</p>
