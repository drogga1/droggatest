  <p><b>[Croatia goalkeeper Danijel Subasic recounting the way he went about saving Sergio Ramos’ penalty]</b> Penalties are a lottery. The guy from Czech Republic <b>[Tomas Necid]</b> smashed the ball well, this time I waited a little and made a good save. <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a> sent a message through (Darijo) Srna to wait for <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Ramos</a> and that he will shoot to my right side. And that’s what happened</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic has revealed that opponents are starting to go to extreme lengths to quell the threat of 18-year-old star Kylian Mbappe]</b> In the League Cup final we lost 4-1 to PSG and Silva was snapping at Mbappe from the first to the last minute. He really tackled him hard, you could see he went for him and wanted to ruin his confidence. In locker room Mbappe was very sad, almost cried, he was really down. I felt sorry for him so I hugged him and told him those things are normal because he had shown everyone how powerful he was and in future everyone will go after him that way.<br /><br />No wonder everyone is crazy about him, he is amazing, plays great and is only 18. He runs like he’s riding a motorbike! He has no respect! Which is good, but at the same time in our locker room he is very calm, polite, never pushes himself in front row…The guy is great, normal, not flying high. Everyone talks about hundreds of million euro that are waiting for him somewhere and still his mother or the club’s driver takes him to training every day! And believe me, you haven’t seen everything from him! I see every day at training how good he is.</p>

  <p><b>[The Coupe de la Ligue final, lost 4-1 against Paris Saint-Germain, was the first occasion in which Kylian Mbappe was truly troubled in this manner]</b> Thiago Silva charged at him from the first to the last minute. He really tackled him hard. You could see that he was trying to get at him and that he wanted to ruin his confidence.<br /><br />After the match, in the dressing room, Mbappe was very sad, he was on the verge of tears, very hurt and I was sorry to see him in that state. I consoled him and I told him that these things were normal because he has shown everyone to what extent he is strong and that this was going to continue in the future</p>
