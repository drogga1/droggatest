  <p><b>[<a href="sheffield-wednesday.html">Sheffield Wednesday</a> striker Fernando Forestieri has been handed a six-game ban by <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> for using racist language against an opponent during a friendly game against Mansfield last July]</b> It was further alleged that the words constituted an ‘Aggravated Breach’, which is defined in Rule E3(2), as they included reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race. The striker has also been warned as to his future conduct and must attend face to face education but the sanction is currently set aside pending appeal</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="sheffield-wednesday.html">Sheffield Wednesday</a> striker Fernando Forestieri has been handed a six-game ban by <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> for using racist language against an opponent during a friendly game against Mansfield last July. The striker signed for Wednesday from <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> in 2015 and has scored 38 goals in 111 Championship games]</b> I am devastated and disappointed with the decision of the Regulatory Commission. Throughout that period of time, throughout both the criminal proceedings and <a href="fa.html">the FA</a>’s disciplinary proceedings, I have consistently and strenuously denied the allegations that have been made against me.<br /><br />Whilst I was shocked and saddened to face criminal charges regarding this matter, I was equally happy to be found not guilty of those charges in March 2019 by the criminal court and considered that to be the end of a very distressing time. As I said at the time, I felt vindicated by the decision of the judge. The decision goes against everything about the person I am and the person I was brought up to be. It is absolutely no comfort to me that, when charging me with misconduct, <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> were very clear that they did not consider me to be racist but instead believed that I had acted in the ‘heat of the moment</p>
