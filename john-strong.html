  <p><b>[John Strong provides a true American perspective to the world’s game]</b> One of the huge influences on me was not even the real John Motson, but the John Motson on the FIFA video games. because part of me becoming a total die-hard in the sport was my Nintendo 64 for my 13th birthday with FIFA 98.<br /><br /><b>[Strong was able to draw from three distinct sources of guidance]</b> I think of it as three different types of influences. The English style is kind of somewhat stereotypically stay out of the way, let the pictures, let the audio sort of speak for itself. The more Spanish-language style is about passion, it’s about emotion, it’s about living the game with every kick and really expressing the type of emotion and passion that your viewers have as they’re watching the game. And then the American style, one of the key tenants of that is the storytelling, because as American sports broadcasters, you have infinitely more access to players and coaches than you do as a soccer announcer anywhere else in the world - it’s not even close<br /><br /><b>[ESPN naming Dave O’Brien lead announcer for the 2006 World Cup despite the fairly glaring issue of him having never called a single soccer game before. Six years later Fox, failing to learn from the past, annointed the equally green Gus Johnson as its soccer voice of the future]</b> Experiments that backfired, call it what it is<br /><br /><b>[Stone, who worked at ESPN when O’Brien was given the World Cup gig and was at Fox when Johnson was brought on board]</b> I give both of those networks credit for at least experimenting and trying to locate that American voice but there was always this part of me in the deep recesses that would say, ‘You’re forcing it.’ Whenever something is forced and not organic these days the public knows it, particularly in soccer.<br /><br />The thing Jonty Whitehead likes to say is it’s developing an American voice for the world’s game. I do think we have established an American soccer culture. I think we see that at MLS games, I think we see that at national team games, and we also see that with people getting up before the sun rises to go to the bar on Saturday morning to watch the Premier League. All of it is good<br /><br />MLS is my dream job but a World Cup, that’s Everest. That’s the ultimate thing. The idea that I could narrate for this country something on that scale, that’s the extreme ultimate aspiration I’ve ever had as sports broadcaster. The fact that there’s a chance that might actually happen is exhilarating and terrifying in equal measure<br /><br />It’s been difficult for the American voice to get an opportunity and to excel and John is a rare case of being a trailblazer this decade. John even at his young age is now in that role as somebody that the youth, the next American soccer voices can listen to and say, ‘Hey I want to be like this guy because he does it right</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Legendary American broadcaster JP Dellacamera gets his moment after staying in background for decades]</b> It’s sort of mind-blowing how many times he has gotten a remarkably short stick in a certain situation. He probably should be more angry than he is. He probably should be more resentful than he is for the opportunities that were taken away from him. But he always plugged away and he did his job and he never lost that niceness about him.</p>
