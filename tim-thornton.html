  <p><b>[Sky Sports News reporter Tim Thornton logged into this afternoon’s presser, so how did it go?]</b> Three months ago I spent the morning with <a href="chris-wilder.html">Chris Wilder</a> going behind-the-scenes on his final press conference before lockdown, so today’s Zoom was a very different experience. But <a href="chris-wilder.html">Wilder</a> always fully engages with his audience and today was no different. But some things were, and it was a clear sign of what will be the new normal<br /><br />We were greeted when we dialled in on Monday morning by the club’s head of media Kevin Cookson, sporting a new lockdown beard. The club briefed everyone beforehand and even sent instructions on how to raise their hand on a Zoom call to show who wanted to ask a question<br /><br />There were more journalists on the call than at a usual press conference, but the club tried to stick to their regular formula, so I kicked things off with the first batch of questions. <a href="chris-wilder.html">Wilder</a> was ready to go before some of the media, and as we got underway everyone was muted while I fired questions at the <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> boss. The only slight issues came about when questions were spread around different journalists which resulted in small delays as each one was un-muted. <a href="chris-wilder.html">Wilder</a> talked for nearly an hour and seemed to enjoy directing proceedings from the top table. And as he left, striker Billy Sharp replaced him in the chair. Sharp told us his wife had taught him how to use Zoom, but it has become a part of his weekly routine now. After 30 minutes with Sharp the press conference was complete and the captain left with a smile on his face as he joined his team-mates for training</p>
