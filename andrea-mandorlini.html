  <p><b>[One-dimensional Jorginho would survive at Chelsea even without Sarri]</b> It is always a pleasure to see Jorginho play and he always puts himself at the coach’s disposal in whatever way he is asked to play. With me, he also played as a more attacking midfielder, but I believe that the role that suits him now is how Sarri wants him to play. I think the criticisms are unfair. Perhaps he is not a flashy player for the eyes of the people, but he is of great importance for the team due to the simplicity of the game. Jorginho can play with anyone and he is a very intelligent and a humble player who is able to adapt to any system, game or manager. He is a silent leader in the locker room. The first time I saw him, he was a very slender boy. It seemed he could fly away in the wind, instead because of work and sacrifice he became, firstly a man, and secondly a great player. He was sold to Napoli against my opinion. I still wanted him to do well so I gave him a Louis Vuitton bag as I knew he would travel more at his new club.</p>

  <p><b>[Striking legend <a href="luca-toni.html">Luca Toni</a> had been the team’s spot-kick specialist but coach Andrea Mandorlini decided to turn to <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a>]</b> I saw that he was very cool and confident. He has great technique and always manages to see things before the others. As he reaches the penalty spot, he sees first where the goalkeeper is moving. His mentality is always positive. I was the first to believe in <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> and I am proud of it. I am glad that he is now making an impact in English football</p>
