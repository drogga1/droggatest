  <p><b>[So the 29-year-old Alejandro Bedoya separated himself from his profession. For three weeks, the sport was the last thing on his mind]</b> No soccer. No kicking, running - nothing.<br /><br />Philly has become a real home now. It definitely feels good, and it makes a difference in your mindset. It makes you not have to worry about these little things that can take your mind off the real important stuff - and that’s coming in here and working hard and focusing on soccer<br /><br />I feel like in his career he’s always been on great teams, whether it’s FC Nantes or the national team, and I feel like he maybe sees himself as a role player. With the Philadelphia Union, I want him to be the guy - so it’s a different role in some ways. We want him to take that leadership role, not just on the field but in the locker room<br /><br />You smell blood. There’s some roster spots available<br /><br />For me, I’m grateful for what he <b>[Jurgen Klinsmann]</b> did - he brought me back into the fold. He was always very open and honest with me. … But it’s a results business, and sometimes when you don’t get results going your way or in a certain fashion, you’re going to get the boot. And that was him. Whether it was about him having too much control or power over things, that’s for others to decide. I think his legacy will definitely be that he expanded the player pool. He got people to talk more about certain issues people <b>[already]</b> would gossip about, but really he brought them to the forefront - whether it’s about U.S. Soccer, MLS, the soccer pyramid here in the States or the way we develop youth players in this country or the way we see soccer in the media<br /><br />The biggest difference for me was the tactical awareness and understanding of the game from the guys coming up. That’s what I try to bring, just that type of understanding, whether it’s everyone moving as a unit or the spacing. MLS can improve on that, and it is improving obviously with better players, better quality<br /><br />The city, it’s got a little bit of an attitude to it, blue-collar type of people, definitely this brass swagger. People here have strong personalities - and I think that suits me</p>

  <p><b>[Alejandro Bedoya took issue with that penalty, saying postgame that Altidore has a history of diving]</b> Knowing Jozy, he tends to go down easy in the box, so let’s just leave it at that. I didn’t even see it, but from what I hear it was definitely not a penalty. I thought was it was a make-up call for them.<br /><br /><b>[Bedoya did try to ease tensions not long after Altidore’s tweet]</b> It’s a shame quotes get taken out of context. All love man. Congrats on your goal and see you soon bro</p>

  <p><b>[Regulations laid down by <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> mean that teams are not allowed to charter flights for any more than four legs of journeys over the season. This means that there are effectively two matches they can travel privately for, as the inbound and outbound flights each count as one leg - a paltry number given the travelling commitments for teams over a season that will stretch to at least 34 matches]</b> Should’ve flown out of Vancouver last night after early kickoff. Instead, we wake up at 4:45 am, spend all day in airports (connect in Toronto) &amp; on airplanes w/ no legroom cross country, and just finally landed back in Philly. What a great recovery day!<br /><br />For me, it’s just so frustrating. This is not a Philly issue, this is a league-wide issue. I’m speaking on behalf of all the players in the league. I put that out there and I got messages from players on all different teams laughing with me and telling me I’m so right</p>

  <p><b>[Philadelphia Union midfielder Alejandro Bedoya delivered a passionate on-field plea to end gun violence following his goal against D.C. United on Sunday night. Bedoya grew up 15 minutes away from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, where 17 students were killed in a gun massacre in 2018]</b> Congress, do something now. End gun violence. Let’s go!<br /><br /><b>[After the game, Bedoya told reporters that he couldn’t help but be affected by the previous day’s events]</b> I’m not going to sit idly by and watch this stuff happen and not say something. Before I’m an athlete, before I’m a soccer player, I’m a human being first.</p>

  <p><b>[Following the recent mass shootings in both El Paso and Dayton, Philadelphia Union star Alejandro Bedoya made headlines by making a plea to Congress after scoring against DC United]</b> Congress, do something now. End gun violence. Let’s go!<br /><br />Yes, we’re blessed with our athletic ability maybe, but before we’re athletes we’re human beings. We feel this stuff. We’re not robots. We’re affected by things, whether directly or indirectly. So it’s only normal at times that people get emotional and need to say something. You know me. I’ve been vocal in the past. I’ll never be the kind of guy that just sticks to sports</p>

However, this deal has many significant gains for players &amp; represents a meaningful step forward for growth of the game in North America. Lot of work put into this from those involved. Now let’s get back 2 business &amp; just play!</p>

  <p><b>[Philadelphia Union captain Alejandro Bedoya has expressed his reservations about a proposed plan to resume the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> season with games in Orlando]</b> Every one of us, I think, would agree that we want to get back to playing. I want to get back out there, being competitive in games. The staff also wants to be out there. Fans want to be watching games, but I will say that this all feels a little bit rushed. I think the players, we’re taking all the risk again by going down there, being isolated. I think it’s a strong term to say it’s like being in a luxurious prison. Essentially we’re going to be sequestered in a hotel in Disney, not being able to do much. This isn’t normal preseason where we can have the freedom to go out to dinner with the guys, go to the movie theater to watch a movie, even go for a quick run to CVS to get the essentials. This is just straight lockdown for eight weeks minimum is what they’re asking, 10 weeks if you’re in the final. I don’t know about you but a lot of guys have families. Even if you’re single, a young player, eight weeks alone not being able to do much. It’s like I said, a luxurious prison</p>
