  <p><b>[Regulations laid down by MLS mean that teams are not allowed to charter flights for any more than four legs of journeys over the season. This means that there are effectively two matches they can travel privately for, as the inbound and outbound flights each count as one leg - a paltry number given the travelling commitments for teams over a season that will stretch to at least 34 matches]</b> Should’ve flown out of Vancouver last night after early kickoff. Instead, we wake up at 4:45 am, spend all day in airports (connect in Toronto) &amp; on airplanes w/ no legroom cross country, and just finally landed back in Philly. What a great recovery day!<br /><br />For me, it’s just so frustrating. This is not a Philly issue, this is a league-wide issue. I’m speaking on behalf of all the players in the league. I put that out there and I got messages from players on all different teams laughing with me and telling me I’m so right</p>

  <p><b>[Philadelphia Union midfielder Alejandro Bedoya delivered a passionate on-field plea to end gun violence following his goal against D.C. United on Sunday night. Bedoya grew up 15 minutes away from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, where 17 students were killed in a gun massacre in 2018]</b> Congress, do something now. End gun violence. Let’s go!<br /><br /><b>[After the game, Bedoya told reporters that he couldn’t help but be affected by the previous day’s events]</b> I’m not going to sit idly by and watch this stuff happen and not say something. Before I’m an athlete, before I’m a soccer player, I’m a human being first.</p>

  <p><b>[Following the recent mass shootings in both El Paso and Dayton, Philadelphia Union star Alejandro Bedoya made headlines by making a plea to Congress after scoring against DC United]</b> Congress, do something now. End gun violence. Let’s go!<br /><br />Yes, we’re blessed with our athletic ability maybe, but before we’re athletes we’re human beings. We feel this stuff. We’re not robots. We’re affected by things, whether directly or indirectly. So it’s only normal at times that people get emotional and need to say something. You know me. I’ve been vocal in the past. I’ll never be the kind of guy that just sticks to sports</p>

  <p><b>[The <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Players Association (MLSPA) announced on Thursday that the two sides had come to terms on a CBA that addressed a number of key issues]</b> It’s been a long journey and could always be better. However, this deal has many significant gains for players &amp; represents a meaningful step forward for growth of the game in North America. Lot of work put into this from those involved. Now let’s get back 2 business &amp; just play!</p>

  <p><b>[Philadelphia Union captain Alejandro Bedoya has expressed his reservations about a proposed plan to resume the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> season with games in Orlando]</b> Every one of us, I think, would agree that we want to get back to playing. I want to get back out there, being competitive in games. The staff also wants to be out there. Fans want to be watching games, but I will say that this all feels a little bit rushed. I think the players, we’re taking all the risk again by going down there, being isolated. I think it’s a strong term to say it’s like being in a luxurious prison. Essentially we’re going to be sequestered in a hotel in Disney, not being able to do much. This isn’t normal preseason where we can have the freedom to go out to dinner with the guys, go to the movie theater to watch a movie, even go for a quick run to CVS to get the essentials. This is just straight lockdown for eight weeks minimum is what they’re asking, 10 weeks if you’re in the final. I don’t know about you but a lot of guys have families. Even if you’re single, a young player, eight weeks alone not being able to do much. It’s like I said, a luxurious prison</p>
