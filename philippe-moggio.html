  <p><b>[CONCACAF general secretary Philippe Moggio says the governing body for North and Central America and the Caribbean has no plans to merge with CONMEBOL]</b> Cooperation with CONMEBOL is very important in every way. We saw with the success of the Copa America that it was an all-around success for CONCACAF as well as for CONMEBOL. The idea of cooperation for tournaments always exists and we’re excited to explore different opportunities, but for a combined federation to arrive that would lead to World Cup qualification <b>[being combined]</b>, I don’t think it is changing. Nothing like this has been discussed, neither between confederations nor at the FIFA level.<br /><br />We know the World Cup serves as a development tool for soccer. When a country has the chance to participate in this competition, it helps the development of the sport in the country a lot. For those countries that will have the chance to participate for the first time, it will be an important boost. Summarizing everything, this is an interesting development for the world of soccer</p>

  <p><b>[Concacaf officials excited for historic expanded Gold Cup in 2019]</b> Our focus obviously is to continue to evaluate how the competition performs. It’s our first time taking it out of North America, which is a big step, and we always want to look at all the opportunities down the road. We obviously need to evaluate how 2019 goes and think about the future of it, but I feel, yeah, we want to expand the competition into the region as much as possible and give more of our members the opportunity to host this wonderful competition.<br /><br />The U.S. gives us a platform in terms of infrastructure that not many other countries have. Of course, Mexico does, Canada now is launching a new professional league. It’s on the path to have more football-specific facilities where you could see a Gold Cup going to a model of shared, like the 2026 World Cup between three different countries will be regional. The opportunities are probably endless and looking back to the past and then to the future, there’s probably the growth potential of more countries hosting Gold Cup games. That’s ultimately what we want to achieve. We want to bring the Gold Cup to more of our members, providing more access and participation<br /><br />We’ve seen, obviously, great success in the Gold Cup throughout the years since the first edition in 91, but it’s a big country. It’s very difficult for us to plan out and ensure we’re able to take our teams to the fan bases where they’re able to enjoy their team. If you have a draw, it’s difficult for fans to really follow and maximize the opportunity.<br /><br />For us to not be able to have, for example, Mexico play in a market where you can have the most Mexican fans enjoy that matchup is difficult. And yeah, the reality is that Gold Cup is our most important commercial engine that fuels the development of sport throughout the region, so maximizing the commercial opportunity is important behind the competition<br /><br />We’re incredibly excited about this unveiling. This is the first time really we’ve been creating so much visibility behind Gold Cup with all the planning and announcements we’ve done over the past nine months. We think it’s going to get great traction and this competition is going to not only be a great experience for our fans but also our partners who are helping us raise the visibility of this tournament every edition going forward and we’ll continue to grow into 21, 23 and beyond</p>

  <p><b>[Guadalajara to host 2020 Concacaf Olympic qualifying tournament]</b> We are very excited to host the Concacaf Men’s Olympic Qualifying tournament in Guadalajara, Mexico. This competition plays a big role in showcasing the best of football across our Confederation, while providing an opportunity to qualify to the Men’s Olympic Football Tournament in Tokyo 2020. Our teams have delivered strong and historic performances in the Olympic Games, we are looking forward to raising the competitive level in the region and bringing the gold back to Concacaf next year</p>
