  <p><b>[Terengganu to work on team chemistry with one week left to go to league kick-off]</b> …I still have not seen our team chemistry, and we have one week left before the first match <b>[of the Premier League]</b>. God willing, I’ll work on it. We now have two more friendlies, against a club from Singapore <b>[Tampines Rovers FC]</b> and our President’s Cup team, to work on the chemistry.<br /><br /><b>[On Federico Falcone]</b> Falcone could not prove what he’s capable of in the match, as he is still fatigued and has yet to acclimatise to our climate and our gameplan. I may also change a few things, due to his arrival at the side<br /><br />I wasn’t so sure if Thiago <b>[forward Thiago Augusto Fernandes]</b> has fully recovered from his injury, so I am reluctant to take that risk, and went with Falcone instead</p>

  <p><b>[Ong Kim Swee and Irfan Bakti’s thoughts on 48-team 2026 World Cup]</b> Although the tournament will now take longer to run, it will be more attractive, as many teams have yearned for the taste of World Cup glory, and now they have a bigger chance of making it. However, we must be realistic. Malaysia are not up to par yet.</p>

  <p><b>[Turtles’ boss Irfan Bakti Abu Salim still sees a lot of weaknesses in his side]</b> We played well in the first half, but in the second we had to defend our slim lead. In the last 15 minutes we lost our shape, everything. We were lucky that PDRM did not create any open chances in that time. It may be due to the fact that it is our first match of the season, and we were a bit too tense in the search for three points.<br /><br />Danial <b>[Ferris Danial Nasir]</b>, Issey <b>[Nakajima-Farran]</b> were nervous, they should not have been so anxious <b>[in front of the goal]</b>. Hopefully they will improve in the next game<br /><br />Although I know what it takes to beat MIFA, I want my players to not take the match lightly, not to be complacent and too casual. There is no easy game</p>

  <p><b>[Irfan angry with his midfield, rues missing Turaev]</b> What we saw is that we couldn’t control the midfield area. The local boys we have there lost physically. There’s still another 90 mins in KT and that’ll decide if we reach the final. Lutfulla will be back. I’m still confident that my team can go further. <b>[Of his midfielders in the first leg]</b> Poor distribution of ball, ball possession and afraid to hold on to the ball. Lutfulla is a big miss in that regard.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Terengganu boss Irfan Bakti admitted that Kedah were simply too strong in midfield]</b> Judging by the way Kedah played tonight, I believe they will end up as the champions. We were overwhelmed in midfield, we gave their number eight <b>[Liridon Krasniqi]</b>, number 10 <b>[Sandro da Silva Mendonça]</b>, and number seven <b>[Baddrol Bakhtiar]</b> too much space. And most of my men were simply ball-watching. Even if Federico Falcone had been available this evening, he would not have been able to turn things around</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Irfan Bakti is pulling all the stops to ensure that Terengganu make an immediate jump back into the Super League after their demotion to Premier League in 2016]</b> Before this, we have confirmed to drop Federico Falcono. And now we’ve decided on Turaev as well. Turaev’s place will be taken by a Brazilian and Falcone’s place by another striker which I will reveal the names later. The two will arrive shortly and start training with the team in June.<br /><br />On 10 June, maybe we’ll have a friendly against Pahang, Felda United on 17 June and Kelantan on 21 June. We know that our rivals in the Malaysia Cup group stage are very tough teams and that is why we have to prepare early</p>

  <p><b>[Terengganu boss Irfan Bakti Abu Salim admitted that he had not known much about Selangor]</b> I have to thank the T-Team head coach for giving me the information on Selangor. I knew nothing about Selangor because I’ve been focusing on Premier League sides, and <b>[thankfully]</b> my men were able to use the information.<br /><br />Either side could have had the three points. We each had many chances, so it’s a fair result. Finally tonight we did not go behind early in the match. We had been doing that in the previous matches, in the friendly matches against Pahang, Felda United, and in the league against JDT II last week we were two down within five minutes of kickoff. Praise God, tonight we were more disciplined</p>
