  <p><b>[Sunderland’s Niall Quinn Admits He Used To ‘Hate’ Steve Bruce]</b> Steve used to get away with murder, because he was a little centre-half. Referees used to let little centre-halves knock lumps out of me. It would be true to say that when you’re a blue with a number nine on your back and you’re being marked by a red in Manchester with number four on his back, I would be lying if I said I respected him – I didn’t like him! But that’s not a slight – it was because he was so tough, he made life so awkward for you, and he constantly got the referee to whistle and the linesman to get the flag up. He was influential, as you know, that was his game, he was all-action. I had a few verbal run-ins with him over time but that doesn’t mean now, years later, that I don’t recognise his graft and determination. I know he’ll bring those qualities to his new job here at Sunderland</p>

  <p><b>[Niall Quinn says Sunderland’s ‘Yo-Yo’ Years Are Over]</b> I’ve learned quickly that when you mention stability in football it can come back and bite you on the backside but hopefully stability is what we can have from now on. It would be great if Sunderland fans could get used to <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> fixtures coming out and them always seeing their team among the leading clubs again. We have built almost three different teams in three years and it has been a very busy time on and off the pitch. You can’t continue on that basis and continuity and stability are both things you strive for. I have looked back at the history books and I would love this club to have a proper long run in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> now.<br /><br />Since the period before the mid-1950s, when Sunderland looked like being a permanent fixture in the top division, the club’s longest run in what is now <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has been six years. That’s not a lot for a club this size and with this potential. During my watch as chairman, I would love us to get to seven years and beyond. That is when you say you are a proper <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club – when you are in the top league year after year. I feel that would be a real achievement<br /><br /><b>[And Quinn feels that such stability is the least that a fan-base as large and passionate as Sunderland’s warrants, concluding]</b> There have been a heck of a lot of changes at this club in a short space of time but hopefully we’re through all that and we’ve now reached a point where we have the boardroom and the manager we want and we go about the task of building the successful team that Sunderland fans deserve</p>

  <p><b>[Niall Quinn steps down as Sunderland chairman]</b> This is a great opportunity for us to make the club stronger and I’m delighted that Ellis has agreed to support the plan. He’ll be a fantastic chairman and taking this role on speaks volumes about his ambition for the club.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn hits out at <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> for lack of depression support]</b> Our union sent a book to everyone last week. What’s that about? Then they back people like <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Tevez</a>. They should do an awful lot more than go on telly saying they sent books out. Depression happens and in all levels of the game and sometimes it manifests itself in people three, four years after a player retires. They need to guide people in life after football</p>

  <p><b>[Niall Quinn says <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> could be a future Ireland manager if he resolves differences with the FAI]</b> Roy does not accept mediocrity and Ireland’s performances in this tournament were mediocre at best. That is what he was criticising, the idea that we were happy to accept those standards. It would take a huge leap of faith from both him and the <a href="fai.html">FAI</a> to appoint him, but also the fans he has railed against and the players he has criticised. But can he be the spark that ties it all back together and leads Irish football to redemption?<br /><br /><b>[Keane and Quinn fell out after World Cup 2002 during the infamous episode in Saipan. The Corkman later dubbed Quinn as ‘Mother Teresa’ but they patched up their differences within four years and the Dubliner hired Keane as manager at Sunderland in 2006]</b> There is history between him and the <a href="fai.html">FAI</a>, but there was history between him and me before he accepted an offer at Sunderland and he did a great job for me there as manager. Just because there is history between them doesn’t mean they can’t resolve their issues and work together in the future<br /><br /><b>[The former Irish captain has said is eager to get back into management and has been linked with several vacancies. British bookmaker Ladbrokes have installed Keane at 25/1 to be the successor to Giovanni Trapattoni]</b> He is available and if he sees a problem with the way Ireland are doing things, is he prepared to take the problem by the scruff of the neck and impose himself on it?<br /><br /><b>[In a 2002 interview with the Irish Times Keane said he would be interested in managing his country and quipped]</b> Nobody would play for me but we’d have great facilities!<br /><br /><b>[Quinn concluded that he was not suggesting <a href="giovanni-trapattoni.html">Giovanni Trapattoni</a> should be sacked from his position as Ireland manager but said the Irish Euro 2012 campaign must be analysed further]</b> I agree <a href="giovanni-trapattoni.html">Trapattoni</a>’s position has to be looked at by the <a href="fa.html">Football Association</a> of Ireland and it will interesting to see whether he still has that hunger. We have to see whether there is still some life left in his reign</p>

He has a beautiful family as well, and I echo the sentiments of all the players and ex-players, ex-colleagues and people who knew him. One of the tweets I saw said he was one of the good guys, and I can tell you that he was one of the very best. His care for others was noticeable. Every day, he was anxious and eager to assist younger players. He was just a beautiful man, and a huge character in our dressing room.</p>

  <p><b>[Asamoah Gyan’s Sunderland exit explained by Niall Quinn]</b> Whatever players say, I’ll tell you what the agents say and I’ll tell you what goes on behind the scenes. With Asamoah, he came to us - via his agent - who said ‘I have had a huge offer in the Middle East and I must go’ to which we told him ‘look, we can’t do that’.<br /><br />We waited a six-month period to see if he would come back into line, we gave him a new contract too - although it did pale in comparison to what was on the table from Al-Ain and also he was being pressured by them to make the move. We were hoping he’d go there for three months and hate it and want to come back<br /><br />He didn’t <b>[hate it]</b>. The fact of the matter is they were probably offering him five times the amount he was on with us, and we were told there was no tax on it, so in theory he was on ten times the amount he was on here.<br /><br />If we were right up the top of the league, fighting for a Champions League spot then you have more ability to keep hold of players the way top four clubs do, but we were Sunderland trying really hard to keep everything working. If we were to give one of those players the money they were wanting - well, I wasn’t going to sanction that because it puts the club in a terrible position. We weren’t taking in any more income, we had hit the level of what we could spend considering <b>[Former club owner]</b> Ellis Short gave us a lot of money, another level would have blown the club into another level. It was the financial facts of life we have to abide by. Asamoah went, Jordan <b>[Henderson]</b> went - those deals alone brought us in £50 million to £60 million.</p>
