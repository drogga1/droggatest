  <p><b>[Toronto FC not looking for sweeping changes this winter]</b> I don’t think a massive overhaul needs to take place. This team isn’t done, this roster isn’t done. There is a drive, a collective mentality from this group. They want to go out and compete.<br /><br />It will be a priority to sit down with everyone and their representative to talk: something we do every offseason. They’ve helped build what we’ve built. It’s important we have a conversation, <b>[discuss]</b> their expectations for next year and beyond<br /><br />We’re planning for next year, but we’re not forgetting about 2020, 2021. At some point we will have to make a shift; get younger</p>
