  <p><b>[Chloe Morgan says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> must do more to integrate men’s and women’s squads]</b> The progress and evolution of our women’s set-up is an ongoing, organic process and something which we as a club are fully committed to. In a short space of time, the club has fully integrated its women’s team into its day-to-day operations and fully supported the team’s entry into the Barclays FA Women’s Super League (WSL)<br /><br />Last year, we staged the first Women’s north London derby in the top flight at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur Stadium</a> which set a new all-time attendance record for the WSL of 38,262. We have also this week launched a new Female Talent Pathway, enabling us to help aspiring young female footballers develop their skills from a young age to play at the highest level possible<br /><br />Equality and inclusion is of paramount importance to us as a club and is central to everything we do<br /><br />Our men’s players have shown cohesiveness with our women’s team by attending matches in support of the players, engaging with them on social media and appearing alongside each other at community events as we recognise that our men’s and women’s players provide equal inspiration to young people within our local area<br /><br />Our women’s team has a dedicated home at The Hive Stadium - training is split between The Hive and our training centre, based on logistical requirements and in compliance with regulations pertaining to gender appropriate changing areas. Players have full access to appropriate training facilities and medical provision at all times, including those utilised by our men’s and academy teams when they train at our training centre, where both the men’s and women’s teams are undergoing tests for COVID-19.</p>

  <p><b>[Chloe Morgan: Women’s football far more inclusive than men’s game]</b> I think there is such a big difference at the moment in terms of the inclusivity of the LGBT+ community in the women’s game compared to the men’s game. For me growing up, women’s football is one of those places where I really felt at home as an LGBTQ person. I really felt a sense of community there, where I wasn’t one person feeling left out - I was one of quite a few in the team sometimes who were of that community. So there’s a stark contrast there between the men’s elite environment at least, where there are no out players. I always say it would be fantastic to have an LGBTQ+ male footballer come out and take a stand but I also appreciate that sexuality is one of those things that is your property. It is no-one else. I wouldn’t want to <b>[be seen to]</b> force or encourage a player to come out when they are not ready, but I do think it would have a significant impact on a lot of young people everywhere if it did happen</p>

  <p><b>[Chloe Morgan says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> must do more to integrate men’s and women’s squads]</b> In terms of my experiences with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, I’m still taking the time to reflect back on the things that have happened and the experience I have had with the club over the past six years. Now as an older player, I definitely think things could be better on the women’s side in terms of equality and I’m ready to stand up and speak out against that, and that’s with the intention of making things better for the next generation of players. I don’t want to see progress go at such a slow pace. It’s almost going nowhere, I want to be part of the push forward. But in terms of equality and what I think <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> should do better, I definitely think there are grounds there to really consolidate the women’s and men’s team and make it more of a cohesive team. I never want a situation where a women’s team feel like a second-class team or they feel like they are second-class citizens to a men’s team, so I think there is work to be done there. I do think in some ways the men’s team were supportive but I definitely think there were occasions when the cohesion could have been a lot better<br /><br />In terms of being part of the men’s setup I definitely think there could have been ways we could have used the facilities better, we could have been in a situation where we met the men’s team more a little bit more often. I just think there were things that were going on behind the scenes that I feel need to be addressed<br /><br /><b>[The 30-year-old is excited about the prospect of moving across London to join the Women’s Championship club]</b> It’s been in the process now for a couple of weeks and it is something that I am so excited about. The club for me, when we have played them before, we have had some really difficult, tough games and they have been a tough side. I’m very much looking forward to another promotion battle - the club’s got ambitions this season - so I’m very much looking forward to being a big part of that.</p>
