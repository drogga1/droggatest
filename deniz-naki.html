<blockquote>
  <p>[Mesut Ozil has been urged to fight fascist and racist attacks in Turkey] In your statement, you are justified in responding to the racism you have encountered and your reasons for leaving the national team. But why you are not showing this response when there are more and more racist and fascist attacks in Turkey on me or on Kurdish or other minority footballers?<br /><br />I think that this is about a political issue. I am a continual target in Turkey because I make pro-Kurdish statements<br /><br />You say you find the explanations of the DFB wrong. In Turkey, a footballer’s career was ended: a person standing for peace was labeled as a terrorist. What was your reaction in this regard? Why do those who see you as ‘native’ and ‘national’ in Turkey see me as a ‘terrorist’? Why do those who support your ‘Turkish existence’ accept it but not my ‘Kurdishness’? Those who will welcome you with open arms on your next trip to Turkey will be exactly the same people who have racially attacked me. There is no distinction between fascists, they are the same everywhere, in every country. I urge you not only to fight against fascism and racism in Germany, but also against any kind of it in the world. I urge you to bring attention to the Kurds in Turkey facing racism and also to combat it</p>
