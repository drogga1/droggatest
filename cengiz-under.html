  <p><b>[AS Roma have completed the signing of Turkey star Cengiz Under from Istanbul Basaksehir on a five-year deal]</b> I’m delighted to be here and I’m very excited about meeting the fans. My aim is to earn myself a regular starting berth as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p><b>[Cengiz Under is confident he made the right decision to reject an offer from Manchester City and join Roma]</b> I received an offer from Manchester City, but I did not agree. There was the project in Rome, and the attitude of the club and the coach was important to me. Then, with the sale of Salah, the team has become more suited to my characteristics<br /><br /><b>[On Monchi]</b> Monchi is a very important name and has always had a lot of confidence in me and I feel it. He says I can become an important player for the future of Rome, important in discipline and tactical work<br /><br /><b>[on Eusebio Di Francesco]</b> Di Francesco gives all players a chance, trusts them and keeps on encouraging them. He always wants the best in training and we have a good relationship<br /><br />The biggest problem was the language, now things are better and I’m more sociable. One day I got out of the shower after training and Monchi told me that I had to meet someone. I went and it turned out to be Francesco Totti! I was very excited, but I feel unlucky not to have played with him<br /><br />Lionel Messi is the best in the world, and I really like David Silva too. My ideal 11 would be Alisson in goal, defended by Dani Alves, Sergio Ramos, Thiago Silva and Marcelo, then Luka Modric, David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne, Salah, Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo</p>

  <p><b>[Cengiz Under has embraced the responsibility of filling Mohamed Salah’s shoes at Roma]</b> It was very important for me that I was coming in to replace Salah as he did really well here. There was a lot of pressure but fortunately once I started scoring and became more involved - thanks to the help of all my team-mates - I really felt I was a part of the team.<br /><br />The first six months were quite difficult because of the language and because I had to adjust. Once I started scoring and I began playing better, I felt I like part of the team. In my first season I had some difficulties at the start but then I was able to show what I can do. This year I’ve got this injury problem. Having to sit on the sidelines for three weeks has got me down a bit but I hope to be back in action soon. Last year we reached the Champions League semi-finals and hopefully we can do as well again this year. In Serie A I hope we can finish among the top spots<br /><br />I think both are difficult and tough, like football generally. The main difference is that people give youth more of a chance in Italy. When I was in Turkey, we only had three or four Turkish players around the age of 20. It was thanks to the coach that I was able to emerge. We need to give young players more of a chance in Turkey<br /><br /><b>[Asked to name his idol]</b> David Silva. I’ve always liked him<br /><br />My favourite is Edin Dzeko because we have a really good understanding</p>

  <p><b>[AS Roma’s Cengiz Under admits that he has great admiration for Manchester City midfielder David Silva]</b> I have always said that it’s very nice to watch other great players, but one should always take himself as an example. You need to be self-critical and you need to improve yourself - I always watch my own videos after games. The one player I really like watching and admire is David Silva. I used to watch his videos often and I like his playing style very much. I love him, so I hope we can play together some day!<br /><br />After comparing videos of my Basaksehir days and my Roma days, I have realised that I play a very different kind of football here. I now know better what I can do defensively and offensively. I think I have improved myself quite a lot in Italy. I will never forget the help <b>[former coach Eusebio]</b> <a href="eusebio-di-francesco.html">Di Francesco</a> gave me. I have improved myself thanks to him. He always trusted me and made me feel confident, thus, I played much better. I was sad, very sad when he was let go</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> have confirmed they have tied down Cengiz Under to new long-term contracts]</b> I arrived in Rome two years ago and since then, day after day, I’ve felt more in love with this city, this club and these fans. This is a very happy moment for me. I want to thank the club for allowing me to realise my wish to continue playing for Roma.</p>
