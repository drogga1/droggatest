  <p><b>[Marco Simone says <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> should sign <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Mauro Icardi</a> from rivals Inter to take their attack to a higher level]</b> I would keep <b>[Rafael]</b> Leao. He has strength and talent. Otherwise, if you always look at the flaws in those who have talent, you have to start from scratch all the time. I wouldn’t have given up on <b>[Krzysztof]</b> Piatek. If <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a> leaves, Milan would be short a striker. I think <b>[Napoli’s Arkadiusz]</b> Milik would do well, but I would try to bring <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a> and <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a> to Milan. Mauro would be a great signing and an ideal situation<br /><br /><b>[Boban claimed <a href="ivan-gazidis.html">Gazidis</a> went behind his and technical director <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Paolo Maldini</a>’s backs and agreed a deal for <a href="ralf-rangnick.html">Ralf Rangnick</a> to take over as coach and sporting director in December]</b> It’s an immense loss. It was too superficial and trivial to fire him because of a controversial interview. I think they used it as an excuse, it was already planned. When you choose two characters like <a href="zvonimir-boban.html">Boban</a> and <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a>, you know at the start the weight they have. They know how Milan are managed. Those who chose them had to continue with them together. They were the first two important pieces in starting again. I have some doubts that such a figure <b>[Rangnick as coach and sporting director]</b> can work in Italy. And then his role in practice would eliminate that of <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a>. The club must clarify the managerial structure. If <a href="ivan-gazidis.html">Gazidis</a> intends to have it as it is abroad, then the relationship with Paolo should be finished and maybe <a href="ralf-rangnick.html">Rangnick</a> could work.</p>
