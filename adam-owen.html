  <p><b>[Adam Owen interview: Seattle Sounders role for best British coach you might not have heard of]</b> As soon as I joined it all got called off. We were supposed to be flying out the next day to play Houston. I got packed up ready to travel and then the day of the trip it was shut down. It has been crazy since then. Four months alone in a hotel room. Perfect timing<br /><br />I was 26 at the time. We beat Stuttgart, Panathinaikos, Werder Bremen, Sporting Lisbon and <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> along the way. I think people probably do not appreciate what an achievement that was. <a href="walter-smith.html">Walter Smith</a> is a class act and to be involved in it was just phenomenal<br /><br />It was just something in me. I knew that a lot of British coaches did not go abroad but I wanted to do it from a cultural point of view and a language point of view. I just love different cultures. I enjoy different experiences. Every place is different, even here in Seattle where they speak the same language. You have to adapt and discover a different way. If somebody offers you an opportunity in football you have to take it. There is a lot to see in this world</p>
