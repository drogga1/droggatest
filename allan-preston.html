  <p>[<a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a>’s Agent Allan Preston says <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> could well be on his way out of Celtic this summer] Tierney won’t be leaving until one of the projected buyers meets Celtic’s valuation, thought to be £25 million. It is all down to Celtic. If they get a price that they believe is the correct value for <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> he could possibly be on his way. No one has hit that price yet.<br /><br />[Preston doesn’t think that the rumours will be affecting him, as a lifelong Celtic fan committed to the club and happy in green and white] He is such an unassuming young man. He is wealthy at the moment but he doesn’t possess a watch, he isn’t into material things like this. He still hangs about his pals from when he was a youngster, he sponsors his local pub team where his pals play and he’s not into his designer gear or anything like that. As the guys say he loves Celtic, he absolutely loves Celtic. Will there be a time for <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> to go? I think that there will be.<br /><br />If it’s just now it will be up to the clubs involved - Arsenal, Napoli or whoever - to then put the money on the table and make Celtic think about this. If there is a time for Kieran to go it will be up to Celtic, <a href="peter-lawwell.html">Peter Lawwell</a> and the board. They have signed a left-back but they do need one because Emilio Izaguirre is away</p>
