<blockquote>
  <p>[Malaysia call-ups kept Davies going during underwhelming 2016 season] I think it’s a matter of the team taking confidence from our wins and performances, [and] bringing that forward to our next games. Keeping the momentum is important and Dollah is constantly reminding us to continue playing how we’ve been playing.<br /><br />[The motivation he seeked to keep him going was in the national team call-ups he received, under Malaysia boss Datuk Ong Kim Swee] It was definitely a difficult year mentally. We were in a situation where we were so desperate for any points that when we lost it really hurt. I kept myself positive by focusing on national team call-ups and trying to keep my own performances high<br /><br />No, I don’t think so there is any pressure to lift either cup, we’re not getting too far ahead of ourselves. It’s still very early on in both competitions but obviously when you start to go a little further the pressure starts to build. For now I’d say the team isn’t feeling that</p>

  <p>[Pahang captain Matthew Davies has said that he is banking on their home ground advantage] Hopefully they [the fans] can expect the same performance [in the 3-1 win], we’ve been really convincing at home this year. So hopefully we can continue with that sort of home form and really turn Darul Makmur [Stadium] into a fortress.<br /><br />I think they are a good team, certainly better when where they are placed right now. I think they will take some time to click with their new players, having said that the Super League is definitely a big step up from the Premier League so maybe it will take some time for them to adjust<br /><br />Fingers crossed yes, I’d like for the game to be played at a neutral venue just so that there are no outside distractions, and we can really focus on the game</p>
