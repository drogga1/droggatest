  <p><b>[Malaysia call-ups kept Davies going during underwhelming 2016 season]</b> I think it’s a matter of the team taking confidence from our wins and performances, <b>[and]</b> bringing that forward to our next games. Keeping the momentum is important and Dollah is constantly reminding us to continue playing how we’ve been playing.<br /><br /><b>[The motivation he seeked to keep him going was in the national team call-ups he received, under Malaysia boss Datuk Ong Kim Swee]</b> It was definitely a difficult year mentally. We were in a situation where we were so desperate for any points that when we lost it really hurt. I kept myself positive by focusing on national team call-ups and trying to keep my own performances high<br /><br />No, I don’t think so there is any pressure to lift either cup, we’re not getting too far ahead of ourselves. It’s still very early on in both competitions but obviously when you start to go a little further the pressure starts to build. For now I’d say the team isn’t feeling that</p>

  <p><b>[Pahang captain Matthew Davies has said that he is banking on their home ground advantage]</b> Hopefully they <b>[the fans]</b> can expect the same performance <b>[in the 3-1 win]</b>, we’ve been really convincing at home this year. So hopefully we can continue with that sort of home form and really turn Darul Makmur <b>[Stadium]</b> into a fortress.<br /><br />I think they are a good team, certainly better when where they are placed right now. I think they will take some time to click with their new players, having said that the Super League is definitely a big step up from the Premier League so maybe it will take some time for them to adjust<br /><br />Fingers crossed yes, I’d like for the game to be played at a neutral venue just so that there are no outside distractions, and we can really focus on the game</p>

  <p><b>[Matthew Davies prefers playing in RB position for Malaysia]</b> Not particularly <b>[playing at left back]</b>, to be very honest. But at the same time, wherever the coach asked you to play, that’s where you play. Although I prefer playing at the right back, but If I have to play there, I’ll play at left back but of course I’m more comfortable with my left foot and at the right back.<br /><br />The coaches are still deciding on that but there are still players that can come in the left position so it should be okay<br /><br />Philippines are a very strong team and they are ranked highly among the South-East Asian countries. They have a lot of mixed heritage players and quality in the squad. We have not been together for a few months but it would be very important for us to win and kick off our new year in the right way<br /><br />The good thing about Matthew Davies is that he can play on both sides. Rizal Ghazali can play on the right, while Khair Jones can play on the left. Depending on the match, as I will also need to see the performance of Rizal and Khair before I pick who will play in the respective positions</p>

  <p><b>[Following Malaysia head coach Datuk Ong Kim Swee’s reassignment as Malaysia U23 head coach by the new Malaysian FA president Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim]</b> Of course I’d be interested in competing at the SEA games, it was one of my major focuses for the year knowing the SEA games is being held in Malaysia. Either way I’d be honored to participate in another SEA games.<br /><br />I think it’s enough <b>[time]</b>, I don’t think anyone is more qualified than Ong Kim Swee to lead another SEA Games challenge, he is very well respected amongst Malaysian players and of course has had success at the SEA Games before. What’s most important is for the players to be playing consistently at club level. Playing week in week out is so crucial leading up to a tournament like this. So that should be the major goal for players hoping to be selected</p>

  <p><b>[Despite ending up on the score sheet, Matthew Davies was left disappointed with Pahang’s performance against Selangor at home]</b> It was good to get that one point in the end, but overall I think the performance was a bit poor. We never really get our rhythm or our style of play, and especially to drop points at home is a bit disappointing. But we’ll move on and focus on what we have to do next.</p>

  <p><b>[Pahang skipper, Matthew Davies has inisisted that the Elephants will go to Larkin with the intention of winning and advancing to the next round of the FA Cup]</b> I don’t know if we can go there with the attitude to only defend. I don’t think the two goal lead is enough especially at Larkin. I think we need a goal at Larkin if we hope to go through.<br /><br />JDT have the luxury of a big talented squad that can be rotated. Perhaps the added travel will factor in to the game but I think only slightly<br /><br /><b>[After the Selangor game]</b> we sat down and had a chat about what happened. All credit to Selangor because they set up really well and were defensively and tactically disciplined. It will certainly be an interesting second half of the season. I think we have the talent and players to make something happen though</p>

  <p><b>[Matthew Davies was confident that the match will end in full-time]</b> The statistics going into the game are interesting. They <b>[Negeri]</b> have had a little drop of form, but at the same time so have we. We’re looking to get back on track, and a win might certainly help. I think there will be goals in this game <b>[on Saturday]</b>, I can’t see the game going into extra time with Negeri winning 1-0. No matter what, there will be goals… I can’s see the game going to penalties right now.<br /><br />We have no preference right now. It’s very much a matter of us wanting to ensure our place in the final is secured. After that we’ll deal with who our opponents will be. Right now we’re putting everything into making sure we get in the final<br /><br />I think the squad will be ready, because in the past few years although we’ve had good starting elevens, we lacked the depth needed to compete in the AFC <b>[Cup]</b>. And this year I certainly see that we have a bigger squad and quality players on the bench. If we were to compete <b>[in the AFC Cup]</b>, we’ll have the strength that is necessary</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia defender Matthew Davies also gave his early take on newly-appointed Malaysia head coach Nelo Vingada]</b> I haven’t chatted with any of my <b>[Malaysia]</b> teammates just yet, but the general consensus is if there are any risks to our lives or wellbeing whatsoever, we’d obviously like to avoid making the trip. It’s all well and good for people to say it should be fine, but at the end of the day, the players selected are the ones that have to take the risk and go over there themselves. We’re all people as well, with families and lives outside of football. But if the situation calls and we have to do it for our country, we’ll do what we have to do.<br /><br />I’m not sure if forfeiting is the appropriate course of action. I mean, personal safety is a huge, huge issue, and it’s something that all the players are concerned about as well. But there are large implications for forfeiting from the match that go beyond just this game and have huge consequences for the association <b>[Malaysian FA]</b> in general<br /><br />I have faith in FAM’s new administration, and I think at the end of the day they’ll come to the right decision, whatever that may be. As players we just have to accept that, no matter what<br /><br /><b>[On Nelo Vingada]</b> He certainly has a lot of experience within the region, it looks like it’s a good appointment at this stage. But I suppose no one really knows how he works and operates until he arrives. Hopefully he can draw on that experience to help our national team</p>

  <p><b>[Pahang skipper Matthew Davies is fully aware of the challenge that Selangor may provide them]</b> We’re the ‘lucky’ team that get to take on Selangor when Andik and Amri are back! I’m sure they both have something to prove so they’ll be firing, and we too are looking to bounce back straight away after the disappointing cup final <b>[FA Cup final against Kedah]</b>.<br /><br />It’s very important, we want to win and finish on a high note. It has been a very good half a season for us, so it’s important that we finish positively and take this result into the break, and really be proud of what we’ve achieved in the half-season<br /><br />Their strength lies in their ablility to play tactically in the 3-4-3 formation. They’re very good at what they do and are very difficult to break down, especially when they drop to five in the back with their two flankers coming back to help their back three<br /><br />The team morale is okay now. Obviously we’ve had a day and a half. <b>[We were]</b> a bit down and disappointed, but yesterday afternoon once we got back on the training field, we started laughing and joking together again, and now we’re refocused on the task at hand</p>
