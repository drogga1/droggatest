  <p><b>[Cosmin Olaroiu, Al Ahli’s manager, opened his fire on the referees following his team’s 2-1 win over Al Nasr in round 15 of Arabian Gulf League]</b> The players who were suspension threatened were the ones to ‘accidentally’ get yellow cards. Al Nasr’s goal was illegal. I cannot remember a serious attack for Al Nasr but one for Kembo.<br /><br /><b>[Cosmin also blamed the referee for Haikal’s reaction and red card at the stoppage time]</b> The referees make players angry like what happened with Haikal. I sent the interpreter a message with a list of players who would be booked and they happened to be the names who would miss the next game. We achieved a sad victory. We won by our men’s persistence and determination</p>

  <p><b>[Real’s late attempt to make Jiangsu pay for <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> after originally agreeing to allow the 30-year-old to join on a free transfer saw the move collapse]</b> It was very close. The club agreed with his agent, his agent was there. We agreed with Madrid and in the last month - I don’t know what happened there, they lose some friendly games by a big score - Madrid changed their mind. First they said they would release him and we would have to pay his salary, then suddenly they said: ‘No, you have to pay for the transfer’. And paying the transfer and his salary was a little bit over the budget and so we looked for another player. But, actually, I know that it was done 90 per cent in the evening, and then in the morning everything changed. But <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, not us<br /><br /><b>[Without <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>, Jiangsu finished fourth in the Chinese Super League at the end of last year]</b> We have to deal with this, but we have to also take care of the players. The players have family back home; they’re worried about this. I hope everyone will be OK, and they will find a solution to pass this moment quickly and everything to be fine again</p>
