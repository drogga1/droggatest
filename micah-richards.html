  <p><b>[Micah Richards on Paul Scholes]</b> He’s always in the right position, always seems to be at the end of the box when the ball drops in. The complete midfielder – when he’s fit, he’s the best. Some go missing but he’s in the right place at the right time. He’s my favourite player of all-time, unbelievable. If you give him a chance it’s a goal, isn’t it?</p>

  <p><b>[Micah Richards on his famous 2011 bust-up with <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a> during a <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> training session]</b> Mario is crazy, but one of the nicest guys ever. We were playing five-a-side and losing because Mario, being Mario, wasn’t tracking his runner. I was like, ‘Mario… track your man.’ But you know what he’s like. He started swearing in Italian and waving his hands. I said, ‘Mario I’m not in the mood today’. I lost my head, he lost his, and it was just bonkers. My favourite Mario story is when he went into the school to speak to the bully. He just does what he wants, doesn’t he?</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester City defender Micah Richards has retired from football at the age of 31]</b> I’m a footballer and I want to play football, but the knee would swell up to the point where I couldn’t even train properly. I would have liked to have given Aston Villa more on the pitch, but it just wasn’t to be.<br /><br />It’s not the ideal way to finish a career, for sure. It has been an unequal battle with injury ever since I left City and – being honest – for a good while during my last season at the Etihad. I finish my playing days happy that I reached the level that I did. I won the Premier League and the FA Cup, played for England and represented Great Britain at an Olympic Games. I consider myself blessed and I am looking forward to renewing my many friendships at City. It is a special place that looks after its own. City has always been my spiritual home and where I enjoyed my best years as a player. Being part of the side that ended the long wait for silverware – in 2011 and 2012 – was very special. It kick-started this new era and the club has never looked back. What has happened since has been amazing</p>

  <p><b>[Micah Richards says Sergio Aguero is up there with the Alan Shearers and the Thierry Henry]</b> I think if look at the goals he has scored, the one when we won the league, he seems to score not just goals but the important goals. I think Jesus when he comes up against stronger opposition, I’m not going to say he goes hiding but I know if I have Aguero upfront that my full trust is in him to either score, put in a shift or link-up play. I know with Aguero on the team sheet what I am going to get from him. He’s been in the Premier League for six or seven seasons now and I think he is still underrated. People don’t give him the respect he deserves. I think he is one of the best ever strikers to play in the Premier League, without a doubt. He’s up there with the Shearer’s and the Henry’s. I think Aguero, if he’s 100 per cent fit, he is striker number one for me</p>

A lot of the older pros - I won’t name names - they need the money and are bitter about the money in modern football.

He wanted the best. Some players want an arm around them but he didn’t care. He cared about results and pushed people. Some didn’t know how to deal with that. I really enjoyed someone saying: ‘You’re good but let’s improve you’. A lot thought they were ready-made stars and could not be improved. Every player can improve! It got difficult between the manager and players but he won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and FA Cup, and he will always be the manager who broke the duck and won the title</p>

His ability to get the best out of his players is a rare quality that separates him from most other managers. In football, talent can only take you so far.

His work is done behind the scenes, but he trusts the quality of his players to do it for him on the pitch and is ready to step in when necessary. He has a philosophy that he will stick with and he doesn’t rest on his laurels, even if City are winning by four or five goals, he wants more from his players – it’s a great combination<br /><br /><b>[The Blues academy graduate said of recruitment plans]</b> You’d imagine <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> may look to sign a defender in the next transfer window to replace Kompany - any team would miss a player of his quality. Even though he was injury prone last year, he still played and performed, in all the big games. Central defence is a position that they need to address if they are to retain the title again. The <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> injury is devastating news for the club as he was set to be the heartbeat of that defence and replace Kompany – <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> need to reinforce that position in January</p>

I would never back against City because the quality that they’ve got in the squad can turn a game on its head and the manager knows how to get the best out of every player.

  <p><b>[Micah Richards says Nicolas Otamendi has become a scapegoat at Manchester City]</b> I know he hasn’t played recently and he’s gone through a bit of a tough time but in these big games you need these players. This could be the game he has a good performance and that can set him up to have a great season. It’s a little bit difficult for him because now City are where they are in the league, he’s under the microscope and sometimes I feel like he can be the scapegoat of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>. Yeah, he does dive in too much for my liking but the season when they won the league and the year before, they were calling him ‘The General’. He had some really good performances, so I think he just needs to get his confidence back and hopefully it can be on Sunday<br /><br />It’s mind games. I think that’s what the title race needs – two great managers going up against each other. Pep’s come out on top a couple of times and he’s just trying to upset the applecart a little bit. I don’t think it’s fear. Why would it be? Pep’s already won the league. All the pressure is on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because they’re great in Europe and I think the fans just want that <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>. It looks like it’s stirred <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> up. When things were said when we were in the title race, people are going to say things but you don’t really react to it.

You know what, I’m going to go with that statement, I’m going to say Henderson is world class and a lot of the work that he does goes unnoticed because he’s not getting 10 assists a season or scoring 10 goals a season. I was referring to on the field but off the field as well. I’ve played with Henderson and he’s just an honest guy who would run through brick walls for you, he’s willing to improve, he wants the team to be at its best<br /><br />Any team that has lots of mercurial characters and youngsters needs a glue to bind it together and those two <b>[along with James Milner]</b> have done that and then some for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.

  <p><b>[Micah Richards says Champions League efforts with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> will make or break <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>’s legacy]</b> Replacing <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a>, when that moment comes, is going to be near impossible for City. His goal-scoring record is just incredible, and so is his attitude. For someone who is a genuine superstar, he is so humble - and he is the nicest man you will ever meet.<br /><br />A lot of superstars might be great talents on the pitch but can also be a bit difficult off it. With <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a>, both parts are spot on. With his talent and attitude, it was inevitable he would have so much success in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and of course he has his moment in history here already because his goal that won the title in 2012 will never be forgotten. But when he does leave the club, I just hope he has got a Champions League winners’ medal too, because that is the only thing he is missing at club level.<br /><br />Whether he wins it or not is not going to make or break his legacy as City’s greatest ever striker, or his reputation as a player, because he has already achieved so much. But it would put him right up there with the greats, which is where he deserves to be. Can City triumph in Europe this year? Well, they are certainly good enough going forward to win it, and <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> is just one of the reasons for that.</p>

I think the centre-back situation needs sorting, because I keep mentioning, in my opinion, <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> isn’t a centre-back; he’s better in midfield.

Otamendi - they were calling him ‘The General’ only 18 months ago. I don’t know if he’s got to an age where he can’t move as well anymore, but he’s not producing the same performances that we were seeing a couple of seasons ago. Stones has not played as much games as he would like. Has he lost the manager’s trust? Probably. So yep, it needs sorting</p>

  <p><b>[Micah Richards says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and Mancini tried but <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> might have taken to Balotelli]</b> Pep would probably like him. Pep is obviously passionate and some people can see it as over-the-top but he just genuinely loves football and Mario genuinely loves football as well, so he actually might have taken to him. But Pep’s such a perfectionist on the field, if Mario wasn’t hitting the heights that we all know he could, they might not see eye-to-eye. You see <b>[Raheem]</b> Sterling scoring a hat-trick or winning man of the match and Pep’s shouting at him on the pitch - talking about what he could do better or why hasn’t he done this. I don’t think Mario would react the best to that. But on a more human level I think they’d get on because they’re two top blokes<br /><br />There was a lot of people who didn’t really like him because he was Mancini’s favourite. He could get away with more stuff than other players and he always still managed to start or come on or whatever. But Mario, as a person, is one of the nicest people I’ve ever met. It’s just he does crazy things. I’m still in contact with him and he will always be one of my favourites. I just wish he could have shown more on the pitch because he’s genuinely one of the best players I’ve played with in terms of ability, shooting, technique - he’s absolutely incredible. I understood what Mancini and all the other coaches saw in him. At the time, we had <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a>, <b>[Edin]</b> <a href="edin-dzeko.html">Dzeko</a>, <b>[Sergio]</b> <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> and <b>[Carlos]</b> <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Tevez</a>. Look at that front line. I just wish he could have stayed longer because you know a lot of people were throwing stones at him and some of it was rightly so for sure, but there was more to him than people saw and he was a genuinely nice person off the field<br /><br /><b>[One notorious incident that enraged Mancini was in a pre-season friendly against Los Angeles Galaxy in 2011. <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a> was clean through midway through the first half when he pirouetted on the ball and tried to backheel a goal - only to put his attempt wide]</b> I asked Mario about it and he said: ‘I’m telling you now. I heard a whistle’. Even if he did hear a whistle or not, we were like: ‘Just score anyway’. But he was adamant that he heard a whistle so he stopped. But you never know with Mario because it fitted in with the rest of his antics. But I prefer the story that he was trying to take the mickey, it’s a better story. People might think he has wasted his talent away but it’s not the case. He’s been at some top clubs, Inter as a young one, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, and Milan - when he went back there he was unbelievable in that season. It’s not by luck how good he is. People say his attitude and his antics are not great but behind the scenes he works harder than most professionals I’ve ever worked with. When he went to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, a lot of people were questioning the signing. I was just like: ‘Come on Mario, this is the time to show people why you’re Super Mario’, but obviously, it didn’t work out</p>

  <p><b>[Richards says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> players overlooked for individual awards]</b> Every time a City player has been up for it, someone’s just pipped them but that season Yaya should have won it 100 per cent. I don’t think people are necessarily being bad to City when they don’t pick them, I just feel subconsciously other teams might think they’ve had all this investment and expect this to happen anyway. You could run through the team from <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a>, when he was on flames, <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a>, <b>[Pablo]</b> <a href="pablo-zabaleta.html">Zabaleta</a>, Yaya, <b>[David]</b> Silva, <b>[Sergio]</b> <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> - all of them could have won player of the year. But I think because we have had so much talent in the squad, that people just expect us to be that good. Like <b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne this season. I do believe it’s got to go to a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player because of how much they are winning the league by. But then City broke the points record and didn’t win it, so maybe De Bruyne could win it instead of <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane or <b>[Virgil]</b> Van Dijk<br /><br />He was coming from one of the biggest clubs in the world so we were welcoming him to the side. He’d played in the <b>[2009]</b> Champions League final <b>[win over Manchester United]</b> as a centre-half so we didn’t know what exactly he was. But after the first training session I was like: ‘Wow’. People just think he’s all power and pace but he has the technique of <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> but could run as fast and as strong as me. When he came as a defensive midfielder we already had Nigel de Jong so I didn’t know if we needed him to do that role. But he has everything. Silva’s probably my all-time favourite City player but Yaya had more strings to his bow<br /><br />We knew how important he was to our team because he’s a player that as soon as he turns it on, nobody in the world can deal with him. He’s a big part of our team, and if he leaves us for a month we could lose some vital games. I remember <b>[after a defeat at]</b> <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> when Yaya was away, Mancini nearly caused World War III in our dressing room. He said to us: ‘You can’t do without Yaya’. The dressing room erupted. I’ve never seen anything like it before, we all wanted to fight Mancini. After we settled down, he said: ‘I said that on purpose because I knew I would get that reaction. And how you have reacted now is exactly how I want you to react every single week on the pitch’. From that point on I thought we were going to win the league, no matter what obstacles were put in front of us, we were going to win it.</p>

  <p><b>[The story of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>’s first <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title]</b> I was out for five days in a row. I’m not a big drinker. But I probably had two hours’ sleep per night. I was drinking absolutely everything because I just couldn’t believe it<br /><br />No disrespect to them, Yaya and Silva - they were always going to win something. But when you’re a young player coming through the youth team at 14, to win a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> … you just can’t describe it. It was absolutely incredible. I was out with my mates. I remember a couple years before <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and Rio <b>[Ferdinand]</b> and all of them were walking around with their <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> medals. So I went out that night, and I made sure I had my <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> medal for everyone to see.<br /><br /><b>[Richards believed the glamour and excitement of the pre-season tour to Los Angeles 10 months earlier helped bring them together and set them up for the first title]</b> I think it all started when we were in LA. We just had a tight-knit group from then on. Normally in pre-season you’re in not the best of places and all the time after training, you just want to go back to the room and relax - watch some films or whatever. But because we were in Los Angeles, we were venturing out and got closer as a group. That really helped us to go and win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It helped obviously that we won the FA Cup the year before, but we believed in each other even more from that pre-season because we got to know each other more as people not just on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[City boss <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a> was hugely superstitious. The Italian is also religious, praying that City would win the title the night before and had prayer beads in his suit pocket at the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Etihad Stadium</a>. But that did not stop him shouting an unholy F<em>ck you! F</em>ck you! at his players when they fell 2-1 behind to 10-man QPR]</b> Everyone’s seen that clip of him swearing at every one!. Everything had been going so right and he’s waiting for just one moment against a team, which we should be battering probably 6 or 7-0. We had something like 20 corners in that game, and we couldn’t hit the target. So everyone was just like ‘we’ve lost the game’. I felt that on the bench when I was there. I was like: ‘I can’t believe this. Is this going be typical old City again?’ Everything was in slow motion</p>
