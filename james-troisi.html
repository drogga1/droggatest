  <p>[Melbourne Victory’s James Troisi would sacrifice his impressive scoring form if it would guarantee a win for his side as they look to avoid a fourth straight defeat] You get one [goal] and two and the rest start to come. It’s always more special when you’re scoring goals but it’s not like I was missing sitters. I didn’t really have many opportunities and now the ball’s falling at my feet and I’m putting it in the back of the net. I find my role here this time at Victory a little bit different. I’m creating a lot more chances for the boys … which as a number 10 is all you have to do. If I can score then it’s fantastic as well but in saying that the most important thing is that we’re picking up the points.<br /><br />It was a pretty difficult couple of weeks. We’ve had a normal week coming into this game on Saturday, so we’re looking forward to it. I think the most important thing is the football we’ve been playing the last two games. We definitely should have got points out of those games, so we’re playing some good football and we’re in a good way at the moment. So we’re looking to rectify, I guess, the points we haven’t picked up</p>

  <p>[James Troisi insists Melbourne Victory are focused on catching Sydney FC] We’re definitely going to keep fighting for top spot. As long as we focus on ourselves and play the way we want to play, when we win that’s what it’s all about. We’re very happy. There’s a lot of tough games coming up, for the other teams as well, so it will be interesting.<br /><br />[Asked about the manner of the win] It was fantastic, it was more like us. We worked hard, we played to our structure and we created a lot of chances. We scored three but we could have had a lot more. That’s the most pleasing thing about the game<br /><br />I’m doing my thing. I’m happy with the way I’m playing at the moment. Obviously I’m scoring goals but more importantly I’m providing goals for my team. As long as I keep doing my stuff on the pitch that [the Socceroos] will take care of itself</p>
