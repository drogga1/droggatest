  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory’s James Troisi would sacrifice his impressive scoring form if it would guarantee a win for his side as they look to avoid a fourth straight defeat]</b> You get one <b>[goal]</b> and two and the rest start to come. It’s always more special when you’re scoring goals but it’s not like I was missing sitters. I didn’t really have many opportunities and now the ball’s falling at my feet and I’m putting it in the back of the net. I find my role here this time at Victory a little bit different. I’m creating a lot more chances for the boys … which as a number 10 is all you have to do. If I can score then it’s fantastic as well but in saying that the most important thing is that we’re picking up the points.<br /><br />It was a pretty difficult couple of weeks. We’ve had a normal week coming into this game on Saturday, so we’re looking forward to it. I think the most important thing is the football we’ve been playing the last two games. We definitely should have got points out of those games, so we’re playing some good football and we’re in a good way at the moment. So we’re looking to rectify, I guess, the points we haven’t picked up</p>

  <p><b>[James Troisi insists Melbourne Victory are focused on catching Sydney FC]</b> We’re definitely going to keep fighting for top spot. As long as we focus on ourselves and play the way we want to play, when we win that’s what it’s all about. We’re very happy. There’s a lot of tough games coming up, for the other teams as well, so it will be interesting.<br /><br /><b>[Asked about the manner of the win]</b> It was fantastic, it was more like us. We worked hard, we played to our structure and we created a lot of chances. We scored three but we could have had a lot more. That’s the most pleasing thing about the game<br /><br />I’m doing my thing. I’m happy with the way I’m playing at the moment. Obviously I’m scoring goals but more importantly I’m providing goals for my team. As long as I keep doing my stuff on the pitch that <b>[the Socceroos]</b> will take care of itself</p>

  <p><b>[James Troisi reckons he did everything he could on Tuesday - bar score a goal - to maintain a starting berth with the Socceroos]</b> I don’t know if there was much more I could do. Possibly, hit the back of the net but I did what I had to do. For me, it’s about getting on the pitch and doing my thing, which I have done at my club and I did that Tuesday night. I’ll leave that <b>[selection]</b> up to the boss <b>[Postecoglou]</b>..<br /><br /><b>[The 28-year-old started alongside Jackson Irvine in Sydney as one of two central attacking midfielders in Postecoglou’s new 3-2-4-1 formation]</b> For me it’s perfect because we play with two sixes <b>[defensive midfielders]</b> and two 10s <b>[attacking midfielders]</b>. Out of that squad … I’m probably a natural number 10, so for me it’s perfect. That’s one of the reasons why I did so well on Tuesday night. So for me, it suits me and obviously we want to play attacking football, which that’s the way we set up to do<br /><br /><b>[The Adelaide-born playmaker declared Victory were a key factor in his return to the national team]</b> One of the main reasons coming back here to Victory is obviously I know what I’m getting. You know, I’m comfortable here, I get looked after and I get to play, I guess, some of my best football</p>

  <p><b>[James Troisi and James Donachie have enough ACL experience to know how tough Brisbane’s task will be]</b> It’s definitely not going to be easy for them but in saying that, that’s the way it is. I’m not sure what type of squad they took over. I’m sure they’ll rest a few players. Obviously the game the other day was quite tough for them, went into extra time but we can’t focus on that and ‘say it’ll be easy’… because if we think like that we’re going to be punished.</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory duo Leigh Broxham and James Troisi are unfazed about playing on a potentially dodgy pitch at Allianz Stadium when they face Sydney FC in the A-League grand final]</b> It’s been the same all season, so it doesn’t really matter. It’s the same for both teams. We will try and play the way we normally play. Obviously, it is going to be a bit more difficult but, like I said, from what I can remember, all our games there have been the same - even with the Socceroos, the pitch was exactly the same. So it doesn’t really matter for me.</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC’s defence has set all kinds of records this season but Melbourne Victory attacking midfielder James Troisi insists the Sky Blues are vulnerable ahead of the A-League grand final]</b> I don’t think it’s impenetrable. If you look at all our games <b>[against Sydney]</b>, we had quite a lot of opportunities. Especially the last game we played them, we just couldn’t take those opportunities. So they are vulnerable and obviously we want to be switched on defensively, and I think that was one of the most impressive things about the Brisbane game. Defensively we were fantastic and they didn’t really cause use much trouble. With our attacking line and with the support of our defence and our midfield, we’re definitely going to create chances. So it’s going to be a good game.</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos midfielder James Troisi has embraced Ange Postecoglou’s target of winning the Confederations Cup as Australia travel to Russia]</b> We want to test us against the best and I’m sure there are not many backing us, but that’s how all of us have had it through most of our career, so there’s no problem with that. We want to go there and try and win it, so that’s all we’ll be aiming to do - try and win every game. So definitely going to be a hard task but you wouldn’t be there if it wasn’t.<br /><br /><b>[Since Germany humbled Australia 4-0 at the 2010 World Cup, the Socceroos have notched a win and a draw in two friendlies, with Troisi scoring in the 2-2 stalemate in 2015]</b> That was probably one of Australia’s best performances. On the night we probably should have won that but … to play against some of the best players, some of the best countries in the world - that’s what it’s all about. I thoroughly enjoyed <b>[the Brazil game]</b>. Obviously not the result we wanted but we’ll build on that and really looking forward to the Germany game</p>

  <p><b>[Australian midfielder James Troisi believes coach Ange Postecoglou’s controversial 3-4-3 formation functions well]</b> I think everyone knows the boss by now. Nothing’s going to change. It works <b>[the game plan and new 3-4-3 formation]</b>. It’s shown it works. Obviously against different opposition it’s a little more difficult. And on Thursday night it was quite difficult and all credit to the Japanese.<br /><br />We’re in a little tricky situation. The last couple of days have been a little bit tough. But we know what we have to do and to get it done. I guess it’s a bit of a do-or-die situation. Not that we don’t have anything to lose, but we have everything to gain. And on Tuesday night we have no choice but to be on fire</p>
