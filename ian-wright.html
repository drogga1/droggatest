  <p><b>[Former Arsenal star Ian Wright believes the Gunners lack a cohesive plan in the transfer market]</b> Everything that is happening is being forced on them through other people. Mkhitaryan is not a player Arsenal have been after - he’s a player that Arsenal have been handed. It’s the same with <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> - a couple of years ago, he was on everyone’s radar but now he’s gone a bit cold. Then all of a sudden, he’s on Arsenal’s radar - it all feels panicky for me. Of course they are both quality players. But if you are losing Sanchez, you need players that will hit the ground running. I’m not sure about Mkhitaryan’s state of mind right now</p>

  <p><b>[Ian Wright has said that Pep Guardiola would make Manchester United as good as his Manchester City side given the opportunity]</b> If you put the two sides up together and playing at their full capacity, that would be some game. Because when you look at City’s team, they are so collectively on the same wavelength. If you look at Man Utd’s team, in respect of individuals, I think they are great players and just as good as City’s players. But they are not a collective, they are not together collectively and if they could put it together in the way they are being coached like Man City, I believe they could be in and around City. If they swapped managers, I think United would be doing exactly what City are doing because they have the kind of players that Pep would be able to get a tune out of, without a doubt, because he would not play how Mourinho plays.<br /><br /><b>[On Mourinho’s style]</b> You cannot tell me that the players United have got do not look over there enviously at how brilliant and free they are playing. You cannot tell me that is not how Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial all want to play. That is how they all want to play because they look like they are having fun as well</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal great Ian Wright has praised fans of the north London club for staying away from games]</b> You hope that they will see that the fans have had enough. Arsenal fans get a lot of stick on social media and people laugh at them. They threaten to do stuff and it doesn’t quite happen but this is the first time I’ve seen a positive step from the fans. I was there the other day and it’s not good to see but with the prices that they pay, they’ve had to listen to excuses, they’ve watched players leave, they’ve watched really incompetent performances and they’ve still gone in their droves. They should show that they are not happy. I’m pleased that they’ve done it and hopefully the board will be looking<br /><br />They are looking at the club falling away and nothing being done.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal need to back their next manager with more than £50 million]</b> We know there is no huge war chest for the next boss. Around £50m has been quoted - not in the same league as Chelsea or the Manchester clubs. By my reckoning, Arsenal need a centre-half, a keeper and possibly another midfielder. What the new boss has to do is arrive with the knowledge he must develop what’s already there and turn them into Premier League stars. I do think there’s the basis to do that, though. I love the look of centre- back Konstantinos Mavropanos, Ainsley Maitland-Niles is a player, and Alex Iwobi continues to improve. Young Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson are great prospects, too. So it isn’t a case of starting from scratch. Arsenal need someone with strength of character, confidence, tactical and coaching ability and an affinity for youth. From the top, it needs patience and nerve, plus the courage to speak up for the manager.</p>

  <p><b>[Ian Wright believes that the criticism faced by Manchester City and England star Raheem Sterling is motivated by racism]</b> How many people do you see get the criticism Sterling gets? The football criticism is something every player has to deal with, but what he gets I don’t see any other footballer getting. They don’t get that stick because for whatever reason they don’t rub up the people in the corridors of power the wrong way. I think there is an agenda against him. There is an element of people at high end of the media who want to keep that guy down. Simple. When you look at the wave of criticism that he takes, there is a certain amount of racism towards it - what else can it be? They are picking on him because of the the background he has come from and they want to keep him down, drag him back down. They don’t want him to continue to be a success. People say you are playing the racism card, but you give me a good reason why Raheem Sterling gets the stick he gets for just being a footballer.</p>

  <p><b>[United manager Jose Mourinho is in danger of emulating the car-crash ending to Arsene Wenger’s reign at Arsenal]</b> The saddest thing of all when I look at United under Jose Mourinho? As much as I respect him as a manager, I can’t see any way it is going to turn around. We all know about Jose and his third-year syndrome. But, listening to him talk, it’s as though even he has accepted it himself. It has me screaming: ‘Come on, man. You’ll go down as one of the greats, but the way you’re acting will tarnish everything you’ve done’. In many ways it’s like the last days of Arsene Wenger. People were watching Arsenal because it was car-crash football. United are fast turning into the same.<br /><br />You can’t say there has been no progress under Jose, because there has. They’ve won a Europa League and League Cup, and last term finished second in the table. But that’s been to the detriment of the sort of football which has long been their mantra. The people upstairs can’t be happy, the fans certainly aren’t and Jose’s definitely not. And as for the players? It’s clearly not a good situation. Something really isn’t right. Mourinho has had a pop at players time and again, he had another go in pre-season and now finds himself having to call on some of them. I’m not for one second suggesting in any way they’re throwing games. But equally, you cannot tell me some aren’t thinking, ‘This serves you right’.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal and England striker Ian Wright told that he believes Sanchez’s malaise stretches back to before his transfer north]</b> Coming to the end of his Arsenal time he was playing in a fashion that made you think he just wants to get away. His body language was bad, he was throwing his arms about and he was doing exactly what we’re seeing him do now. He’s giving the ball away, every now and again he can still create something and put the ball in the box. But the fact he had his first rest in nine seasons and he had a pretty good pre-season made me think he was back but it’s not happening for him. I don’t think he can warrant a place at the moment when you’ve got Rashford and Martial waiting to play</p>

And the fact that he is capable of scoring goals against all types of opposition. He’s someone that I think Arsenal should definitely try to sign up for the long term. He’s valuable to Arsenal. I think he’s got eight to 10 goals in him over the course of a season. In the current climate, I don’t think Arsenal can afford to let someone like that go.</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Ramsey’s contract saga at Arsenal should have been avoided]</b> That Ozil situation has had a massive effect on what’s going on right now because Aaron Ramsey is captain material. It should have been done ages ago. Ivan Gazidis has got a lot to answer for for this to happen because Ramsey should be a focal point in the team. He’s somebody who is the heartbeat of the team and when it’s going poorly or badly, he still shows for the ball and tries to play how he wants to play, tries to get in the box and des things. He’s somebody that I’d like to see stay because I think he is that player who is never afraid. He scores goals. I like him simply because when he gets in there he will finish and he’s somebody that, given a run of games, he will do something because he’s not afraid. He doesn’t hide. He’s somebody that if they can get it going, I’m desperate for him to stay but I do understand that Arsenal cannot continue to let players dictate like they are now. If it’s going to happen, take the contract off the table, take your chances with it</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal are right to have made a big statement in contract talks with Aaron Ramsey]</b> What I do like about him and what I will always give him credit for, is that he never hides, never ever hides. No matter what stick he gets, he never hides. I have to stick with Arsenal, they have to make this kind of stance, the amount of players we’ve lost in this fashion. I believe that Arsenal want him to stay, but they have to make this stance. I think Arsenal have to do this, they have to make everybody else in the squad know how it’s going to be from this day onwards, and that’s why the withdrawal of the contract is a big statement from them. And it’s a massive one as we’re on the verge of losing another player that’s a good player for Arsenal</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling offered the best possible response to their critics]</b> Harry Kane couldn’t have given a better response if he’d sat down and written the script himself. It’s been absolutely remarkable to hear the way some people have been putting the boot in on the England captain of late. Yes, before last night the Spurs striker had gone six games without a goal for his country. But never, for a single second, had Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate shown the slightest concern. In Seville we saw exactly why - and exactly why Kane, whether he’s banging in hat-tricks or not, is such a vital player for club and country. That first-half performance was one we couldn’t have dared to even dream about. Not against a Spain team under Luis Enrique. And while Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford rightly got the headlines for 45 of the most impressive minutes I’ve seen from England, you can’t overlook Kane’s role.<br /><br />The thing Harry’s found since his World Cup hat-trick is that when you’re a top-class goalscorer, it is often all you’re judged on. But there’s always been so much more to his game than that. In Seville we saw exactly what. His work-rate is phenomenal, as club manager Mauricio Pochettino has pointed out plenty of times at Tottenham. Harry showed when players run past him, like Rashford did in Croatia and last night, and when Raheem bombs forward, he is well capable of holding it up and linking as well as anyone. Maybe now - even if he’s not rattling in a hatful of goals every week - Harry’s critics will realise there’s a lot more to him than finishing. A heck of a lot more<br /><br />I can’t let last night pass by without paying my own tribute to Raheem - if anyone deserved it, he’s the man. We all knew he’d gone a long time without an international goal. Yet never once did he hide, never once did he fail to show for the ball and never once did he have a pop back. Raheem kept his head down, kept fighting away and now has his reward</p>

Wolves, on the counter-attack, they had a plan for us and we were very fortunate to get away with that. I love our manager. At half-time, he realised we were getting hurt on the right-hand side because <b>[Pierre-Emerick]</b> Aubameyang wasn’t getting back to help <b>[Sead]</b> Kolasinac, which is a worry for me in itself. I was pleased he made the decision to do that at half-time, as much as it’s hard on <b>[Alex]</b> Iwobi because he has been playing well recently. The tactical fouls that they made on us were clever and stopped our flow. There wasn’t enough creativity from us. Mesut came off. He couldn’t quite get into it because Wolves had the two banks of players and he couldn’t find the space that he needed.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have made the correct decision in letting Aaron Ramsey leave]</b> He is a top player, when you get a top player like that who is going for free, you are going to have teams of that calibre <b>[Bayern]</b> coming for them. I think it might be the perfect time for us and for him to move on. I think the boss should be given now the time, especially the money, to try and find maybe one or two replacements for someone like Aaron Ramsey, rather than giving Aaron Ramsey the kind of money he was asking for. Maybe we can get two, maybe three players at the 70, maybe £80,000-a-week level to come in and really bolster up the squad and contribute more.<br /><br />I think it might be time for Aaron to move on and I think it is a really good move for him, so hopefully we can, whether it is this window or the summer, we can get a few players in that fill that gap. It isn’t something I’m too disappointed about, I’m pleased for him and I’m pleased for the new ruthless Arsenal in respects of the way they are saying, ‘if that’s the way it is going to be, then that’s the way it is going to be’. I don’t think we are going to see too many more players running down contracts and leaving on their terms anymore. Unfortunately we see with Danny Welbeck - he was running his down and unfortunately he got injured and this is the jeopardy, when you are trying to run down your contract.</p>

I was hoping that they were going to manage the game a little bit better, but anything can happen. If they start well and start quickly, the nerves could hit Atlanta.<br /><br />They <b>[NYRB]</b> are playing at home, they need to fly out the blocks but need to be careful not to leave the back door open.

  <p><b>[Ian Wright has praised the impact Unai Emery has had at Arsenal]</b> I love the ruthlessness. love that the team comes first over every player. He makes substitutions when we need it and we’ve seen he is willing to substitute someone at half-time. Everyone around the club only has positive things to say and that’s not easy when all they know for such a long time is one manager. The players he’s added to the squad have been a success and his plan for integrating them was perfect.<br /><br /><b>[on Granit Xhaka]</b> There is no doubt in his football ability. He has a fantastic left foot and has a great passing range. But speaking honestly he is a player that worries me - simply because of the lack of concentration with his defensive duties. Wolves and Cardiff are two good examples. I do like <b>[seeing]</b> him trying to organise the team and get people into the right positions, so he does show leadership on the field.

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend Ian Wright believes Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has what it takes to become an all-time goalscoring great for the Gunners]</b> At the moment with him scoring 20 goals in 31 games he’s going to be ranked number one! He’s had a phenomenal start to his Arsenal career. He’s got him on the left hand side, but for someone who has not had a consistent run in the team his goalscoring return will be way up there on the goalscoring charts. The rate in which he’s scoring is better than any of us. He’s got to 20 goals in 31 games - it took me and Thierry 40. I thought at the time I was playing every single game, he’s coming on as a sub. If he can continue scoring at this rate he probably be well up there in the goalscoring ranks<br /><br />Arsenal are improving. You only have to look at their away record from last season. They’ve scored more goals in the second half than anyone else In games. That says to me that Arsenal are not only physically stronger but mentally stronger as well. People can say whatever they want about the manner in which they’ve gone on this 18 game unbeaten run but they’re ready for this big test against Tottenham, just like they were against Liverpool. They’re confident and have got momentum. He’s <b>[Emery]</b> not resting on his laurels because 18 games is something you could be pleased with. He looks to me like someone is still a very much work in progress. That’s why he makes the decisions he makes for the team. Because he knows they can get better and under him I think they will get better<br /><br />The platforms that I’m on now are the platforms I want to be on to get my opinion across. The thing I love about it even more is the personalisation of the whole thing and the feedback I get from people is that they’re very much engaged it. I’ve always had a great affinity for fans. On a YouTube channel you know you’re going to get genuine debates and genuine questions</p>

He’s an unbelievable player but can he do it? I don’t know if he can. I had Arsenal fans coming over to me saying he’s had 19 assists. Thierry Henry had 20 assists and 30 odd goals - and he done it twice! Is that what we want, just assists? Is that what you’re going to throw in my face? And a hat-trick against Ludogorets</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend Ian Wright says that Robin van Persie was justified in his decision to leave the Gunners for Manchester United]</b> It’s really hard for fans. I do feel for Robin because he was so unfortunate with injuries at our club and he stayed as long as he could, he saw people leaving around him. Being an ex-player I can totally understand <b>[his decision to leave]</b> but coming from a fans’ point of view you can see why they would be very, very disappointed with the fact that he left and he went to Manchester United and won the title with them. Let’s face it, he won the title literally single-handedly for them. They would have loved him to stay and be fit enough to try and do that for Arsenal but it’s very difficult to say you want the fans to forgive him when he left and did exactly what he left for.<br /><br />It’s like when I left Crystal Palace. I love Crystal Palace but the fans have a problem with me simply because I left and went to Arsenal and was a success. I said to them I’m leaving to win trophies. Robin van Persie left talking to us about the ‘little boy’ in him who said he had to take this chance. He was totally justified in doing that because he won a Premier League medal. For anybody to expect Arsenal fans to welcome him with open arms is something that I can’t answer. There’s a certain loyalty that fans will want and unfortunately for Robin he just got himself into the situation where the greatest club in this country came calling with one of the greatest managers in world football - and it’s very difficult to turn that down</p>

But the fact is that that kind of elevated everybody’s expectations a bit and I still feel top four is still out of our reach if I’m going to be totally honest. The Europa League is something that Arsenal should be really focusing on, for me. To be honest it’s the only thing you can focus on because if you look at the way it has gone in the Premier League, and it looks like they’ve fallen away a bit, Arsenal. Chelsea look like they’re maybe going to emerge a little bit now they’ve got the striker they need, Man United are really on form. You have to say that it’s looking a little bit worrying in respect of top four. But I think that Europa League is what Arsenal should be focusing on.

And then Mustafi, his fingerprints are all over the crime scene - pushing him <b>[Kane]</b> in the back. They get the penalty, score the penalty.<br /><br />I thought the manager got the shape right.

There’d be comments like ‘Do you have steak at home, you don’t even know how to spell sauté potatoes?’. This would be from guys calling me ‘a 20-minute player’. I remember those times. It was really intimidating to the point I stopped coming down<br /><br /><b>[One specific person, however, started to notice. And it is a person that Wright credits with changing his entire outlook on football, and even life: his manager]</b> Steve Coppell came up to me and asked ‘Why are you not coming down?’. He explained to me why you cannot let people dictate your life to you, and make you feel you have to act differently. ‘What’s the worst that can happen? They don’t like you any more than they do already?’ He was the one that made me realise I want to face that problem. That was the kind of person he was. He always spoke to me in a way where he was telling me something, to do something right<br /><br /><b>[He is joyously comfortable in himself, and he credits people like Steve Coppell for that]</b> You’ve got to remember, I came in straight off the building site, straight into Steve. He was somebody that obviously recognised I might be able to do something, and he was somebody that was always very strict with me. It was what I needed<br /><br />He also told me ‘If you don’t know, just ask. Whatever company you’re in, if there’s something you don’t understand, ask’. He gave me that kind of wisdom.<br /><br />That was the kind of person he was. And I recognised that really early. He was really honest with me. He said to me, when I was having all the problems at Palace early days, ‘Listen, things will change, and you are going to be a big part of what happens here. There are going to be people that will not be here, and you’ll see how easier it will be for you. Like I’m saying to you, trust yourself’<br /><br />And you know, I was there ‘What are you talking about man?’ But obviously next season, <a href="mark-bright.html">Mark Bright</a> came in with the rest of the guys and made me a component in the team and all of a sudden you see what he’s been saying<br /><br /><b>[There was a time when he felt restrained on a football pitch, too. That, however, was one reason why he came into the professional game so late]</b> I felt confident to a certain extent, I was playing Sunday morning football and I was doing OK, but every time I went for trials, 12 to 17, <b>[Leyton]</b> Orient and all these places, Charlton <b>[Athletic]</b>, I didn’t get into them. My confidence was low. The only football trial I ever got through was Palace. Once I got there, I thought to myself, ‘I’m going to do my thing, I’m going to play how I play’. And I remember, after, the first trial, Steve Coppell spoke to me - because I was trying things; skill; shots from ridiculous distances; scoring goals; going past people - and he said ‘Never change the way you approach a football match’<br /><br />Coppell always told me ‘They don’t want to lose the ball and have to chase back towards their own goal because people will roast them, so they’re blaming you for not protecting them. It’s natural. Don’t worry about it, but don’t change the way you play. Have confidence in what you do, because what you do is what a lot of people out there can’t do’. He gave me the confidence to make me feel I was the only person out there who could do what I could do<br /><br />And remember I was going into the professional game, so I’d start a game and it wouldn’t work out so well, then I’d come on for 20 minutes and do well, so they’d say I was a ‘20-minute player’. Of course I had major doubts, thinking ‘This isn’t going to work out’. Remember, when I signed for Palace, it was only for three months. Steve Coppell wanted to sign me for more, but Ron Noades, he genuinely couldn’t afford it to the point where he had to wait to see if it was going to happen for me. Steve Coppell always said it was going to be fine. I wasn’t used to it at all, somebody having total faith in me like my teacher Mr Pidgen, somebody that you don’t want to let down<br /><br /><b>[He believes Coppell’s influence goes even deeper]</b> He was always hard with me but fair. If I for instance started to get above my station in training, he’d always pull me back, and he’d do it in front of people. It was something I could easily accept, because it was someone who saw me from inception. So he’s the one who moulded me, out of everyone, the one who made me what I am, my work ethic, how I treated people, how I treated trialists<br /><br />So when people like <a href="john-salako.html">John Salako</a> came in, he was a nightmare some of the time, shooting and not crossing, then you’d have a go at him, Steve Coppell would be saying: ‘Don’t you remember what was happening to you. Don’t pass that on’. So we made sure we took him in. Steve Coppell changed everything about how I am as a man today<br /><br /><b>[<a href="david-dein.html">Dein</a> then helped changed what Wright was as a player, and took another leap of faith in him]</b> <a href="david-dein.html">David Dein</a> was the one that got that extra 250 over the line.

The fans are going to love you, you are exactly what we need’<br /><br />He used to come in and see us all before a game started, shake everyone’s hand, and would say to me ‘There’s a goal in you’. And he’d say it to me every time, with a smile. He’s somebody I now speak to every day. We text.

I remember afterwards, the lads, I’d only been around them a week, so they all came over, ‘Brilliant’, ‘Well done’ but ‘Don’t expect anything from him!’<br /><br />He was that kind of father figure in your life, where you could never please him, but all he’d need to do was look at you and smile, and you’d feel like a million dollars. That’s what some dads are like, and then when you get older you realise why they were doing what they were doing<br /><br />Whereas <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> just wanted to pass on wisdom. He’d talk to you the way your granddad would speak to you in respect of giving you wisdom. You just wanted to please him. Giving you a responsibility about what you do. Two different things, and I needed them both<br /><br /><b>[He also feels young players in modern football need this kind of greater guidance now, precisely because the game has changed so much from what Wright came into. It actually makes the issue all the more relevant]</b> With the modern player, from the age of eight or nine, they’re in academies, they have all the football kit, they have this regimented way about them, everything is perfect … but if things start going a little bit awry, they’re looking around ‘What’s going wrong here, what’s happening? This isn’t the perfect world, this isn’t right, this isn’t how it’s meant to be’<br /><br />I think that the modern-day footballer, because everything is given to him, especially if you’re an elite player in the academy, your hardship is going to come when you start playing for a top team, and you get criticism, and people are going at you. ‘Why isn’t this happening for me? Why’s it like this? Why am I getting so much abuse?’ It’s more difficult for them because of the way they’ve been brought through. They’ve been guarded and shielded from the real world, until they get out there, and all of a sudden social media is in your face like you never believe. It’s something you have to deal with there and then, and that’s why you see some of them struggle to deal with it<br /><br />When they get in touch with me, I tell them exactly what I think. I make sure they know I love them so much, but I’m going to let them know ‘You’re not doing this, you’re not doing that, and the reason is it’s in training, are you doing this, are you doing that, what you doing late at night, are you getting rest?’ I say all that stuff. The lessons have been invaluable</p>

But we’re here now and what we need to do, and as much as people are saying it’s a risk, of course it’s a risk but as fans and as owners and everybody, we just need to back him, we’ve got to go in. It’s a risk of course, it’s a risk we have to go all in, we have to put all the chips on it. The people upstairs, from owners to fans to everybody. We’ve got to go in and support Mikel with everything he does, whether that’s in the transfer market, whether that’s the players that’s going to go out. That’s going to happen, there’s a lot of players at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> that we need to get rid of. You know that and I know that. When Mikel comes in, he’ll probably know that when he’s watched them and he’s played against them. Even the other day he would have said ‘Right, I’m getting rid of him, him, him and him’. The fact is that we’ve got to back him in that particular instance</p>

This is what I received for posting and talking about #BlackLivesMatter yesterday. The abuse started a week earlier, the taunting is terrifying. Coming back and back again. Let’s show these social media companies how bad this has got, it’s ridiculous!!! So easy for them!! If you or a black friend has had online racist abuse then please post a tweet with the hashtags #NoConsequences and #BlackLivesMatter.<br /><br />Football is the punching bag. When you hear people having a go at football because <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> are having meetings … they have to have meetings because at some stage things have to start again. Just because football is a game … it’s still a business, just like other businesses are making plans to try and get themselves going again</p>

  <p><b>[Earlier this year, a teenage boy handed himself in to police after the former England and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> striker Ian Wright also shared racist abuse he received online]</b> I know I’m not meant to look at them but these messages still hit me so hard man. This is a child!!! This kid has a direct line into me and is able to send this without any worry<br /><br /><b>[The messages included a number of racist terms and one read]</b> if I get corona I will cough in your face</p>
