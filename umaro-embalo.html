<blockquote>
  <p>[Umaro Embalo is already sparking talk of interest from Manchester United] It’s a great reference for me and I think we have many characteristics in common, many people recognise that. I respect him a lot and really enjoy watching his games, enjoying his football. I always follow Di Maria and before my games I watch videos of him to try to imitate him.<br /><br />Sometimes people tell me this kind of thing [that he is the star of his generation], but I do not think about it, I just try to evolve more and learn new things. I do not think I’m bigger than anyone, I work for myself and try to improve daily. I think I’m in a good moment, I’ve learned a lot and I’m working hard, doing my best in all training and games and I think things are going well. Benfica have been placing a lot of faith in youngsters, not only in me but also in many of my colleagues. The academy has been a source of great hope for the club and this represents a great responsibility. We have to give our maximum every day. Our national teams are also very strong at the moment, we have excellent players in all divisions. This is very important for our evolution and for the future of Portuguese football</p>
