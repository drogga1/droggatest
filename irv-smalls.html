  <p><b>[<a href="bruce-buck.html">Bruce Buck</a> called up his friend Irv Smalls, the executive director at FC Harlem, to come to London to covertly meet <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a>]</b> I met <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a> before he signed here. There are confidential parts but it was great to meet him with at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, who we have partnered with since 2013. As we walked around <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> carefully dodging stadium tour groups we had a good chat about growing up in Hershey, the smell of chocolate and the Hershey Kiss Lights, Hershey Park and I talked about our program in Harlem and the work we do with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He is a nice kid, laid back. I have caught up with him since. He has a good head on his shoulders and seems to have the right attitude and behaviour to continue his football development at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He doesn’t fit for me the typical American-style footballer. He has got more of a European style, fluid, silky, kind of glides around the pitch. It has been pleasure watching him thus far with the Blues<br /><br /><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have now partnered with Smalls with his vision to see the same opportunities given to inner city kids like those in Harlem with wider reform also on his mind]</b> There are many talented and hungry youths in the Manhattan, Harlem and Bronx neighbourhoods of NYC from which we serve, that just don’t get opportunities to properly develop their passion for the game.<br /><br />I came to London in 2013 and we went to the academy and I met some of the executives. I saw a lot of kids from different cultures come into the cafeteria. I said: ‘Do you have a diversity initiative at your club?’ They were like: ‘What do you mean?’ I responded: ‘That’s a college basketball team in the U.S., that’s not soccer. They were saying we are in the business of developing world class players, period. Race or your socio-economic status is not a criteria for development.<br /><br />In the United States, neighbourhoods like Harlem and the Bronx exist across the country and house untapped potential talent that could be a hotbed like we see with South East London. That’s where you get <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a>, <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> and <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a>. Of course, it is not apples to apples and there is a long-standing history and culture of football in Europe. The sport is seen as way out to improve outcomes for them and their families the way basketball is viewed in our communities in the U.S. Those kids from South East London are the hungriest. This is their chance. The kids in our community are hungry, they just don’t know the system or politics. They don’t have the access to the network or contacts to navigate a growing youth football culture in the U.S.<br /><br />It still has several barriers to entry. Some which are institutionalised by the suburban pay-to-play youth system, whether they want to acknowledge it or not. Then there are some of the everyday challenges that disadvantaged youth have in their communities that wealthier families don’t encounter. Often the system wants to tell our communities: ‘If there is talent send them to us and we will take it from there’. I have done that and I have seen it is not that simple. It is not a meritocracy as they would want you to believe. I have seen clubs and coaches in the system wanting to use players to win games but not develop them as players as young men and women.<br /><br /><b>[Smalls is now motivated and driven with a clear purpose of providing a quality grassroots-to-pro-football development pathway for the untapped disadvantaged youth of urban America]</b> It is so easy to dismiss our communities and say you can’t, you won’t, you don’t have and you will never have because of this, that or the other.<br /><br />I am all about being solution-oriented at this point in my life. We understand in all sports the likelihood of going pro is small, but as the kids have often said to us: ‘Build a pathway, give us an opportunity to dream and achieve it we might surprise you’.<br /><br />Since my time at <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> I make it point to keep myself educated on the business of football and then share this with our players. I am honest with them about the challenges and what it takes to succeed, often the biggest challenges are off the pitch. It is not just being physically prepared it emotionally, mentally and spiritually being grounded. I want them to not only aspire to be an elite player but they could own a team, run merchandising or whatever and give back to their communities.<br /><br />If we put them in the system, we have to continue mentoring them every step of the way. Now the World Cup is coming to the U.S, we are ambitious. I say we need a whole new system to engage these inner cities. It is not just for these kids but to help the U.S. become a better soccer country</p>
