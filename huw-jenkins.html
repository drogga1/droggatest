  <p><b>[Swansea City chairman Huw Jenkins has said manager Bob Bradley’s job is not under threat]</b> I don’t know where that story came from, but it’s natural in football that everyone wants and needs results. But the last thing we need at this moment of time is a continual change in manager. We need stability first and foremost. Perhaps in the summer I could have made a better decision. From preseason onwards, I don’t think things were right – it was too flat. But we’re with Bob now to try and turn that corner, and that is what we are working towards.</p>

  <p><b>[Swansea City have sacked manager Paul Clement after a poor first half to the Premier League season]</b> To change the manager, especially at only the halfway point of the season, is the last thing we wanted to do as a club. We had three different manager last season and as a result we all wanted to give Paul as much time as possible to turn things around. But we felt we couldn’t leave it any longer and needed to make a change to give us the best chance of an uplift and a turnaround in fortunes with the club bottom of the Premier League.</p>

  <p><b>[Swansea City have named former Sheffield Wednesday boss Carlos Carvalhal as their new manager to replace the sacked Paul Clement]</b> We felt we needed to get the managerial situation resolved as soon as possible and while the timing is not always perfect, we can look forward to the second half of the campaign with renewed optimism.<br /><br />Carlos’ time at Sheffield Wednesday, which included securing two consecutive play-off places, highlighted that he has great character and personality to lead the squad and the football club, which is vital at such a crucial time. He has built up a lot of experience over the years which will ensure the team is structured and organised. He is driven and ambitious and while he has a big challenge ahead of him, I know he will tackle it without fear</p>

  <p><b>[Swansea City have confirmed that they will not be extending manager Carlos Carvalhal’s contract at the Liberty Stadium]</b> We’d like to put on record our thanks to Carlos for his enthusiasm, hard work and commitment since arriving at the club in December. Naturally, we are all disappointed with the club’s relegation from the Premier League, and following discussions with Carlos, we felt it was in the best interests of both parties that we move in a new direction. We will now be looking to appoint a new manager in readiness for the 2018-19 season. While there are already rumours linking us with several managers, it is vital that we identify the right person to take this team forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> chairman Huw Jenkins has revealed why <a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a> ended up at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and not <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, with two transfer sagas having played out in 2019]</b> When I was first invited to run the club the directors gave me a lot of freedom. We had a good system in place, they had trust in me and provided good support. People like Martin Morgan, Leigh Dineen were excellent. With the changes, gradually more and more people were getting involved. I recall with <a href="daniel-james.html">Dan James</a> there were six people interfering, trying to make a decision that day. I was told a deal was in place for Dan to go to <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>. It made no sense to me, not for <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea City</a> financially because there was nothing in it for us.<br /><br />As much as others felt the deal could have been done and we could have got something out of it, to me Dan going up to <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> at the time, risk injury, us rely on a summer transfer, was wrong. I wasn’t even sure <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> would pay the loan fee until the summer. I spoke to <a href="graham-potter.html">Graham Potter</a> about it. Remember, part of his mantra was to bring through younger players while making the team competitive. Dan was an important part of that. Graham wanted him to remain until the end of the season and play for <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a>. In playing regularly for us, we felt we would get more value out of any future deal. Not just for the club financially, but for Dan himself. And, of course, he has done really well at Man United and also for Wales. Whether he is playing well or not, Dan has this inner spirit, believes he is a good player. That’s important, you need that mentality as a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> footballer<br /><br />So <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea City</a> got a much bigger transfer fee, Dan got a better move. That <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> business was the final thing I did as <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> chairman, my parting shot if you like, the last involvement. Although, of course, shortly after I left they also got £20m from <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> for Oli McBurnie. We got Dan for £75,000 from Hull, Oli for £100,00 from Bradford. Not a bad bit of business</p>
