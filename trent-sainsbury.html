  <p><b>[Inter Milan have completed the signing of Trent Sainsbury on loan from Chinese Super League side Jiangsu Suning]</b> We greatly appreciate the contributions made by Sainsbury last season and thanks for all the joy and pride he brought to our fans. <b>[We]</b> wish him luck and all the best in his new challenge.</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos adamant Peru’s first goal was offside]</b> Not feeling happy, it’s not the nicest way to go out of the tournament. I thought the first goal was offside, I don’t know what the ruling should be on that. If I said what I wanted to say I’d probably cop a huge fine so I’ll just leave it at that.</p>

  <p><b>[Kuwait vs Australia. Centre-half Trent Sainsbury feels the squad is starting to gel after another period of training together and talked of a positive feeling among the team leading into the match]</b> I think any time together as a group is always good. It is always special when you come into these camps. We have got a good core group of players together now, a lot younger than what we have had in the past. So I think any time together over a certain time period is always good for us. And leading into this campaign as a World Cup qualifier it is always nice to kick it off with a few extra days in camp together. Leading into this game we are feeling really good and together as a team there is a good bond there</p>
