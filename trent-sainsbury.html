  <p><b>[New Inter defender Trent Sainsbury has admitted his loan move from Jiangsu Suning on transfer deadline day came as a shock]</b> I didn’t expect to go back so quickly and I must admit to go to a club of this stature is a bit of a shock. I was thinking maybe I would go back to Holland and prove myself in European football again but this massive opportunity has come my way, one that I certainly couldn’t turn down. It’s the chance to play with and against some of the best players in Europe, in fact some of the best in the world. To go and pit myself against them will be a good fight - it’s a short time period, so that allows me to give everything I possibly have until the end of the loan period and see where it takes me.<br /><br />I’m going to have to adjust very quickly, no doubt - European football is dog-eat-dog. But I don’t want to go there just to make up the numbers or for the experience, I want to go all out to play</p>

  <p><b>[Jiangsu centre-back Trent Sainsbury joined in the praise for the coaching team after their journey to the World Cup took them to 11 different countries]</b> We now hold the record for the most games played to qualify for a World Cup. It is full credit to the backroom staff who get us up for every game.</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos centre-half Trent Sainsbury says he is keen for an Australian to be given the national team job long-term]</b> My preference would definitely be an Australian coach. I think if they are going to go Aussie they have to go for the long term - this World Cup, next World Cup <b>[Qatar 2022]</b> and the Asian Cup <b>[2023]</b> after that. People probably say I’m biased if I said Graham Arnold. If they go international, it will just be for the <b>[2018]</b> World Cup - I don’t think they should take it through to the <b>[2019]</b> Asian Cup. Why give this experience to a foreign coach when you can give it to an Aussie to have this experience and put that on their CV?</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos central defender Trent Sainsbury has admitted he felt let down by the resignation of former coach Ange Postecoglou]</b> We always thought <b>[Postecoglou]</b> was going to stick around and see it through and all of a sudden word comes out through the media, which was a bit disappointing, it was sort of like a break up over text or finding out through somebody else. Yeah there was always a few inklings that he was going to leave the job and it never really hit home at the time. I think the boys were looking forward to having him take us to the World Cup in Russia. I feel let down. Everyone has got their decisions to make - we don’t know his side of the story and I don’t know if we ever will. My personal feeling is that I feel a little bit let down<br /><br /><b>[Postecoglou]</b> has taken us on this journey and he has done a fantastic job and he has left such a legacy - 2015 Asian Cup, qualifying the way he wanted us to qualify. I think the belief that’s in the squad now will carry on to the next generation. I wouldn’t say he is like a father figure but he is one of the most positive coaches I’ve ever had and one of the most passionate. I think when you have that, it hurts when they leave because you might never have that again</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos adamant Peru’s first goal was offside]</b> Not feeling happy, it’s not the nicest way to go out of the tournament. I thought the first goal was offside, I don’t know what the ruling should be on that. If I said what I wanted to say I’d probably cop a huge fine so I’ll just leave it at that.</p>

  <p><b>[Kuwait vs Australia. Centre-half Trent Sainsbury feels the squad is starting to gel after another period of training together and talked of a positive feeling among the team leading into the match]</b> I think any time together as a group is always good. It is always special when you come into these camps. We have got a good core group of players together now, a lot younger than what we have had in the past. So I think any time together over a certain time period is always good for us. And leading into this campaign as a World Cup qualifier it is always nice to kick it off with a few extra days in camp together. Leading into this game we are feeling really good and together as a team there is a good bond there</p>
