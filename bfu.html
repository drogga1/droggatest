  <p><b>[The Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) has hit back at <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> after England’s manager said his squad will need to prepare for racial abuse when they travel to Sofia in October]</b> BFU president Borislav Mihaylov has sent an official letter to the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> General Secretary and the chairman of the <a href="fa.html">Football Association</a> <a href="greg-clarke.html">Greg Clarke</a>, expressing his indignation and disappointment following the public comments by <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> and the suggestions that the English players will be subject to racial abuse by the Bulgarian supporters in the upcoming European qualifier in Sofia on October 14<br /><br />The BFU views such behaviour as groundless, inappropriate and unnecessary prior to the important and exciting football game that Bulgarian fans have been looking to in the past year. We have not received any official information regarding discriminatory language used by a Bulgarian supporter at Wembley Stadium<br /><br />Even if this were the case however, we believe that generalisations and the creation of needless tension by official members of the English team is absolutely unacceptable and in contradiction with the spirit of mutual respect and fair play, the core values of both <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and the BFU</p>

  <p><b>[Bulgarian Football Union pleased to avoid ‘more severe sanctions’ from UEFA]</b> The Bulgarian Football Union would like to emphasise that the incidents of October 14 at Vasil Levski St., which provoked a huge international response and created great public tension, failed to prevent the professional and effective response of all departments and units <b>[of the BFU]</b><br /><br />Thanks to the diligent and competent work of the BFU administration and the Union’s legal partners, as well as the persistent efforts to combat racism, xenophobia and tribal intolerance, the Bulgarian national team avoided more severe sanctions<br /><br />We sincerely believe that in the future the Bulgarian football fans will prove with their behaviour that they have unjustifiably become the subject of accusations of lack of tolerance and respect for their opponents. This will be of benefit to all - for football players as well as fans, as well as for Bulgaria’s international sporting prestige</p>

  <p><b>[Bulgarian FA present ‘Scarf of Respect’ as part of post-England anti-racism campaign]</b> Football is a game for everyone, regardless of their race, gender or religion. With this message, the Bulgarian Football Union presents ‘The Scarf of Respect’ - a fan scarf, the proceeds of which will go towards combating discrimination in our favourite sports.<br /><br />The creation of this charity product is part of a series of steps that the BFS will take in response to what happened during the European Qualification between Bulgaria and England on October 14th. Traditionally, football scarves show affiliation with a particular club - ‘The Scarf of Respect’ shows the love of the game for everyone. The scarf is inspired by the colours of the Bulgarian flag, but the message is universal - in football there is no place for discrimination of any nature.<br /><br />‘The Scarf of Respect’ was presented with a photo shoot, which included the captain of the national team, Ivelin Popov, the strikers <a href="marcelino.html">Marcelino</a> and Bozhidar Kraev, the goalkeeper of the women’s national team, Victoria Dimova, football players from the youth team, fans and employees of the National Football Base ‘Boyana’.</p>
