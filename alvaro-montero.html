  <p><b>[Are <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> targeting another rebuild?]</b> <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Thibaut Courtois</a> will remain No 1. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> is happy with him and <b>[club president]</b> <a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a> loves him.<br /><br />The club’s general director Jose Angel Sanchez - Perez’s right-hand man - has been promoting a transfer policy that is not based on massive expenditure ever since the turn of the century. They are keen to bring in players and turn them into superstars where their values go up.<br /><br /><a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> now feel they can’t compete financially with the money from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and those clubs backed by Arab countries. <a href="andriy-lunin.html">Lunin</a> didn’t play much at Leganes and Valladolid but they have confidence that he will be a very good goalkeeper in the future<br /><br />The situation can be compared to <a href="raphael-varane.html">Varane</a> when he first arrived. He arrived on <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>’s recommendation in 2011. The feeling is that beyond Militao, Nacho is not going to stay as the fourth option. There’s a chance they will look to sign someone in this position<br /><br />Achraf has exploded at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, and Madrid may feel that it’s better to sell him due to his playing style. He’s got good market value so it’s a good moment to sell him. They could make money from that transfer as a result of his performances and look to spend it elsewhere<br /><br />He has the complete confidence of <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> but Sergio Reguilon - who has been on loan at <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> - is expected to come back. He’s another player who may be loaned out or sold. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> still thinks <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> can hold down the left-sided berth, but he also feels that at times <a href="benjamin-mendy.html">Mendy</a> is the better option. He was picked over <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> in the Champions League last-16 first leg against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and the feeling was he was going to also be picked in the second leg as he is more defensive-minded. The left-back is perhaps the only position where there’s not a clear first and second choice<br /><br /><b>[Montero would be surprised if either Soumare or <a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kante</a> were to form part of <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>’s rebuild]</b> It would be strange for me if Madrid were to sign <a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kante</a> as he’s 29. The three famous players who helped give <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> three successive Champions League titles - <a href="casemiro.html">Casemiro</a>, <a href="toni-kroos.html">Kroos</a> and <a href="luka-modric.html">Modric</a> - are amazing but age is now a problem. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> has not always used <a href="luka-modric.html">Modric</a>, with Valverde coming in. We’ve seen the first transition, and in this next year, we will see more an evolution in the midfield<br /><br /><a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>’s obsession is to sign <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>. There is plenty of debate in Spain already about Valverde being better than <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, but he’s a world champion, he’s only just turned 27 and he’s box-to-box. Camavinga is another option as he falls in line with the transfer strategy the club are wanting to follow<br /><br />Then there is <a href="isco.html">Isco</a>. In the same way <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> resurrected <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a>’s Madrid career, so too did he bring <a href="isco.html">Isco</a> back from the dead. Before the coronavirus crisis, the feeling in Spain was that <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> was going to call up <a href="isco.html">Isco</a> to the Spanish national team. A year ago, that certainly wouldn’t have been the case<br /><br /><a href="martin-odegaard.html">Martin Odegaard</a>’s loan with <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a> is for another season, but my feeling is that Madrid will not break that agreement with the Sociedad president <a href="jokin-aperribay.html">Jokin Aperribay</a> as they have a very good relationship. He’s been performing really well and while it’s a possibility of him coming back, I think he’ll stay at Sociedad given the number of options still in midfield<br /><br />Madrid have spent a lot of money on <a href="luka-jovic.html">Jovic</a>, but we have to recognise that he simply hasn’t played many minutes. The feeling at the club is that he can improve and is a lot better than he’s demonstrated so far<br /><br />Madrid will only spend a crazy amount for <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>. It will be impossible for them to win titles with just <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a> scoring goals. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> have so many options, but Madrid must hope <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> and <a href="marco-asensio.html">Marco Asensio</a> come back from injury like two new signings</p>
