<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Lionel Messi’s former colleague at La Masia, Alberto Botia, has revealed it came as no surprise to him to see the Argentine conquer the world of football]</b> I grew up watching Messi every week, when he was playing with the Under-19 and U-16 teams, I was younger and I attended almost all his games. I never had a doubt he was about to become the best of the world.<br /><br />Valverde left everyone happy in Olympiacos and that is very hard to do, everyone speaks about him. The game in Greece could be so different than the Camp Nou one <b>[a game Barcelona won 3-1]</b>. We are in front of our supporters and we must be very intense, we know that. How to stop Messi is the question all defenders who face him ask themselves each week, he is a top one but I think it would be a mistake focusing only on him, we are worried about all Barcelona players</p>
