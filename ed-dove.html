<blockquote>
  <p>[The view from Cameroon] Cameroon are still picking themselves up after a mixed and muddled 2017, although time is running out before they host the first expanded Africa Cup of Nations in June 2019. Last year they unexpectedly won their third Africa Cup of Nations in unlikely circumstances in Gabon, before disappointing at the Confederations Cup and then missing out on the World Cup for only the second time since 1986. Afcon-winning coach Hugo Broos departed, and after a rudderless period under interim boss Alexandre Belinga, Clarence Seedorf was unveiled amidst much fanfare … and skepticism, which only increased after an opening draw against lowly Comoros.<br /><br />After four matches, the Dutch great is yet to prove either that can offer substance beneath the style, or that he can get a handle on the idiosyncrasies of the African game. His reign began with a firm announcement that he wouldn’t consider players plying their trade in Asia, and while he later reneged on this decision-perhaps after realising that star man Christian Bassogog plays in China-it was too late to prevent the premature international retirement of captain and Beijing Renhe forward Benjamin Moukandjo<br /><br />Even with Vincent Aboubakar injured, and Nicolas N’Koulou and Joel Matip still in self-imposed international exiles, Cameroon boast quality across the pitch. In Andre Onana, they can call upon Africa’s best goalkeeper today, while Eric-Maxim Choupo Moting, Karl Toko Ekambi and Andre Frank Zambo Anguissa are prominent figures in major European leagues. Georges Mandjeck offers bite and tenacity in midfield, Collins Fai starts at right-back alongside Michael Ngadeu-Ngadjui, but everyone else is still auditioning for places under the new coach</p>
