  <p><b>[Former Borussia Dortmund prospect and USMNT youngster Joe Gyau is playing for 2 Bundesliga side MSV Duisburg as he works his way back from injury hell]</b> The thing that got me the most about the injury was that I was so close, on the brink of breaking in. The season before that I was making my debut at Hoffenheim, then I went to Dortmund and broke into the first team. Then I was playing with the national team. I was making the rosters weekly for Dortmund, and then I got hurt. That’s what kind of killed me the most. Obviously such a long rehab process was also tough, especially for how long it was. Trying to stay motivated was definitely a tedious task.<br /><br />It was a decision I made because I was ready to play. I was back in training for six months, and I saw that trying to ease my way back into a big club like that, the probability wasn’t going to be so high, so I didn’t do too much dilly-dallying. I was ready to play and I was ready to do whatever it took. <b>[Dortmund]</b> is a great club, and a great experience being there. It was bittersweet, my whole time there. The first six months were great, but after everything that went down I was just ready to go somewhere and prove myself<br /><br />It was a decision I made because I was ready to play. I was back in training for six months, and I saw that trying to ease my way back into a big club like that, the probability wasn’t going to be so high, so I didn’t do too much dilly-dallying. I was ready to play and I was ready to do whatever it took. <b>[Dortmund]</b> is a great club, and a great experience being there. It was bittersweet, my whole time there. The first six months were great, but after everything that went down I was just ready to go somewhere and prove myself<br /><br />I know the level in third league in Germany. It’s good, it’s still high-level football. To a lot of other people, they hear third league they don’t think you’d want to go there and get stuck there. I didn’t think that way. I just wanted to get back, and make up on the time I lost, improve my game and get back into form<br /><br />My game has definitely matured a lot. I was very hungry, I was very eager on the pitch when I was younger, but sometimes it might have been to my detriment. Maybe I wanted to do too much. Now my game is much more balanced. I’m able to make the right runs at the right times. I play the ball a little bit quicker to the guy whose in a better spot. That ambidexterity of my game has gone up, I can play it well with either foot. I’m also stronger. Two years of rehab will definitely have you ripped<br /><br />The wheels are back like they never left. If you do rehab correctly then your leg will be back stronger than it was before. When i was playing before the injury I was playing off pure athleticism, god-given genes. I wasn’t really working on speed and everything that much, but now, after losing that, I had to get that back and then some. So I was in the gym every day, doing jumps, sprints, squats. The kid is definitely back with a vengeance<br /><br />In the beginning I thought about it a lot because I was in the mix. Right before I made my debut against Czech Republic Klinsmann was telling me ‘You’re part of the team now. I want to have you on the roster for the Gold Cup in the summer. I want to have you in the cycle for the World Cup.’ Then I get hurt and all those things slipped away. That was definitely fresh in my mind. When I got back and slowly started to play again I realized that can’t be my sole motivation. You’ve got to keep your eye on improving because once you keep improving every training, every game, then that stuff will come automatically<br /><br />How can anyone resent him? I’m happy for Christian. He’s doing his thing and it’s great for Americans to have him doing what he’s doing. He’s doing his thing, and just him being there playing game in and game out for a good side like Dortmund, that’s busting down a lot of barriers. I feel like a lot more clubs will be more willing to pay bigger fees for Americans<br /><br />The next World Cup isn’t for the next four years. Until then, I’m just trying, on the club level, to establish myself, and keep leveling up and make enough noise that I get back in there. And hopefully by the time that World Cup comes I’ll be in the mix. Obviously, as I’ve learned, you can’t look too far in the future because you never know what can happen the next day</p>
