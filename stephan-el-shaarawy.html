  <p><b>[Stephan El Shaarawy on Neymar]</b> I’d say <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is the best player in the world at the moment. I played against him in Geneva with Italy and he was simply incredible on the ball</p>

  <p><b>[Stephan El Shaarawy revealed international ambitions with Italy were a factor in his return to Italy’s <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> with Roma]</b> It was definitely my aim to make the squad for Euro 2016. You get noticed more in Italy. To be called up for the national team you need to be playing regularly at club level and to do that you need to work hard, be committed and show desire. My aim is to play well for Roma to achieve that. I’m here to show what I can do - to myself, the coach and Italian football as a whole</p>

  <p><b>[Stephan El Shaarawy has completed a switch to China after Shanghai Shenhua announced they had agreed on terms with his current club AS Roma]</b> I will always thank the Roma fans for these years we had together. I also thank all those who I worked with at Roma<br /><br /><b>[El Shaarawy was asked if he had spoken to Italy boss Roberto Mancini about how the move would affect his chances of more international calls]</b> No, I haven’t heard from him</p>

  <p><b>[Stephan El Shaarawy confirmed he was close to returning to Roma in January]</b> There was the possibility of returning to Italy. When the virus broke out, I had spoken to the club saying that I needed to play to earn a place in the European Championship. Having already had a great consideration from <b>[Italy coach Roberto]</b> Mancini despite my move to China, I was ready to return to play regularly, but then nothing was done. There had been contacts with two teams. One was Roma</p>
