<blockquote>
  <p><b>[With 10 goals in her last five outings and an outrageous average of a goal scored every 26 minutes, no one comes close]</b> It feels really good! I was kind of stuck at the brace! I think I just enjoy it at the moment. I struggled with injuries over the last two years and now I just feel really fit and healthy. I think that’s the most important thing, to stay fit, and just enjoy the moment and hope it will continue like that<br /><br />I feel like the injury was a big challenge, but it definitely helped me in many ways. One: on the football side because I think that when I was younger, I was going into rough tackles a bit blind. Now, I’m a bit more clever, deciding when to go into duels and when not to. It’s also helped my vision of the game, and personally, it helped me a lot because you have to be strong to recover from such an injury. I think you realise when you’ve been out for such a long time just how much you miss it. At the moment, I’m enjoying every minute on the pitch and I think you can see that in the goals. I just like to be out there with the team.<br /><br />I think I can improve massively. I’ve still got lots to come. Defensively, maybe getting around a bit quicker and the change of direction, that’s from a physical point of view, but also in the game, technically, and playing together with the team, there’s always areas I can improve - and I will. I’m not being critical of her goal-scoring but her all-round build-up play, it has to improve. We want to work on it, we want to get her better. Between the two boxes, she can be a better player, but in the box, she’s showing that she’s an incredible goal-scorer. She’s scoring a lot of goals, but she’s missing a lot of chances as well, so she can score even more! And she knows that. But, like I say, we can’t be critical of her goal-scoring. I think that was her 19th goal of the season in all competitions, which is incredible for us</p>
