  <p><b>[Katie Chapman speaks after winning the tenth FA Cup title of her career]</b> We kept the ball really well. They tried to play on the counter, but we were quite dominant. We were pretty relaxed and I got around the park all right for a 35-year-old, didn’t I?</p>

  <p><b>[Now watching from afar, England legend Katie Chapman tells Lionesses to be confident ahead of World Cup]</b> They really looked after me, all the older ones, and I always felt comfortable when I went to the England camps - I never felt out of place or that I shouldn’t be there, it was actually really nice. I felt really welcome there - you were nurtured and looked after.<br /><br />I was overwhelmed, being selected to play in that - being so young. I played a lot of the tournament too, which was even more surprising<br /><br /><b>[The 2009 Euros, where England were well beaten 6-2 by Germany]</b> We didn’t play very well in that game and we didn’t deserve to win it. We weren’t good enough<br /><br /><b>[She was recalled for the 2015 Women’s World Cup in Canada by new coach Mark Sampson]</b> We were in a bubble, we didn’t know what was being said back home in the press<br /><br /><b>[Chapman wonders whether a tournament just across the Channel will bring added weight of expectations on this year’s squad]</b> You have to perform - because if you don’t, you’re out. Even a team that are underdogs can perform because it’s their moment to shine, it’s their time to be in the spotlight. Everyone is on their game. You have to be ready, you have to be prepared. Go in confident - get through the group stages, and anything can happen after that<br /><br />I think they’re going to do really well. Sometimes it’s not always performance, sometimes it’s about getting the result. The result is all that matters at the end of the day. Sometimes we are going to have to get our head down to graft. It’s not always going to be pretty football. Going into a major tournament, you need to take it game by game. Be confident, but quietly, in the background<br /><br />Nerves are a good thing. Not too much, but I knew when I was nervous I’d have a great game. Forget everything else that’s going on around you and what you need to do within the game, because it can become overwhelming out there - don’t let that distract you, focus on the job you need to do<br /><br /><b>[Having hung up her boots two years ago to devote more time to her family, Chapman is now an ambassador at her last club Chelsea, working across commercial, marketing, education and outreach]</b> Oh my God, hands down, I’d want to be on that pitch! I’m getting better … but the big games I’m still struggling with</p>
