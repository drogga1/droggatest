  <p><b>[As a former Man City player, Jesus Navas is looking forward to rekindling old rivalries with Manchester United in the Champions League]</b> For us, it’s all about getting through to the next round. But I know it would be nice for some of the friends I’ve got back in Manchester if we did manage to pull it off and knock out United. If people underestimate us, they should look at what we’re doing at the moment, our ­performances, the fact we’ve got to a final already and we’re still in all of the competitions. We’re a great side and we can achieve things. United were always our great rivals when I was at City, and we played some really important games against them. But now this is really important game for Sevilla, for the club, for our fans, and it would be great for us to make it to the quarter-finals.<br /><br />We know it’s going to be a hard game, but we’re doing well at the moment and we’ll do everything in our power to go through against United. But we know we’ll have to be at our maximum level and concentrated throughout both games, because at any moment, a top team like United can finish the tie. United have also got some really important games coming up, starting with us, but hopefully we’re going to be able to stand in their way.</p>

  <p><b>[Jesus Navas reflects on Man City spell and airs Spain ambition]</b> I had four very good years, not only in football, also personally. I learned a lot, I grew up in all aspects and that’s something very nice. We won the Premier League the first year, two cups and I am very happy for everything.<br /><br /><b>[On Pep Guardiola]</b> Very good. As a coach he has everything, he knows how to work with the team and he helped me a lot personally and in football. They are very good people there<br /><br />We are hoping to achieve important things and hit our remaining targets. We will try to qualify to play in the Champions League, for us that would be really good. Every game is very difficult. There are several teams that are fighting and it’s going to be a beautiful battle. We have to do all we can in the last few matches to fight for this<br /><br />Very happy to have him back, we know how he works, he is very close to us and he will do good things for the team. He knows this club and that is an advantage that he has, he will help us<br /><br />To continue enjoying each game and try to get a title for Sevilla again, as that would be something very special. In the national team, I want to be there at all times, that for me is a source of great pride<br /><br /><b>[He said of that recall]</b> It’s unique. To play with the national team is the ultimate goal for any player. I have really enjoyed being there again. Seeing old friends again, the confidence that the coach has given me, I only have words of thanks<br /><br /><b>[On Sergio Ramos]</b> He’s like a brother to me. We have lived many years together in Sevilla, in the national team and now to be with him again is a very special thing<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether a side which swept the board between 2008 and 2012 can return to the top]</b> We have a good team. There are players who are young, who are contributing a lot and the idea of the coach is very clear, what he wants we are showing on the field. We just need time</p>

  <p><b>[Jesus <a href="keylor-navas.html">Navas</a> says years of covering for <a href="dani-alves.html">Dani Alves</a> at <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> made it easy for him to become a full-back for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> There were players injured <b>[at City]</b> and he <b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>]</b> asked me if I could play there.

You dream of that from when you’re a child. It was a dream that became true. It was incredible. The greatest moment for me. My next dream would be to win another title with <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> and with our fans.

The Spanish teams always fight for this title. <b>[The Europa League]</b> is very special for us. We have won it on various occasions and feel very comfortable playing it. We know that it is difficult and a long tournament, so we have to go game by game. The truth is that this competition has given us a lot of happiness</p>
