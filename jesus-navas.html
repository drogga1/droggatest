  <p><b>[Jesus <a href="keylor-navas.html">Navas</a> says years of covering for <a href="dani-alves.html">Dani Alves</a> at <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> made it easy for him to become a full-back for Manchester City]</b> There were players injured <b>[at City]</b> and he <b>[Guardiola]</b> asked me if I could play there. I told him that I could do it without a problem because when I played with <a href="dani-alves.html">Dani Alves</a> he used to attack a lot, so I normally covered him in the defence. I did not have any problem doing it. Everything went well<br /><br /><b>[However, his crowning achievement came when his burst forward from his own half led to <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a>’s winning goal in the 2010 World Cup final]</b> Thinking about that play, for me to have won a World Cup is the biggest thing ever as a player. You dream of that from when you’re a child. It was a dream that became true. It was incredible. The greatest moment for me. My next dream would be to win another title with <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> and with our fans. That would be something big		<br /><br /><b>[He also predicts a Spanish team can triumph in the Champions League - as well as former club City]</b> <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or another team that’s always on top can win the Champions League. The Spanish teams always fight for this title. <b>[The Europa League]</b> is very special for us. We have won it on various occasions and feel very comfortable playing it. We know that it is difficult and a long tournament, so we have to go game by game. The truth is that this competition has given us a lot of happiness</p>
