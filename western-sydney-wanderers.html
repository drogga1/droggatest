  <p>[Red and Black Bloc has lashed out at Football Federation Australia’s intention to penalise them and Western Sydney Wanderers for their vulgar banner at Saturday’s derby] We find it ironic that it takes the FFA barely 24 hours to respond to a banner deemed ‘offensive’, but take over 12 months to even commence an appeals process agreed upon in December 2015. Clearly football in this country is in the wrong hands. Football belongs to the people, not a dictatorial body or the likes of so called expert commentators.</p>

  <p>[Western Sydney Wanderers have confirmed Football Federation Australia has sent them an infringement notice for the vulgar, homophobic banner displayed by the Red and Black Bloc] We confirm that the Western Sydney Wanderers Football Club has today received an infringement notice relating to supporter behaviour from Football Federation Australia due to the actions of some fans during the match against Sydney FC on the weekend at ANZ Stadium.<br /><br />The Western Sydney Wanderers will be responding to the notice within the time frame provided. Notwithstanding that the club has yet to submit its response, Western Sydney Wanderers FC unequivocally states - and reinforces its position provided on Sunday after the match - that it does not in any capacity welcome, authorise or condone the display of imagery depicted in a banner on Saturday night. It is an affront to many on a multitude of levels and is completely unacceptable<br /><br />The club will continue to support the rights of our members and fans who display passionate support for this team in an appropriate, civil and respectful manner and we will not allow our members and club’s reputation to be affected by the disrespectful actions of a few. As a club made up of the most diverse and inclusive cross-section of members and fans in Australian sport we are committed to working with FFA and our stadiums to ensure our matches remain a positive family friendly environment</p>

  <p>[Western Sydney Wanderers have banned 14 members of the Red and Black Bloc from any of the club’s matches for 18 months] Following a thorough review of the incident on Saturday night including review of CCTV footage at the venue and examination of those involved and how they both concealed the banner’s entry into the venue, its construction within the bay and display during the match we have acted to remove them from our club.<br /><br />This incident involved key leaders of the RBB who have shown no remorse for their actions of bringing our club and the game of football into disrepute and have continued to flaunt their disdain for the club and our diverse and inclusive membership family further on social media.<br /><br />As a club we have had enough and have put the entire group on notice. While the vast majority of the RBB are exceptional in their support and actions for this club we must remove all those who see themselves as bigger than the club they support</p>

  <p>[FFA fine Western Sydney Wanderers $20,000 over ‘highly offensive’ banner] The actions of the Western Sydney Wanderers spectators responsible for displaying the banner and the ensuing celebration of the banner on social media were completely unacceptable. While we have noted and were pleased with the positive proactive measures undertaken by the Western Sydney Wanderers the fine reflects the fact clubs are responsible for the actions of their spectators and managing the approval of the game day banners and activities of their active fan groups.</p>

<h4 id="2018-02-27-retrieve">2018 02 27 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>[Western Sydney Wanderers management have decided to ‘close down’ their active support area for Sunday’s match against Perth Glory] The Western Sydney Wanderers maintains its position that it will not accept offensive behaviour being displayed at its matches and also will not accept the illegal use of incendiary devices. The Western Sydney Wanderers maintain that the majority of those members in the active area have been outstanding and supportive of the club and the team. Unfortunately a small group have made this action unavoidable. Investigation into those directly responsible for the lighting of flares is continuing. Members who normally attend in the active area will be subject to alternative seating arrangements that will not be active on the day. Communication to those affected members will be conveyed later this week. The active area will be reopened for the following match against Wellington Phoenix on 10 March 2018, however should there be any further breaches of the terms of admission then the club reserves the right to close down the active area for a further indefinite period</p>
