  <p>[Who is Sergej Milinkovic-Savic? The €100m Man Utd target compared to Zidane] The coach is the one that selects players and if he gets a good result, he is right. We qualified for the World Cup without him, didn’t we? Also, Dusan Tadic, who played in his position, had four goals and eight assists! So, it made sense to play Tadic and Adem Ljajic in midfield. Would I have called Sergej up for the World Cup? Theoretically, yes. I have nothing against the lad; he is great player. But no one has a guaranteed place in the squad.<br /><br />[Muslin’s response to Milinkovic-Savic’s fine form] He’s playing well for Lazio - so what? [Karim] Benzema is a key striker at Real Madrid and has won three Champions Leagues in a row and he is not in the French national team, yet France don’t play badly because of that. With me as a coach, a player has to have three qualities to get in the team: skill; he has to fit in the team as a player; and he has to fit in the team as person</p>
