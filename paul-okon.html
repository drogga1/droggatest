  <p><b>[Argentine youngster Facundo Alcacer continues to trial with Central Coast Mariners]</b> We played them once this season on New Year’s <b>[Eve]</b> and it was probably one of our best performances of the season and we were unlucky not to have won the game. So irrespective of the loss last weekend, we’ll go down to Melbourne with that performance in mind against Melbourne City full of confidence that if we can perform anywhere near that level then we have a chance of winning.<br /><br />It’s foolish to look at their <b>[City’s]</b> game last week against Adelaide and make too much of it just because they lost. They’re a quality side. They won the FFA Cup. They’re the club with the most resources … so form is going to come into play here in our thoughts. We’re up against a team that can still win the A-League</p>

  <p><b>[Coach Paul Okon has described Roy O’Donovan’s red card in Central Coast Mariners 2-1 loss to Melbourne City as madness]</b> Well the referee comes across and he’s got the yellow card in his hand. That means he’s seen the incident. So why does he need the linesman? He’s got the yellow card in his hand, so in his eyes it’s a yellow card. Why then does the linesman influence him and give a straight red? It’s madness. It’s madness, it’s insanity and it ruined the game for both teams - irrespective of what the final result would have been but it’s disappointing.<br /><br />Well I hope common sense prevails here. It shouldn’t be any different because it’s Central Coast Mariners. The referee will look at it, say he got it wrong with his linesman and the match review panel will allow Roy to play next week<br /><br />How can you defend against him <b>[Tim Cahill]</b>? He’s so good when he makes his runs. His timing is good and nine times out of ten he always hits the target but disappointing to give away that second goal, which really cost us</p>

  <p><b>[Central Coast Mariners coach Paul Okon has paid tribute to his defence]</b> I think that’s a big reason why we’ve won the last three games ‘cause defensively we’ve been really solid. We’ve looked like we weren’t really going to concede, we’ve eliminated silly mistakes and it’s really been a platform to go on and win the game.<br /><br />We’re not saying ‘we’re in the race for the top six’ or ‘we’re going to make the top six’ but it’s our job as a team, as a club to stay in the running for as long as possible, and if we can get three points on the weekend that certainly brings us into that equation even more</p>

  <p><b>[Central Coast Mariners coach Paul Okon has claimed the finals hopes of both his side and Newcastle Jets will be on the line in Sunday’s F3 Derby]</b> It comes at a time for both clubs where if they have any hopes of making the finals, it’s a game that both teams will want to win. It should have that derby feeling to it; atmosphere, contest and hopefully we can travel up there on Sunday, perform and send our travelling supporters home with a smile on their face.<br /><br />We don’t feel like we took a step backwards. It wasn’t our best performance, we realise that. Melbourne Victory is one of the top sides in the country. We’ve had a good week of training and we go into this derby full of confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Central Coast Mariners coach Paul Okon has claimed Sunday’s F3 Derby against Newcastle Jets could define his team’s season]</b> This game means everything for us. It potentially - for many - may define our season. We’ve had two derbies to date and we had an outrageous number turn up for the two games in Newcastle, so if you’re thinking about coming don’t think about it, just turn up, because we need your support. You’ve been magnificent this season</p>

  <p><b>[Central Coast Mariners fans have a lot to look forward to in 2017-18]</b> There’s a lot to look forward to beyond this season. We worked hard during the week and I thought what we sort of worked on and spoke about before the game we executed perfectly and we probably should have scored a few more goals.</p>

  <p><b>[Central Coast coach Paul Okon says higher in-house expectations have set the platform for the Mariners despite their season ending in defeat]</b> The work started when I took over here. Gone are the days when the bus pulls into McDonald’s after away trips. We’ve raised the standards. Hopefully our supporters have acknowledged that. In the off-season we’ll assess everything, make the necessary changes with the resources we have and hopefully people don’t assign the wooden spoon to us before we’ve even kicked a ball.<br /><br />In the last 20 minutes we fatigued a little bit, we knew that would happen, but I’m really happy for the players and the way they’ve ended their season. A big effort against one of the best teams in the country. No surprise that we put in a performance like that tonight</p>

  <p><b>[On Roy O’Donovan]</b> Roy has been an important player for us this season and although it’s disappointing to see him join our closest rival, it will certainly add fire to the F3 Derby next season.</p>

  <p><b>[Mariners coach Paul Okon met Hiariej on his recent scouting trip and watched him play against PSV Eindhoven]</b> We were actually looking at Tom in the January transfer window and were very close to signing him. At the time, Groningen decided that they wouldn’t release him, which was disappointing for us because we thought he really would have added value at that time of the season. We’ve kept dialogue since and followed him throughout the remainder of the season. We knew that Tom was open to the idea of exploring an opportunity and adventure in a country like Australia and it’s exciting to have him here for at least the next two seasons..</p>

  <p><b>[Central Coast Mariners coach Paul Okon made his feelings clear on the VAR system after two of his players were sent off by it during a match in December]</b> If you came to this game tonight and you left here no longer in love with football, who could blame you? I think it’s probably what everyone is talking about and that’s not the reason why people are turning up watching - it’s not why we turn up to play and coach.</p>
