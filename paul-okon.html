<blockquote>
  <p>[Argentine youngster Facundo Alcacer continues to trial with Central Coast Mariners] We played them once this season on New Year’s [Eve] and it was probably one of our best performances of the season and we were unlucky not to have won the game. So irrespective of the loss last weekend, we’ll go down to Melbourne with that performance in mind against Melbourne City full of confidence that if we can perform anywhere near that level then we have a chance of winning.<br /><br />It’s foolish to look at their [City’s] game last week against Adelaide and make too much of it just because they lost. They’re a quality side. They won the FFA Cup. They’re the club with the most resources … so form is going to come into play here in our thoughts. We’re up against a team that can still win the A-League</p>

  <p>[Coach Paul Okon has described Roy O’Donovan’s red card in Central Coast Mariners 2-1 loss to Melbourne City as madness] Well the referee comes across and he’s got the yellow card in his hand. That means he’s seen the incident. So why does he need the linesman? He’s got the yellow card in his hand, so in his eyes it’s a yellow card. Why then does the linesman influence him and give a straight red? It’s madness. It’s madness, it’s insanity and it ruined the game for both teams - irrespective of what the final result would have been but it’s disappointing.<br /><br />Well I hope common sense prevails here. It shouldn’t be any different because it’s Central Coast Mariners. The referee will look at it, say he got it wrong with his linesman and the match review panel will allow Roy to play next week<br /><br />How can you defend against him [Tim Cahill]? He’s so good when he makes his runs. His timing is good and nine times out of ten he always hits the target but disappointing to give away that second goal, which really cost us</p>

  <p>[Central Coast Mariners coach Paul Okon made his feelings clear on the VAR system after two of his players were sent off by it during a match in December] If you came to this game tonight and you left here no longer in love with football, who could blame you? I think it’s probably what everyone is talking about and that’s not the reason why people are turning up watching - it’s not why we turn up to play and coach.</p>
