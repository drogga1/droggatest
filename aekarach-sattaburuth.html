  <p><b>[Mr <a href="somkid-jatusripitak.html">Somkid Jatusripitak</a>, who is seen as Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha’s right hand man for economic affairs, said about fierce wrangling over key cabinet posts among coalition partners]</b> Mr <a href="somkid-jatusripitak.html">Somkid</a>’s remarks came in the wake of reports about haggling over key ministerial posts between the PPRP and two of its key partners – the Democrat Party and the Bhumjaithai Party – after the prime ministerial vote. However, both parties have insisted that the allocation of cabinet posts has already been finalised. Instead, they suggested the Palang Pracharath settle its own internal problems over the allocation of cabinet posts<br /><br />Palang Pracharath secretary-general, Sontirat Sontijirawong – who heads the party’s working group tasked with coordinating with other coalition parties – on Monday explained why talks over formation of the coalition government have yet to be finalised. He said the PPRP is fully committed to putting its key economic policies into practice, and to do so, the party needs control over key economic ministries to ensure the successful implementation of said policies</p>

  <p>Future Forward Party leader <a href="thanatorn-juangroongruangkit.html">Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit</a> has asked the Constitutional Court to extend the deadline to submit evidence to fight a media share-holding charge by 15 days. It is the second time Mr Thanathorn, who has been suspended as an MP since the court accepted the case for a ruling, has sought an extension. If the fresh request is approved, Mr Thanathorn has a total of 60 days to submit his defence<br /><br /><a href="thanatorn-juangroongruangkit.html">Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit</a> stands accused of holding shares in V-Luck Media Co when he registered as an MP candidate in early February – a breach of Section 98(3) of the constitution, which bars owners and/or shareholders of media and/or publishing firms from running as MPs<br /><br />When accepting the case for consideration on May 23, the court asked Mr <a href="thanatorn-juangroongruangkit.html">Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit</a> to submit his defence within 15 days. When the deadline was about to expire, he sought a 30-day extension granted by the court, which will expire on July 8.<br /><br />Mr <a href="thanatorn-juangroongruangkit.html">Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit</a> has denied the charge and insisted he and his wife transferred their shares to his mother on Jan 8, immediately after returning from Buri Ram to Bangkok following a campaign rally<br /><br />Pheu Thai spokeswoman Ladawan Wongsriwong yesterday slammed the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) over its plan to seek an injunction for its 27 MPs accused of violating media share-holding rules. She said the PPRP’s plan to ask the court not to suspend the MPs facing the qualification reviews would be unfair to Mr <a href="thanatorn-juangroongruangkit.html">Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit</a> who is suspended on the basis of allegedly breaching the media share-holding regulations and complied with the court order. … PPRP deputy spokesman <a href="thanakorn-wangboonkongchana.html">Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana</a> said the party’s request is above-board because the cases against the party MPs and Mr Thanathorn are different. However, he said the party would accept the court’s decision</p>

  <p>Two of the nine micro-parties with one MP each have announced they will pull out of the coalition and independently serve as ‘people’s MPs’ in Parliament. Mongkolkit Suksintaranont, leader of the Thai Civilized Party, said yesterday he and Pichet Sathirachawal, leader of Prachatham Thai, another micro-party, had agreed to serve as people’s MPs, meaning they would not side with either the government or the opposition but will vote at their own discretion<br /><br />Mr Mongkolkit Suksintaranont said he would not go back on his word, apparently in response to criticism he had done so before. During his election campaigns, he told voters he would not support the continuation of power by the regime but later joined the government<br /><br />If the two MPs <b>[Mongkolkit Suksintaranont and Pichet Sathirachawal]</b> withdrew from the coalition, the government will have 252 votes against 246 of the Opposition<br /><br />A Palang Pracharath source, who asked not to be named, said key members of the party had agreed to allocate about six political positions, such as spots on the House committee and ministerial assistant roles, to the small parties</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The government’s first loss on the floor of the House was on Aug 8, when members considered a regulation on the performance of the parliament president. The opposition garnered 207 votes and the government only 205.<br /><br />Chaiwut Thanakhamanusorn, secretary of the government whip, said on Thursday that Wednesday’s loss occurred when MPs took a personal stand against the whip committee’s direction, and some MPs were unable to enter the session chamber in time for the vote<br /><br />The loss did not pertain to any law presented by the government. The government whip would supervise voting more strictly when it came to important legislation, he said</p>
