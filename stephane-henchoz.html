  <p><b>[Liverpool have absolutely no chance of winning the Premier League title]</b> It was a big problem last season and everybody was hoping they could solve the problem. I think they definitely should buy somebody. At least one or two centre-backs, they tried <b>[Virgil]</b> Van Dijk, but they couldn’t make it happen. I don’t know. It seems that it is always the same mistakes, set pieces, they are very weak, very poor. The way it is at the moment, they have absolutely no chance of competing for the title. They would be more than happy to finish in the top four, but if they carry on the way they are conceding goals, I can’t see them finishing in the top four unfortunately.</p>

  <p><b>[Switzerland legend Stephane Henchoz has said that Arsenal star Granit Xhaka cannot be selected as captain of the country]</b> I think the captain has to represent the Swiss team and Switzerland, Xhaka does not do that. This would be a real problem. Players like <b>[Yann]</b> Sommer, <b>[Stephan]</b> Lichtsteiner or <b>[Fabian]</b> Schar, who represent traditional Switzerland, could feel excluded, just like fans who might not be able to identify with the team. The Swiss players without a migration background and Swiss fans, they would feel marginalised<br /><br />Some players say how great their desire is to play for Switzerland. I’d ask them: ‘What is this pleasure? So they can show themselves on a big stage? Because after the World Cup maybe they can get a better contract at their clubs or get a transfer? You don’t have to scream the anthem like the South Americans or Italians, but with those teams I see that they really feel like playing for their country<br /><br />I would have gathered the players the day before the match and told them: ‘Something special’s heading your way’. It was especially important to those who spent their childhood in the former Yugoslavia. I would have told them clearly not to be carried away by rash reactions. You have to train these young players to not only be footballers, but also to represent Switzerland, even if they have other roots. The double-headed eagle has no business in this game! The double-headed eagle has no business with the national team</p>
