  <p><b>[on <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Competitive Gaming Commissioner]</b> EA made the significant investment over three years ago to accelerate the growth of competitive <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. We’ve created the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Global Series on the path to the eWorld Cup to allow us to invest more time and resources to grow the global digital sport of football. Our future is going to come down to how well we can provide access to people who want really engaging content. The Stay and Play Cup brought 20 of the top clubs in the world together and it was broadcast to over 115 countries. There’s not a whole lot of groups that can do that. It comes down to access and giving content to fans where they want to see it<br /><br /><b>[EA Sports’ Koning hopes competitive <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> can grow not only in terms of viewership and engagement, but also in prize money in order to compete with other esports]</b> Most games were built for competitive play. When you look at the likes of DOTA 2, Overwatch, they were built for competition. <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> is 25 years old, so it wasn’t built for competition like this. People weren’t streaming or using the internet to connect our experiences. The future of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> comes down to how we can scale and grow and have the tools for viewers and players to become fans. When we unlock this, the prize pool can go through the roof<br /><br />We have so many similarities with traditional sport: fan activity, attendance, viewership, talent, superstars. We have the DNA of sport. I get asked the question all the time ‘are you going to replace football?’. The reality is <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> is integrated into the fabric of football. We are a companion to the football experience globally. In the ideal world, you have lead-in programming for a derby which is an esports derby. You have programming on a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday leading up to a Saturday football match. That’s the ideal world - how do we use that to build more entertainment for consumers and build fan bases? Every single sports enterprise on the planet is looking for fan engagement. Our goal is to have some of the most unique, progressive and engaging fan engagement that we can possibly have. The analogy is to fish where the fish are. If I have a sports entertainment product, where would I go? I absolutely would go to the World Cup, to the Champions League final and have activation. It’s that relationship that makes <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> so unique: we are woven into the DNA of football. The future of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> is around fan engagement growth and deepening that connection into the actual DNA of football</p>
