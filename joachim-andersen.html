<blockquote>
  <p>[Joachim Andersen has hinted that he could be open to leaving Sampdoria] It could be time for me to further my career. I have loved my time in Sampdoria – the fans, the president, the staff, the players, the city – but maybe it’s time to move on to develop further. There are a number of interested clubs from Europe’s biggest leagues who are discussing with my agent and I’ll be making a decision shortly together with my family and my agent.<br /><br />It’s very important to me that Sampdoria can also benefit from an eventual transfer. It’s not all about me. I have so much to thank this great club for. Without Sampdoria, I wouldn’t have had the opportunities I have had to this point<br /><br />I have dreams of playing in the biggest clubs in the world and the biggest leagues in the world – I’m lucky enough to already be playing in one of them. I think I have a pretty broad football education and I don’t see why I shouldn’t be able to adopt to most leagues – but I’m not saying it would be easy<br /><br />[Andersen believes that playing in Italy and discovering a new style of football has benefited him immensely] I have learned a lot. I grew up in Denmark and Holland playing with a lot of possession. When I came to Italy, I learned a new part of the defending game, which added a new layer to my football education. But most importantly I haven’t forgotten how to play ball. That means I’m still comfortable in possession while I have developed as a defender. My position is good and of course I’m pretty tall [193cm], which gives me an advantage in the air. I’m not going to tell you what I had to work on – let the strikers see if they can find out themselves!<br /><br />[He reserved praise for Sampdoria coach Marco Giampaolo, who is expected to take over at AC Milan in the coming days] He’s played a big role in my development. He is known as one of the best coaches in Italy when it comes to defensive organisation. I have learned a lot from him and he has made me a more complete footballer<br /><br />The U21 Euros was one of my big goals this season, so it is insanely annoying that I can’t participate. It was my last opportunity to play with the boys in the U21 team, so it’s hard to say goodbye to them without having the opportunity to play the in the tournament. Of course, I would have loved to play, but instead of being 80 percent fit, I can now purposefully and thoughtfully build up for the next season without risking my rehabilitation. That way, I can concentrate on returning stronger and better</p>
