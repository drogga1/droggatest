  <p><b>[Preston North End manager Simon Grayson says that Daryl Horgan is a player with the potential to excite]</b> I thought Daryl affected the game when he came on. He is a player who has the potential to excite the fans and do well for us. It is good to have players in the squad who can fit straight into what we want to do.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> boss Simon Grayson says that the club will be able to attract the likes of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper <a href="sergio-romero.html">Sergio Romero</a> should they finally return to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> If <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> get back to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, playing for the club is an exciting prospect for anybody. They’ll be attracting players from all other globe - regardless of whether they’re Argentinian or playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Getting in front of the <a href="leeds-united.html">Elland Road</a> faithful and working for <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a> is a massive proposition. It won’t be an issue attracting players. They’ll be having recruitment meetings - <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Bielsa</a>, Victor Orta and <a href="angus-kinnear.html">Angus Kinnear</a>. There will be two lists at this moment in time. One for if they make <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and one for the worst-case scenario of staying in the Championship.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> has been linked with a switch to the club]</b> Having that communication with defenders has sometimes been a problem for <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>. Joe has had a fantastic career. I had him on loan at Blackpool from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> when he was a teenager. He showed what he is capable of back then and went on to have a fantastic career. Whether it’s what <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> are looking for, I don’t know what Victor has in mind. And knowing them they’ll probably pick someone that nobody has ever heard of.</p>
