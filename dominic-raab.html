  <p><b>[United Kingdom government’s foreign secretary Dominic Raab says Discussions relating to the return of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football have been held in constructive meetings]</b> I think it would lift the spirit of the nation. I think people would like to see us get back not just to work and get to a stage where children can safely return to school but also enjoy pastimes, sporting in particular. The government has had constructive meetings with sports bodies over plans for athletes to resume training when it’s safe to do so. The culture secretary has also been working on a plan to get sports played behind closed doors when we move to the second phase. We can only do it when the medical and scientific advice is that it can be done safely and sustainably, but that is certainly something under active consideration</p>

  <p><b>[British MP calls for Saudi takeover of <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> to be blocked]</b> I think it’s right that that legal due process is followed and we have this debate about takeovers in this country. I think we should follow the rule of law</p>
