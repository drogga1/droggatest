<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mao could become the first player to make 50 appearances at a <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> tournament]</b> I don’t think about these milestones. I think about doing my best to help the team. I wasn’t counting, but I’m really surprised by this! What was it - 46 games? It’s really gratifying, I’m very happy to hear it, but my focus is on helping the team<br /><br />The best players I’ve played against are Amarelle, Madjer, Roberto of Spain, ‘Sagan’ (Boguslaw Saganowski), <b>[Dejan]</b> Stankovic<br /><br /><b>[The consensus is that the outcome of Brazil-Portugal will determine who wins Group D and avoids Russia in the quarter-finals]</b> Portugal are a very strong team. They’ve been growing a lot every day. They have won important titles, they have great players - Madjer, Jordan, Belchior, Coimbra, Be Martins, Leo Martins. They have Petrony in goal - for me he’s one of the best goalkeepers in the world.<br /><br />It’s always great to play against Portugal. Who wins when Brazil play Portugal is the public, because both teams have so much quality and play beach soccer at such a high level. They will be very tough opponents.<br /><br />All three of our games will be tough. Nigeria are always strong. They always have good players. They are very fast. Their game is based a lot on speed - it’s hard to find a team that runs as much as Nigeria. They mark well and they are very good offensively.<br /><br />We’ve also been observing what Oman have done over the last few years. They’ve come on a lot<br /><br /><b>[Mao is nevertheless confident Brazil can successfully defend the crown they won in The Bahamas]</b> They are spectacular players. Two huge talents. I believe both should be in the <b>[final three]</b> for the <b>[Beach Soccer Stars]</b> Best Player award this year.<br /><br />Brazil is lucky to have excellent players in all areas. Russia, Paraguay, Portugal are very strong contenders, but I believe Brazil are in a very good position to become champions<br /><br /><b>[Paraguay 2019 could present Mao, who turns 41 in December, with his final chance to become a world champion]</b> I plan on playing for another two years. This could be my last World Cup, but I could play in 2021. I still love playing<br /><br />I dreamed of being a goalkeeper since I was little. This is very rare for a Brazilian as everybody wants to play outfield, but I was always imagining myself as a goalkeeper in big games. I was inspired by Rogerio Ceni, Marcos, Dida, Zetti, <a href="claudio-taffarel.html">Taffarel</a>, Carlos Germano, as well as beach soccer goalkeepers like Robertinho, Paulo Sergio, Jose Maria, Roberto of Spain<br /><br />I’m doing what I always dreamed of, so it’s very gratifying. I’ll make a decision after the World Cup as to whether I carry on</p>
