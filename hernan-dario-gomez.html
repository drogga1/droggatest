  <p><b>[Panama coach Hernan Dario Gomez said when asked about the performances of Pulisic’s supporting cast]</b> It didn’t surprise me because they’re players who need space and we gave them space. In the other games we played against the United States we never gave them so much space in the back. This time we gave them space and that was the error. They took advantage and they were superior and we were bad and they hit us hard.<br /><br /><b>[On Christian Pulisic]</b> That kid killed us. He did what he wanted.</p>

  <p><b>[Hernan Dario Gomez didn’t make excuses, not that he really could]</b> We found a rival immensely superior on the field of play. Before the game I didn’t think that. In the game they were superior in speed, in strength, in everything. In ability, in everything superior. They were excellent, and we had a very bad night. We were very bad, we looked ugly.<br /><br />At halftime we talked about keeping the score at 3-0, because we need the goal difference. We didn’t have a good night, and our opponent was superior. We were lucky, because it was a game where we could have given up 10 goals<br /><br />I saw a blowout coming, the blowout was coming. I put out a bad lineup, in the sense that I went too offensive and gave too much space to a very fast team, and we had too much trouble with them. So I said ‘No, let me reconfigure this because we’re going to give up six goals’. So I added another player in the midfield</p>

  <p><b>[Belgium vs Panama]</b> I must say Argentina aren’t up there with the same quality as Belgium. Argentina and Iceland don’t have a great distance but there’s a greater distance between us and Belgium. We are not the favourites but who knows.</p>
