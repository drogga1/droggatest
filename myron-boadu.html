  <p><b>[Boadu happy with Gunners snub]</b> I will never forget the moment I got on the plane, I thought, ‘This may be an important day in my life’. If we had said yes, it would have had far-reaching consequences for our family. It was attractive to go, but I also got a very good offer from AZ. I’m playing in the first team now. I do not know if that would have been the case at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, where I would play with boys of my own age, which did not appeal to me <b>[…]</b> I never regretted rejecting those clubs… I knew how good I had it at AZ and <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> had to convince me. They didn’t succeed. Other clubs didn’t either</p>

  <p><b>[AZ Alkmaar prodigy Boadu reveals choice between Ghana and Netherlands]</b> That <b>[playing for the Netherlands at senior level]</b> is my priority. I am going for the Dutch national team. That is why I was so disappointed that I had to drop out of the Dutch U21 team last week. That could have been my debut. I am now fit again. The injury was of course disappointing. It was the first time in a year that I was selected for a national youth team again. And the very first time at the U21s. Hopefully I will get a recall soon<br /><br /><b>[The Amsterdam-born also shed more light on his Ghanaian background]</b> The people, the food, that makes me feel connected. Sometimes we speak Ghanaian language at home, but I still don’t manage so well. I have been to Ghana twice, the last time was 12 years ago. So I hope to return someday</p>

  <p><b>[Netherlands striker of Ghanaian descent Boadu denies Black Stars approach]</b> No, actually not. Me, my parents and my agent have never had a call or anything <b>[from Ghana officials]</b>. So I didn’t have to choose. In the end, it all went quickly with Oranje<br /><br /><b>[Boadu’s dream of playing on the big stage for Oranje this summer has been dashed by the postponement of the Euros from 2020 to 2021 due to the raging coronavirus pandemic]</b> That is a shame, of course. But health is the most important thing. The pre-selection does show that the national coach has confidence in me</p>
