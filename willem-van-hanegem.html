  <p><b>[Dutch legend Willem van Hanegem epitomised the rivalry between the Netherlands and <b>[West]</b> Germany probably more than any other player over the past 60 years. Van Hanegem had lost his father, two brothers and a sister during World War II, two of them as a direct hit from German bombing raids on the Netherlands. Prior to the 1974 World Cup final between the two countries, van Hanegem ordered his team-mates to ‘stuff the Germans’ while after the 2-1 defeat he tearfully stated]</b> I didn’t give a damn as long as we humiliated them. They murdered my father, sister and two brothers. I am full of angst. I hate them</p>

  <p><b>[Van Hanegem says <a href="bert-van-marwijk.html">Van Marwijk</a> should stay on as Netherlands coach]</b> Bert should continue. It would help f*** all if <a href="bert-van-marwijk.html">Van Marwijk</a> quit as national team coach. He should say farewell to a few of the players <b>[rather than go himself]</b>, He has to sit down with players such as <b>[Rafael]</b> <a href="rafael-van-der-vaart.html">van der Vaart</a>, <b>[Wesley]</b> <a href="wesley-sneijder.html">Sneijder</a> and Robin <b>[<a href="robin-van-persie.html">van Persie</a>]</b> and tell them how he wants things to pan out. He should also try to get <b>[Arjen]</b> <a href="arjen-robben.html">Robben</a> and <b>[Klaas-Jan]</b> Huntelaar on board. These five players are crucial for the team and for the development of the younger players. This team still has a bright future ahead. I wouldn’t have any fear ahead of the qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup with this group of players</p>

  <p><b>[Retired Netherlands international Willem van Hanegem believes <a href="rafael-van-der-vaart.html">Rafael van der Vaart</a> and <a href="wesley-sneijder.html">Wesley Sneijder</a> are too preoccupied with themselves]</b> Guys like <a href="wesley-sneijder.html">Sneijder</a> and Van der Vaart, who are awfully good players, are still too preoccupied with themselves. With all respect to Van der Vaart and <a href="wesley-sneijder.html">Sneijder</a>, if they are at their best in 2014, then they will play their usual. But they must fight to remain at the top and play well with each other. They put themselves under pressure, because they are afraid of the upcoming youth<br /><br />I heard <b>[former Netherlands coach Rene]</b> van der Gijp say on television that Boetius is too young. How stupid can you be? Young players should participate in the training and in my opinion, even a little bit in matches. Boetius is a boy who you could have made good use of against Estonia, with him, the football becomes better. Let him do more</p>

  <p><b>[Van Hanegem says Van Gaal has lost his mind]</b> Van Gaal is deranged. How can you make that claim? It is good that he will leave again after the World Cup. I see our teams play and it’s a festival of colossal mistakes, which has nothing to do with good football. Do you see that in the Champions League?<br /><br />We’re struggling to even have three teams in Europe. They’re only looking to cover their own backside. Make top five, upper half of the table, qualify for European football. Comments like that. After Feyenoord’s second and third finishes in recent seasons, the squad remained the same, so why not say that you want to challenge for the title? If you play for Feyenoord, <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>, you need to get involved for the national title. Fortunately, <b>[Feyenoord coach]</b> <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Ronald Koeman</a> now realises that as well, but he has yet to convince the players</p>

  <p><b>[Van Hanegem says Van Gaal mistreating <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> stars]</b> What I hate to see is how Van Gaal is treating <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a>. Louis has more attention for the other geezer next to him. But Louis forgets that we are talking here about <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a>. Louis has played for Telstar, FC Antwerp and Sparta Rotterdam. <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> was a giant as a player. He deserves more respect than this.<br /><br />Falcao has proven over the past few years that he is one of the best strikers in the world. But at United he is being treated as if he was signed from an old fourth division club. Sometimes he’s allowed to play a few minutes, sometimes he is allowed to start, other times he sits 90 minutes on the bench, or even worse, in the stands. I can see there are more players not happy at United. Di Maria was one of the most important links in the chain at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. In the World Cup he was the best player in the Argentina side. But at United he hasn’t been able to pass a ball over more than 25 yards most times</p>

Take Memphis for instance. He’s just like Goldfinger with his golden shoes. But what is the use of that for Netherlands? He just lay on the ground, it makes you feel despondent<br /><br />All these players look like they are contesting a bodybuilders match. Back in the day you had players who were ripped, now they only look pumped up. That’s a big difference</p>
