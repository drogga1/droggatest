  <p><b>[Gianluca Vialli makes himself very popular with Jimmy Hill]</b> I know the English would be happier if Villa won the League with 11 of their players, rather than <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> with 11 foreigners - that is because the English are very nationalistic. They struggle to admit it when somebody brings something good to their island</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluca Vialli explains the difficulties of life as a player-manager]</b> In some of the games, some players go over the top. They pass the ball to me too much because I’m also the manager. Meanwhile somebody else doesn’t give me the ball at all because he doesn’t want to be considered a creep</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluca Vialli, whose <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> would beat Milan to the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> title in 1991, agrees]</b> They were revolutionary because they played so well as a team - tactically they were perfect. The way they pressed high up the pitch rather than dropping deep. It was quite revolutionary and they have been copied ever since</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> striker Gianluca Vialli discloses cancer battle]</b> I’m fine now, very well indeed. It’s been a year and I’m back to having a beastly physique, although I still have no certainty of how this match will end. I used to wear a sweater under my shirt so no-one noticed anything. I was still the person everyone knew<br /><br />I hope my story can inspire people, who are at crucial intersections of their lives, and I hope mine is a book to keep on the bedside table so people can read one or two stories before falling asleep or in the morning as soon as they wake up. Another key phrase that came up during my treatment, hanging on a yellow post-it on the wall, was this: ‘We’re the product of our thoughts’. The important thing isn’t winning; it’s thinking like a winner. Life is made up of 10 per cent for what happens to us and 90 per cent for how we deal with it. I hope my story can help others, to deal with what’s happening in the right way</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluca Vialli fears England vs Italy friendly won’t go ahead due to coronavirus]</b> I don’t know. We assume the game is going to go ahead unless we are told otherwise but it is difficult for us. We would like to know what to do in order to prepare for Euro 2020 in the best possible way. We’ve scheduled this game but we need to be realistic and recognise that the governments and the sports authorities will decide what we have to do and we will do that. We have to take it one day at a time. At the moment we have to assume that everything is going to go ahead but we recognise that it all could change</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluca Vialli given all-clear from cancer after 17 months of treatment and says he feels ‘fortunate’ compared to coronavirus victims]</b> I am fine. In December I finished 17 months of chemotherapy, one cycle of eight months and another of nine. It was difficult, even for someone as tough as me, both physically and mentally. The tests showed no sign of the illness. I am happy, even if I say that under my breath to be on the safe side. Regaining my health means seeing myself in the mirror again, seeing the hair grow, not having to draw eyebrows on with a pencil. In that respect, I feel very fortunate compared to many others. I think of those brought to hospital and forced to die alone, their relatives not allowed near in case of contagion, funerals that could not be celebrated. It’s terrible. This crisis will leave enormous scars on the country; emotional, moral and economic scars<br /><br />You fight the fear of dying by thinking of your desires, concentrating on what you really love and how much we want all those good things to return. In this enormous silence that surrounds us during the lockdown, there is almost a Zen atmosphere. We can hear the birdsong even in the megalopolis of the big city, see how quickly the smog cleared, even after some chose to mock that wonderful young girl, Greta Thunberg. It will be wonderful when football and sport return, as emotions and memories will help us to get back to living our full lives. I just hope we maintain this capacity for solidarity in future and expand it. Keep backing the healthcare workers, these generous people of incredible physical and mental strength. Let us not forget them, when this is all over</p>
