  <p><b>[Gianluca Vialli suggests that Allegri is simply following in the footsteps of those who have gone before him by trying to fire up his players for the business end of the season]</b> These things do happen. Sometimes the coach can even orchestrate these things. In a winning team, where everyone’s too relaxed, the coach can do it deliberately. It happened to me at Juve with Lippi. I remember one day before training, Marcello called me to this dressing room and said, ‘The guys are too relaxed. Today I’m going to get angry with you because I want everyone to wake up. So, when we were doing some warm-ups in training, Lippi roared at me once, ‘Luca!’ Then twice. Three times. Four times. Then, the fifth time, I said to him, ‘Look, if you roar at me again, I’m going to say something back because my team-mates expect me to say something! We’ll finish it here and that’s fine. Message received!<br /><br />In other clubs, I think these things might be handled in a different way. But at Juve, it’s always been like this. I know Juve as a club, the environment, and I see Allegri as a very intelligent coach. We saw how he mended his relationship with Dybala immediately. I don’t think at Juve these things leave a mark. At other clubs, if they were managed in a different way, it could become a problem. But at Juve they’re immediately forgotten</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has been urged to emulate Sir Alex Ferguson and spend the next 25 years at Chelsea by former Blues striker Gianluca Vialli]</b> I think Antonio loves the club and wants to play in the Champions League. There was a rumour about him going to Inter Milan, rather than Juventus, but if I was him then I would be staying a bit longer, fall in love with London, Premier League football and Chelsea and stay for 25 years like Alex Ferguson did.<br /><br />It’s been fantastic. To recover from a situation that wasn’t ideal, he managed to turn things around. He did it, especially when he made that tactical change after about seven or eight games. That really changed the season. Chelsea played really effective football, but also entertaining. I think they deserved the title in the end</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluca Vialli believes that Antonio Conte’s Chelsea will find it difficult to compete with Manchester City this season]</b> I think it has been a decent start of the season for Chelsea. The first match of the Premier League season, they lost at home to Burnley. I think it is quite normal that the title holders don’t start the season at their very best because you just won the previous title. Your stomach must still be full after the summer.<br /><br />Also I think Antonio was not particularly impressed with the transfer operations up until then and it was getting a bit frustrating. I think that his frustrations were being transferred to the side. I think that’s why you had a red card in the Community Shield, and also in the first match of the season with Gary Cahill <b>[and Cesc Fabregas]</b>.<br /><br />The transfer activities then improved and Antonio got the players that he wanted and he got a very good sequence of performances and results. They then lost to Manchester City which looks, in my opinion, like the best side in the Premier League this season<br /><br />That result was also on the back of going to Madrid and beating Atletico in a very, very important match for the Champions League campaign. To sum it up, I think that Chelsea will do very, very well this season. I think that Antonio’s sides, whether it is Chelsea or Juventus, they always play with pride, real determination, real humility<br /><br />They take every match very seriously, so they will be there or thereabouts. So maybe they will finish second but I think that Antonio, who has managed in the top division for four years in his career and won four titles, has demonstrated his ability to win the competitions<br /><br />Maybe he might want to focus slightly more on becoming successful in Europe with Chelsea in the Champions League because with his own Champions League campaigns so far, I am sure he’s not entirely happy with the results. So maybe we will see Chelsea going very far in the Champions League this season</p>

  <p><b>[When asked about why he traded football for the world of finance]</b> My father was an entrepreneur. I always look out for stuff that excites me and I know I want to get involved in projects and companies that have got a mission to make a service that will make football or sport better.<br /><br />Tifosy is a great idea in my opinion because it serves both the football clubs and the fans and, ultimately, I believe the sport will be better. I think I know the football industry quite well. Talking about football, in particular, and I think there are two major problems.<br /><br />One is finance. Football clubs, they need money. Some of them spend money unwisely, some of them just spend money strengthening the side and they spend a massive amount of money, kind of a fortune, in investing in players.<br /><br />Other clubs, I think wisely, want to invest money in order to invest it in tangible assets. Something that will make the club more financially sustainable, something that will assure a better future for the club. So I think there are so many clubs that want to spend money for the right reasons.<br /><br />Whether they want to build a museum for the fans, whether they want new training facilities for the academy or build a new stand to make the stadium better and to get some more revenues. These are the sorts of clubs that we want to work with.<br /><br />We are a tool that wants to help football clubs to raise money for tangible projects and also in doing that, we reconnect the clubs with the fans. We realise that the second major problem in football is that the fans don’t feel like they are part of the clubs anymore.<br /><br />It might be due to the fact that there are so many foreign ownerships out there. It might be down to the fact that many fans are being treated like customers rather than being treated as partners. So I think that working together, shoulder-to-shoulder and helping football clubs in order to become better football clubs makes the fans very proud and makes them reconnect to the club that they are so passionate about.<br /><br />When we started, Fautso Zanetton, myself and James Pollock <b>[the founders of Tifosy]</b>, the idea was to run rewards based campaigns. There was a charitable aspect but we basically wanted to do something for football clubs and we wanted the fans to contribute or to donate money in return for some sort of money can’t buy experiences.<br /><br />Now these experiences have become particularly sophisticated, it is not just about a shirt, it is about having your name on a plaque at the training facilities or it is about spending the match day in the dressing room, listening to the players and the management just before they go on the pitch and so on.<br /><br />So many fans are interested in contributing because on the one hand, they live an incredible experience that they will never forget. On the other hand, they know they are contributing and donating money to make the club eventually better.<br /><br />So the museum at Parma, training facilities at Portsmouth, the 1966 World Cup winner statue at Fulham. The big screen inside a stadium at some second division clubs for the fans to look at the scores and watch the highlights.<br /><br />These are the features that the fans are so keen on and some of the clubs didn’t have the money to <b>[do them]</b>. We had campaign contributions from 35, even 42 different countries. So we realised that it isn’t just about fans from one specific club but there are so many football fans out there in the world who the online platform could reach so they can contribute.<br /><br />Later we realised that fans wanted more, they didn’t just want to contribute, they wanted to be investors. They started asking us if we could talk to clubs to sell some equities or launch some mini-bonds. So from campaigns based on rewards, we went to organised campaigns with mini-bonds or equities, so fans can invest.<br /><br />They know they are investing in something that’s meaningful but they are also getting a financial return - 4% <b>[in cash]</b> or 8%, if you get some coupons or credit. So it is a win-win situation in my opinion for the clubs and for the fans.<br /><br />Kickstarter has a different approach, they sort of use a kind of do-it-yourself approach, it is all down to the person who wants to raise money for a specific project to run the campaign on the website.<br /><br />We do something totally different, we come up with the campaigns, we run it on the website, we do due diligence so we offer a 360 degrees type of service but I think the most important difference is that we have the license. We are authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority so we need to do things properly</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluca Vialli has backed Alvaro Morata to fend over Sergio Aguero, Harry Kane and Romelu Lukaku in his race to become the Premier League’s top goalscorer this season]</b> I’ve got no doubts that Morata can be there or thereabouts and win the competition as the most prolific striker in the Premier League. He has got a different style. He is not Diego Costa, there’s only one Diego Costa in terms of being able to be effective and aggressive at the same time.<br /><br />He’s not Lukaku because he hasn’t got the physique of Lukaku but he is probably more effective in front of goal because Morata only needs a couple of opportunities to score. Lukaku normally is always there, which is a great asset for a striker but he might need two or three chances to convert one goal. I think Morata is likely more technical as well. Aguero, Gabriel Jesus, there’s so many great strikers in our league and that makes everything so entertaining. That’s why I think the Premier League is the most enjoyable league in the world<br /><br />I think that Morata is quite aggressive. Maybe not when he tackles but he is aggressive in his runs, he is always moving around and looking for the ball. Yes, he might have to adapt a little bit to the physical side of the game because in Spain and Italy, referees are much more receptive to a striker falling on the ground.<br /><br />I know Morata very well because he was at Real Madrid but he also played in Italy for a number of seasons. He is a very talented striker, I like the fact that he runs a lot. For me, that’s something that a lot of strikers don’t do enough but Morata works really hard for the side.<br /><br />He has got a very, very effective understanding, an empathy if you like, with some of the players in the side. He makes forward runs and he knows where to run in order to receive some of the quality balls from Azpilicueta, for example, or Hazard or Fabregas.<br /><br />So he is very good and the fact that he played in Spain and Italy before he came to the Premier League has given him enough experience for how to play the game and to know what to do to become an immediate hit in the Premier League.<br /><br />He is scoring goals but I am sure that Antonio <b>[Conte]</b> wants more because he always demands more but I am sure that he is extremely happy with Morata’s performances so far</p>

  <p><b>[While Cristiano Ronaldo’s position on the pitch may have shifted over the years, Gianluca Vialli believes his incredible focus and attitude have never altered]</b> I think that the way he’s playing the game is exactly the way he was playing the game before but the starting position is slightly different. But in his head the thoughts are exactly the same. Now he’s probably starting from a more central position - before it was more wide - but his attitude towards the game, the opponents, his own team is exactly the same. I don’t consider that a massive change.<br /><br />It’s difficult to predict what your body is going to do but I believe Cristiano is a great professional. He looks after himself very well, he’s totally dedicated. He thinks about football 24/7. Italian players go to bed and they think about the training session of that day and the one the day after. I’m not sure when you come to the Premiership you think the same way. With Cristiano I get the impression he thinks about football 23½ / 7. For 30 minutes he probably does something else. It’s all about how dedicated you are to the game. It’s a game you play on the field but more importantly It’s what happens off the field that makes the difference<br /><br /><b>[On Antonio Conte]</b> Without a doubt Chelsea had a massive advantage last season when they had a week to prepare. When you give a week to prepare to a manager like Conte compared to most of his opponents who had sometimes had three days to prepare a match that’s a massive advantage. They’re great managers, so they’re able to prepare the match better, and to instruct the team better and come up with better solutions. Now they play twice a week, it’s almost a different sport in my opinion. It takes some adjustment.<br /><br />He’s got some players who have been there before, they’ve done it before so it’s an advantage compared to teams like Leicester, for them it was something completely new. It is tough. Antonio will have to adjust as well. I’ve spoken to the biggest Italian football legends and they’ve had managers who were great and they told me Antonio is on a different level. That is a massive compliment</p>

We believe it’s a rational investment but also an emotional investment. With Stevenage it was a great story. We decided to run the campaigns for about a month, but we actually reached the target and actually we went over the initial target by £100,000. So instead of £500,000, we raised £600,000.</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluca Vialli has hailed Harry Kane as one of the best strikers in the world]</b> Harry Kane is becoming one of the best strikers in the world. It is unbelievable, he is strong, he is technical, he is a goalscorer and he is scoring in the Premier League, Champions League and at international level with England.<br /><br />I don’t know whether if Harry Kane gets injured that it would be over for England but it might be a big problem because at the moment he is the centre-forward. He is the guy that everyone knows in the team can come out with the end product and the goals you need in order to win things.<br /><br />He is also someone who works hard for the side. It would be difficult to find someone capable of replacing him. I think Harry Kane at the moment is a world-class player, probably together with Robert Lewandowski, Suarez, Cristiano, Higuain, and perhaps Icardi. He is definitely one of the top five centre-forwards in the world at the moment and I think soon he will be in the top three.</p>

  <p><b>[Massimiliano Allegri is right to ignore interest from the likes of Arsenal and Chelsea]</b> Today, footballers are like brand names. A coach has to take this into account. I do not think Allegri is looking for stimulation elsewhere. Sometimes Ferguson may have thought about it, but he was at the same club for more than 25 years. Maybe one day we’ll talk about Allegri as ‘Sir Max’. It is not easy to leave Juventus because it is hard to find somewhere better.<br /><br />Max is very good on both a technical and tactical level, because he is able to adapt his team’s system to suit certain situations and different opponents. In terms of management, his ability is often underestimated. I would like to have been coached by him</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluca Vialli given all-clear from cancer after 17 months of treatment and says he feels ‘fortunate’ compared to coronavirus victims]</b> I am fine. In December I finished 17 months of chemotherapy, one cycle of eight months and another of nine. It was difficult, even for someone as tough as me, both physically and mentally. The tests showed no sign of the illness. I am happy, even if I say that under my breath to be on the safe side. Regaining my health means seeing myself in the mirror again, seeing the hair grow, not having to draw eyebrows on with a pencil. In that respect, I feel very fortunate compared to many others. I think of those brought to hospital and forced to die alone, their relatives not allowed near in case of contagion, funerals that could not be celebrated. It’s terrible. This crisis will leave enormous scars on the country; emotional, moral and economic scars<br /><br />You fight the fear of dying by thinking of your desires, concentrating on what you really love and how much we want all those good things to return. In this enormous silence that surrounds us during the lockdown, there is almost a Zen atmosphere. We can hear the birdsong even in the megalopolis of the big city, see how quickly the smog cleared, even after some chose to mock that wonderful young girl, Greta Thunberg. It will be wonderful when football and sport return, as emotions and memories will help us to get back to living our full lives. I just hope we maintain this capacity for solidarity in future and expand it. Keep backing the healthcare workers, these generous people of incredible physical and mental strength. Let us not forget them, when this is all over</p>
