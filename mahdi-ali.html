  <p><b>[Mahdi Ali, UAE’s manager, insists he has a great relationship with the Football Association of his country, which extends for many years]</b> My relationship with the FA is strong and great, and it extends for many years. Everyone must support the national team. There was no farewell after the game against Iraq. It was just a motivational speech to the players to take responsibility and realize the qualifying dream. I told the players whether I stayed or left, you have to fight for making the country happy and realizing the dream of qualifying to the finals</p>

  <p><b>[Emirati top flight league leaders, Al Jazira, released a statement affirming that the club’s stadium, Mohammed Bin Zayed stadium, is in optimal condition to host important football games]</b> Al Jazira went through the details of the press conference of UAE’s coach Mahdi Ali talking about the venue change for UAE’s match against Japan. We received nothing from the Emirati FA regarding such issues with our grounds, and we would like to clarify that no one from the UAEFA or UAE’s national team staff visited our grounds in the last period, that’s why we’re surprised with Mahdi Ali’s comments about our stadium of triumph, and would like to know how he got to those conclusions.</p>

  <p><b>[Mahdi Ali excludes injured Amer Abdulrahman from squad to face Japan]</b> I wished to continue in the team after being called-up to the national squad, but I have full confidence in the rest of the players led by coach Ali, to show their best in order to achieve the desired results.</p>

  <p><b>[UAE boss Mahdi Ali remains upbeat despite a lengthy injury list ahead of the team’s World Cup qualifier with Japan]</b> We are having some difficulties and we miss many players. In the UAE, we have a limited number of players we can choose. But we are used to this situation - it is a part of football. We should not think about the injuries, but think about how we play this match, and how to win it. We will try our best and work hard to make a positive.<br /><br />We are thinking about this match at the moment. In football, anything can happen, so you have to prepare for everything. What we think about is only how to do our best regardless of the result that comes. But usually the result comes with hard work, so we think only to work hard and do our best on the pitch irrespective of what condition we have at the moment. In the end, this is football and one team will win. We always think about positive things, we don’t want to think about negative things. And I hope that thinking about the positive will make a good emotion and motivation for us<br /><br />Football doesn’t believe in history - what happened in the previous game is in the past. Football knows only one language: how prepared you are, how strong you are on the pitch, how much effort you give in the game. And I think we always play our football, always try to work hard, whether in training or on the pitch. And that makes the difference in the team. Of course, we are in a good position as well as the other three teams in the table. This gives us a lot of motivation to fight for our chances to qualify. The last time was 1990, and this gives us a lot of motivation for the players, the fans and the staff. Mentally we’re in good shape because we’re playing at home and we’ll work hard to do our best in this game</p>

  <p><b>[UAE suffered a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Japan on Thursday evening at Al Ain with goals from Yuya Kubo and Yasuyuki Konno]</b> It is not the time to tackle that issue here. In five days’ time, we have another game, and it is the decision of the association to take, not me. I am a professional coach, so I am not thinking about <b>[resigning]</b>. We have another game coming. We lost only three points here. We have not lost our chances to qualify. There are still 12 points to play for. I think we have to win the rest of the games, and we have to work hard to achieve our goals.<br /><br />The match was difficult for us. We controlled the first half for much of the time, and created chances, but we did not score. In the second half, the same. Japan made use of two attacks and scored two goals. The match was hard, and despite the situations we faced, I’d like to congratulate my players for their efforts. Now we are looking forward</p>

  <p><b>[UAE coach Mahdi Ali announces resignation after Australia defeat]</b> For me, I have spent around 13 years with the national team, and five years with the first team. We have had so many achievements with the team, we have worked very hard and I think this is the time for me to leave.<br /><br />I tried my best, I did not complain, but now is the time for me to leave. Actually I resigned before the Iraq game, but the federation insisted I continue. I stayed. We won the Iraq game and we had a better chance. I think, after five years, I did my best. We have had so many achievements, winning the Gulf Cup and qualifying to the third round of the World Cup <b>[qualifiers<br /><br />Given the conditions we have, I don’t think we can achieve better than that. It is a very bad moment for me. I wish I could leave the national team in a better condition. But this is life. We have to accept it. I apologise to all the UAE fans, the leaders, the players, the staff, I thank them all. This is the time for me to leave</b></p>
