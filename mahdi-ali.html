  <p>[Mahdi Ali, UAE’s manager, insists he has a great relationship with the Football Association of his country, which extends for many years] My relationship with the FA is strong and great, and it extends for many years. Everyone must support the national team. There was no farewell after the game against Iraq. It was just a motivational speech to the players to take responsibility and realize the qualifying dream. I told the players whether I stayed or left, you have to fight for making the country happy and realizing the dream of qualifying to the finals</p>

  <p>[Emirati top flight league leaders, Al Jazira, released a statement affirming that the club’s stadium, Mohammed Bin Zayed stadium, is in optimal condition to host important football games] Al Jazira went through the details of the press conference of UAE’s coach Mahdi Ali talking about the venue change for UAE’s match against Japan. We received nothing from the Emirati FA regarding such issues with our grounds, and we would like to clarify that no one from the UAEFA or UAE’s national team staff visited our grounds in the last period, that’s why we’re surprised with Mahdi Ali’s comments about our stadium of triumph, and would like to know how he got to those conclusions.</p>
