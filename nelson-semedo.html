  <p><b>[New Barcelona signing Nelson Semedo has revealed the Ronaldinho was one of the reasons he joined the Camp Nou side]</b> The presence of Ronaldinho had a great influence in my decision. Since I was little, I’ve always liked Barcelona. At the moment, Barcelona is one of the best sides in the world. Lionel Messi and Neymar are otherworldly players, but the whole team has great quality.<br /><br />The first few days have been very good. My adaptation is going well because of the help of my team-mates and everything has been very easy. I came to the best team in the world. It’s a side with a great structure and has players of the highest level</p>
