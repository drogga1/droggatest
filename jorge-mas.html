  <p><b>[Jorge Mas reveals Inter Miami likely to wait until the summer to sign big-name players amid <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a> links]</b> In all probability, everyone has been expecting a really big name, someone from Europe. There’s a possibility we wait until the summer window for that <b>[number]</b> nine. A nine, in all likelihood, our main DP will probably be either in the summer window or we’ll have some type of loan transaction in the short term. We’re looking at someone who can score north of 25 goals. This is about winning. This isn’t just about bringing in a name for marketing and PR and selling a thousand more jerseys. That’s not the objective. There are very high-profile players who we’re extremely interested in. We’ve been linked to a lot of them. We’re looking for a 9, and I think that’s where our final DP spot will go</p>

  <p><b>[Inter vs Inter Miami name dispute]</b> This issue has nothing to do with Inter Miami the name, it has to do with exclusively with ‘Inter’, that one word. Regardless of the outcome, Inter Miami will be here hopefully for 50 to 100 years. We’re not concerned with the trademark issue whatsoever</p>
