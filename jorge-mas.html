  <p><b>[Beckham’s Inter Miami group braced for long-awaited MLS launch]</b> We had super, super productive meetings in KC. I’m very excited for what we can bring the Miami soccer fan, and we’ll have some big news to announce in Miami in the near future. Being a native, I’m a Miami guy 1,000 percent, and I want to make this a really special team with a really special fan experience</p>

  <p><b>[Jorge Mas reveals Inter Miami likely to wait until the summer to sign big-name players amid <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a> links]</b> In all probability, everyone has been expecting a really big name, someone from Europe. There’s a possibility we wait until the summer window for that <b>[number]</b> nine. A nine, in all likelihood, our main DP will probably be either in the summer window or we’ll have some type of loan transaction in the short term. We’re looking at someone who can score north of 25 goals. This is about winning. This isn’t just about bringing in a name for marketing and PR and selling a thousand more jerseys. That’s not the objective. There are very high-profile players who we’re extremely interested in. We’ve been linked to a lot of them. We’re looking for a 9, and I think that’s where our final DP spot will go</p>
