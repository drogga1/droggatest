  <p><b>[Yerry Mina reveals tales of poverty-stricken childhood and heart-warming speech he made to mother at the age of 14]</b> My mother was crying. I said ‘Listen, mum, I am going to build a house for you one day. I am also going to make sure you will be fed from the hand of God’. My mum started to cry again. She said, ‘Don’t worry, Mina, I am also doing my best to try to keep you’<br /><br />From that day, wherever I travel in the world to play my football, my motivation before I go out on the field I always say it is my mum’s dinner or - like in a few weeks’ time - <a href="gabriel-jesus.html">Gabriel Jesus</a>’s mum’s dinner. Either the striker’s mum’s dinner or mine<br /><br />To be strong physically and mentally on the field I say to myself I am going out to earn my mum’s dinner. It comes from them, from that childhood, the time when things were tough. It’s not an easy place to grow up and I look back and am motivated to serve as an example to kids growing up the same way</p>

  <p><b>[Everton defender Yerry Mina has admitted he is dreaming of a positive future on Merseyside as he targets a consistent second season in the Premier League]</b> It’s really nice to be at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. I feel good, I’m very relaxed and am getting happier and happier with how things are progressing in the club and in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. That’s very important for me and every day I give thanks that I am in this position. I keep my feet on the ground but I’m happy to say my head is in the clouds. Something is certainly going right. We’re working very well together and defending well. Records are hard things to achieve - everyone has to work together very well<br /><br /><b>[Mina says the squad is bonding well, and he thinks that Silva is the perfect manager to lead his youthful squad into their ambitious future]</b> The positive aspect about that is that we know each other very well and I’m lucky to be here in this great club. It’s full of strong personalities and I’ve got great team-mates. We’re like a family and that is what is contributing to us getting better and better day by day. We’re achieving this by following the boss’ instructions and step by step we’re definitely going in the right direction. Professor Marco, as I call him, is a very positive person, he’s a man that loves to always come out on top. He’s a winner and he motivates all of us to win and to be winners. He’s very open, very easy to talk to and is a hard worker as well. He puts in long hours. We all have a very good relationship with him. I am pleased he’s shown so much confidence in me and every time I go out on the pitch, I try to demonstrate he was right to put that confidence in me. I want him to know I appreciate the good judgement he’s shown to put so much faith in me.</p>

  <p><b>[Yerry Mina says <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a>’s calmness helping <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> players through coronavirus lockdown]</b> He’s a coach from whom I have learned an awful lot in the short time he’s been with us, and I hope to continue to do that. He is always full of charisma and giving off a positive vibe, which really helps you to perform well.<br /><br />The last time I spoke with him it was just the same as ever.’ve been speaking a lot with Davide <b>[<a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a>]</b>, the manager’s assistant, during this situation, but a while ago at the start of this pandemic I spoke with the gaffer and it was a very good conversation. As we all know the manager is just top quality<br /><br />It’s the calmness he has in situations where we might be under extreme pressure. He ensures that everyone around him stays calm, too. He keeps his head and thinks in those moments. He is the boss</p>
