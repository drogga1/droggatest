  <p><b>[Yerry Mina talks about meeting <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> for the first time]</b> It’s special for me <b>[to play with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b>.

  <p><b>[Barcelona are willing to listen to offers for Yerry Mina as they look to move the centre-back on just six months after signing him]</b> For me, Barcelona are the best team in the world. I don’t want to leave and I never do. I like the club, the city, the people, the players here… everything. It’s wonderful because I always feel supported. Now I am relaxed, I’ve been doing things in the best way possible, trying to improve, because that’s what I want.</p>

  <p><b>[Yerry Mina has hinted at making another move]</b> I want to make the best decision, but being calm is the most important thing. I want the best for my life and I have fulfilled a dream arriving at Barcelona, but this year I had some very difficult moments. I want a team where I’m calm and can receive minutes.</p>

  <p><b>[Yerry Mina has said that he was paying for Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez to go shopping after making bets with the strikers over free-kicks in training]</b> When I arrived, to create a good atmosphere I started to bet with Messi and Suarez to see who took the best free-kicks in training. I did it just to watch them. Before I knew it they were taking 50 euros a day off me. And I was like, ‘What, I’m paying for these guys to go shopping!’ But the truth is those monsters put the ball wherever they want it. They are fantastic people and they are wizards.<br /><br />I thought a lot of things, a lot of bad things. I thought I was finished. I felt so bad and <b>[Philippe]</b> Coutinho and Paulinho tried to encourage me all the time and told me that everything would be fine. For me, I understand that there are spectacular players <b>[at centre-back]</b> but I just wanted to have a minute to impress and it didn’t happen. The few minutes I did get, they were bad … it felt at times like everything was going wrong and coming down. I felt like I couldn’t do anything right, such as even giving a pass in training<br /><br />In terms of my future, I have no idea but I’m calm about it. I’m 23 years old and have a lot of football left to play</p>

  <p><b>[Yerry Mina insists that Manchester United were not interested in securing his signature in the summer]</b> I was always focused on Everton. Any talk with Manchester United was just to my agent. I have always been aware of English football - Manchester United, Manchester City, Everton, Tottenham. But Everton has always been an important club for me, honestly. I watched them when back in the day when <b>[Marouane]</b> Fellaini was playing here.<br /><br />The truth is Professor Marco Silva spoke to me every day, telling me to come to England. The big thing was when I was holiday, training and keeping fit after the World Cup, Marco was on the phone. Talking to me, saying to me, ‘come on, come and play here with us’. The faith he showed in me was very important. I know now, sitting here, that I have made the right decision. It was the best decision I could have made</p>

  <p><b>[Yerry Mina reveals tales of poverty-stricken childhood and heart-warming speech he made to mother at the age of 14]</b> My mother was crying. I said ‘Listen, mum, I am going to build a house for you one day. I am also going to make sure you will be fed from the hand of God’. My mum started to cry again. She said, ‘Don’t worry, Mina, I am also doing my best to try to keep you’<br /><br />From that day, wherever I travel in the world to play my football, my motivation before I go out on the field I always say it is my mum’s dinner or - like in a few weeks’ time - <a href="gabriel-jesus.html">Gabriel Jesus</a>’s mum’s dinner. Either the striker’s mum’s dinner or mine<br /><br />To be strong physically and mentally on the field I say to myself I am going out to earn my mum’s dinner. It comes from them, from that childhood, the time when things were tough. It’s not an easy place to grow up and I look back and am motivated to serve as an example to kids growing up the same way</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> defender Yerry Mina has admitted he is dreaming of a positive future on Merseyside as he targets a consistent second season in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> It’s really nice to be at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. I feel good, I’m very relaxed and am getting happier and happier with how things are progressing in the club and in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. That’s very important for me and every day I give thanks that I am in this position. I keep my feet on the ground but I’m happy to say my head is in the clouds. Something is certainly going right. We’re working very well together and defending well. Records are hard things to achieve - everyone has to work together very well<br /><br /><b>[Mina says the squad is bonding well, and he thinks that Silva is the perfect manager to lead his youthful squad into their ambitious future]</b> The positive aspect about that is that we know each other very well and I’m lucky to be here in this great club. It’s full of strong personalities and I’ve got great team-mates. We’re like a family and that is what is contributing to us getting better and better day by day. We’re achieving this by following the boss’ instructions and step by step we’re definitely going in the right direction. Professor Marco, as I call him, is a very positive person, he’s a man that loves to always come out on top. He’s a winner and he motivates all of us to win and to be winners. He’s very open, very easy to talk to and is a hard worker as well. He puts in long hours. We all have a very good relationship with him. I am pleased he’s shown so much confidence in me and every time I go out on the pitch, I try to demonstrate he was right to put that confidence in me. I want him to know I appreciate the good judgement he’s shown to put so much faith in me.</p>

He is always full of charisma and giving off a positive vibe, which really helps you to perform well.<br /><br />The last time I spoke with him it was just the same as ever.’ve been speaking a lot with Davide <b>[<a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a>]</b>, the manager’s assistant, during this situation, but a while ago at the start of this pandemic I spoke with the gaffer and it was a very good conversation. As we all know the manager is just top quality<br /><br />It’s the calmness he has in situations where we might be under extreme pressure. He ensures that everyone around him stays calm, too. He keeps his head and thinks in those moments. He is the boss</p>
