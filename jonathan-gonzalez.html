  <p><b>[Jonathan Gonzalez was once fully committed to representing the United States on the international level]</b> I wasn’t called in, in November. Personally, nobody came and talked to me and let me know about that friendly. I just wasn’t called in.</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan Gonzalez has released a statement thanking U.S. Soccer for its support but declaring his intention to represent Mexico at the international level]</b> Four years ago I arrived in Mexico with the dream of playing soccer professionally, something that I have accomplished with a lot of hard work, dedication and above everything else, with the support of my family. It is not easy to leave the country in which one is born, however, Mexico is also my home as it is the country where my parents were born and, consequently, where my roots originate.<br /><br />Today I want to announce my decision to represent Mexico and their national team. I am ready to earn a spot for many years<br /><br />I want to express my gratitude to the United States Soccer Federation for all their support and trust during my first few years of soccer development.</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Carlos Osorio knows who is going to the World Cup]</b> I saw him, I spoke to him and I asked him and he told me, ‘I have played there.’ I said, ‘Well that’s what I see you playing.’ We’re not asking him to play as a central defender! We’re just playing him. ‘You are very dynamic, we see you playing father forward becoming a box-to-box player and using all your energy.’ That’s how we do it and I think that’s the proper way to do it, not because I do it that way, because it’s the proper way</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Gonzalez says Mexican-Americans must follow their hearts when making national team choice]</b> I think a lot of players have been coming out with their background being Mexican and playing in the U.S. national team and vice versa. In my opinion, their decisions aren’t going to be easy at all, but they have to do whatever their heart tells them and their mind mostly and try to go for whatever’s going to help them in the future and help them grow. I think the decision comes down to what’s best for their future<br /><br />In those moments, it was very intense, but I think I made the best decision. Personally I don’t try to see everything on Twitter or Instagram. I’m really not up to date with everything that happens. At that time there was a lot of discussion. Were there a lot of posts? Yeah, but I tried to stay off social media and really think about what I was going to do. I really don’t think anything journalists or people posted influenced my decision. I think it’s something I did on my own<br /><br /><b>[Young players also reach out to Gonzalez to seek his advice about breaking through and becoming a professional]</b> It’s something new to me. Before I used to be the one asking questions, the one trying to look for advice and now I get all these young guys asking me for advice. It’s something that makes me very proud, and I just try to help them out with their future and find ways to make them be their best and give their all so they can make their dream a reality<br /><br /><b>[Even so, Gonzalez said he’s been working hard to get back to full fitness and is confident minutes are coming]</b> I just think that right now my main goal is to be a starter again for <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a>, hopefully get called up to the senior national team soon. That’s a big part of what I have planned for now in the short-term. Ultimately, in the medium and long-term, it’s to go to Europe and so on, but the most important thing right now is to get fit and start playing here in <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a> again<br /><br />I think little by little going to these camps with Tata and getting more experience and getting that rhythm back, I think that’s going to be something really good for me in the future. Tata, I don’t think he’s really come up to talk to any of us in specific, at least not me. I don’t know. I’m just hoping I’m doing things well and hoping I get the call back soon</p>
