  <p><b>[Landon Donovan on why he committed his long-term to Los Angeles Galaxy]</b> I think we’re seeing a little bit of a tipping point right now. When you have a guy like Clint Dempsey, with all that he’s done and the player that he is, wanting to be in our league, it makes a big statement. You look at someone like <a href="robbie-keane.html">Robbie Keane</a>, who I think we can all agree could play anywhere in the world, and he has decided to come here. Everybody wants to be here. When a guy like <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> comes here and leaves, now I speak to players in Europe, and they say, ‘Gosh, David couldn’t stop raving about what a wonderful place the <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> is.’ So I love being here. I love playing here. I get to play in front of my family. We have a beautiful stadium here at StubHub Center. We have wonderful fans. We’re a successful team</p>

  <p><b>[Landon Donovan on the possibility of a coaching career in the future]</b> Just in the last month I’ve talked a lot to my agent and my wife about starting to get the itch to coach. What all of us want to do when we get out of the game is we want to have the ability to go back and make an impact and help others. I didn’t have anybody at 16, 17, 18, 19 that was telling me what to do or how to react or how to act in certain situations and I wish I would have had that. I want to have the ability to impact people in that way and to affect change in a positive way, and I think I have a lot to give in that way</p>

I spoke with some of them and they jokingly asked if I was ready to make a return to the field to help fill some of the void left by injuries and departures. I reminded them that I haven’t played a meaningful soccer game in almost two years and I certainly couldn’t fill the holes left by those players. Over the ensuing days, I began to think about their inquiries and it struck me that perhaps this is something I should consider</p>

  <p><b>[Confident and improved Bruce Arena has U.S. believing]</b> There’s no question he could coach anywhere. Now, can he coach at Real Madrid or Barcelona? I don’t know. I don’t think Bruce would have any problem coaching anywhere. And he proved that because coaching anywhere means being able to deal with the pressure, which Bruce deals with as well as anybody I know. It means being able to deal with the egos, which between myself, Robbie <b>[Keane]</b>, David <b>[Beckham]</b> and others over his career, that wasn’t an issue. He would be fine coaching anywhere. Let’s just say if he didn’t succeed, it wouldn’t be because he was in over his head or wasn’t capable. It would be because things didn’t go right. He has all the ability to coach anywhere, no question.<br /><br /><b>[What was Arena’s secret to pulling off what, to this day, stands a truly impressive coaching feat?]</b> What he did is he just let us go do what we were good at, and we never knew until many years later what the pressure was like. We never knew how important those <b>[World Cup]</b> games were. We were just having fun playing and he was smart enough to just stay out of the way and let us be kids. A lot of coaches overthink it. They don’t trust the players so they give them too much info. Bruce basically said, ‘Guys, just go play. You know what you’re doing. Just go play.’ And we were able to just go play and we were successful because of it</p>

  <p><b>[Landon Donovan calls Clint Dempsey’s goal tally ‘much more impressive’ than his]</b> I’m very proud of the record, there’s no question. But when you put it in context, I don’t know the numbers but I know Clint has fewer penalty goals than I had. I know he’s done it in less caps than I have. I know he’s probably done it in less years than I have. And you have to remember that he was overseas for a lot of years, so he didn’t get to come in all the time and play friendlies in January against the Norwegian B team or Barbados. So in my opinion he’s done it in more difficult circumstances and that makes it that much more impressive.<br /><br /><b>[Donovan still admits to being blown away by the national team career Dempsey has put together]</b> I knew there was something special when I first saw him play, but I would have never imagined that he would be able to be this consistent for this long just because he played so hard. And when you play that intense and that hard, and put yourself in danger that often, you would expect that you would have a lot more injuries. But he’s been remarkably healthy throughout his career. And he’s been able to keep himself going, and that to me is unbelievably impressive</p>

  <p><b>[Bruce Arena hates talking tactics, but is still very much a tactician]</b> Bruce will tell you that, obviously the tactical side of the game is important, but he believes the other parts of the game are just as important. To claim he’s not tactically intelligent is wrong, it’s just not something he’s overly focused on discussing like a lot of coaches are in the game now.</p>

  <p><b>[Darlington Nagbe leaves us wanting more, but he’s still delivering for the USA]</b> <b>[Nagbe]</b> can affect the game in other ways besides having to run at people or make a killer pass or shoot. He can still be very beneficial. I think he’s done really well. I think he has started to see that he can be more aggressive, and I’ve seen that as he’s been here with Bruce. I think Bruce is giving him total freedom to just go. ‘You’re good enough. You have no idea how good you are.’ I think he’s starting to see that. But you also don’t want to take him away from what he does naturally.<br /><br />Clearly, everyone says he’s a great player, he’s good, he’s special. So are we trying to push him into something he’s not? Isn’t it good enough that he’s being effective? He’s made it to the national team being who he is. That’s pretty damn good. Can he maybe turn it up a little bit? Maybe, but I think he’s done really well</p>

  <p><b>[Landon Donovan adapting to transition from the soccer field to TV booth]</b> I feel like I always err on the side of positive because I’ve been there, and it’s not as easy as it looks on TV. But I think as you get more comfortable, I feel okay saying something negative or critiquing in the context of the game. There’s a difference between saying ‘this guy’s a terrible player’ versus ‘this guy made a bad play’.<br /><br />I try to phrase it in a way where I’m being respectful to the player, but if Eric Lichaj gives a ball away in the third minute, what the hell’s he doing? Or Omar <b>[Gonzalez]</b> lets a ball bounce in the six-yard box, Omar’s one of my best friend teammates I’ve ever had, but you have to say ‘What the hell was Omar doing’. I think you have to do it out of respect for the game, and your job, but also out of respect for the players. I’m trying to figure out that line, but I’ve been more critical this tournament for sure<br /><br />It wasn’t a nerves thing because I was used to being in front of a camera, but I didn’t understand the things you need to do to be good at it, or to even be competent. It was a bad situation because I was sitting talking to a camera, as opposed to being in an area where you’re with other people. Where you’re at a desk, where you have energy. It was a good learning experience to kind of get thrown into the fire, but thinking about then versus now, it’s like anything. The more practice, the more you learn, the better you get. So I’ve come a long way<br /><br />My ex-wife was an actress, and she would always talk about how important chemistry is on camera, and I’d always say ‘That’s stupid. Like you’re an athlete, you do your job, you do your job’. But it’s just like on the field. There’s certain guys you have chemistry with. Like Brian Ching, I just knew exactly where to go, what to say, where he wanted it. Same with <b>[DaMarcus Beasley]</b>, you just knew it, because you spent so much time together<br /><br />There’s a balance that Stu and I figure out and we’re continuing to figure out. If he’s hammering someone and I see the other side, like for instance Paul Arriola. The other day <b>[Holden’s]</b> going after him and he said he should have scored this deflected shot that bounced in front of him and had all this spin, and I’m saying ‘Stu, hold on, that’s not the easiest chance to score on’.<br /><br />If a guy has a horrible game and we both see it, we’re going to say it. But if, like Paul Arriola, I don’t think he’s been poor. I don’t think he’s been his best, I don’t think his passing and finishing has been the best, but I think he’s been energetic and lively, so when Stu says that I’m fine to say ‘Listen, I don’t think he’s been that bad’. And it’s okay. Everybody looks at the game and has eight different opinions. That’s the way soccer is<br /><br />I’m aware of <b>[the criticism]</b>, and since it’s new to me, I look for it a lot. I’m on Twitter looking to see what people say. In the end it’s so I can understand what I’m doing right and doing wrong, but I’ve realized that, just like my playing career, I could score a hat-trick and someone will say ‘You’re terrible, you got lucky to score three goals’. And it’s just based on whether someone likes you or not. I’ve obviously been, in some ways, somewhat polarizing<br /><br />I would have said a year ago absolutely not, but I’m really enjoying it, and I’m enjoying the pressure of it because you’re live. When I think ahead to next year, in the World Cup, and 20 million plus people paying attention, so there’s the adrenaline going, and it’s performing. I like that part of it.<br /><br />Do I see myself doing it long term? I don’t know. I don’t see myself traveling every week, 52 weeks a year doing it, but if I could do it in a way where I’m doing enough of it so I’m being respectful to everybody but not killing myself, then maybe</p>

  <p><b>[Does U.S need more game-changing stars? Landon Donovan thinks so]</b> It’s USA Soccer’s challenge. Argentina has six guys like that, and two of them don’t make their World Cup roster. We have one or two. That’s what needs to get better and it’s not necessarily a thing that one player just turns on. It’s, ‘Do we have that or not? Do we have those options or not?’ We have a few, but inconsistent. We need four or five consistently if we’re going to make it to the next level.<br /><br /><b>[Donovan’s take on Rowe and Dwyer’s Gold Cup performances]</b> They’re very similar. They both can pull off a special play, which there’s high value in at this level, super high value in. In a game where they don’t pull off a play, are they doing enough? That’s a question I don’t have answered yet. I would like to see more of them, more games with them. That’s the question that needs to be answered because when you get to the next level, when you get to <b>[World Cup]</b> qualifiers, and you get to the World Cup, you’re not going to pull off a play like that every game. The only guy I can think of <b>[on this Gold Cup team]</b> that can do that right now is Clint. That you would say, ‘He can pull off a special play in that game.’ I don’t look at anyone else and say that. Maybe Michael <b>[Bradley]</b>, maybe Jozy <b>[Altidore]</b>.<br /><br />If Kelyn Rowe’s on the field in a World Cup game, or Dom Dwyer, and they don’t score or pull off a play is there enough there? Right now, no. But it doesn’t mean they can’t get there<br /><br />He’s pulling off plays in every game. I was watching him the other day in China against Milan, and he pulls off plays. In a perfect world you have three or four of those guys on the field. Right now, when Clint’s in form, he’s one of those guys. If he’s not, then he’s not. If Jozy’s in form, he can be.<br /><br />Christian, you can say, is one of those guys. It’s a lot on his shoulders. We should be good enough where we have three or four of those players. Like I said, if Jozy and Clint are on form, and Fabian <b>[Johnson]</b> is playing well, then those are guys who can pull off those plays, but right now you would say Christian’s the only one you consistently would feel confident in that way.<br /><br />I just think it’s impressive that this early in his career he’s able to consistently not just play well, but pull off special plays. That says a lot about him<br /><br />I like the current 11 when I think about it. Probably <b>[Jorge]</b> Villafana, <b>[Geoff]</b> Cameron, <b>[John]</b> Brooks, Tim <b>[Howard]</b>, <b>[DeAndre]</b> Yedlin. And then you can go through and say is it Michael <b>[Bradley]</b> and Christian, Darlington, Jozy, Clint and Fabian. That 11 is good. I think what we’re trying to figure out is there real depth that can be added and help in a real way. Who are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16? Who are those guys. That, I’m not sure of yet<br /><br />Honestly, watching this Gold Cup hasn’t given me a ton of confidence in that way. You want to see a couple, like three or four, step up. Omar <b>[Gonzalez]</b> is for sure that next guy up at center back. Who’s the next guy up top? Is it Jordan <b>[Morris]</b>? Is it Juan <b>[Agudelo]</b>? Is it Dom? Is Kelyn Rowe really the next guy in midfield? Is it Gyasi <b>[Zardes]</b>? I don’t know because nobody has staked that claim</p>

  <p><b>[San Diego’s rise to MLS expansion favorite will come down to public vote]</b> Growing up, I knew it as a youth soccer market, but I didn’t realize how many adults without kids love soccer in this town. We had a viewing party for the World Cup final in downtown, there were 13,000 people that showed up. Most of those people were fans of other MLS teams, of European teams, of South American teams. There’s just this crazy melting pot of people who love soccer. Then when the ratings came out after the World Cup, San Diego was the number one market for the World Cup final in the States and the number five market overall. We have more people in this city watch Major League Soccer than in any other city, and we don’t even have a team. When you calculate that, plus the proximity to the border, and the five or six thousand people who cross the border every Friday or Saturday to watch the Xolos play, you realize pretty quickly San Diego is a massive soccer town.<br /><br />I didn’t realize that this was going to be such a political process. You would think that if somebody wants to privately fund a massive development and stadium that it should be a no-brainer, but it’s been anything but easy. I figured the league wanted to be in San Diego, which I believe they do. I just didn’t think that the local politics would be what they were. It was a little naive of me, because if you see what happened in St. Louis, and what happened in Miami, you realize that none of these things are slam dunks. So even though you have the fastest-growing sport in the country, there’s still this old-school thinking that soccer’s not going to make it. Older people who don’t really understand soccer don’t understand how valuable the sport can be for a city. You see what’s happened in Portland, you see what’s happened in Orlando. How Toronto has galvanized that city. I think people just don’t really understand it because they’re looking at it through their old-school soccer lens<br /><br />Anybody you talk to in San Diego says ‘Yeah, I would love an MLS team, and I’d buy season tickets immediately’, but the way to get that is they have to vote. Getting people out to vote for something is a whole different animal. Particularly in a mid-term election, when not as many people get out to vote. That becomes a challenge, but that’s been our challenge and one we’ve taken on. In the end the beauty of all this is people can educate themselves, hopefully, and they get to vote. When you have a public vote you can’t complain because the people have the chance to decide</p>

I don’t know if the investors here will have the appetite to go through this again and try to figure something out. I don’t know how much they’re willing to put up with again. They got dragged through the mud quite a bit in this process. If it was as simple as, ‘Do we want an MLS team and do we want to do something like that for the city?’ I think that’d be an easy answer for everyone. But unfortunately these things are more complicated than that and I don’t know if they want to go through that again</p>

  <p><b>[San Diego project falters following public vote]</b> If it was as simple as, ‘Do we want an MLS team and do we want to do something like that for the city?’ I think that’d be an easy answer for everyone. But unfortunately, these things are more complicated than that and I don’t know if they want to go through that again.</p>

  <p><b>[Landon Donovan has said he believes Major League Soccer will soon surpass other North American professional sports leagues]</b> Finally, Major League Soccer is very close to the others. I believe that now, baseball, in my country, is for the older generation. Young people don’t watch much baseball. American football <b>[NFL]</b> also has issues with security and health. Basketball <b>[NBA]</b> is in a good phase, but MLS is really growing. In five, 10, 15 years, I believe we will be the third, second or first sport in the country.<br /><br /><b>[Prospective owners used to have to pay as little as $10 million to join the league as an expansion team, as Toronto FC did in 2006. Now those fees can reach as much as 30 times that amount]</b> <b>[That it costs]</b> $300m means everything – because, if companies or people with money are paying a lot, this tells you business is good and that the league is growing</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic has a £58 million move to Chelsea in place]</b> Candidly, I am a little worried and I think American fans should be a little bit. I understand the situation at Dortmund now; they are not going to play a player who is leaving in six months. The beauty of the situation with Christian is that he, by all accounts and from what I have seen, has a really good head on his shoulders, likes to compete and is oozing with talent.<br /><br />From that standpoint it should be fine but what happens if you go to Chelsea, who fortunately for him have a two-window transfer ban, but have a bunch of other talented players and he doesn’t get a chance to play. He is now either 20 or approaching 20 and needs to be playing games so that could be concerning. It is hard to turn down the allure of going to somewhere like Chelsea but it’s the same argument I’ve made since I was 20 years old, when people ridiculed me for leaving <b>[Bundesliga side Bayer]</b> Leverkusen, if you are not playing games at that age, you are getting worse<br /><br />I just hope that he gets a fair opportunity to play. You just never know with a manager. When you’re playing in America, for a club in America, you get the benefit of the doubt. But when you’re playing somewhere else, they don’t care if you’re from America or Ghana or Argentina, they are going to play who they think should play. So, he’s got to prove he belongs there, which I’m hoping and guessing he will do, but it’s going to be difficult. That’s a club that’s full of quality attacking players</p>

  <p><b>[After his LA Galaxy were bounced by Club Tijuana that year]</b> I think you see the difference in the leagues on nights like tonight. We’ve got probably six, seven, eight guys who are mature, who know how these games are. They’ve got 20 guys who know how these games go. And that’s the difference between the payrolls</p>

  <p><b>[Landon Donovan has been announced as the Executive Vice President for Soccer Operations for a USL Championship franchise that has been awarded to San Diego]</b> I chose San Diego as my home and have personally been focused on bringing professional soccer to the community. Thanks to Warren, USL and our incredible team, that dream has become reality. I am ecstatic to be a part of this talented group and the newest addition to the USL Championship.

It was a rough night, but in the end it was clear that it was more about politics and other factors than soccer, and unfortunately that’s what this town is known for, making things not happen, and we saw that up close</p>

  <p>I think when I had kids, my mentality changed. I come from a family of teachers. And so, more than coaching or managing, I really like teaching and helping people sort of get to the next step … I was naive at first thinking I’d like to kind of run the soccer side and be the coach<br /><br /><b>[Carrie Taylor, believed to be the first female coach of an American men’s pro soccer team, will serve as one of Donovan’s assistants]</b> Carrie is the most qualified person on our staff<br /><br /><b>[So what kind of manger will Donovan be?]</b> I don’t envision myself running every training session by myself à la Pep <b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>]</b> or <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, who are very hands on. For me, there’s more benefit in stepping back and seeing the big picture. That’s what I was good at as a player. I knew what to do, where to be. I don’t know how to coach that<br /><br />One thing that I think is probably most important at the professional level is communication. Players would always say, I don’t care if I’m not starting, or I’m not in the 18, or you want to cut me. Just tell me to my face and be honest. So many coaches dance around it and in the end you get resentment because of that. And so what I want to be is direct and honest but with compassion, understanding that this is their livelihood. Especially at the USL level, <b>[if]</b> you’re making 30 grand a year, it’s a big deal if you’re not starting if you have a $500 bonus<br /><br /><b>[The fact that Donovan was an elite player]</b> means nothing, except that you have credibility and respect initially. You can lose that really fast <b>[Without naming him, he mentions the experience of working under former Ballon d’Or winner <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Ruud Gullit</a> in L.A]</b> He was a terrible, terrible coach. Terrible. Maybe the worst I had. So it doesn’t mean anything<br /><br />Being aware of that is the starting point. And then the second piece is, and this is just crazy the way the world works, as painful and as hard as 2014 was, it gave me compassion that I never had before. It allowed me to see that not everyone makes the team. Not everyone’s the star, people get cut or don’t make the roster. Being able to go to someone and say, ‘I know what that’s like’ and not, ‘Oh, that must suck,’ is so valuable<br /><br /><b>[What happens if things go sideways?]</b> The beauty of being in this position - although in some ways you could say it’s really awkward to be an executive and an owner and a coach - is that I have the big picture in mind. And if we’re bad, and I’m really bad at this, I’ll step out of the way. And it would hurt. But if I’m not good at it, I shouldn’t be doing it. That’s just the reality. And I have no issue with that<br /><br />Every day with your kids, you’re managing and coaching them. And you’re teaching them. You’re being very deliberate about what you say, how and when you say it. I don’t always get it right. Sometimes I blow up. But you try to be very intentional with your words. I like that. That’s fun for me, to see them connect with something you say in a real way. Now I have the opportunity to do it to 25 young people, not just these three at home</p>
