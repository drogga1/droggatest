  <p><b>[Landon Donovan on why he committed his long-term to Los Angeles Galaxy]</b> I think we’re seeing a little bit of a tipping point right now. When you have a guy like Clint Dempsey, with all that he’s done and the player that he is, wanting to be in our league, it makes a big statement. You look at someone like <a href="robbie-keane.html">Robbie Keane</a>, who I think we can all agree could play anywhere in the world, and he has decided to come here. Everybody wants to be here. When a guy like <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> comes here and leaves, now I speak to players in Europe, and they say, ‘Gosh, David couldn’t stop raving about what a wonderful place the <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> is.’ So I love being here. I love playing here. I get to play in front of my family. We have a beautiful stadium here at StubHub Center. We have wonderful fans. We’re a successful team</p>

  <p><b>[Landon Donovan on the possibility of a coaching career in the future]</b> Just in the last month I’ve talked a lot to my agent and my wife about starting to get the itch to coach. What all of us want to do when we get out of the game is we want to have the ability to go back and make an impact and help others. I didn’t have anybody at 16, 17, 18, 19 that was telling me what to do or how to react or how to act in certain situations and I wish I would have had that. I want to have the ability to impact people in that way and to affect change in a positive way, and I think I have a lot to give in that way</p>

  <p><b>[Former USA international Landon Donovan reveals why he made the decision to come out of retirement and re-join his former club <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> for the remainder of the 2016 <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> season]</b> Since my retirement, I have remained in close contact with many of the staff and players on the <b>[LA]</b> Galaxy. I spoke with some of them and they jokingly asked if I was ready to make a return to the field to help fill some of the void left by injuries and departures. I reminded them that I haven’t played a meaningful soccer game in almost two years and I certainly couldn’t fill the holes left by those players. Over the ensuing days, I began to think about their inquiries and it struck me that perhaps this is something I should consider</p>

  <p><b>[Landon Donovan comes out of retirement to sign for Liga MX side Club Leon]</b> It’s not going to happen. When I decide in my mind that I want to do something, I do it. Almost without realising it as I got into my teens, I played with a distinct style different from other Americans and I never really understood why until I really started to analyse it and realised that I grew up playing with Mexicans and Latinos. I didn’t know any other style of football. I was born in Southern California, I grew up talking and playing with Mexicans and it’s part of my soul</p>

  <p><b>[Landon Donovan has been announced as the Executive Vice President for Soccer Operations for a USL Championship franchise that has been awarded to San Diego]</b> I chose San Diego as my home and have personally been focused on bringing professional soccer to the community. Thanks to Warren, USL and our incredible team, that dream has become reality. I am ecstatic to be a part of this talented group and the newest addition to the USL Championship. I’m looking forward to our Opening Night in Torero Stadium and the stands being filled with smiles, chants and cheers from my fellow residents of America’s Finest City.<br /><br /><b>[Donovan was a major voice in trying to bring MLS to San Diego, but those efforts fell apart last November when Measure E, the so-called SoccerCity initiative, was soundly beaten by a competing stadium project led by San Diego State University]</b> We got beat up pretty quickly, pretty early on, and that was pretty hard to swallow. It was a rough night, but in the end it was clear that it was more about politics and other factors than soccer, and unfortunately that’s what this town is known for, making things not happen, and we saw that up close</p>

  <p>I think when I had kids, my mentality changed. I come from a family of teachers. And so, more than coaching or managing, I really like teaching and helping people sort of get to the next step … I was naive at first thinking I’d like to kind of run the soccer side and be the coach<br /><br /><b>[Carrie Taylor, believed to be the first female coach of an American men’s pro soccer team, will serve as one of Donovan’s assistants]</b> Carrie is the most qualified person on our staff<br /><br /><b>[So what kind of manger will Donovan be?]</b> I don’t envision myself running every training session by myself à la Pep <b>[Guardiola]</b> or <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, who are very hands on. For me, there’s more benefit in stepping back and seeing the big picture. That’s what I was good at as a player. I knew what to do, where to be. I don’t know how to coach that<br /><br />One thing that I think is probably most important at the professional level is communication. Players would always say, I don’t care if I’m not starting, or I’m not in the 18, or you want to cut me. Just tell me to my face and be honest. So many coaches dance around it and in the end you get resentment because of that. And so what I want to be is direct and honest but with compassion, understanding that this is their livelihood. Especially at the USL level, <b>[if]</b> you’re making 30 grand a year, it’s a big deal if you’re not starting if you have a $500 bonus<br /><br /><b>[The fact that Donovan was an elite player]</b> means nothing, except that you have credibility and respect initially. You can lose that really fast <b>[Without naming him, he mentions the experience of working under former Ballon d’Or winner <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Ruud Gullit</a> in L.A]</b> He was a terrible, terrible coach. Terrible. Maybe the worst I had. So it doesn’t mean anything<br /><br />Being aware of that is the starting point. And then the second piece is, and this is just crazy the way the world works, as painful and as hard as 2014 was, it gave me compassion that I never had before. It allowed me to see that not everyone makes the team. Not everyone’s the star, people get cut or don’t make the roster. Being able to go to someone and say, ‘I know what that’s like’ and not, ‘Oh, that must suck,’ is so valuable<br /><br /><b>[What happens if things go sideways?]</b> The beauty of being in this position - although in some ways you could say it’s really awkward to be an executive and an owner and a coach - is that I have the big picture in mind. And if we’re bad, and I’m really bad at this, I’ll step out of the way. And it would hurt. But if I’m not good at it, I shouldn’t be doing it. That’s just the reality. And I have no issue with that<br /><br />Every day with your kids, you’re managing and coaching them. And you’re teaching them. You’re being very deliberate about what you say, how and when you say it. I don’t always get it right. Sometimes I blow up. But you try to be very intentional with your words. I like that. That’s fun for me, to see them connect with something you say in a real way. Now I have the opportunity to do it to 25 young people, not just these three at home</p>
