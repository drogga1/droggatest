  <p><b>[Landon Donovan on why he committed his long-term to Los Angeles Galaxy]</b> I think we’re seeing a little bit of a tipping point right now. When you have a guy like Clint Dempsey, with all that he’s done and the player that he is, wanting to be in our league, it makes a big statement. You look at someone like <a href="robbie-keane.html">Robbie Keane</a>, who I think we can all agree could play anywhere in the world, and he has decided to come here. Everybody wants to be here. When a guy like <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> comes here and leaves, now I speak to players in Europe, and they say, ‘Gosh, David couldn’t stop raving about what a wonderful place the <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> is.’ So I love being here. I love playing here. I get to play in front of my family. We have a beautiful stadium here at StubHub Center. We have wonderful fans. We’re a successful team</p>

What all of us want to do when we get out of the game is we want to have the ability to go back and make an impact and help others. I didn’t have anybody at 16, 17, 18, 19 that was telling me what to do or how to react or how to act in certain situations and I wish I would have had that. I want to have the ability to impact people in that way and to affect change in a positive way, and I think I have a lot to give in that way</p>

I spoke with some of them and they jokingly asked if I was ready to make a return to the field to help fill some of the void left by injuries and departures. I reminded them that I haven’t played a meaningful soccer game in almost two years and I certainly couldn’t fill the holes left by those players. Over the ensuing days, I began to think about their inquiries and it struck me that perhaps this is something I should consider</p>

  <p><b>[San Diego’s rise to MLS expansion favorite will come down to public vote]</b> Growing up, I knew it as a youth soccer market, but I didn’t realize how many adults without kids love soccer in this town. We had a viewing party for the World Cup final in downtown, there were 13,000 people that showed up. Most of those people were fans of other MLS teams, of European teams, of South American teams. There’s just this crazy melting pot of people who love soccer. Then when the ratings came out after the World Cup, San Diego was the number one market for the World Cup final in the States and the number five market overall. We have more people in this city watch Major League Soccer than in any other city, and we don’t even have a team. When you calculate that, plus the proximity to the border, and the five or six thousand people who cross the border every Friday or Saturday to watch the Xolos play, you realize pretty quickly San Diego is a massive soccer town.<br /><br />I didn’t realize that this was going to be such a political process. You would think that if somebody wants to privately fund a massive development and stadium that it should be a no-brainer, but it’s been anything but easy. I figured the league wanted to be in San Diego, which I believe they do. I just didn’t think that the local politics would be what they were. It was a little naive of me, because if you see what happened in St. Louis, and what happened in Miami, you realize that none of these things are slam dunks. So even though you have the fastest-growing sport in the country, there’s still this old-school thinking that soccer’s not going to make it. Older people who don’t really understand soccer don’t understand how valuable the sport can be for a city. You see what’s happened in Portland, you see what’s happened in Orlando. How Toronto has galvanized that city. I think people just don’t really understand it because they’re looking at it through their old-school soccer lens<br /><br />Anybody you talk to in San Diego says ‘Yeah, I would love an MLS team, and I’d buy season tickets immediately’, but the way to get that is they have to vote. Getting people out to vote for something is a whole different animal. Particularly in a mid-term election, when not as many people get out to vote. That becomes a challenge, but that’s been our challenge and one we’ve taken on. In the end the beauty of all this is people can educate themselves, hopefully, and they get to vote. When you have a public vote you can’t complain because the people have the chance to decide</p>

  <p><b>[San Diego’s MLS expansion hopes take major hit after losing vote on stadium project]</b> We got beat up pretty quickly, pretty early on, and that was pretty hard to swallow.<br /><br />I can’t speak for our owners, but I think it would be devastating for this city to not have a Major League Soccer team, but there’s so many factors that go into it. I don’t know if the investors here will have the appetite to go through this again and try to figure something out. I don’t know how much they’re willing to put up with again. They got dragged through the mud quite a bit in this process. If it was as simple as, ‘Do we want an MLS team and do we want to do something like that for the city?’ I think that’d be an easy answer for everyone. But unfortunately these things are more complicated than that and I don’t know if they want to go through that again</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic has a £58 million move to Chelsea in place]</b> Candidly, I am a little worried and I think American fans should be a little bit. I understand the situation at Dortmund now; they are not going to play a player who is leaving in six months. The beauty of the situation with Christian is that he, by all accounts and from what I have seen, has a really good head on his shoulders, likes to compete and is oozing with talent.<br /><br />From that standpoint it should be fine but what happens if you go to Chelsea, who fortunately for him have a two-window transfer ban, but have a bunch of other talented players and he doesn’t get a chance to play. He is now either 20 or approaching 20 and needs to be playing games so that could be concerning. It is hard to turn down the allure of going to somewhere like Chelsea but it’s the same argument I’ve made since I was 20 years old, when people ridiculed me for leaving <b>[Bundesliga side Bayer]</b> Leverkusen, if you are not playing games at that age, you are getting worse<br /><br />I just hope that he gets a fair opportunity to play. You just never know with a manager. When you’re playing in America, for a club in America, you get the benefit of the doubt. But when you’re playing somewhere else, they don’t care if you’re from America or Ghana or Argentina, they are going to play who they think should play. So, he’s got to prove he belongs there, which I’m hoping and guessing he will do, but it’s going to be difficult. That’s a club that’s full of quality attacking players</p>

  <p>I think when I had kids, my mentality changed. I come from a family of teachers. And so, more than coaching or managing, I really like teaching and helping people sort of get to the next step … I was naive at first thinking I’d like to kind of run the soccer side and be the coach<br /><br /><b>[Carrie Taylor, believed to be the first female coach of an American men’s pro soccer team, will serve as one of Donovan’s assistants]</b> Carrie is the most qualified person on our staff<br /><br /><b>[So what kind of manger will Donovan be?]</b> I don’t envision myself running every training session by myself à la Pep <b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>]</b> or <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, who are very hands on. For me, there’s more benefit in stepping back and seeing the big picture. That’s what I was good at as a player. I knew what to do, where to be. I don’t know how to coach that<br /><br />One thing that I think is probably most important at the professional level is communication. Players would always say, I don’t care if I’m not starting, or I’m not in the 18, or you want to cut me. Just tell me to my face and be honest. So many coaches dance around it and in the end you get resentment because of that. And so what I want to be is direct and honest but with compassion, understanding that this is their livelihood. Especially at the USL level, <b>[if]</b> you’re making 30 grand a year, it’s a big deal if you’re not starting if you have a $500 bonus<br /><br /><b>[The fact that Donovan was an elite player]</b> means nothing, except that you have credibility and respect initially. You can lose that really fast <b>[Without naming him, he mentions the experience of working under former Ballon d’Or winner <a href="ruud-gullit.html">Ruud Gullit</a> in L.A]</b> He was a terrible, terrible coach. Terrible. Maybe the worst I had. So it doesn’t mean anything<br /><br />Being aware of that is the starting point. And then the second piece is, and this is just crazy the way the world works, as painful and as hard as 2014 was, it gave me compassion that I never had before. It allowed me to see that not everyone makes the team. Not everyone’s the star, people get cut or don’t make the roster. Being able to go to someone and say, ‘I know what that’s like’ and not, ‘Oh, that must suck,’ is so valuable<br /><br /><b>[What happens if things go sideways?]</b> The beauty of being in this position - although in some ways you could say it’s really awkward to be an executive and an owner and a coach - is that I have the big picture in mind. And if we’re bad, and I’m really bad at this, I’ll step out of the way. And it would hurt. But if I’m not good at it, I shouldn’t be doing it. That’s just the reality. And I have no issue with that<br /><br />Every day with your kids, you’re managing and coaching them. And you’re teaching them. You’re being very deliberate about what you say, how and when you say it. I don’t always get it right. Sometimes I blow up. But you try to be very intentional with your words. I like that. That’s fun for me, to see them connect with something you say in a real way. Now I have the opportunity to do it to 25 young people, not just these three at home</p>
