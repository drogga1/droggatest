  <p><b>[Barry Lewtas ready to follow in Steven Gerrard’s footsteps with Liverpool’s U18 side]</b> He sent a text saying ‘best of luck, please pass on my best wishes to the lads. The following day, Liverpool stuffed Sunderland 6-1. The perfect start.<br /><br />I can safely say I wasn’t as good a player as him! Steven did a fantastic job last year. The style of football they played was great to watch and it was good to be around. The U-16s and U-18s follow suit so wherever they went, we went. I wasn’t in it but I was around it in terms of the travel and being around the dressing room before and after games. You are quite close-knit and towards the back end of the season Steven used quite a few of the under-16s. Of course they are huge boots to fill. Firstly, because of who he is but also because he proved himself to be a top quality coach. He did a really good job. I am never going to match his reputation. He put a real good stamp on the team and I need to ensure that I do the same<br /><br /><b>[Reflecting on his first weeks in the role]</b> I am really enjoying it. Obviously it helps that I’ve worked with a lot of the lads before. I know them well, they know me and know what gets on my nerves! Having relationships like that already helps. I’m well aware that the level does go up. What was maybe okay out on the back pitch at U-16s last season, those boys are really going to have to raise the bar in the U-18s. They are under no illusions. I certainly wouldn’t say it’s a case of just carrying on doing the same, we’ve had to crank it up. The first year scholars would be the first to admit that it’s been tough physically. They are full-time now so they are training more often and have gym sessions in the afternoons. They are here all day so it is tougher for them<br /><br />I needed to pay my way. A friend of mine was getting into coaching and I started doing my badges too. It went on from there. I was doing soccer schools and then I was fortunate enough to get a role at Wigan. As soon as I got in there I realised this was something I wanted to do, more so than kick a ball around. It kind of snowballed. I spent five or six years at Wigan, five or six years at Bolton and then I came here in 2013. It was when the current first years <b>[in the U-18s]</b> were U-12s. I was working with the U-12s initially and then it was full-time looking after the 10s, 11s and 12s. Then I moved into the 15s and then the 16s. Now this. It’s been good. Every move has been a step up. It’s been a long journey, no wonder my hair has gone! But I certainly feel like I’m ready for this opportunity<br /><br /><b>[On Curtis Jones]</b> It was great for Curt. He’s been given an opportunity. He’s gone up there, he’s got to travel and he’s got to learn a bit more about what’s required at that level. He’s a cracking kid. I’ve known Curtis a long time and worked with him at under-15 level. It’s nice when you see kids grow up and flourish, and it was really pleasing to watch him in pre-season. He’s had a fantastic experience this summer but he would be the first to say that it’s just a start. Now he’s had a smell of it, he will be really keen to push on and impress over the course of this season<br /><br /><b>[Duncan, of course, is the cousin of a certain Steven Gerrard]</b> There’s no fanfare around him, he’s just another one of the lads. Bobby has done well at Academy level and has scored goals. He will be keen to pass the next test of his development which is U-18s level and work as hard as he can to get to the U-23s. We are really excited to have him here. He’s really added to the group - both on and off the pitch. It’s important for him to knuckle down and we’ll see where he goes from there<br /><br /><b>[A first home game of the season at Kirkby against Manchester United]</b> It’s a brilliant first home game. There’s always a buzz when you play United - even if it’s at U-9s, it’s special. sThe lads are really excited. We’ve had a good pre-season and we played some really good stuff against Sunderland so it’s important we carry that on. I’m excited. It’s a tough one picking a team but we’ll be ready for it</p>

  <p><b>[Why Ki-Jana Hoever’s rise is set to inspire <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s talented young stars]</b> I am enjoying being part of it and I’m privileged to lead the team in it. We want to win it and we’ll go full at it. It does carry a lot of prestige, and I’m looking forward to the challenge.<br /><br /><b>[Even better that <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a> and Rafa Camacho, 17 and 18 respectively, made their senior bows in the same game. Lewtas, of course, worked with both during his spell as under-16s coach]</b> It’s a big motivation for us coaches, to be working with players that could end up being required by the first team. And it must be a big motivation for the boys as well when they see their peers being asked to go up and train or play<br /><br />We were in the airport on the way back from a tournament in Germany before the <b>[<a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>]</b> game, and few of the boys were speaking to <a href="ali-curtis.html">Curtis</a> on FaceTime. They are team-mates, but they’re also friends. We certainly use it in terms of showing them that there is a pathway here. If you train hard, if you perform and get the opportunity to go to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> then you need to take that chance. The boys who have gone up there have certainly impressed. If you are capable of doing that the manager will keep you there and work with you.<br /><br /><b>[with <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s defensive options decimated by injury over the Christmas period, there was no hesitation in sending the teenager up to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> to train. There, Hoever held his own against the likes of <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, earning himself a chance when <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> rotated for the cup]</b> We flew back from Germany so I had to rush home to watch the game. I got in just in time. And when <b>[Dejan]</b> <a href="dejan-lovren.html">Lovren</a> got injured and the camera panned to Trent <b>[<a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a>]</b>, I thought ‘interesting, Trent playing centre back?’ Then I saw Ki-Jana put his top on, it was like ‘wow!’<br /><br /><b>[So what did he make of his performance?]</b> Listen, I can’t lay claim to Ki-Jana because he hasn’t been here that long but I was nervous, especially when he started taking everyone on!. Basically, you don’t want him to fail on the things you’ve worked with him on in training!<br /><br />But I thought he showed an awful lot of composure against an experienced team. He was very mature and did ever so well.<br /><br />It’s great. Wherever you work, if someone gets a promotion, you’re chuffed for them, as long as they aren’t taking your spot! I’m made up for all three of them. <a href="ali-curtis.html">Curtis</a> has been here an extremely long time. To walk in here at the age of seven or eight and then pull on the shirt for the first team was great for him.<br /><br />It was nice to speak to Ki-Jana’s dad in Holland and hear how happy he was. There’s a real feel-good factor when it happens</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool starlet Paul Glatzel signs first professional contract]</b> He’s had real tough luck with injuries, but hopefully that’s behind him now. He had a double leg-break having a kickabout with his mates when he was 15, which obviously set him back. We think the world of him here, and to have those setbacks at the time he did, it was really tough for him. He’s bounced back brilliantly this season.</p>

  <p><b>[Barry Lewtas’ under-18s will be looking to become the first Reds side to reach the final of the FA Youth Cup in a decade]</b> It’s great isn’t it? It gives them a taste of the dressing room, and we’re really excited about the pitch. There will be no excuses in that regard, we need to be on it, we need to play the way we know we can. It’s a perfect surface, big pitch against a good team who will try and press the life out of us. We’re really excited. I’m sure the lads will have families there watching, and it’ll be a real proud moment.<br /><br />Without overstating it, it’s very similar to the first team. The game against Bayern Munich was huge, they win it and they kick on again. We have got to try and ride that wave, embrace the tough game, a semi-final at Anfield. We’re not downplaying it. We’ve got to go all guns blazing for this one, and the remainder of our league games as well. A lot of the boys are used to these big games. They play European games, international games for their countries. They’re not wet behind the ears, and that’s something we need to use to our advantage at Anfield on Sunday. We try and expose them to big games. We’re not complacent, but we hope we’ve prepared them enough throughout the Academy. But I agree the FA Youth Cup is that tournament that carries something a little bit more special<br /><br />I’m really pleased for Rhys. He’s really earned his way in there. He’s shown good potential. I remember showing him a video for him on his heading, and it had all his old clips from when he was 15. He wouldn’t want me to show you any of them! He’d want them archived! But look at him now, and the hard work he’s put in. It’s not by chance. He was always taller than everyone, but look at him now, he’s fully worthy of his call-up and his chance. I’ve had a chat with him and he’s really excited. He’s had a pro contract, a bit of under-23s exposure and done well, and at under-18s and under-19s level he’s been really strong. He’s one of those players that we’ll look back on at the end of the season and think ‘what a good story’. There are a few of them. Look at Paul’s resurgence after all those injuries, Bobby’s start to a new club, Rhys, big Vite <b>[Jaros]</b> in goal, Yasser <b>[Larouci]</b> at left-back. There’s time to reflect at the end of the season, but Rhys’ call-up is another one to show we’ve had a good year<br /><br />We’ve done some analysis, we know the teams they have beaten. We watched the game against Leicester and they’re a good team. A lot of their boys play under-23s so we know they’ll be able to cope physically, they’ll be tough. Leicester are a real good team and they beat them in extra time. We’re preparing to play against the best team we’ve faced. I don’t think that approach has done us wrong so far. We know who their good players are, they’re a good team<br /><br />It’d be great if they could. The more we get there, the better. It adds to the experience. In Zagreb, there were 3,500 there and it sounded like 6,000. It was frightening, really loud, it echoed and it was really nice. There were moments where we controlled the game and you could hear a pin drop. It was like a proper European game. It was a proper European experience. It’d be great if we could create something like that at Anfield. The boys will have their families there of course, but the more people who can get down and support, I’m sure the lads would like that, definitely</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool under-18s coach Lewtas relishing Manchester City Youth Cup challenge]</b> It was a Premier League qualifier. It was on the back pitch at Kirkby and we lost to City. I think Bobby Duncan scored two but he says he scored three! Whatever it was, it was a heavy defeat to a very good City side. We sat down afterwards and we said that this was the start for us, we had to build from there.<br /><br />The City games were always benchmarks for us. All the way through under-15s and under-16s, they were THE game. And we got closer and closer and closer, and then when we got to under-16s the tables started to turn slightly and the games became a lot more competitive. I think it’s quite fitting that it’s City in the final. I feel sort of like it was meant to be. But I hope I’m saying that after the final!<br /><br /><b>[Duncan’s celebration that day spoke of his feeling towards his former club]</b> Yeah, it probably will be something I think about. You don’t want him to get caught up in the occasion, we want him to play the football he has played so far this season. There will certainly be a reminder to him and a few words, but he’s been here long enough now to be fine. Earlier in the season, he hadn’t been here that long. It’ll be a little word in his ear and away we go<br /><br /><b>[The Reds were disappointed with the scheduling of the game]</b> It was definitely disappointing. We went to Dallas for a whole host of reasons. We played in the Cotton Bowl in front of 20,000 people in the first game which was a great experience, but we had lots of cultural and charity stuff over there too, and it was a shame that we had to cut that short. We were disappointed, but the game is on now and that’s the main thing. It’s all part of the experience. The day we returned from Dallas, if we’d have had to play a Youth Cup final the following night, I don’t think that would have been right. I was tired myself, and you could see the lads were. Now we’re back and in the swing of things, I feel like I’ve been back for weeks. It’s done and dusted now and we’re just concentrating on the game. But it was a concern, definitely<br /><br /><b>[The fact that the game will be played at City’s Academy Stadium]</b> We have spoken about that. It is an away game. I do agree that the Youth Cup Final should go to one leg because there are no other two-legged finals in senior football, so it is good for the boys to get used to a one-off final. That is the right thing to do. Whether it should be played at someone’s home stadium, I am not completely convinced. The team they will put out on Thursday, a lot of them play under-23s football and that is their home pitch. It would be unwise for us not to prepare the boys for an away game. It will be a full house. A lot more Man City fans there. We have built it up that way, we are looking forward to the challenge of going into their backyard. Would it make it sweeter? You would have to ask the lads that. My job is just to prepare them. There is a nice rivalry between the two groups, a long-standing rivalry. A little bit more needle there, little bit of competitiveness. It will be exciting<br /><br />The message this week has been about not settling on reaching the final, not being content being second in the league. I think if you want to play here that is not enough. If you go back to the first team then second place is not what they are playing for. They are trying to win the league and the Champions League, and that is very much the message here: don’t settle, don’t be happy that you have got to a final. That is not the club you are at. We are in the final and we have to do our best to win and not fall short. That is definitely the message. We will not be a tourist there and think City are better than us. We’re going there to win</p>

  <p><b>[On Vitezslav Jaros]</b> An unsung hero, in my view. He’s been brilliant. We play in an open way, and he’s made some big saves in games. He’s a good lad, he came in as an under-16, his English is good - in fact, he speaks with a Scouse accent now. He certainly swears with one! It’s funny, hearing this Czech Scouser! But Taff <b>[Mark Morris, the goalkeeping coach]</b> has done a great job with him and I think Vite plays a big part in the style we play with. He works hard, he’s been a real plus and there’s more to come. He’s a very good goalkeeper. He’s had an ankle injury recently, which kept him out of the semi-final, but he’s back now and ready to go</p>

  <p><b>[on Jack Walls]</b> He’s been here since he was a boy, under-8s. He’s moved position a lot. I remember moving him to left-back as an under-15, when before that he was more of an attacking midfielder. Now, we’re looking at him more inside, as a centre-back. He’s grown, he’s got a nice physical stature, he can head a ball well. He’s comfortable on the ball and quite aggressive in his defending too. He had glandular fever last year and missed a lot of football, but he’s done well for us this term</p>

  <p><b>[on Tom Clayton]</b> He’s recovering from ankle ligament surgery, so he won’t be playing on Thursday. He’s a bit of an unsung character in our team; we miss him massively when he doesn’t play. He’s comfortable in possession, passes the ball well into midfield, and behind the scenes he’s a bit of a leader as well. He’s very sensible, and when it comes to big moments he plays properly. He’s a real trustworthy player, which when it comes to a centre-back is really important. He understands his game, what he can and can’t do, and it allows him to make good decisions. He’s from St Helens and he’s a big rugby fan, goes to all the Super League games, so when we play games at their stadium he gets a bit giddy!</p>

He’s a big Preston fan, and he has been at the club a long time. He’s good in the air, a side of his game that has really developed over the past year or two, and he helps us build and play because he wants to pass the ball. He has the physical attributes, and his talking on the field has come on a lot. He’s worked really hard on that. He’s knuckled down and done really well and recently had his first call-up to the England under-17 squad, which was great for him</p>

His grasp of the language has improved hugely, he’s worked hard at it, and you can see he’s more confident as a result. He was a wide player when he came, but this year we’ve just wanted to have a look at him at left-back, because we think he has the attributes. He’s got great athleticism, he runs into space well, he carries the ball and he gives us great width. He was a bit sceptical at the time, but as time has gone on I think you can see he’s enjoying it. We look at him as a little success story this season</p>

  <p><b>[on Leighton Clarkson]</b> He’s a good footballer, whether he plays as a No.6 or a line higher. He passes forwards, switches play, takes set-pieces, he has great technique. He was a prolific scorer from midfielder in his schoolboy years. He came from Blackburn as an under-7, when he was spotted playing for his local side Clitheroe Wolves. He was training with both Manchester United and Blackburn, his boyhood team, but chose Liverpool as the best place to develop. Seeing the likes of Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher obviously influenced his decision too. Jake Cain is his big mate and they play in midfield together. He’s had a good season, we lost a lot of creativity with Curtis Jones going up to the under-23s and the seniors, but Leighton has taken some of that on, even if he does it through passing more than dribbling. He captained the side at under-15 and under-16 level and has lifted a few trophies along the way.</p>

He’s from Essex, so he likes his clothes and all that! He tries to make out he’s a tough Londoner but he’s not fooling me! He’s a nice boy, a bit of an all-rounder. He’s still finding his identity as a midfielder but he’s done well</p>

  <p><b>[On Jack Bearne]</b> He’s had real tough luck with injuries, but hopefully that’s behind him now. He had a double leg-break having a kickabout with his mates when he was 15, which obviously set him back. We think the world of him here, and to have those setbacks at the time he did, it was really tough for him. He’s bounced back brilliantly this season. He and Bobby have got 59 goals between them, which you can’t knock really, can you! But aside from the goalscoring, he is unselfish and he gets as much joy out of creating. He’s captained the team this season and it’s brought out real leadership qualities. He’s a well-respected member of the group. A fluent German speaker, because his mum and dad are from there. He lives up near Wigan and he’s a big Wigan Athletic fan. He and a few of the lads go to the games when they can</p>

  <p><b>[On Fidel O’Rourke]</b> He’s a real trustworthy No.9. You know what you’ll get from him, he’ll run in behind, he’ll link the play and he’s a pest to play against. He has a knack of being in between the posts to score tap-ins, or the ugly goals if you like. He’s a real good character, too. He’s had the armband, and he sets the example of how to behave off the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[On Bobby Duncan]</b> He’s done great, to be fair to him. He’s come in and scored goals, as I suspected he would. He’s had to adapt and fit in, and fair play, he’s worked his socks off. He had a tough pre-season, where he was in the pool and he was running and he was barely on the field, but we needed to get those fitness levels up. And since the first day, he’s worked hard and scored goals. He’s a real good striker of the ball and he scores all types of goal, plus he’s really opened up as to the parts of his game that need to improve. He and Paul <b>[Glatzel]</b> have been outstanding together</p>

  <p><b>[Barry Lewtas’s side beat Manchester City on penalties]</b> I said during the week that I’d be over the moon for the boys, and I am. I said to Curtis <b>[Jones]</b> when he came to celebrate with the boys, what about all those years over on pitch five at Kirkby when we’d take a hammering against City? That was where it all started for us. When you’re in the journey for so long, you can’t help but be over the moon for those players. They deserve it. They’re a great set of lads and they never quite know when they are beaten. I’m biased because I work with the boys, but the amount of days and hours we’ve been in - they never have a day off. They have worked ever so hard, and maybe it was just one of those things that was meant to be tonight. But I’m going to say that! I think it was fitting that we could beat City at the end. I thought it was a fantastic final which both teams played their part in. But for us the journey, if you like, has come to an end there</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> U18 coach Barry Lewtas introduces the class of 2019]</b> Yeah, you get goals when you watch us!. It’s a good start, but still loads to do<br /><br /><b>[In addition, Lewtas’ assistant, Scott Mason, has joined <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> up at Rangers. Jonathan Robinson is his replacement. Much has changed, even if the demands of the role haven’t]</b> That’s the job. It’s an exciting part of the job because there’s no complacency there. You turn back up on July 1 and you have to go again with a new team, a new group. You have to start creating that environment, those day to day habits all over again. The aim is the same, just as it was last year. The aim was to get as many players as we could up to the under-23s, and that doesn’t change. We’re here to provide for Critch, and then Critch hopefully provides for the first team<br /><br /><b>[The likes of <a href="rhian-brewster.html">Rhian Brewster</a>, <a href="harvey-elliott.html">Harvey Elliott</a>, <a href="sepp-van-den-berg.html">Sepp van den Berg</a>, Ki-Jana Hoever, <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a> and Adam Lewis - all 19 or younger - are on the cusp of the first team, while Yasser Larouci and <a href="bobby-duncan.html">Bobby Duncan</a> picked up senior experience during pre-season, heading to America with <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s first team. Lewtas watched their progress with interest]</b> I was more nervous then than I was for the Youth Cup final!<br /><br /><b>[Lewtas has also been encouraged by what he has seen from his other first-year scholars]</b> Layton is the one who has scored a few goals and got a bit of attention. He’s a Huyton lad who has been with us a long time. He’s hit the ground running, which for any No.9 is ideal, it’s what you want to do. For us, the journey is a long one. There are plenty of parts he needs to improve, but in fairness to him he’s been attentive, he’s bought in from day one and he’s listening every day. That’s paying dividends so far, and hopefully that continues. Elsewhere, we’ve a new centre-back in Billy Koumetio, who is a really good personality. He’s really strong in terms of how he wants to defend, with aggression on the front foot. And he wants to get better, which is important when you’re adding new players into groups. You’d think he’d been here for years and his performances have been really good<br /><br />James Norris is another local lad, West Derby boy, and he’s started the season well. He plays left-back and midfield, a real all-action player, very dynamic and industrious, but he can be very creative as well with his energy and driving forward. He’s started the season well. Tom Hill is an old-fashioned box-to-box midfield player who has scored a few goals too. He reaps his rewards for running forward, because he doesn’t stop. Credit to him, he’s contributing with goals and assists, affecting games at both ends of the pitch. The same goes for James Balagizi, who is more of a midfielder but has been playing a bit as a loose No.9 alongside Layton. They bounced through the door on the opening day and haven’t looked back<br /><br /><b>[about outcomes and processes]</b> It’s a balance. How can I tell the boys that trophies don’t matter, when they’re thinking about a final on national TV, or a semi-final at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> or trips abroad in the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Youth League? The lads want to prove they can compete and win. But for me, it’s about the environment you create, day in and day out. It’s about the standards we set in training, and how that enables the boys to develop. We’re here to build good footballers and good people, and if they can win things on the way, then all the better</p>

  <p><b>[Barry Lewtas believes the consistency and technical quality of Leighton Clarkson is behind the youngster’s recent call-up to the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> senior side]</b> It <b>[his call-up]</b> could be a mixture of a number of things really. Leighton has been consistently good for a season and has carried it on this year. He is technically a good player, which always helps when you are stepping up to that environment where the level is extremely high as it helps you survive. The communication between Alex <b>[<a href="alex-inglethorpe.html">Inglethorpe</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s Academy director]</b> at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> and the pathway from the Academy is there, they are watching games and seeing consistent performances from Leighton and how he conducts himself and how professional he is, and they’ve seen enough to get him up there. Once he’s up there, it’s up to him. And obviously he’s done okay. He will train there in morning and he’ll come back here and he’s in the gym with the lads in the afternoon, it’s not like they go there and that’s it. They still do their work at the Academy as well. They are probably desperate to come back and tell everyone stories to be honest!<br /><br /><b>[Jones is likely to captain the team, and Lewtas says that, like <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a>, he has been encouraged by the way in which the young Scouser has stepped up his game of late]</b> Inside the Academy we have to realise that sometimes young lads do makes mistakes and have to learn from them. In this environment you have to learn quickly. <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a> was captain in Naples and I was impressed by how mature and responsible he was, not just on the pitch but around the place. He was a leader when we were there. If the senior professionals, like Milner, have noticed a change, then that’s really good. That’s part of growing up. His form for Critch <b>[under-23s boss <a href="neil-critchley.html">Neil Critchley</a>]</b> has been a positive. The standard of players, especially the attacking ones at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a>, surely has to serve as motivation, not just for <a href="ali-curtis.html">Curtis</a> but for all the youngsters. We are in a fortunate position where the group is so close-knit. <a href="ali-curtis.html">Curtis</a> plays for the first team, gets man of the match, then a few days later scores twice for the U23s. He’ll be desperate to play on Wednesday. Fantastic week for him, it’s only good for his development<br /><br /><b>[On <a href="harvey-elliott.html">Harvey Elliott</a>, whose performance against MK Dons was eye-catching]</b> Harvey is in here quite a bit. He’s a nice kid. You sometimes forget he is only 16, he’s a young boy. He’s polite and seems a nice kid. But when he plays, he seems to have a real maturity and confidence in his performance</p>

  <p><b>[Barry Lewtas says Norris and Hill head latest group of Academy stars]</b> It’s a very good group. It’ll be exciting to see if they can hit the ground running. I’m definitely looking forward to seeing how they develop. You can judge a season in different ways. From the outside, people may say we went out of the Youth Cup early and we were so many points behind <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in the league, but it’s not just about that<br /><br /><b>[Tom Hill started the game and the Formby-based forward’s development has been particularly eye-catching]</b> It’s been a really good season for him. Tom was in my team at Under-12s, and then at the back end of last year, just before the Youth Cup final, we travelled to America for the Dallas Cup. Tom and Layton Stewart came with us. He played against New York City. It was their Under-19 team and we basically played an under-17 side, but Tom was brilliant. He really impressed me that day with his attitude and commitment, and when he came back for pre-season, he carried that on. He’s very coachable, his attitude is spot on and his levels are good. He earned his place in the team. Credit to him, every challenge that’s been put down in front of him he’s risen to. He’s very good out of possession, he is intelligent and understands that part of the game and how important it is. As a coach, you can trust him in those situations. He’s very tenacious, but he’s also got a real knack of running forward in key areas. He creates chances and he scores goals, and if you were listing skills for an attacking midfielder or a forward, they’d rank quite high wouldn’t they?! He’s someone with a lot of attributes. He’s had a really good season, and I’m so pleased for him because he’s worked so hard.<br /><br /><b>[on James Norris]</b> He’ll perhaps be one of the more disappointed ones about how the season has ended. But he’s been a real good performer for us. He’s played in most of the games, and he’s moved up to the 23s and played there. I wanted to give him experience of playing different positions this season. We wanted to expand parts of his game technically, put him under a little bit of pressure. He’s been a real good performer for us. He’s had a real impact. He’s competitive, hates losing, and he sets good standards every single day<br /><br /><b>[on Billy Koumetio]</b> He’s done really well. He’s got a head start on the rest of the Under-16s coming up next year. An opportunity came up this season and he took it. He’s had good exposure to Under-18s football. He’s probably played a few positions that aren’t natural to him, but he was a starter from day one, and that says a lot. It’ll be interesting to see how he evolves. When you come out of the schoolboy programme, that’s when you start forming a bit of an identity as a player and as a person. It becomes your job, and it’s about how you commit to it every day. I think he’ll be an attacking midfielder, a No.8, but he’s played deeper at times this season. That’s important. When I look at <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> midfielders now, and let’s take <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as an example, they can play in a number of positions. (Jordan) Henderson and (Gini) <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Wijnaldum</a> are perfect examples. For a midfielder, you have to have as much as they can in your armoury. It’s always exciting to see how the boys coming up develop. They’re swapping school for work, if you like. There is interest and attention, the scores get published now and you get a bit of profile. It is all a challenge and you have to rise to it, but I think they will. It’s a good group, and I’m looking forward to seeing how they all progress</p>
