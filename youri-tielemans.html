  <p><b>[Europe’s next great midfielder? Why Man Utd should be looking at boy wonder Youri Tielemans]</b> I have experienced a lot of emotions in football, but nothing will move me more than the birth of my daughter. No matter what the future brings. You never forget something like that. It was a conscious decision by us to become young parents. In the manic lifestyle, it will be good to pick my moments of rest, but it will also give me more stability to be a better footballer. A bit like Eden and Thorgan Hazard, who became fathers at a young age too.</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City have announced the signing of Belgium international Youri Tielemans]</b> I’m really excited to get going. The Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world and when I was young, I always watched Premier League games. I’m really happy to be here and I’m excited to get started. It’s a big family. Everybody is really kind and really good with me. I think it will be really good here.</p>

  <p><b>[Youri Tielemans could be part of something great at Leicester]</b> I do not know what is going to happen this summer. I feel really good here, but I have to see the other options too. That is normal, and I do not have to rush myself. We are now in April and we will see over the next months. At Leicester, I can be part of something great. They will have a new training ground, the stadium will be much better than it is now with more fans coming over. So it can be something great for the future.<br /><br />The style of play we play here suits me best. I can play free here and thinking about the offensive play when we have the ball, and when I do not have the ball, I try to manage the team and organise the defensive part. But I feel really good in this team and my team-mates help me a lot to adapt to the style and the gaffer helps me a lot too, so it is really easy</p>

  <p><b>[Youri Tielemans has admitted he is flattered by interest being shown in him by <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> We’ll see which club it will be. The only thing I can say is things are moving. A lot of clubs have shown interest. We will see in the next few weeks who it will be. Yes <b>[I am flattered by <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> interest]</b>, they are really big teams in England and in Europe. To hear those names gives me confidence. I just try to play my game on the pitch and try my best.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> have announced the club-record £40 million signing of Youri Tielemans from <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> on a four-year contract]</b> It is such a great feeling to sign for this football club. Ever since I arrived on loan last season, all the players, the staff and the fans have been fantastic with me, so I’m thrilled to be able to become a <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> player. I believe that we have the talent in our squad to achieve something special and for any player, that’s an exciting thing to be a part of. I really can’t wait to get started again with this club and do everything I can to help my team-mates.</p>

  <p><b>[Youri Tielemans is happy with his decision to snub big clubs over the summer]</b> During the transfer window, I was happy with the interest of certain big clubs. I needed to make a choice for my young career and I think it was the right one. To arrive off the back of a €45m transfer doesn’t change anything. They already knew me at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. My loan spell went very well. I wanted to continue playing for this club</p>

  <p><b>[Youri Tielemans says De Bruyne is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s best]</b> At the minute, we have a lot of very good midfielders in the game and I just try and pick all the positives from all the midfielders around. I really try and improve myself through watching others play. So, when I see another player playing I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, that’s something I need to improve’ and then I’m trying it in a training session. At the moment, I think the best in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is De Bruyne. He just stands out. He is the complete midfielder. He is physical and runs a lot. Technically, he keeps it very, very easy. Tactically, he is very good as well. He’s got everything<br /><br /><b>[Rodgers has suggested that his young charge could himself go on to coach at a high level]</b> Don’t tell my wife that. She wouldn’t be happy about that.<br /><br />The manager hasn’t changed me but he’s trying to push me very, very hard, and to push me to my top level. He’s always trying to improve me as a player but as a person as well and with him, I’m really trying to think like a manager. I’m really trying to think about tactics. Whereas before, I understood everything that a manager asked me to do but I didn’t question why he had asked me to do that. So I was just doing it because he told me so. It would be way easier if every player would think and understand what the manager has asked him to do and not just do it because he was asked, but really understand it. If we all think the same, then we can only do great things on the pitch. Now I’m really thinking about it and asking questions if I don’t understand something. And, I think my tactical game has improved a lot under him and under <a href="roberto-martinez.html">Roberto Martinez</a> as well with the national team. Those two have really improved me tactically and I learned a lot, and I still learn about it now</p>
