  <p><b>[Leicester City have announced the club-record £40 million signing of Youri Tielemans from Monaco on a four-year contract]</b> It is such a great feeling to sign for this football club. Ever since I arrived on loan last season, all the players, the staff and the fans have been fantastic with me, so I’m thrilled to be able to become a Leicester City player. I believe that we have the talent in our squad to achieve something special and for any player, that’s an exciting thing to be a part of. I really can’t wait to get started again with this club and do everything I can to help my team-mates.</p>

  <p><b>[Youri Tielemans is happy with his decision to snub big clubs over the summer]</b> During the transfer window, I was happy with the interest of certain big clubs. I needed to make a choice for my young career and I think it was the right one. To arrive off the back of a €45m transfer doesn’t change anything. They already knew me at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. My loan spell went very well. I wanted to continue playing for this club</p>

  <p><b>[Youri Tielemans says De Bruyne is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s best]</b> At the minute, we have a lot of very good midfielders in the game and I just try and pick all the positives from all the midfielders around. I really try and improve myself through watching others play. So, when I see another player playing I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, that’s something I need to improve’ and then I’m trying it in a training session. At the moment, I think the best in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is De Bruyne. He just stands out. He is the complete midfielder. He is physical and runs a lot. Technically, he keeps it very, very easy. Tactically, he is very good as well. He’s got everything<br /><br /><b>[Rodgers has suggested that his young charge could himself go on to coach at a high level]</b> Don’t tell my wife that. She wouldn’t be happy about that.<br /><br />The manager hasn’t changed me but he’s trying to push me very, very hard, and to push me to my top level. He’s always trying to improve me as a player but as a person as well and with him, I’m really trying to think like a manager. I’m really trying to think about tactics. Whereas before, I understood everything that a manager asked me to do but I didn’t question why he had asked me to do that. So I was just doing it because he told me so. It would be way easier if every player would think and understand what the manager has asked him to do and not just do it because he was asked, but really understand it. If we all think the same, then we can only do great things on the pitch. Now I’m really thinking about it and asking questions if I don’t understand something. And, I think my tactical game has improved a lot under him and under <a href="roberto-martinez.html">Roberto Martinez</a> as well with the national team. Those two have really improved me tactically and I learned a lot, and I still learn about it now</p>
