  <p><b>[q: What is the secret behind this incredible success?]</b> I think that the biggest secret behind our success is the excellent mix between young and experienced players. And <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> has done a great job to motivate everybody</p>

  <p><b>[q: Can you tell us a bit about <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a>]</b> He has done a great job. He made a big step from <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> to Milan and has done very well to motivate the team. He has a lot of new and innovative ideas and has played a big role in this Scudetto win</p>

  <p><b>[q: What has changed since last year with <a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a>? You have conceded fewer goals than last term with basically the same defence…]</b> We played with four attacking players last campaign. We conceded more goals, but we played more attacking. Additionally, a lot of players have really matured this season. I’m talking about Abate, who has developed a lot. And also <a href="thiago-silva.html">Thiago Silva</a> has improved again. They did a good job last year, but have been excellent this term.</p>

  <p><b>[q: Talking about <a href="thiago-silva.html">Thiago Silva</a>. Could he become a Milan legend?]</b> At the moment, he is the strongest defender around in my opinion. He is one of the best players I have ever played with. All he has to do is confirm his class year after year. I’m sure that he will become an important part of Milan’s history</p>

  <p><b>[q: <a href="thiago-silva.html">Thiago Silva</a> recently joked that you are bit like a radio, because you talk a lot on the pitch and you give him a headache every now and then. How do you respond to that?]</b> Look, this all stems from a situation when he had just joined the club. Then coach <a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> asked me to coach him a lot during his first match for Milan against Varese. And that’s what I did. Now I know that he does not need a lot of advice</p>

  <p><b>[q: Competition for places in defence will increase with the arrival of <a href="philippe-mexes.html">Mexes</a> and Taiwo]</b> They are both great players and it is important to have enough options. I know <a href="philippe-mexes.html">Mexes</a> pretty well and he’s great. You need to have plenty of options when you are a big team like Milan. Yepes is the perfect example of that. People doubted him, but he always did well whenever called upon</p>

  <p><b>[q: Let’s talk about someone who leaves the club; your good friend <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Andrea Pirlo</a>. What do you think about his decision?]</b> We all have to make our own decisions, that is part of our job. I’m really sad to see him go. We have played together for nine years and he is a real friend. The team that will sign him is doing good business. He is one of the last real geniuses in football. Few have been able to do what he has done at <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a>. I’d give him a 10 as a player and as a person</p>

  <p><b>[q: And <a href="antonio-cassano.html">Antonio Cassano</a>? What’s your advice for him?]</b> I want to start by saying that he has behaved very well, both on and off the pitch. He has played his role in the Scudetto. I personally think that once you join Milan, you have to do your utmost to stay put. Leaving the club is always a step back. It’s obviously his choice though</p>

  <p><b>[q: What can you say about <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a>?]</b> He’s an amazing player. We all knew that, but he is also very important in the dressing room. He never wants to lose and that attitude is very important. He is ahead of many other players with similar qualities</p>

  <p><b>[q: Let’s talk about you again. You have just renewed your contract with Milan, but did you ever consider to leave Milan? Perhaps like <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Fabio Cannavaro</a>]</b> I would definitely have moved abroad had Milan not offered me a new deal. Join <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a>? Why not. If I ever change clubs, I will not move to another Italian club, but I will sign a with a foreign team instead. Something new to keep going</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[q: What would you like to do after your active career?]</b> A coaching career is pretty tempting, but it will not be easy because of my family. I do not like the idea of being away from my family all the time again. I do not want to accept a job as coach in Florence and then leave my family in Milan. And I do not want to force them to travel along with me, either.</p>

  <p><b>[Nesta does not believe Milan’s head coach is the reason for the club’s recent ineptitude.

Milan is a reflection of the economic difficulties any business is going through in Europe<br /><br />You have to cut and find ways to save money or bring in more money, and that’s what Milan did. Selling those two players <b>[Ibrahimovic and Silva]</b> was an economic decision, but losing two players like that, will be hard to replace</p>

  <p><b>[Nesta has come to the defence of his former boss <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Massimiliano Allegri</a>, who finds himself under increasing pressure]</b> As for <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a>, the criticism is unfair. I think fans are smart enough to realise the team is new and needs time to gel, but also selling two key players like <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a> and Silva will hurt the team</p>

  <p><b>[Nesta explains that he is still adjusting to physical nature of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> but is happy with life in his new city]</b> It’s been a great experience so far. The city is beautiful, the fans have been great and the team is treating me well. The level of soccer in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is growing, so there will be some growing pains. It’s not at the level it is in Italy or Spain, but it is definitely getting better. It’s also very different than my previous experiences. It’s more physical<br /><br />It’s going to be tough to make the playoffs. We had a loaded schedule earlier on, which meant we played a lot of games before the team really came together. And other teams ahead of us have games in hand, so it will be difficult, but we won’t give up. We will just take it one game at a time.</p>

He was part of the 2006 World Cup winning side and believes that Italy could be back on its way to being a contender after a strong showing in the Euro 2012 tournament]</b> Every few years, a new crop of players comes out for a national team and dominates for a little while. Spain is in that situation now. But Italy is young and with some time to gel, can continue progressing from its runner-up position at the Euros this year</p>

But the discourse is wider. In the golden years, the presidents failed to invest in youth. And then there was the fact that the clubs were not worried about going bust as the bank always came to the rescue. The Italian economy allowed it. But now it doesn’t.
