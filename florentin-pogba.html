  <p><b>[Paul Pogba will come face-to-face with brother Florentin Pogba when United take on Saint-Etienne in the Europa League]</b> We’re both determined players. Him and me. If he’s on a run, and I have to tackle him, I’ll tackle him. I’m not going to knock him out. But if I have to foul him, I’ll do it.</p>

  <p><b>[Florentin Pogba is preparing to face younger brother Paul and his Manchester United side in the Europa League]</b> Arsenal are the club of my heart. I’ve supported them ever since the Invincibles - what a team! The downside of being a professional is you rarely get a chance to go to watch other teams so I’ve never actually been to the Emirates. But one day I will, hopefully.<br /><br />Playing in England is a dream I have had since I was a kid. I had the chance this summer. Is there a team I prefer more than the others? Arsenal<br /><br />I’ve never asked a player to swap jerseys at the end of the game, although I do have some because when I’ve played against friends we’ve just sort of swapped spontaneously. I think that after this game there’ll be a quite natural exchange of shirts</p>

  <p><b>[Pogba’s brother Florentin Pogba drops Real Madrid move hint]</b> He <b>[Pogba]</b> has always said that, after Manchester, Madrid has always interested him. So when his experience at Manchester ends, why not come here to Madrid?<br /><br />I don’t know <b>[if Pogba will stay at United]</b>. A lot of things can happen in football. I could tell you one thing today and another thing tomorrow. Things are going to happen. Summer’s coming. We’ll see if he stays, if he goes. At the moment <b>[all I want]</b> is for my brother to be happy, to be playing like he knows how to say and that’s it. In my opinion, he’s done a good job and we can see Manchester are going to have it tough to qualify for the Champions League. We’ll see how it turns out</p>
