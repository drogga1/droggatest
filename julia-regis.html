  <p><b>[Regis’s widow Julia Regis says her life has been turned upside down after losing her soulmate. In a statement via West Brom, she said]</b> Cyrille and I were soulmates, he was the perfect man for me and we had a wonderful life together. He was a beautiful man and a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, brother and uncle. Losing him has turned my whole world upside down. It is a void that will never be filled. I have been moved by the many messages of support and condolences I have received and the kind things people have said about Cyrille as a person and a professional. He came into football the hard way and never lost his passion for the game. He was a role model for so many because he always treated everyone he met with kindness and respect</p>
