  <p><b>[Marko Arnautovic has completed a reported £22 million move from West Ham to Chinese Super League side Shanghai SIPG. Prior to the completion of Arnautovic’s move to China, his agent and brother Danijel Arnautovic had been critical of West Ham after they initially rejected a £20m offer for the forward]</b> He’s not a cow or a horse which you bring to market. He’s a highly talented footballer who is simply being used by West Ham. He’s just a number to them. West Ham were trying to get rid of Marco right up until the last minute of the January transfer window and they are still trying to sell him right now. To them he’s just a commodity. West Ham are still speaking to the Chinese club. He is still for sale and it’s simply a case of how much money West Ham can get for him</p>

  <p><b>[Marko Arnautovic insists he always gives his all and criticised the European media for suggesting otherwise following his move to Shanghai SIPG]</b> They do not train with me, they do not play with me, but they just write something. Maybe that’s the characteristic of European media, the truth is that I always give everything to my team, I never spare myself. I’m here to work hard, I want to do my part so the club can achieve all of its goals.<br /><br /><b>[Arnautovic is joining former Chelsea playmaker Oscar at SIPG - who currently sit third in the Chinese Super League - while ex-Porto star Hulk is also at the club]</b> I feel they are very good people who really want to help me integrate into the team, and I feel very welcome. Because of this meaning, I feel more pressure. But I am ready for this challenge to make many goals and assists with this jersey and this number</p>
