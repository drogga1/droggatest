It makes me happy, though, because he is my No.1 but he’s a great and I’m only a little boy<br /><br />When I was in Enschende, beside my apartment there was a field with cows grazing in it. Then, I’m in Milan and discover Fashion Week, the restaurants, the clubs and only beautiful women. At the time, I didn’t have a girlfriend. I was 19.

He had another brush with the law in Vienna, telling a police officer]</b> Shut up! I earn so much I could buy your life<br /><br />I must keep myself under ­control.

  <p><b>[West Ham rule out Marko Arnautovic departure despite £35m China offer. Arnautovic’s agent and brother, Danijel, has called for the Irons to accept the bid]</b> West Ham bought Marko for peanuts. They paid £20m for him, which is nothing in the current market. They bought him to keep them in the Premier League last season and he did that. He took every award at the club; best player, signing of the season and the players’ award. Now West Ham have a fantastic offer. It is close to double what they paid for him.<br /><br />He wants to go to a new market and challenge for titles. This is what he wants. It is his great desire that West Ham accept the offer from China. Marko is professional and is preparing himself for the Arsenal game. He will give 100 per cent for West Ham. That is Marko. He will never change. Until he is no longer a West Ham player, he will give everything to the club. He hopes the fans can respect his wishes.</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham forward Marko Arnautovic has ended speculation over a January transfer by confirming he intends to stay at the club until at least the end of the season]</b> I guess it’s no secret that there has been an offer for me and I have to admit that the offer was a very tempting one for me and my family. I’ve given 100 per cent to my club duties but I have also needed some time to talk to my club, my wife and the rest of my family. I have now decided to put a stop to all the writings and speculation. I’m a professional footballer and the only thing I know in life is to play football.<br /><br />It’s clear that London and West Ham United feels like home for me and I hope the West Ham fans have always seen that. The club has pointed my career in the right direction since I joined and therefore I want to put the offers aside, help the club to climb as high as possible in the table and try to win the cup. Let’s focus on the rest of this season together and let them bubbles fly.</p>

  <p><b>[Marko Arnautovic has dismissed talk of a rift in the West Ham dressing room]</b> Complete nonsense. I did not have issues with any player. Every one of them knows how the football business works. People claimed I refused to play. But that is not true and a complete lie. I talked to my family and my agents for hours. It was totally our decision to stay. Of course, then you read the club did not want to pay the fee. But this is wrong. It is a matter of fact that I called the manager and the president to let them know about my decision. But everybody looks at social media and believes the things that are written there<br /><br />I could not call 60,000 people, that would have taken more than two years. But I picked a few that sent me annoying messages on Instagram. I asked them for their number, to talk to them. I don’t believe any player in the world has ever done that. They could not believe it at first either. I told them I was a human being just like them and I respected them. Therefore they should respect me, too. I told them: ‘Now you can tell me all these bad things directly’. And I asked them ‘What do you do, when you receive a better job offer? Do you turn it down immediately?’ They said no and understood my situation<br /><br />If things do not go well, people are quick to say ‘Arnautovic does not want to play for us anymore’. I turned from a fan favourite to a player they hated in no time. If I was a normal player at West Ham and wanted to join a Chinese club, nobody would have said anything. But since I was a leader at West Ham and thought about that offer, I was suddenly a bad man. One day your are top, next day your are flop - for everybody. That is why I was looking to make contact with the fans and even called them. It was the manager’s decision to not call me up. But it was me who received all the abusive messages. Some wanted me out, some wanted me in the reserves. Others wished for me to break my leg. Okay, that is social media. I understand the emotions. They are angry because they love me<br /><br />I will shine again. People think I am too old at 30. But that is just a number on paper. When people say I have a dip in form, that is nonsense. No matter which defenders are in front of me, they better be scared because of me. I don’t have a crisis</p>

Maybe that’s the characteristic of European media, the truth is that I always give everything to my team, I never spare myself. I’m here to work hard, I want to do my part so the club can achieve all of its goals.<br /><br /><b>[Arnautovic is joining former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> playmaker Oscar at SIPG - who currently sit third in the Chinese Super League - while ex-Porto star Hulk is also at the club]</b> I feel they are very good people who really want to help me integrate into the team, and I feel very welcome. Because of this meaning, I feel more pressure. But I am ready for this challenge to make many goals and assists with this jersey and this number</p>
