Playing for Barcelona’s academy was a very important time for me and my career, as I learned a great deal here. I started my career here and facing them as a player in the Champions League is undoubtedly special and exciting. However, when I had the chance to come to Italy with Sampdoria, I didn’t need to think twice. It was the right decision for me and my representatives.<br /><br />There are always offers, but I am happy at Milan and very calm. I have the opportunity to play in the Champions League, I am captain and I want to get even stronger here. I feel like I’m asked to repeat this every day<br /><br /><b>[On Lionel Messi]</b> We know Messi is the best player in the world and I personally felt it was sad he won’t be against us, because it’s always great to face the best.

  <p><b>[Mauro Icardi has called for respect]</b> When I felt that with my goals I could help Inter to be stronger, in many ways. Stronger than the problems of Financial Fair Play, stronger than our difficulties, when there were many to judge that as a team we were not worth much. At Inter, with Inter and despite all, I’ve always decided to stay, and for the love of these colours, I’ve turned down offers that most professional players would have refused. I played with physical pains that brought me to tears after the game, and in the following days. But I have always insisted on taking the field, even against medical advice, because I was able to forget every pain on the field, with the only goal of giving everything I could to help these colours. For the LOVE of the Nerazzurri colours. Because there is only Inter.<br /><br />I do not know if at this moment there is love and respect towards Inter and towards me by some who make the decisions. I do not know if there is somebody with the desire to act and solve things only and exclusively for the love of Inter. In a family many things can happen, beautiful or ugly</p>

  <p><b>[Mauro Icardi’s lawyer, Giuseppe Di Carlo, has hit out at Inter for allegedly discriminating against the striker, saying he is suffering psychologically from his ongoing exclusion from the team]</b> At the beginning of August I sent a warning to the club for Icardi to be fully reintegrated to training. In response, I received a formal note from the company stating that he is already in the group, but it is well known he isn’t doing the technical-tactical exercises. He is unilaterally considered to be for sale despite a contract until June 2021 and his declared will to respect it. This is an established practice by other clubs too, but I wonder: is it right? This arbitration can become a question of law for the future. We aim to show that a footballer can’t be treated like that. In my opinion there is no way we can get a resolution, but we want equal treatment with the other Inter players. Now let’s see what kind of response there will be. If Icardi leaves, we will drop the case. Otherwise… He’s suffering from a psychological point of view. It is not normal to suffer discrimination like this: the armband, his absence from the squad photos, the number <b>[being given to <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>]</b>, missing training<br /><br /><b>[Di Carlo added that the lawsuit is not about money, insisting that Icardi only wants to return to the Inter squad]</b> I want to clarify that the request for damages is a necessary consequence of the legal action and not a personal initiative by the player. It would’ve been an incomplete document without requesting at least 20 per cent of the salary as compensation. Once you take that action, the issue of compensation becomes obligatory. It’s a situation where money is irrelevant, because what Icardi wants is to be an integral part of the Inter project. How is it possible in two months of pre-season training he hasn’t taken part in a single friendly? Now we must wait up to five days for the tribunal to accept the case and I think they’ll wait until the transfer window has closed on Monday evening. Obviously, if Icardi were to complete a transfer, the legal action would be dropped</p>

It’s a major step in my career, and a great opportunity to join a top club like <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>. I hope to live great things here.

I have just arrived, but when you arrive with an option <b>[to stay permanently]</b>, you try to show our best game in order to be bought. So, we’ll see next summer. I was very moved by the fans.

In fact, I think he’s started well, scoring a couple of goals immediately. Then he got injured and maybe this raised the usual criticisms because <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> represents a big investment for the team, was strongly supported by <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> and must live up to expectations. But it’s not easy for anyone to play in Italy. <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> is the most defensive championship in Europe. Maybe he needs a little more time to settle in, but he’s already scored a lot of goals in his career. And he will do it again. It happens to everyone, that you go through a less brilliant moment.

Then at the end of the season, around May or June, we’ll see what happens. It’s still too early to say anything<br /><br />I feel good here and I’ve been asked to perform the same role: to score goals, which is what matters most for an attacker and the team. I’ve always been used to pressure, but I think it helps that we’ve almost always won. And when you win, it’s okay.
