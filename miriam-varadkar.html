<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Described as a politician in a hurry to the top in recent times]</b> <a href="leo-varadkar.html">Leo Varadkar</a> was in a big hurry to go to university. So he wanted to skip that year and go to Leeson Street. But he was talked out of it<br /><br /><b>[Asked if anything triggered <a href="leo-varadkar.html">Leo Varadkar</a>’s interest in politics, Miriam Varadkar points to Ashok Varadkar and said their son used to sit watching all the political TV programmes with his father]</b> From about the age of ten, he used to watch all the elections with Ashok, he was very keen on what was happening in other countries<br /><br /><b>[Miriam recounts a stand out moment in the 1980s when a shopkeeper asked <a href="leo-varadkar.html">Leo Varadkar</a> what he wanted to be when he grows up]</b> He said he wanted to be Minister for Health and it was very embarrassing as I think he was only about seven or eight. I was actually shocked<br /><br /><b>[About Leo who risen through the ranks to the office of Taoiseach]</b> We are proud as punch. We are delighted for him because we think it is probably what he wants. We are happy but we still get worried a bit now and again. I am more concerned about the media because I think that they love you some weeks and after a few weeks they find a lot of faults and they tear you down. <b>[She concluded]</b> We are delighted. We are very proud and we hope that the country will be very proud of him</p>
