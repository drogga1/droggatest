  <p><b>[Sunil Chhetri - Very happy on India’s new FIFA Ranking]</b> I’ve just had a look at the updated rankings put out by FIFA and ‘very happy’ is the simplest but most honest way to describe how I feel about India being placed at 101. This achievement belongs to the team, the team behind the team, the coaching staff, the media, the fans and most importantly, to the country.<br /><br />On a personal note, the joy is a little more given this is the highest ranking we’ve achieved during my time playing for the nation. But while we should celebrate every success, big or small, we also need to realise that the real test begins now<br /><br />In my opinion, rankings are a very fickle measurement of one’s success and it is best to not get carried away by it. You lose one game, you slide down 40 places, you win one, and you climb up 50. The real achievement will be when we cling on to this position or better it over the next three to four years. We will need to play more games with better opponents and keep performing well consistently at home and more importantly, away<br /><br />This change in ranking also pushes us up on the Asian circuit and working our way up further will give us favourable draws when lots are drawn in continental competitions. That said, our biggest task at the moment is to make it out of the qualifiers of the AFC Asian Cup<br /><br />Everything said, we are moving in the right direction and like I always say, it will take a mammoth effort from all of us involved with football to reach where we want to be</p>

  <p><b>[Sunil Chhetri on Khalid Jamil spat - ‘You’re not supposed to abuse on the pitch’]</b> I would take three points any day. Three points is what we have missed in many games this season where we have played very well. As you rightly said, this wasn’t a vintage Bengaluru FC performance, we weren’t at our best today. But we’re happy we managed to pick the three points.<br /><br />We are not thinking about that. We are just focused on our game. At Bengaluru, we are not used to playing games where we are not contenders for the championship, but still, we just want to win. And you know what, it translates. Winning becomes a habit. You take that to the next games and we are still in the AFC Cup and yet to play the Federation Cup, so that is crucial<br /><br />Not much, really. You’re not supposed to abuse. He was abusing, I was just keeping shut. The crowd can say what they want to say. But the players and the staff are supposed to maintain the respect. The camera was on my face, so I can’t even abuse, so all the best to him!</p>

  <p><b>[Sunil Chhetri: ‘Bengaluru FC winning four trophies in four years is outstanding’]</b> I’ve always maintained that they <b>[Mohun Bagan]</b> have a very good team and they showed it. However, right from minute one, we showed intensity. Big respect to Bagan - I think they played really well. We created much more chances though and I think a couple of goals were disallowed. At the end, we were victorious 2-0, and I’m so happy and proud of the team.<br /><br />You can never predict the future and can never say you’re going to win trophies but it’s what our team desires a lot. Four trophies in four years is outstanding. It’s what we’ve done last year, it’s what we have done this year and it’s what we are going to continue doing. This trophy was outstanding<br /><br />It’s <b>[losing]</b> part and parcel of the game. There were times when Mohun Bagan have won against us in the last 5 minutes when we were at home and were rejoicing when we were sad. It happens<br /><br /><b>[On Sony Norde’s reaction to the defeat]</b> Sony’s a great friend and great player. I’m sure he’ll get over this<br /><br /><b>[Questioned on his ongoing recovery from a hamstring tear]</b> It’s going to take some time. I’m being got patient. The moment I start putting pressure, the recovery will not go according to plan. Right now I’m taking it one day at a time<br /><br />It’s a lovely time for Indian football touchwood and I hope we can keep it up knowing our country’s potential. We need to keep our heads down and work hard in every department. Not only the players - but the coaches and the Federation have to work hard and together we have to move forward<br /><br /><b>[On Bengaluru’s participation in the Indian Super League]</b> I don’t know what lies ahead. All I know is that the document has been picked up</p>

  <p><b>[Bengaluru FC retain star players Sunil Chhetri and Udanta Singh]</b> I’ve always been vocal about how Bengaluru FC is a club that is always close to my heart and I couldn’t be happier to commit three years to the blue shirt of BFC. The Bengaluru FC fans have always shown me so much of love and I’m glad at the prospect of playing in front of them yet again. With Bengaluru in the ISL, these are exciting times at the club and I’m sure we will build the best possible squad for the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Bengaluru FC captain Sunil Chhetri said he was confident of the task ahead despite the reshuffle in the squad]</b> Things will get tougher from here given we have only just assembled a squad. But we’ve got a really good set of players that I’m confident will turn into a unit with time. There’s a nice blend of experience and youth and it’s going to be an exciting season ahead.</p>

  <p><b>[Sunil Chhetri says Gurpreet Singh Sandhu is a leader]</b> I’m really, really happy. Apart from his technical ability, he’s a great lad to have in the team - he’s a leader. He’s going to push us. When someone wants to improve and someone that good comes to your club, it’s always a boost, not only on the pitch but off it too.We expect a lot from him and I’m sure he’s going to deliver a lot for the club.<br /><br />There are a lot of fresh players and new energy. Although to be very honest, I do miss my old teammates because we spent so many years together. We won so much and we had some great times here, so losing almost 70 per cent of our squad wasn’t good, but it’s done now and there’s a new journey, a challenge that awaits us. As far as I’m concerned as the captain of the club, we’re going to try our best to do as well as we can. The formula of the club is always to improve ourselves and that will never change</p>

  <p><b>[Bengaluru FC captain Sunil Chhetri exuded confidence despite the prospect of facing relatively unknown opponents in North Korea’s 4.25 SC]</b> We’re adapting quite well. It does feel that it’s the first year. In between the three years, 80 per cent of the team was here, all the players have a good mentality. Everyone is working very hard. The time isn’t adequate. Tomorrow is a real test. We would have wanted to play more games before. None of us could have played 90 minutes. It’s a big game. We want to continue our work in the AFC Cup.<br /><br />We don’t know much but we did see some videos. They have six to seven national players. They are a difficult team to play against. They are not an easy opponent. It will be difficult for us. It’s our home and we always start as favourites. We will give our best</p>

  <p><b>[Sunil Chhetri says The whole Bengaluru FC squad enjoys rivalry with Mohun Bagan the most]</b> I have not thought about retiring. I am enjoying my game and want to continue till I do. There are a few players who can break my record but for now I am looking forward to add to that tally.<br /><br />The team didn’t miss us. Jackichand <b>[Singh]</b> and Balwant <b>[Singh]</b> got goals, Sandesh <b>[Jhingan]</b> was good in defense. However, there are areas of improvements in all departments<br /><br />We are excited about the challenge especially given we have a healthy lead from the first leg. It was not playing easy on the heavy ground. We are now taking one match at a time and hope to cross this hurdle first<br /><br />Over the last four years, the rivalry against Mohun Bagan has been the best one. The whole Bengaluru FC squad would agree with that</p>

  <p><b>[The FIFA U-17 World Cup is set to take place in India]</b> Over the years, I have witnessed the India national team kits evolve as the game has. As we continue our journey in the world of football, Nike’s new innovations in the kit will certainly help the team on the field. The material is much lighter and the air truly flows through the jersey to keep us dry on the pitch.</p>
