  <p><b>[Sunil Chhetri - Very happy on India’s new FIFA Ranking]</b> I’ve just had a look at the updated rankings put out by FIFA and ‘very happy’ is the simplest but most honest way to describe how I feel about India being placed at 101. This achievement belongs to the team, the team behind the team, the coaching staff, the media, the fans and most importantly, to the country.<br /><br />On a personal note, the joy is a little more given this is the highest ranking we’ve achieved during my time playing for the nation. But while we should celebrate every success, big or small, we also need to realise that the real test begins now<br /><br />In my opinion, rankings are a very fickle measurement of one’s success and it is best to not get carried away by it. You lose one game, you slide down 40 places, you win one, and you climb up 50. The real achievement will be when we cling on to this position or better it over the next three to four years. We will need to play more games with better opponents and keep performing well consistently at home and more importantly, away<br /><br />This change in ranking also pushes us up on the Asian circuit and working our way up further will give us favourable draws when lots are drawn in continental competitions. That said, our biggest task at the moment is to make it out of the qualifiers of the AFC Asian Cup<br /><br />Everything said, we are moving in the right direction and like I always say, it will take a mammoth effort from all of us involved with football to reach where we want to be</p>

  <p><b>[Sunil Chhetri on Khalid Jamil spat - ‘You’re not supposed to abuse on the pitch’]</b> I would take three points any day. Three points is what we have missed in many games this season where we have played very well. As you rightly said, this wasn’t a vintage Bengaluru FC performance, we weren’t at our best today. But we’re happy we managed to pick the three points.<br /><br />We are not thinking about that. We are just focused on our game. At Bengaluru, we are not used to playing games where we are not contenders for the championship, but still, we just want to win. And you know what, it translates. Winning becomes a habit. You take that to the next games and we are still in the AFC Cup and yet to play the Federation Cup, so that is crucial<br /><br />Not much, really. You’re not supposed to abuse. He was abusing, I was just keeping shut. The crowd can say what they want to say. But the players and the staff are supposed to maintain the respect. The camera was on my face, so I can’t even abuse, so all the best to him!</p>

  <p><b>[Sunil Chhetri reacts to India’s goalless draw in Qatar during <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup qualifying]</b> Dear India, THAT is my team and THOSE are my boys! Cannot describe how proud I am at this moment. Not a big result for the table, but in terms of a fight, as big as it can get. Huge credit to the coaching staff and the dressing room</p>
