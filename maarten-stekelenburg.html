  <p><b>[Stekelenburg, meanwhile, admits that he will ask <a href="phil-jagielka.html">Phil Jagielka</a> to buy him dinner, after the England international conceded both spot-kicks]</b> When you go 1-0 up you hope you can get the three points but I think you have to be thankful for a point. It’s not only guesswork for the penalties, you do the analysis as well. Will <a href="phil-jagielka.html">Phil Jagielka</a> buy me dinner after that? I will ask him!</p>
