  <p><b>[Rafael Marquez says that Liga MX should be worried about the rise of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and the impact it will have on Mexican soccer]</b> I think that <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is more attractive than coming to Mexico and that we should be a little worried about that. We should try to enamor our players more so that they can come back and that would help the quality of football get better. We should be working to improve and try to bring back these important players for our country<br /><br />It is very appealing nowadays to play in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and many young players are thinking that, if they have a good performance here, they can be signed by a team in Europe easier than staying in their home countries. Many people judge <a href="rodolfo-pizarro.html">Rodolfo Pizarro</a> for moving to the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> but I hope that if he has a good season a team in Europe will sign him. I think he wants to play in Europe and maybe switching to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> he can get that opportunity that he couldn’t have in Mexico<br /><br /><b>[This season, Los Angeles FC sent shockwaves by coming from 2-0 down to take down Club Leon]</b> We saw what happened to Leon. Who was beaten by <a href="carlos-vela.html">Carlos Vela</a>’s <b>[LAFC]</b> and is on an upwards path, and it won’t be long before they overtake us</p>
