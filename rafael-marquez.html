  <p><b>[Weak penalty for stadium brawl more evidence Liga MX isn’t serious about change]</b> It would be important for them to have a little conscious and values, to accept that they were involved and they messed up. And the federation has to use a strong hand in this type of things and not wait for something more serious to happen that we’d regret.<br /><br />We’re not trying to copy what happens in South America, where there’s more violence, there they have deaths, and we don’t want to come to these circumstances</p>

  <p><b>[Rafa Marquez planning to retire after World Cup in Russia]</b> My idea is to get to the World Cup and maybe retire from there. For sure I’ll still be in professional football, I don’t know how, as a coach or director, but as a player I’ll end my career after the World Cup.<br /><br />Russia is going to have all eyes on it because the next year it will be the site of the World Cup and you can see how everything works, the quality of the stadiums, the quality of all the organization</p>

Just like I have looked after my career as a professional, today is my toughest game and I intend to clarify all of this.<br /><br />I categorically deny any type of relation with this organization and with what has been stated in several news reports. I understand the legal situation that I find myself in and I will immediately work on clearing up the facts alongside my team of attorneys</p>

  <p><b>[Rafa Marquez says he’s still hoping to make Mexico’s squad for the World Cup]</b> Yes, I still see myself playing with the national team. It would be an important close to my career as well, but I’m also not clinging on to hope of what might happen. I know the present situation and I’m going to keep enjoying this magnificent sport. It would be something beautiful, something important, but I also think that what I’ve done over the course of my career leaves me content, not grasping for this final dream</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico legend Rafa Marquez still holding out World Cup hope]</b> I still have the same dream as always, hope dies at the end, so I’m still hoping, continuing to work with the same desire I’ve had to be there.<br /><br />If I had a legal problem holding me up, I wouldn’t be playing with Atlas. I have global brands at Atlas, and there’s no problem. That also applies to the national team. I know he’ll make his decision about the administrative part of things, although obviously the most important is the sporting side and that depends on ‘professor’ Osorio.<br /><br />I’ll always be available to support the national team no matter the position or the way. Obviously we haven’t spoken about that topic yet, they haven’t proposed anything to me and you have to wait for the time that might be necessary to know if it’s going to happen<br /><br />I think more time and work is needed, but it’s tough to have that with the things that are happening. In general, I see a national team at a good level. Individually, we have very experienced people. Unfortunately, we’ve also lost two important players who hopefully can recover quickly, I wish them a quick recovery. We’re hoping that everyone else continues at a good level to get to the World Cup in the best form possible</p>

  <p><b>[Rafa Marquez will take the field at the Estadio Jalisco for the final time, more than two decades after he made his Atlas debut in 1996]</b> It’s my last match in the Jalisco. We still have one more game in Pachuca. Maybe this will be the farewell from my fans, from my home, but with the commitment of still ending the tournament in Pachuca.<br /><br />I’d like to finish things the best way possible, and obviously have the dream of being able to go to a fifth World Cup. It’s right around the corner, and playing in these two final games would help me get better physically. I’ve been feeling really good in these last few matches and am hoping this can happen as well<br /><br />I think it’d be the perfect culmination, the cherry on the cake to go to the World Cup, but even so if I don’t go to the World Cup I’m very proud, very happy and very satisfied with the career I’ve had.<br /><br />I think there’s an important generation of players coming who can once again give this club a respected name. They’re working on this to be able to get great players out of <b>[the academy]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Rafa Marquez must be in Mexico’s World Cup squad]</b> It’s not whether I see myself there or not. I’m working to be there. Beyond that, it’s not in my hands to say I’m going or not. I’m putting in effort every day, training well, taking care of myself, giving my maximum effort every game and hopefully that gets me there. It would be a beautiful opportunity to be in a group that I think is very good. We want to do something important in the World Cup, and hopefully I have the chance. If not, well, life goes on, I’ll keep working the same way and supporting my teammates.</p>

  <p><b>[Brave moments for Rafa Marquez]</b> I wanted to try to have more control of the ball, try to take advantage of the spaces the team left and above all to defend as well as possible.<br /><br />Since I took part in a World Cup in 2002 there have been a lot of changes. Obviously, with the national team as well, there are faster players, more athletic players, players with better technique. This team is different from the one I was on, maybe, in 2002 and in the process we’ve had</p>

  <p><b>[Rafa Marquez compared the national team manager job to that of the president of the country]</b> It’s tough here in Mexico to be left to work in peace because you have to sell news, and I think the national team job is as important as that of the presidency of this country. Whoever comes in needs to know what’s coming, what goes along with the national team.<br /><br />Tata Martino has a great personality and can manage well with what there is externally with the national team job. On the international level, he’s a recognized manager who has been with important teams, important national teams, at Barcelona and I think not just anyone can be there. I think he has that experience of being able to manage big stars</p>

  <p><b>[Rafael Marquez says that Liga MX should be worried about the rise of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and the impact it will have on Mexican soccer]</b> I think that <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is more attractive than coming to Mexico and that we should be a little worried about that. We should try to enamor our players more so that they can come back and that would help the quality of football get better. We should be working to improve and try to bring back these important players for our country<br /><br />It is very appealing nowadays to play in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and many young players are thinking that, if they have a good performance here, they can be signed by a team in Europe easier than staying in their home countries. Many people judge <a href="rodolfo-pizarro.html">Rodolfo Pizarro</a> for moving to the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> but I hope that if he has a good season a team in Europe will sign him. I think he wants to play in Europe and maybe switching to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> he can get that opportunity that he couldn’t have in Mexico<br /><br /><b>[This season, Los Angeles FC sent shockwaves by coming from 2-0 down to take down Club Leon]</b> We saw what happened to Leon.
