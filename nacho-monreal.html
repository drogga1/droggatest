  <p><b>[Nacho Monreal is hopeful that the rigorous methods introduced by new Arsenal boss Unai Emery can play a part in prolonging his career]</b> At the moment we are talking with the club. I’ve always said I am really happy, I feel very happy playing for Arsenal. I came six years ago. I have a good relationship with them. We are in contact in any moment so don’t worry about that. I am happy here. That is the most important thing.<br /><br />In training, he <b>[Emery]</b> likes that every single player gives his 100 per cent in any moment. Training is one hour and a half, <b>[maybe]</b> one hour 40, whatever, <b>[and]</b> all the time we must give our best performance. If we have to run, we have to do it, don’t save any energy<br /><br /><b>[Monreal turns 33 in February]</b> My idea is to play in football until my body says ‘Nacho, so sorry but that’s the end’. But I think it is far <b>[away]</b>. I hope so. You never know because your body, sometimes you start with some problems, some injuries and you can’t continue giving 100 per cent</p>

  <p><b>[Nacho Monreal claims Arsenal have landed the worst teams in their Europa League draw]</b> These were the worst teams in the draw, we have two long trips to Azerbaijan and Ukraine. But it is not an excuse not to go there, play a good game, good football and get the three points.<br /><br />We missed a really good opportunity to win the Europa League. We would have qualified automatically for the Champions League and that was our target. This season, we start from the beginning of the competition, so we are going to try to qualify again for the Champions League through the Premier League, but we know we have the option to win the Europa League and qualify there. It is a good competition. We want to play, we want to fight until the end. Why not win the Europa League?</p>

  <p><b>[Nacho Monreal has stated that Arsenal’s goal for the season is to secure Champions League football for next term]</b> We don’t know in what position we will finish, but our target for the season is to finish in the top four. That’s the club’s target and we’re going to fight for that. We can do it two different ways - the first is finishing fourth in the league, this is our idea and, if not, we will have the opportunity to win the Europa League and play in the Champions League next season. I hope we get our target. The club is improving a lot. We have been working will in the last few years but probably the last two, we went down a bit and we didn’t qualify for the Champions League - this was our target, honestly. We want to get back to playing in the Champions League next season, that’s what we’re fighting fot and we have the opportunity. It’s been tough this season, fighting Chelsea and Manchester United for just one place, but it’s in our hands.<br /><br />We learnt a lot <b>[from the FA Cup defeat]</b>. Since they changed manager, they have improved a lot. That’s the truth. Jose Mourinho is a good manager but obviously he had a lot of problems with the players. Since he left, Manchester United has grown a lot. They’ve won most of the games they’ve played and they look like a better team. But we’ve arrived in good form. I think most players are fit, full of confidence and commitment. We know that it is going to be tough, but the good thing is we are in a good moment. They beat us two months ago so it’s going to be a good opportunity for us to know where we are, if we honestly have a chance to qualify for the Champions League.<br /><br />If we get the three points it is going to be very important for us, we’ll take a step forward. If we lose, we’ll get another chance, but in our mind we want the three points continue on our way. We have a lot of similar things - we had a new manager at the beginning of the season, they changed theirs a few months ago. We are fighting for the same target in this moment of the season so you could say we are very similar. It is going to be very tough but small details will make the difference in these games</p>

  <p><b>[On Mesut Ozil]</b> Mesut had some small problems and he missed a few games, but he’s with the team again and he’s fighting. If you see him training or playing you can see that he’s completely committed to the team and that’s really good. He’s very important for us and he’s a top-quality player. He helps us a lot with assists and scoring goals. When the other teams see him on the pitch, they say, ‘Oh Mesut is here, we need to be careful’ so he’s an important player<br /><br />This season has been a bit different for me because it’s been the first one when I’ve had a few injuries in a row and I’ve missed a lot of games. I lost my form over the last few months, but now I’m back I’ve started to feel better again. The team is happy and lucky to have two left-backs who try to help the team. I’m really happy with my past performances, but as I’ve said, I just try to give my best every single day, every single training session and every game. I try to help and I’m happy doing that</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal defender Nacho Monreal has hailed team-mate <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a>]</b> We are so proud of him because he’s scored three goals in a semi-final. He’s helped us a lot, but it’s not only him, it’s every player. He scored a hat-trick, so we are all really happy for him. We needed him and we needed Laca (Alexandre Lacazette).<br /><br />Our target is to play in the Champions League next season. Unfortunately we couldn’t finish in the Premier League top four, but now we have a good chance. I can’t remember the last time we played in a European final - 2006 against Barcelona? Now we have a good opportunity to finish the season with a trophy and play in the Champions League next season<br /><br />I’ve played here so many times and I know the fans. They are one of the best sets of fans in Spain. They push a lot and made it hard for us in the beginning. But after 10 or 15 minutes when the game calmed down, we started to play our game, and I think we were the better team from then on</p>

That’s what I did but my position, and where I enjoy playing, is left-back<br /><br /><b>[Monreal is confident the club will improve the squad before the transfer window closes]</b> I trust in the club. Obviously a few players decided to retire - <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a>, <a href="stephan-lichtsteiner.html">Stephan Lichtsteiner</a> - and other players changed. That’s how it works in football. One day you’re here then you’re in another place. But 100 per cent the club is looking for new players. They will come</p>
