  <p><b>[Nacho Monreal compares his <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team-mate <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> with NBA star LeBron James]</b> I think <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> is the LeBron James of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He is one of the best players in the league and I have the opportunity to train with him every single morning. I know how competitive he is, a trait that he shares with King James himself</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal left-back Nacho Monreal says he wants to stay at the club despite reports they are trying to sign Kieran Tierney from Celtic]</b> That’s all rumours. I belong at Arsenal. I still have a contract. My idea is to stay here. It’s a great club and I feel really comfortable playing for Arsenal. My idea is to continue playing here<br /><br />My position has always been left-back, this is the position I enjoy most. Football is changing, obviously sometimes our centre-backs have got injured in the last few years and the manager has decided I have to play in that position. That’s what I did but my position, and where I enjoy playing, is left-back<br /><br /><b>[Monreal is confident the club will improve the squad before the transfer window closes]</b> I trust in the club. Obviously a few players decided to retire - Petr Cech, Stephan Lichtsteiner - and other players changed. That’s how it works in football. One day you’re here then you’re in another place. But 100 per cent the club is looking for new players. They will come</p>
