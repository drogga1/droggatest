  <p><b>[Arsenal are privileged to have Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil in their squad]</b> Both Alexis and Mesut have been around in football for a long time now. Everybody knows what they can do and I have to say, we are privileged to have them in the team. I think all of our rivals, when they are preparing to face us, they really have to spend a bit more time preparing for those two. Mesut, for example, he is the player that threads the play together.<br /><br />And Alexis is a really complete footballer. He is very good in the air despite the fact he is not the tallest. He has a great shot on him, his positioning is very good. He chips in with the goals and really, he has everything.<br /><br />What I would say is that it is his ambition that makes him such a great player. He just wants more at all times and for example, if he gets subbed off when we are winning 3-0, he is not happy because he wants more, he wants to play more and he wants to keep improving.</p>

He has a great shot on him, his positioning is very good. He chips in with the goals and, really, he has everything. What I would say is that it’s his ambition that makes him such a great player. He just wants more at all times and for example, if he gets subbed off when we are winning 3-0, he’s not happy because he wants more, he wants to play more and he wants to keep improving. That’s good for him, because he keeps pushing himself and it’s good for the team because it obviously gives us that driving force</p>

  <p><b>[Nacho Monreal has promised Arsenal fans that they will see an improvement in their side’s fortunes in the coming weeks]</b> We have had difficult games, but maybe our commitment hasn’t been enough <b>[lately]</b>. In the past few games we haven’t played our game and maybe that’s why we’ve lost too many times. When you lose one, two or three games in a short time, it’s obviously difficult because your confidence goes down. We have to win a couple of games and then I’m completely sure that the team will go up again</p>

  <p><b>[Nacho Monreal has pledged his support to beleaguered Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger]</b> We are not going through a good time, at all levels. We have lost four of the last five Premier League matches, we have left the European places, which today is our goal, we were eliminated from the Champions League, and then there is all the controversy with the manager. With fans who are unhappy with Wenger. And at the end, everything affects the players. It inevitably influences at all levels.<br /><br />Well, it’s a complicated time. There is a section of the fanbase that is against the coach. Just a part of them, because it is not everybody. I think most of the fans are with him and support him. But there is a small part of the fans that does not agree, and are those who protest. We, the players, are with Wenger. He has the final word and he will decide whether to continue or not, because I understand that the club has made a renewal offer. So what he does will be the best thing for him and for Arsenal, for sure<br /><br />For Arsenal as a team and as a club, ideally everyone should continue. But today these are the circumstances: the coach finishes his contract and has not yet communicated whether he continues or not, then there are two important players like Alexis and Mesut who finish their contracts next season and they are waiting for the coach to follow<br /><br />It is a situation of uncertainty, and that does not help. But it is not in our hands either. I have a couple of years left at Arsenal. I am very happy there, I feel very valued in the team, and I am quite fine. It is grateful that there are teams that are interested in me, and you never know where you are going to finish, but right now I am happy at Arsenal</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal left-back Nacho Monreal has declared his intention to continue on with the Gunners after the club signed a possible replacement]</b> I’m very happy at Arsenal and I feel important because Wenger has demonstrated his confidence in me. I have two years left on my contract with an option for a third year, and the idea is to continue here. I’m aware that football can change, but my head is in London. I’m playing and the idea is to continue.<br /><br />We haven’t achieved our goal of finishing in the top four, but we made up for it with victory in the FA Cup and we leave with good feelings</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez are committed to Arsenal]</b> The feeling is that they will continue. At no time have we talked about the possibility of them leaving. Not at all. They are committed to the group and we will see what happens. I can’t say much about it. It does not depend on me. The situation is clear. They are two vital players for Arsenal. They are two players who end their contracts at the end of the season. If the club want them to stay beyond December <b>[the January transfer window]</b> they will follow. Yet, I do not know the club’s intentions. It is other people who are the ones who have to make a decision.<br /><br />What we all want is for the team to maintain this dynamic in the coming games. We are a team that when we are playing well, when we are focused, when we have solidarity… we are very hard. It’s tough to play against us. It is true that we have this fault: we are a bit inconsistent. We are able to play two, three games at a very high level and then we have a dip. If we were more consistent we would be fighting for more things at the end of the season. But the win over Tottenham gives us confidence for the coming games.<br /><br />I think we don’t have to be obsessed about setting a certain target. We go match by match. The target was to beat Tottenham and now the next one is to do the same in the Europa League <b>[against Koln]</b>. When the months of January, February arrive, we will see where we are and what we can achieve. We aim to win everything but we cannot become obsessed. In previous seasons we arrived at January as Premier League leaders, it seemed that we were going to win the title and in the end we suffered a blow</p>

  <p><b>[Nacho Monreal has said of the furore surrounding Mesut Ozil]</b> People must understand that every player is completely different. He is like that <b>[quiet]</b> and 10 years ago he was the same. So you can’t expect on the pitch that he starts to fight, to talk with the referee because he never did it. He is not going to change in this case. The important thing is he plays at his highest level, gives a lot of assists, scores a lot of goals and basically helps the team. That’s what he knows. He doesn’t know how to go up to a player and grab him by the throat. People have been a bit unfair with him. He is a very famous player and obviously people love talking about him. Recently, it is always bad things. Like last time <b>[against Chelsea]</b>, he was sick and that’s why he didn’t play. People started to invent that he had a problem with the manager. It wasn’t like that. He got a cold, he was sick, that’s it. That’s why he didn’t play.</p>

  <p><b>[Nacho Monreal is hopeful that the rigorous methods introduced by new Arsenal boss Unai Emery can play a part in prolonging his career]</b> At the moment we are talking with the club. I’ve always said I am really happy, I feel very happy playing for Arsenal. I came six years ago. I have a good relationship with them. We are in contact in any moment so don’t worry about that. I am happy here. That is the most important thing.<br /><br />In training, he <b>[Emery]</b> likes that every single player gives his 100 per cent in any moment. Training is one hour and a half, <b>[maybe]</b> one hour 40, whatever, <b>[and]</b> all the time we must give our best performance. If we have to run, we have to do it, don’t save any energy<br /><br /><b>[Monreal turns 33 in February]</b> My idea is to play in football until my body says ‘Nacho, so sorry but that’s the end’. But I think it is far <b>[away]</b>. I hope so. You never know because your body, sometimes you start with some problems, some injuries and you can’t continue giving 100 per cent</p>

  <p><b>[Nacho Monreal claims Arsenal have landed the worst teams in their Europa League draw]</b> These were the worst teams in the draw, we have two long trips to Azerbaijan and Ukraine. But it is not an excuse not to go there, play a good game, good football and get the three points.<br /><br />We missed a really good opportunity to win the Europa League. We would have qualified automatically for the Champions League and that was our target. This season, we start from the beginning of the competition, so we are going to try to qualify again for the Champions League through the Premier League, but we know we have the option to win the Europa League and qualify there. It is a good competition. We want to play, we want to fight until the end. Why not win the Europa League?</p>

  <p><b>[Nacho Monreal has stated that Arsenal’s goal for the season is to secure Champions League football for next term]</b> We don’t know in what position we will finish, but our target for the season is to finish in the top four. That’s the club’s target and we’re going to fight for that. We can do it two different ways - the first is finishing fourth in the league, this is our idea and, if not, we will have the opportunity to win the Europa League and play in the Champions League next season. I hope we get our target. The club is improving a lot. We have been working will in the last few years but probably the last two, we went down a bit and we didn’t qualify for the Champions League - this was our target, honestly. We want to get back to playing in the Champions League next season, that’s what we’re fighting fot and we have the opportunity. It’s been tough this season, fighting Chelsea and Manchester United for just one place, but it’s in our hands.<br /><br />We learnt a lot <b>[from the FA Cup defeat]</b>. Since they changed manager, they have improved a lot. That’s the truth. Jose Mourinho is a good manager but obviously he had a lot of problems with the players. Since he left, Manchester United has grown a lot. They’ve won most of the games they’ve played and they look like a better team. But we’ve arrived in good form. I think most players are fit, full of confidence and commitment. We know that it is going to be tough, but the good thing is we are in a good moment. They beat us two months ago so it’s going to be a good opportunity for us to know where we are, if we honestly have a chance to qualify for the Champions League.<br /><br />If we get the three points it is going to be very important for us, we’ll take a step forward. If we lose, we’ll get another chance, but in our mind we want the three points continue on our way. We have a lot of similar things - we had a new manager at the beginning of the season, they changed theirs a few months ago. We are fighting for the same target in this moment of the season so you could say we are very similar. It is going to be very tough but small details will make the difference in these games</p>

  <p><b>[On Mesut Ozil]</b> Mesut had some small problems and he missed a few games, but he’s with the team again and he’s fighting. If you see him training or playing you can see that he’s completely committed to the team and that’s really good. He’s very important for us and he’s a top-quality player. He helps us a lot with assists and scoring goals. When the other teams see him on the pitch, they say, ‘Oh Mesut is here, we need to be careful’ so he’s an important player<br /><br />This season has been a bit different for me because it’s been the first one when I’ve had a few injuries in a row and I’ve missed a lot of games. I lost my form over the last few months, but now I’m back I’ve started to feel better again. The team is happy and lucky to have two left-backs who try to help the team. I’m really happy with my past performances, but as I’ve said, I just try to give my best every single day, every single training session and every game. I try to help and I’m happy doing that</p>

He’s helped us a lot, but it’s not only him, it’s every player. He scored a hat-trick, so we are all really happy for him. We needed him and we needed Laca (Alexandre Lacazette).<br /><br />Our target is to play in the Champions League next season. Unfortunately we couldn’t finish in the Premier League top four, but now we have a good chance. I can’t remember the last time we played in a European final - 2006 against Barcelona? Now we have a good opportunity to finish the season with a trophy and play in the Champions League next season<br /><br />I’ve played here so many times and I know the fans. They are one of the best sets of fans in Spain. They push a lot and made it hard for us in the beginning. But after 10 or 15 minutes when the game calmed down, we started to play our game, and I think we were the better team from then on</p>
