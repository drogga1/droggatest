  <p><b>[Gonzalo Higuain’s agent Nicolas Higuain say his brother is determined to see out his contract at Juventus, despite speculation about him moving to AS Roma]</b> Gonzalo wants to respect his contract and therefore stay with Juventus for another two years. His performances at Juve have been good and playing for another team in Italy isn’t a workable solution. I don’t want to disrespect anyone, but if Gonzalo plays in Italy again then he only will for Juve, who own him.<br /><br /><b>[His brother understands why the fans were upset with the striker but believes it is testament to the passion of the Neapolitan support]</b> The parties wanted each other. The Neapolitan people always loved Gonzalo and the boos he received after his transfer at Juve prove it. The pain was strong, but I think their reaction was normal because we’re talking about a passionate set of fans.<br /><br /><b>[His agent believes it’s too soon for that and supported his sibling’s choice to withdraw from national team contention]</b> I think it’s still too early <b>[to return to River Plate]</b> because Gonzalo is 31 and, once he’s recharged his batteries, he’ll be good enough for Juventus. He has no second thoughts about quitting the national team. He felt he had to give way to younger players because staying in the national team for such a long time is a great responsibility and he preferred to withdraw himself</p>

But I think what I did is not bad and then we managed to win the Europa League and reached the Champions League, so they were good results. People expected more from me but I think the goals were fine in that short time. If you’re a good player then people expect everything from you. But sometimes people don’t take into account that you are coming from a different league, from the Italian one that is completely different to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br />People don’t consider the fact that I played there for only a few months. Yes, I understand that they expected more from me and I appreciate that because that means that they relied on me. I also know that people have good expectations from the best players. I always welcome criticism, provided that it is constructive and not destructive. I just want to say that I had the chance to play in one of the best leagues in the world<br /><br /><b>[Higuain insists that <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> is the man who gets him playing at his best]</b> I have learnt a lot from every manager I have worked with, but there’s no doubt Mr <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> is the one who gets the best out of me. He never gives up. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> is so stubborn and, with me, it helps. We have a good relationship but, as we are both stubborn, sometimes we clash, but it’s a good conflict. There’s nothing wrong with being stubborn: if you are not stubborn enough, you don’t have success and you disappear among the others. And I am only stubborn in football</p>

These people clearly don’t care about my mother’s health, they only care about mentioning the magic word that in this case is ‘Higuain’, that’s how this business works. Obviously everyone knows who this message is for and I don’t like to generalise. My brother, Gonzalo, travelled with the authorisation of the club and with a certificate that proves he is negative for Covid-19. Like any other Argentine citizen in this country, he is carrying out the quarantine measures requested by our president. Higuain did not run away, okay? The reason is so that he could be with our mother during this undesirable situation. Please do not use the magic word in this delicate family moment. It’s better to put your efforts into doing more important things right now. Thank you</p>
