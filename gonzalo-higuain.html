They are both beasts and have each developed their own qualities and characteristics, so play with the one that makes you feel better in your own game.<br /><br /><b>[On Paulo Dybala and Lionel Messi]</b> Well, one is just starting out and the other has won everything.

He also has everything to be world class<br /><br />I want the great players to be with me! I listened to Raul and <b>[Ruud]</b> van Nistelrooy, so hopefully <b>[Dybala]</b> will listen to me.

However, the fans aren’t as demanding as at Real, it’s not in the culture of Juventus fans to whistle their own players. The fact that the team sought me out and paid such a high clause can only make me proud.<br /><br /><b>[Higuain’s former clubs Madrid and Napoli go head-to-head in the Champions League knockout stages]</b> I have a lot of affection for both teams. Of course <b>[Maurizio]</b> Sarri’s team is changing and trying to improve. I have friends on both sides, may the best team win.</p>

In fact, he sees football just like the greats do, even though he is very young. I hate comparisons, so I will say that Dybala must become Dybala. He has the potential to be among the best in the world. But you have to leave him alone.<br /><br />Winning is not important, it is the only thing that matters: it is not a little phrase, but the clearest example of the essence of this team. Playing at the Juventus Stadium is spectacular. Before entering the field of view photos of Platini, Baggio, Zidane, Del Piero and you say: ‘in the same shirt, can I not give my best?’<br /><br />At 29 I have found mental tranquility in my life, both in work and outside of it. I am playing in a team that will fight for the Champions League and I have found a beautiful city, where I love to wander</p>

It was the same when I left Napoli. I always hold a great affection for the places I’ve played and when I had to leave both clubs it was a very sad time.<br /><br />Everybody knows how much I love Madrid but now I’m playing for Juventus. It will be a special game because we can eliminate a big rival and that would give us a lot of confidence for what is ahead. For many years, Barcelona have been at the very top of the elite but we are well prepared to face them.

It is a collective effort where everyone contributes<br /><br /><b>[the association of Higuain with repeated failure has become so strong in his native country that he admitted the constant insults directed at his mother made him doubt whether he could even continue]</b> Sometimes you just say, ‘mum, I don’t want you to keep suffering’.

As well as the challenge of, along with my team-mates, bringing Milan back to what it was, meaning reaching as high as possible. I feel a deep joy, to stay at AC Milan makes me proud. I hope to earn all this trust, I’m very faithful about this new adventure.<br /><br />It’s the first time I’ve had such a feeling, I didn’t expect such a joy, I’m glad to be here. I hope I can win something with AC Milan, as I haven’t won anything yet. I think I’m in the right place at the right moment. AC Milan called me up and you can’t say no to AC Milan.

He’s someone who knew how to work with me, particularly on the emotional side. The 2015-16 season was a wonderful one in which I broke the goal-scoring record, which is very important out there <b>[in Italy]</b>. It was a fantastic year for myself and Maurizio, a period which we shared together, even thought it was for a short time. I’m just happy to be working with him again at a big club, which has so much history and wonderful team-mates. I want to get back to that level. Everything is set on the right path to achieve our goals by the end of the season.<br /><br /><b>[Higuain was also quizzed on the differences across leagues]</b> The defenders here go into you harder. Especially when you receive the ball to feet. That’s a big difference, but I have a good impression of English football. It will only get better for me. When I was growing up I watched all of the different leagues, but lately you see a lot more of the Premier League so I knew about it before I came here. I think it’s a very fascinating league. Especially the way they play here in England - with a lot of dynamism - is really great. The stadiums are full and there’s a great atmosphere. You don’t have to worry about many things and this is important for players because it allows you to live life like an ordinary person</p>

  <p><b>[Gonzalo Higuain is hoping to convince Chelsea that he is worthy of a permanent transfer]</b> I’m happy here. It’s always nice to try a new league and it’s my first taste of the Premier League. Obviously it’s a period where I’m adapting but I’m hoping that, although I’ve only got a short time, I can finish well. The best thing we can do is qualify for the Champions League and hopefully win the Europa League too. We’re coming towards the end so it’s about finishing as strongly as possible. The main objective is to finish in the top four so we can play in the Champions League and also to encourage other players to come and play for the club. That’s what the squad are hoping for, so that we can add players next season, and to finish the season well and make people happy.<br /><br />From a personal point of view I want to do as well as I can so I can be here for next season. That’s my intention. I came here and I wanted to stay. It’s a good city, you live well and you can be relaxed but also enjoy yourself. So my intention is to stay here<br /><br />You watch the games on TV and you see that it’s a fast and powerful league to play in, but when you’re playing it’s even more so. You come up against defenders that are really strong. Also, we’ve seen any team can beat any other team. We’re one point off the Champions League spot so we have an opportunity to put pressure on the other teams for the end of the season</p>

And we, who don’t kill anyone, who do things well, who only play a sport, why can’t we go out? Once I started to understand this, I started to go out, to live life more. I am grateful for it because life just goes by and suddenly you are 40 or 50 and you can’t go back. I live better.<br /><br />I suffered. Even if you don’t look at social media, it still reaches you. I’m now at a stage in my life when nothing hurts. I’ve played in the best leagues, the best teams, in three World Cups and in the Copa America. It no longer affects me what people say. I have overcome it. When I was young, I didn’t imagine that I would achieve 10 percent of what I have. Why am I going to worry what they say?<br /><br />I know that if I want, I can return to any club where I’ve played. That is something that fills me with pride. I’m a good person and I’ve always done well wherever I’ve gone. I want people to love me for being a good person, for who I am, not for how many titles I’ve won</p>

Now I only think of our season: I have good memories against <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>, I made my <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> debut against them. It’s never easy at the Franchi, but we must be strong as we know we are and take home the victory. I’m back on the same team as Cris <b>[<a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> after a few years and he’s even stronger, more complete and ambitious, I’m happy to play with him again<br /><br /><b>[Higuain has switched shirt number this term and he believes the move to No.21 is helping him turn his fortunes around]</b> This is a decision that I made. I decided to swap from number nine, although it was available, with the day in which my daughter was born, to take her with me in every game - a choice of the heart, which is bringing me luck</p>

  <p><b>[Higuain: I could have done better but <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> move wasn’t a failure]</b> I could have done better. But I think what I did is not bad and then we managed to win the Europa League and reached the Champions League, so they were good results. People expected more from me but I think the goals were fine in that short time. If you’re a good player then people expect everything from you. But sometimes people don’t take into account that you are coming from a different league, from the Italian one that is completely different to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br />People don’t consider the fact that I played there for only a few months. Yes, I understand that they expected more from me and I appreciate that because that means that they relied on me. I also know that people have good expectations from the best players. I always welcome criticism, provided that it is constructive and not destructive. I just want to say that I had the chance to play in one of the best leagues in the world<br /><br /><b>[Higuain insists that <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> is the man who gets him playing at his best]</b> I have learnt a lot from every manager I have worked with, but there’s no doubt Mr <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> is the one who gets the best out of me. He never gives up. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> is so stubborn and, with me, it helps. We have a good relationship but, as we are both stubborn, sometimes we clash, but it’s a good conflict. There’s nothing wrong with being stubborn: if you are not stubborn enough, you don’t have success and you disappear among the others. And I am only stubborn in football</p>

  <p><b>[Gonzalo Higuain’s brother Nicola says Please stop talking about Gonzalo, our mother is battling cancer]</b> Our mother, like so many other people in the world, is battling a disease called cancer. These people clearly don’t care about my mother’s health, they only care about mentioning the magic word that in this case is ‘Higuain’, that’s how this business works. Obviously everyone knows who this message is for and I don’t like to generalise. My brother, Gonzalo, travelled with the authorisation of the club and with a certificate that proves he is negative for Covid-19. Like any other Argentine citizen in this country, he is carrying out the quarantine measures requested by our president. Higuain did not run away, okay? The reason is so that he could be with our mother during this undesirable situation. Please do not use the magic word in this delicate family moment. It’s better to put your efforts into doing more important things right now. Thank you</p>

  <p><b>[Higuain will see out <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> contract and could leave in 2021, says player’s father]</b> Everything that’s been said about Gonzalo isn’t true. I can tell you one thing: Gonzalo will stay with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> because he still has a year and a half left on his contract and he’ll respect it. He’ll see out his current contract. In 18 months, Gonzalo will decide what to do because he will be the master of his own destiny. This is the reality and what will happen in Pipita’s career, unless other things happen that are unforeseen. But I can guarantee you that, in Gonzalo’s head, there’s no desire to leave <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, where he is much loved by the fans, just as he loves the <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a>, their shirt and their fans</p>

Lautaro is in the ascendancy, this is the most exciting part of his career, he is already part of a big team like Inter despite being so young. He has already played in the Copa America, scoring goals, and without doubt has what it takes to become Argentina’s main No.9. Having said that, it all depends on him.
