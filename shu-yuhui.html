  <p><b>[Tianjin Quanjia have admitted to making a move for Chelsea striker Diego Costa while turning down the chance to sign Monaco forward Radamel Falcao]</b> Theoretically speaking, there is no limit on transfer budget in the summer. We can target whoever we want. But on several occasions, our targets are reluctant to join us. We made an attempt for Pato last year but he is not willing to come because our club was still in second division then. After we get promoted, he came. We also approached Diego Costa and other stars. It remains to be seen who will join us in June but I can assure you that the new players will be on the same level as Costa.<br /><br />Not long ago, famous football agent Jorge Mendes came to the city of Dafeng to meet us. We had an overnight negotiation and Falcao was about to sign the contract to join us. However, the deal was scuppered by Cannavaro who later told us he doesn’t suit our style of play. Price and reputation are not our only concerns. We have to apologise to Mendes</p>

  <p><b>[Tianjin Quanjian are still trying to sign Chelsea star Diego Costa]</b> I can only say that we are still working on the deal <b>[to sign Diego Costa]</b>. And we have already made contacts with several players. We have high standards <b>[when it comes to buying foreign players]</b> and those players prefer top clubs such as Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. It’s safe to say that we have the same transfer targets as those illustrious clubs. We may have to pay bigger price because our club are now competing with Real Madrid &amp; Bayern Munich. As for who will join us in June, let’s wait and see.</p>
