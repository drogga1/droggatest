  <p><b>[Tianjin Quanjia have admitted to making a move for Chelsea striker Diego Costa while turning down the chance to sign Monaco forward Radamel Falcao]</b> Theoretically speaking, there is no limit on transfer budget in the summer. We can target whoever we want. But on several occasions, our targets are reluctant to join us. We made an attempt for Pato last year but he is not willing to come because our club was still in second division then. After we get promoted, he came. We also approached Diego Costa and other stars. It remains to be seen who will join us in June but I can assure you that the new players will be on the same level as Costa.<br /><br />Not long ago, famous football agent Jorge Mendes came to the city of Dafeng to meet us. We had an overnight negotiation and Falcao was about to sign the contract to join us. However, the deal was scuppered by Cannavaro who later told us he doesn’t suit our style of play. Price and reputation are not our only concerns. We have to apologise to Mendes</p>

  <p><b>[Tianjin Quanjian are still trying to sign Chelsea star Diego Costa]</b> I can only say that we are still working on the deal <b>[to sign Diego Costa]</b>. And we have already made contacts with several players. We have high standards <b>[when it comes to buying foreign players]</b> and those players prefer top clubs such as Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. It’s safe to say that we have the same transfer targets as those illustrious clubs. We may have to pay bigger price because our club are now competing with Real Madrid &amp; Bayern Munich. As for who will join us in June, let’s wait and see.</p>

  <p><b>[Chinese Super League side Tianjin Quanjian have identified three ‘world-class’ players to try to sign this summer]</b> As far as I’m concerned, our club looks certain to buy a powerful foreign striker and a quality homegrown defender. The recruitment of the Chinese defender is a done deal, but right now we cannot reveal his identity in accordance with the relevant provisions. As for the foreign imports, three stars have been nailed down by our club and we will choose to buy one. The club’s representatives are working on the deal. And I will absolutely honour my promise to the fans that the new striker will be, without a doubt, a world-class player.<br /><br />As a promoted team, it’s rather difficult to get results against those CSL heavyweights, but we expected more. What if we have a powerful foreign striker? We could have won all of the three games</p>

  <p><b>[According to Tianjin Quanjian owner Shu Yuhui, the Chinese Super League club have secured pre-contract agreements over the transfers of three big names]</b> It’s safe to say we did make contact with all of those players, some of whom are still in talk with us. The only thing I can reveal right now is that we have agreed terms with two or three stars. The players have no problem with the deals and their clubs are also willing to let them leave. The only issue that remains unresolved is reaching agreements with their respective clubs over the transfer fees.<br /><br />The player we buy should satisfy two requirements. First, he is suitable to the style of football we play; and second, he has the right attitude. However, if some <b>[European]</b> clubs are intent on taking advantage of us, we won’t allow ourselves to get ripped off. We won’t lose our mind</p>
