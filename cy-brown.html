<blockquote>
  <p><a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans showed up in full force and full voice Sunday for <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s final home match as <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> manager, a 5-0 beatdown of <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>. It was the liveliest I’ve seen the Emirates in years, as fans paid tribute to the boss by opening the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> songbook and singing the gamut of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> chants from the <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> era. But there was one player’s song they sang with a bit more gusto than all the others: Patrick Vieira’s<br /><br />What more would you expect? <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a> is an ‘Invincible,’ an absolute legend of the club. He was <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>’s first signing in 1996 and won three <a href="epl.html">English Premier League</a> title during his nine years in North London, as well as a World Cup as a French international. After his playing career, he joined <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> as a youth coach before being hired by City’s <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> sister club, New York City FC, in 2016<br /><br />In New York, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Vieira</a> found immediate success. He led the club to second-place finishes in the Eastern Conference in each of his first two seasons, all while playing a distinct brand of modern, attacking soccer<br /><br />… A movement of young, cutting-edge coaches is flooding the game at the top level - many of whom are unknown commodities with resumes similar to Vieira’s - and it would behoove <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to get in on that trend. But whereas a typical manager of this breed may not be given much of a chance by fans, Vieira’s status as a club legend would give him a longer leash and more time to complete this rebuild. He’s the best of both worlds - a hot, new thing dressed up as an old favorite<br /><br />Hiring <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Vieira</a> would be in keeping with a small movement sweeping German soccer and the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. Top clubs have been snatching up young coaching stars left and right from youth sides across Germany. This is how world-class managers such as <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a> and <a href="julian-nagelsmann.html">Julian Nagelsmann</a> all got their starts in the top flight. The main selling point of this type of hire is that these men are coaches as much as managers. As youth coaches, these men were able to focus on tactics and player development without dealing too much with acquisitions and departures<br /><br />In New York, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Vieira</a> employs a possession brand of soccer that emphasizes playing out of the back. NYCFC sides are meticulous in their buildup, very similar to what <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> does at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, leading to some of the most attractive play in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. But <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Vieira</a> is also pragmatic and has shown the capacity to grow as a coach. In 2018, NYCFC has tailored its style to its opponents and played the counter-attacking game when building from the back didn’t work. The result is Vieira’s most efficient and effective side since coming to America<br /><br />By all accounts, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Vieira</a> also manages his players much differently than <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>, who was famously nurturing and infamously protective of his players. This clip, in which <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Vieira</a> is asked about <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>’s greatest strength and weakness, best sums up the difference in <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Vieira</a> and <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>’s personnel management philosophies<br /><br />Although <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Vieira</a> was a fiery, hot-tempered player, he’s calmed down significantly on the touchline. One theory for his stoic demeanor as a manager is that he’s funneling that anger and fire into his players. When NYCFC lost 7-0 to Red Bulls in 2016, he reportedly lit into his dressing room and accused his players of ‘cowardice’. I could never imagine <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> doing either in a million years. And quite frankly, after years with big losses being met with little more than a shrug, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> could use a bit of righteous indignation<br /><br /><a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is in a tricky spot. The club and the fans are ready to move on from <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>, but there’s still a desire to keep a connection both to club history and <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>’s beautiful attacking style. <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Vieira</a> can be that connection. He manages his players different than <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> but plays that same aesthetically pleasing brand of soccer the two helped make famous at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. If the club wishes to keep a spiritual tether between the <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> era and the new era, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Vieira</a> is the clear choice for the job</p>
