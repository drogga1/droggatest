  <p><b>[On new player’s adaptation]</b> With new players, especially in the defense, it takes a while to jell and kind of get to know and understand what everybody is thinking. But playing so many games down here in preseason is very helpful because you get those minutes with those guys and kind of start to get those tendencies down. I think being here and doing that will be extremely helpful for the season.<br /><br />Obviously, winning MLS Cup is our main goal, but getting trophies again like last year would be a successful year. For everybody else, it would seem like a successful year, but for us we have bigger goals than just winning one trophy. That’s kind of how I view it.</p>

  <p><b>[Portland Timbers ready for tight battle with FC Dallas]</b> I think you’re pretty right about how it’s going to go. Both teams like to counter-attack, both teams have good players capable of doing it. I think whoever executes the counter-attacks better will be the team who wins.</p>
