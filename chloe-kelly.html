  <p><b>[Chloe Kelly says Leaving <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> was the best career decision I’ve made]</b> That’s what shapes you really and if you forget those experiences, you take things for granted. I never take things for granted. That’s how it is and it can easily go back to that, like that really. It was great for me as a QPR fan. My family were absolutely buzzing. It was like a dream come true really, I even played at Loftus Road in one of my first games. But it was only Sunday league at the time and I wanted to push myself<br /><br />It was tough because I knew my family would want me back home, but I don’t regret that. To come to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, a different city, and just experience something else … I was sitting on the bench at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and I learned a lot, but I wanted to show what I was capable of. <b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> was an unbelievable experience. As a 16-year-old going into that set-up, when I went up to train with the first team, it was a big step.<br /><br />Obviously, you’re going to be nervous, but you’re there to show what you’re capable of. It was great to be there when such big players were, because I think you can look at those players and learn a lot from them. It was massive going in with the likes of Kelly Smith and Rachel Yankey. Sometimes it is difficult when you’re not playing, but there’s big players there. You kind of have to accept it. I had a lot of friends <b>[at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>]</b> from the England youth age groups and I knew Andy Spence <b>[manager at the time]</b> was really good with youth players. He gave them an opportunity and I think that’s what I needed: an opportunity<br /><br /><b>[Having the ankle surgery needed to overcome an injury she spent last season playing through]</b> It was really difficult. I think that’s why I played on with my injury for so long. Selfishly, because I should’ve let someone else play that was 100 per cent, but unselfishly because I was like ‘I need to play, I need to help the team’. I’ve learned a lot now from it, but I think you learn a lot about yourself in those moments<br /><br /><b>[team bonding exercises that aren’t always as successful as their results]</b> I enjoyed the break-out room, but I wasn’t very good at it! We got out, but I think the woman was lying to be fair. We got out with like three seconds to go, so I don’t really believe it!<br /><br />We haven’t really got a big result against a big team yet. We know they have really top players - if you just focus on <b>[WSL top-scorer, Vivianne]</b> <a href="vivianne-miedema.html">Miedema</a>, there are 10 other players that can hurt you. We’ll just focus on ourselves and find ways in which we can break them down and stop them from hurting us. We want to call ourselves a big team, so we need to get results against top opponents</p>

  <p><b>[Chloe Kelly: <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> Women sign England forward on free transfer]</b> <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are a hugely ambitious club whose aspirations match my own and as soon as I had my initial discussions with the staff, I knew there and then that it was the place I wanted to be. Having spoken to Gareth <b>[Taylor]</b> too after he joined the team, I could sense immediately what a great manager he is and I was excited by the idea of working with him. The development made by a number of young players at the club was massive for me, and the opportunity to play Champions League football was a real draw too. Now it’s all sorted, I’m genuinely so excited for what is to come in the blue shirt</p>
