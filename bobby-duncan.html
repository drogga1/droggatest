  <p><b>[Liverpool sign England youth star Bobby Duncan, cousin of club legend Gerrard]</b> Steven’s been a big influence. What he achieved in his career inspires me. He always had that hunger and desire to win trophies. As well as talent, it was his attitude, character and leadership that made him the player he was. I’ve always tried to learn from him and when he messaged me after the hat-trick that meant a lot.</p>

  <p><b>[Duncan spent time at both Liverpool and Everton, but wound up playing for Wigan Athletic instead. At 10, he was picked up by Manchester City]</b> They were building their new Academy at the time. And with all that investment I thought it would be good place to continue my development.<br /><br /><b>[In 2016, he made local headlines when becoming the first England player at any level to score a hat-trick against Brazil]</b> I’ve broken a lot of records in my life but nothing as big as that. I thought about the likes of Shearer, Gerrard, Owen and Fowler - all big players who have come up through the England junior ranks. It had never been done before and to think that some kid from Huyton has now done it is amazing. It doesn’t feel true</p>

  <p><b>[Bobby Duncan revealed Liverpool’s FA Youth Cup win was yet to sink in as he reflected on a remarkable first season with the Reds]</b> Unbelievable. We just created history. We haven’t won in so many years, so it’s unbelievable to score, unbelievable to win. It was mixed emotions. Relief, passion, every type of feeling! This season couldn’t have gone any better. We’re in the title race, we’ve just won the Youth Cup. If somebody had told me at the start of the season we were going to do all this, I’d have jumped at it. I’d have been buzzing. I can’t even believe it, it hasn’t even hit me yet<br /><br />I’ve been with them since I was a kid, so there’s no disrespect. I love half the players in there, and I have only respect for them. To beat them is unbelievable, but I don’t want to rub it in their faces. I have got respect for this club, and for the people higher up as well. They came out and played an unbelievable game, but we matched them. We had more grit and determination in the game<br /><br />I knew that I had time and space, I knew that the City full-backs were tired, so I just hit it with my left foot and … .it moved! Luckily it went in. Big players play in big games, and they provide in big games, know what I mean? I didn’t get into the game as much in the first half, but in the second I tried to get into it and luckily the ball come to me and it hit the back of the net. I was out most of <b>[last]</b> year to join my boyhood club and it was hard at times to get through it. City were holding my registration back and I couldn’t do anything. I had other clubs coming in for me but the only club I wanted to join was Liverpool because I knew straight away. Worth the wait!</p>

  <p><b>[Rubie’s statement, which was shared by Bobby Duncan on his own Twitter page]</b> There has been a lot of things said the last few weeks regarding Bobby Duncan’s future at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. And today <b>[Wednesday]</b> is the final straw of the behaviour and dealing of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> sporting director Michael Edwards. A few months ago before the end of last season, Bobby had meetings with the club’s hierarchy including academy director <a href="alex-inglethorpe.html">Alex Inglethorpe</a>. It was recognised that Bobby wasn’t happy at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for different reasons and Alex invited us to bring offers to the club for the exit of Bobby Duncan. For a player with zero first-team experience, no clubs were prepared to pay an outright reasonable fee for a player they got for £200,000 last summer.<br /><br />With that in mind we have been able to find clubs that were ready to take Bobby on a season-long loan with a (sic) option to buy for amounts of £1.5 million upwards, which is a great return for the club on a player who will never play for the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> first team and who doesn’t want to be there. The club and Michael Edwards specifically made it clear that that kind of deal wouldn’t work. So then myself and my team worked even harder and managed to get a deal on the table for a loan with an obligation to buy after five starts with a higher transfer fee than before and a sell-on to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Putting all of that aside, the real reason Bobby missed the U23 game <b>[against <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>]</b> on Monday is because he has suffered some deep mental health issues with all the stress the club has put him under.<br /><br />Stress of being told he can leave but then going out of their way to force him to stay against his will. Not only is he on a very small salary but he also has one season left on his contract after this one and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have flatly said he will not get a new one. Bobby has not left his room for four days because of this and will never go back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> again and my only concern now is his mental health and well being. The <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> hierarchy have shown zero consideration to that and have even gone as far as saying in writing that they will punish him and make him stay at the club until January and beyond to teach him a lesson. This is not really dignified behaviour from a club with the rich history of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and one who one of their greatest ever players <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> happens to be Bobby’s cousin. It’s a sad state of affairs that a club such as a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> can be allowed to get away with mentally bullying and destroying the life of a young man such as Bobby.<br /><br />I know one thing for sure, and that is he is never going back there again and he’s on such a small salary that no amount of fines will even make a difference. In this situation all that matters is the player’s health and in this case Michael Edwards has totally ignored that because of his own stubbornness and I really pray that his experience doesn’t happen to any young players again</p>

Played for the 1st team in pre-season which is a great start &amp; he should try &amp; develop this season &amp; maybe make the bench in Carabao Cup.
