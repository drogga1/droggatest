  <p><b>[Kayla Adamek ready for Champions League clash with Atletico Madrid]</b> What’s most memorable is talking to Ali Krieger, who was one of my idols growing up. Just seeing her positivity and passion for the game, that really stuck out to me and inspired me. I have this, I guess, vision in my head where I’ve had all these people in my past who have inspired me and I want to give back by inspiring others with my story<br /><br /><b>[As well as other World Cup winners in <a href="ashlyn-harris.html">Ashlyn Harris</a>, Sydney Leroux and <a href="alex-morgan.html">Alex Morgan</a>, Adamek’s team-mates also included Brazilian legend <a href="marta.html">Marta</a> and 56-time Canada international Shelina Zadorsky]</b> It’s funny because you grow up and all these players are your idols and then all of a sudden, you’re on the same pitch as them. It was a really good experience in terms of development. I was with them in and out of college and not only technically did I develop, but I took after their characteristics or things that they do to be the best. I think that’s what I learned the most<br /><br />I know a lot of girls that have come overseas to Europe. They said being in the Champions League is one of the best experiences you can have so that’s what really drove me to come. There’s five Americans with me, too, and I think that was interesting. That’s like half a team, you know? I thought we could do something special here. It’s been amazing having them there because it is a bit of a language barrier. Of course, when you have this common love of soccer and a common goal, the language barrier just breaks down. We’re all motivated for the same goal<br /><br /><b>[It’s the fifth time Spartak have reached this round of the Champions League, with their winning mentality serving them well in qualifying]</b> Those are the games we live for as football players. That last game <b>[against Ferencvaros, to decide who qualified]</b>, I still get goosebumps thinking about it, which is also why we’re so excited to play Atletico. I actually watched Atletico a bit against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> <b>[in pre-season]</b> and I really admired the way they possessed the ball. It’s kind of similar to how our coach wants us to play here. We all know that it’s going to be a tough game but, like I said, these are the games that all footballers live for<br /><br /><b>[Kayla Adamek also improving in a number of ways in a very different environment]</b> Specifically, it’s a very different style of play. There’s been a bit of adjustment, learning a new system, new tactics. It’s more of a thinking game rather than athleticism, which has been awesome. I think that’s actually improved my game and a lot of the Americans who are with me out here<br /><br /><b>[Adamek describes enjoying a similar path as her goal]</b> It’s funny because people say it’s a career-ending injury, but I’ve actually been able to come back stronger. Going through that adversity has helped me as a player. I know I can achieve anything if I really want to. I’m not taking anything for granted</p>
