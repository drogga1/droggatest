  <p><b>[On joint CONCACAF World Cup bid]</b> I remember well the World Cup of 1970. I remember well how Estadio Azteca was built. In 1986 it fell to us to host, I remember that World Cup well. Today, to be able to give the Mexicans, Americans and Canadians an opportunity to experience a World Cup in Mexico is a great honor.<br /><br />My children didn’t see the World Cup in 1970, my children didn’t see the 1986 World Cup, but they will see the World Cup in 2026, along with my grandchildren. That’s the blessing of soccer. To be able to make that magic, and offer it to the world<br /><br />I think with what we have agreed to today, we’ll be able to offer the Mexicans in Mexico a great World Cup, and the Mexicans in the United States will have the other 60 matches in the United States to enjoy <b>[the World Cup]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[San Luis Potosi ready to host Mexico national team in rare trip away from capital]</b> At the end of the day, the national team is everyone’s, but unfortunately we’re not able to take it to the whole country. We have the opportunity to take it out of Mexico City and take it to another city and this time we chose San Luis Potosi.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexican Football Federation said]</b> I think the whole group would’ve liked to finish having achieved the goal of being undefeated. It couldn’t. I think it was a very difficult match. Honduras came out with everything it had. I’ve said that preparation for the World Cup begins tomorrow. We have the two games in November and those we can have in February and March and the matches on the way to Russia. Surely, the preperation for the World Cup begins tomorrow for the Mexico national team.</p>
