  <p><b>[Oscar Jansson says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> supporters would take <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> back with arms wide open]</b> <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> was an easier one than seeing Harry <b>[Kane]</b> being a big star. He always had that aura around him that he was an unbelievable talent - just a star - and it was just a question of when he was going to explode. Gareth trained extra and always believed in himself, and once he got his chance at left-back because of an injury you couldn’t keep him out of the team. I know that he was close to leaving <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> before that even happened, that’s just the daily life of being a footballer - you need to get the chance, and when you get it you need to take it. He was always good. I think <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> fans would take <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> back with arms wide open. It’s just about what he wants to do. I don’t think he’ll leave <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> before his contract is up<br /><br /><b>[Kane]</b> wasn’t the fastest or the strongest. If I was to pick someone to be a star from that group, he wouldn’t be in the top five, six, or seven. We had an unbelievable age group, and Harry was good, just not as good as some of the others. But then he always had that ability to motivate himself to train extra, to do extra fitness. He’s always been a great striker of the ball, a good finisher, it’s just that at the time he wasn’t as good as others in the age group</p>
