  <p><b>[Marcelino’s obsession with diet has seen Valencia’s players subjected to a strict regime and midfielder Dani Parejo admitted this week]</b> I have lost five and a half kilos since he has been here. It’s hard at first, you go through a bad time, you’re hungry, but your body adapts. Now I feel more agile and faster.<br /><br />I knew that we would do well with Marcelino. Because of the way we learn, the way we train every day, the way he prepares matches</p>

  <p><b>[Unai Emery sent ex-Valencia defender Miguel Brito to sleep during a tactical meeting while in charge at the Mestalla]</b> They say coaches are a little different, and he’s a perfectionist: there’s a lot of work, a lot of videos, talks, and its true players can get tired of it, that he’s a bit heavy-going. When you get an outline of the opponents it helps, of course, but a footballer’s attention - anybody’s attention - can wane if it goes on for 20, 25 minutes. Miguel Brito fell asleep during a talk one day</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> captain Dani Parejo was also full of praise for the belief which carried the players through to victory following their 2-1 won over <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in the Copa del Rey final]</b> It’s my happiest day as a Valencianista. I’ve been here for eight years and I’ve had a lot of bad times, but a club like this deserves a lot more joys like that. It’s amazing, the people, the welcome … we have to give thanks to the people, to my teammates, to the club and to all of us.<br /><br /><b>[He also acknowledged the achievement as the ideal way to mark the club’s 100th anniversary]</b> We have made history in a very significant year. You cannot ask for more. The year was incredible whatever happened, and I thank the people, because from the beginning they always believed, and I always believed. The party is for everyone - it’s incredible</p>
