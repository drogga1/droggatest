  <p><b>[Emerald City Supporters, one of the Sounders’s main supporters groups, on Human Rights]</b> The rights we stand for are not political, they are human rights. No one should be oppressed or persecuted because of who they are. As with all things in life no one should feel they can’t attend a soccer match and support the club they love. Just like the Iron Front symbol, the Emerald City Supporters stand for the oppressed and the persecuted</p>

  <p><b>[The Sounders’ March 21 match against FC Dallas has been postponed]</b> As the developments surrounding COVID-19 in our region evolve, Seattle Sounders FC has been working in real time with regional health authorities and government officials to do our part in combating this public health crisis. Our organization must remain flexible in these efforts, and at this time, that includes heeding Governor Inslee’s call to postpone our home match on March 21 versus FC Dallas at CenturyLink Field<br /><br />Throughout this process, Sounders FC has stated that nothing is more important than public safety and the wellbeing of our fans. With that in mind, we respect the difficult decision that has been made today, and our club will continue following the guidelines set forth by our public health authorities and government agencies<br /><br />We will maintain our consistent dialogue with elected leadership, public health officials and <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a>, and as more information becomes available, the club will continue to provide public updates. This includes details about rescheduling the FC Dallas match for a later date</p>
