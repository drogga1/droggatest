If you are successful in any job, I believe it is because you are in love with that job, and if you have a successful family it is because people are in love with each other. I’m romantic in the sense that the people I love, they have to know that I love them, and they do know it, and they feel it. My wife did a tattoo and challenged me to do it. I didn’t at first because I always felt, ‘Urrrgh, it hurts’ and ‘I don’t have to do this to my skin’, and so on and so on. But it was her birthday and I thought it would be a good gift to her. So I had my wife and my kids’ names on my wrist and it was not as painful as I thought. It was easy. For me, the perfect weekend is when I am at home with my family. Perhaps watch my son play football and then have dinner in a restaurant. <b>[When I watch my son play]</b> I am the quietest father of the group.

He has years and years to develop his game, so that expectation and investment from the club is based on that – a super player for the next seven or eight years.<br /><br />We don’t expect Paul to arrive here and the next day to be unbelievable, but the other thing is that we trust him so much that we pass to him this kind of feeling. He is a very self-confident boy too, so we are living well with the critics, if you want, and we know what the critics are. With the quality of his pass, with his aerial game, with his agility in such a big body, for his defensive side of the game, coming from the back with the ball, he would be a phenomenal central defender, too.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho still believes that a Champions League final between Lionel Messi and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is a possibility]</b> First of all, I think it’s a frustration for all those who like football to never have had a <b>[Champions League]</b> final between the two <b>[Messi and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b>. It was almost real many times, but it never happened. I always thought that it would be a big injustice to them, in the sense that everything would be centred on them and that one would come out holding on to the big ears cup and the other would come out with his head down.<br /><br />I always thought it would be a great injustice to have a duel between the titans of the two best players in the world in the last decade, for one of them to bow to the weight of defeat. That’s why it’s probably a good thing it never happened. Can it still happen? It could still happen. They’re both in clubs that want to win. They don’t hide that they want to win themselves.

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has claimed he felt ‘almost caged’ in England]</b> I lived in England most of those years <b>[the 15 years since he left Portugal]</b>. I also spent some years in Spain where we walked there in the same habitat. Italy not so much. Italy really likes the game, the tactics. I usually have people talking about it, more polemic, less polemic, more aggressiveness, less aggressiveness, but they are people of great credibility and you have great names in football to discuss about football. But in England it’s day and night. For example, I’ve sometimes felt almost caged because you can’t even comment on the referee before the game. I was punished and well punished for pre-match statements and statements such as ‘I hope the referee is very well, that he resists pressure from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> Road, that he has an excellent performance’. This is forbidden. This is considered to somehow induce the referee, put some kind of pressure on him.<br /><br />Even speaking well of the referee, as I did, I was punished. In Portugal, you tell referees what you want, before the game, during and after the game, you’re punished with ridiculous small fines. There’s total impunity. And we’re talking only at this level. And then obviously we’re a country that should like this. The kind of TV shows that exist in Portugal and that exist simultaneously in three, four, five different channels and that are repeated from Monday to Sunday and that survive, is because Portuguese people like this. So maybe we have the football we want to have.<br /><br /><b>[Mourinho also heaped praise on Portuguese wonderkid Joao Felix]</b> To start with, I think it’s more important to describe even superficially Benfica’s team, which was the habitat where he developed, and which allowed him to have conditions for it. I think things start there a little bit. The Portuguese championship is a championship that obviously has a big gap between the top teams and the others that allows a team to develop a dominant game, which is what Benfica is developing at the moment. It’s a dominating team, that enters the field and wants to win, wants to score, that doesn’t have fears, that is winning by 1-0, 2-0 and that wants to win by three or four and that doesn’t fear the power - that also isn’t much - of the opponents. Joao is developing in a habitat created by Bruno Lage <b>[the coach]</b> and he develops his qualities.<br /><br />He said the other day that his position was that of a free role. A free role in high level football may not exist. A free role but subject to certain principles of play that he must know and surely knows. I think he’s a player who has a fantastic ability. From the point of view of defensive organisation, it’s better than what you might think. Usually when you say you have a free role, you think you’re not defending. He defends and I think he defends well. And I think that Bruno has defined from game to game the moments of pressure, the positions of pressure, and Joao Felix presses, recovers, closes spaces, has a very good understanding of the game. I think he’s on the right track to be a great player. This issue of selling, not selling, should sell, should not sell, should leave, should not leave, Benfica is the one who knows, Joao Felix knows, his family knows. It is very difficult to say what can be better for each one</p>

In the context of 38 matches you cannot lose many points, especially at home against direct rivals if you want to win the title. I thought it was very important because there was not a contradiction between our words to the players, our ambitions, and then the result of the match. If you say ‘this season is to be champions’ and then the first match you lose 3-0 at home to a direct rival, you give one step back.<br /><br />So it was one step forward, there was a big relation between that match and what we tried to give to the team in pre-season which was mental strength, being compact, tactical discipline and then be really ambitious on that approach that sometimes I call the ‘all in approach’. You have to put everything in that game, in every minute of the game, every second of the game, it’s all in. It’s your qualities, your physical power, it’s your aggression, it’s your emotional control, you have to put everything in. That game was one of those matches where we could feel the ‘all in’.

The decision was made. The contract wasn’t signed but the decision was made. I had decided to go to Real Madrid. I hadn’t gone two previous times, it was my third opportunity.

That is why I didn’t return<br /><br /><b>[Mourinho recalls he had difficulty keeping his emotions in check following his second Champions League triumph]</b> I remember perfectly that I didn’t even go to the dressing rooms because I had that feeling, that sensation, that I was going to lose emotional control.

  <p><b>[Mourinho explains how he’d beaten Van Gaal in 2010 Champions League final before it started]</b> We knew <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> had a coach, whom I knew very well, and I knew that his own ego, his own self-esteem, would always lead him to play according to his ideas - and this, for me, was an advantage. I knew perfectly well that when they lost possession of the ball, it was a team with some weaknesses. On the other hand, there were top attacking players that needed to be stopped. And I think our great advantage in this game was precisely the strategic side<br /><br />I think the game was won before it started. Not only for the emotional aspect, not only for the levels of confidence, of self-esteem, of empathy, of brotherhood that Inter had. But also for the way that, from a strategic point of view, we prepared for the game<br /><br />I always challenged the group exactly for this situation. We can win three titles, two, one or zero. After those 15 days, we can make history in Italian football, winning the treble, or we can end up as the ones who were ‘almost’ - and football is full of ‘almost’, which is to almost win. And Milito… when we played the Italian Cup final against Roma, we won 1-0 with Milito’s goal. We went to Siena to play the championship game, in which we had to win to be champions - one-nil, Milito’s goal. And we played in the Champions League final against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, two-nil, two Milito goals. Three titles in 15 days and Milito with four goals in three games. Historic</p>

When he comes to the first team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, it is different to the Championship. I think in this moment he is a winger on the left, can also play on the right, can learn progressively and even developing physically, which he is doing. Even last time I saw him and the first time I met him when I came here he is already different physically. I think Ryan can play as a left-back. Probably the best left-back in the last decade was <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a>, in spite of him being from two enemy clubs, but he was fantastic. But Ryan has lots of similarities with Ashley <b>[who Mourinho managed at Chelsea]</b>, and he can learn how to defend.

He was playing well, he adapted to our way of playing, would be good to have him as an option but it’s not possible so sad news for us, sad news for him. But he will be back and we will survive without him. I trust the other people that can play in the same position, like Danny did in the last match. And we still have other players that can do it. On top of that, I couldn’t be at it but I watched on video our youth team playing in the Champions League, and we also have <b>[Dennis Cirkin]</b>. OK, he’s 17 but he’s a kid with a lot of quality, and I look forward to bringing him to train with us, and to help his development.<br /><br />We have options - Danny Rose is the natural left-back, <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Jan Vertonghen</a> can do it, he did it already for the club and for the national team.

I have lost 150-180 - Carlo is a little bit older than me. I think now it is not about how much you won, it is about the matches we didn’t lose. So, probably the best managers now are the managers with zero defeats. The only reason I can understand is that they look through the CVs and see guys with more defeats and guys with less defeats, so guys with less defeats are given the job. I cannot find another reason<br /><br />If you don’t win, it is better being close to winning than to be far away. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> were close to winning the league when <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> won, were close to winning the Champions League last season and close to winning the League Cup when I played against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>.

We know how to defend short corners, we train how to deal with short corners. The players involved in the short corner solution were not focused. So you concede a goal with a short corner and you concede a goal with a penalty. So the goals didn’t come from that superiority, they came from mistakes.<br /><br />Then in the second half we changed, we felt we needed to change and we had much more control and we were in our best period of the game and one goal would change the emotion of the game because the game on the pitch was already changed.<br /><br />In the first half <b>[the ball]</b> was in our half and in the first 15-20 minutes of the second half we were much more in their half, the game changed. We were looking for a goal and instead of a goal comes a red card. Then the game obviously is easy for them to control with players technically good and one player more.

If I was one of my attacking players, I’d be very frustrated that behind we are not able to stop it, so it’s frustrating.

Another thing is what you call the direct replacement. To be that he needs to work. The next step for him is to sign a new contract at the club long-term and then it is for everyone to decide what is the best for his development. In this club we care about our players. It is also to find the best pathway to develop. He’s 17 years old. I don’t think at the age of 17 it’s good for you to go on loan to a Championship club or to go abroad to another country.

There were various decisions but I leave that for the pundits, I leave that for the referees’ specialist to do.

It’s impossible to always be dominant against them<br /><br />In the second half I think the game was more 50-50, we weren’t as dominant as we were in the first half. We tried with the ammunition we have in the last period to bring energy and more depth from midfield with Gedson, with more vision, more quality from <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a>.

But we want to do things not to resolve the problems of today or tomorrow but things that are also good for the future.<br /><br />For example, <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Steven Bergwijn</a> - I prefer to say Stevie - is the kind of player that is good for now but also good for our future, the direction we want to go. With the difficulties of the market in January, it was really hard to find the striker that is good not just to resolve the problems of today but also the future of the team. So probably we’re not going to do it.<br /><br />I cannot hide. If I say it’s easy to play three competitions without a striker, I’m going to lie. I cannot lie. You know that’s important for us. If it’s not possible, its not possible. For me the great thing is that we’re all together on this in the club. There’s nobody to blame and say you didn’t do your job well or you could do better than you did. Not at all.<br /><br />Again we don’t want a striker to just help us now, to be useful for us. We want a striker to be good for our future, possible to play with <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> together in the future. And with the difficulties of the market, it was very, very difficult to find <b>[one]</b>.<br /><br />To find a winger that fits in our way of playing - young, creative, enthusiastic with a lot of <b>[room to]</b> develop - that can also create a connection with the fans because we know what the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> fans want. We found with Stevie this profile of player. It’s not the perfect situation but it’s where we are.<br /><br />The good things for me are always the feelings, the positive feelings - and we’re together on this. As a team we have to face the rest of the season the way it is and give everything we can to have the best possible results.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about speculation surrounding <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>, Mourinho was dismissive]</b> I thought you were going to ask about <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> or <a href="gabriel-jesus.html">Gabriel Jesus</a> but you ask about <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>.

Lamela, do you know how many training sessions he had with the team? Zero. Direct from injury, to recovering on the pitch with the physios to 20 minutes of a game in the Champions League. That is our team. You can look at it and see two perspectives. One perspective is of an amazing group with amazing guys that try everything, from another side you see how we are in this moment.

Schick is tired, come off, there’s <b>[Yussuf]</b> Poulsen. This is our situation, it’s like going to a fight with a gun without bullets.

We don’t have a striker and we have tired players, it’s as simple as that. We did very, very well. If we score before our opponent, I think we have a chance because we are well organised. But when they score before us and drop back it’s very, very difficult for us.<br /><br />A defeat is a defeat, but the good thing is that in the last seconds the players were still fighting for a result and that for me is a very important thing.</p>

  <p><b>[Mourinho insists Parrott still not ready as <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> boss defends makeshift striker Alli]</b> The match was close and will always be close. If you look at it in that perspective then yes, we missed a big chance to score a beautiful goal and to make the score 3-1. That’s football though, and nobody’s to blame. Ben arrived in a great position, the cross is great and Dele makes the run that he has to make. He’s pretty good in the air for a player who is not a striker. He’s a good header of the ball. He was unlucky. Obviously without the strikers we tried different solutions. I think it worked in the sense that we managed to score goals. We managed to have some opportunities. We managed to arrive in dangerous positions. I believe we had more possession than them. We had more control than them<br /><br />He is not ready, he is not ready. He’s a good kid, a good talent, he’s a kid we want to help. He’s a kid who needs help, not just on the pitch but outside the pitch.

He was on the bench because Erik Lamela told me before the game he was not even ready to go on the bench. So, in that moment, without Lamela, we brought Troy in and in the last five minutes we put on a striker who at least knows the position so he could try to fix <a href="conor-coady.html">Conor Coady</a>, giving Dele some more space and freedom.

Many fantastic players in their first season in a new country, for different reasons, they struggle. There are many, many examples of that. He’s a player with great talent and has to know he has to do much better and know I cannot keep giving him opportunities to play because the team is much more important than the players, and the players must be on the pitch as a consequence of their performance. This is performance-level football</p>

That sometimes happens. You hope it doesn’t, but I thought that second half there was everything seemed to be given for very little. I think we had six bookings. I haven’t seen every incident but that seems bizarre to me<br /><br /><b>[Dyche called for the game’s authorities to review refereeing incidents]</b> I think the game has got to be careful at the minute and the powers that be need to take a look at what’s going on. You can’t not get a decision because you’re trying to play the game correctly. I don’t think you can do that. That’s wrong. We all know that. So they’ve got to look at that, and today was a good example of that. Chris Wood, fouled in the box, definite foul - if that’s anywhere else on the pitch it’s given as a foul - and yet it’s not, in the box today</p>

I found a sad player, without confidence. Then I was trying to give him that confidence back. I played him immediately, and in a position I thought was his natural position (central midfield)<br /><br /><b>[But]</b> we needed a little bit more creation and dynamic in midfield, because we wanted to give the team an offensive character. And then, when we lost the attacking players, I thought more when you don’t have the goalscorers you need more players that have a little bit more creation, so we went a bit more in the direction of players like <b>[Giovani]</b> <a href="giovani-lo-celso.html">Lo Celso</a>, even playing in a double pivot<br /><br />Then I spoke with him (Dier) a few times. He was always giving me the idea that his best feeling would be playing as a centre-back, and my answer at that time was I think this is something to maybe start him in next pre-season<br /><br />By different circumstances, I decided to play him against <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> in a back-three, where I thought he would be less exposed and, with the ball, a midfield player. He played so, so well. Then I decided ‘okay, the feeling is so good, let’s go with a back-four when it is more difficult for a centre-back’. He did so, so good again. So now we have the feeling that maybe it’s his best position<br /><br />And again, more important than what I or my assistants feels, or data says, is what the player feels. And he loves to play there. You can see his attitude on the pitch; leadership, confidence. So maybe there is a good solution for him. And in a world where there are not so many centre-backs, in this moment, at a high level, he is a good solution for us</p>

We cannot compete, we cannot do one versus one, we have to keep a certain distance, we cannot compete. <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, Son, <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Bergwijn</a>, <a href="moussa-sissoko.html">Sissoko</a>, all of them are fine. I think with a couple of weeks of normal training, when the authorities tell us we can train normally I think in a couple of weeks, the boys will be ready to play, of course not in the maximum of their potential, I think nobody can do that in this moment. For us, of course, it is a great feeling, because we finished the period with that defeat at Leipzig, where we were really, really in trouble to have 11 players, including attacking players, and in this moment Lamela, Son, Dele, <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Bergwijn</a>, everybody is fit now.</p>

I don’t think it will be in July or August anymore, it has to go further than that. It is normal you are going to have a different market, I don’t see the world - especially the football world - ready for some crazy numbers we used to have. I would like my club to be what I know what we will be: sensible, balanced and not going to spend rivers of money. We are trying to respect the situation, not just the football but the situation in the world and society overall<br /><br />To be honest in this moment it is the last thing we are thinking. In the club we are not thinking about it. No talks about it, because in this moment we think about safety, following every rule inside of the training ground, we are trying to be perfect, not just in the testing but in everything in the club, we are trying to be perfect. Since the moment <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> started, the Portuguese league and Spanish league announced a date to start, I think it is the most difficult moment for us, because we want to play.

Everyone has pre-season injuries in normal seasons, so we cannot expect now not to have an injury here, an injury there. We cannot ask for more than the authorities are giving us, which is the maximum security, and I think now it’s time just to play and to give people what people want.<br /><br />There was a moment we were all scared about when we would start. Is the season is over?. Next season will start September, October, November <b>[…]</b> who knows? But then less doubts, less doubts, less doubts and now it feels like it’s coming. We want to play.

Hamstring, which is something he’s had problems with in the past, even in this season, and is always something that makes the medical department think about it</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Dier: Jose Mourinho criticises decision to give <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> midfielder four-game ban]</b> My feeling is that in the majority of the cases, football is not protected by the people that are powerful and doesn’t belong to this world. That’s simply my feeling. Powerful people - that doesn’t belong to the tribe. And they don’t have the feelings. They don’t have the know-how, and it’s very, very difficult to lead something when you don’t have a clue about the world that you are leading<br /><br />I don’t think so honestly because if you appeal, you have other risks and let’s at least start next season without a suspension. We all know how it works with these FA decisions. You have access to the record of successful appeals and unsuccessful appeals… I don’t think we are going to appeal<br /><br /><b>[Mourinho, who also says the fan would be welcome back at the stadium once gates are open]</b> The fan had the opportunity to meet the player, had the opportunity to apologise to the player, had the opportunity to understand that we are very well paid but we are not robots. We are very well paid but we have families and friends that support us in the stadiums. So I think it was a good opportunity for that fan to turn his profile and become a different fan. It was <a href="eric-dier.html">Dier</a>’s own decision to do it, because the person in this case, first of all, is a <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> fan and was sorry about what happened. The way I was told he had the dignity to want to apologise to him. It was a nice thing that, in normal circumstances, especially after saying that he never felt under threat at any moment of the situation, would be enough for a fair decision.<br /><br /><b>[Speaking on <a href="eric-dier.html">Dier</a>’s move from midfield into central defence]</b> We made a decision together. I told him immediately since my arrival, ‘Let’s go in a certain direction but I think you are not ready, so let’s try to go back to a certain level being a midfielder but always with an eye of transforming you as a centre-back’, which is where he feels happiest. He is very comfortable on the ball, the building up of play and without any kind of problem attacking the space in front of him -being an extra man and building up play in the midfield. I think he is doing very well, we look forward to next season where from the beginning I have no doubts he will be there as a centre-back. I think he is going to be an important player for us.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the severity of <a href="dele-alli.html">Alli</a>’s injury]</b> Small but he’s not ready for tomorrow.

But at Sheffield I could blame myself and the players, today I could not do that different.<br /><br />The performance was not good enough, but good enough to win. I am not saying a strong performance or a sharp one but good enough to win. In a way they surprised us with the way they played, since Bournemouth were in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> I don’t remember them playing the way they did, but that is an option for them because they have a point they wanted. But I think we were not sharp, we were dominant behind, it was an easy game behind but then lack of sharpness in attacking areas.

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> need to rediscover cutting edge]</b> We want to keep our defensive organisation as it is giving us good numbers but we’re not scoring enough goals. We’re not being dangerous and attack-minded enough despite all the attacking players on the pitch. At the moment there is a contradiction between the amount of attacking players we have on the pitch and our production. We are arriving in good positions, we have good percentages of ball possession and spend the majority of the time in the opponent’s half. But there is no sharpness or objective - there’s too many touches, we’re not clear or aggressive or making sharp killer decisions<br /><br />We cannot get any better players than what we have. I like them all. It’s one thing to say we are not scoring enough goals but another to say my players are not good enough - and my players are very good. So in relation to the transfer market - I don’t want to replace my attacking players.<br /><br /><b>[Oliver has been the VAR official in Spurs’ last two away games, where there were controversial decisions in both]</b> I cannot speak about it, I don’t like to speak about it.

It is very important. They are very important in the game, I think so. It would stop nothing, make things much more open, much more clear. It would give the ref the chance to say, ‘Yes, I made a mistake - I feel sorry for that’, or ‘Yes I had incredible performance’.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho exclusive: I want to see my <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> against Arsenal]</b> Maybe some of the boys want something different. When I am in a club, I like to be one of them and I like to feel what my people feel. It’s a new feeling for me when I move from club to club, but I learn that feeling very, very fast. I would say that the moment I put my foot in a club for the first time, I learn it automatically. So yes, I am one of them. In this case, one of us, which is <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> people. What is important for the fans is important for me<br /><br />It was a moment where <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> was really living a difficult moment and Sporting were the champion. We were going to the match with the whole country thinking that the champion would dominate the derby, but we won, and we won in such a fantastic way<br /><br /><b>[What, then, does he want to see from his players against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>?]</b> My mentality. I want the team to be a reflection of what the coach is. When that happens, that’s when you feel, ‘This is really my team’. This is something that is not a finger click. It’s a process. But if you have that feeling that it is your team even when you lose matches - because you will always lose matches - then that is when you are really happy.<br /><br />The world changes, society changes, young people change. Everything changes and there is no way back. But we have to adapt to the new world. We have to adapt to the new football that, I keep saying, is not on the pitch, it’s the new football outside the pitch. We need to adapt to it, but when we believe strongly in something, we cannot give up and just play the safe side of it, just by saying that these are new times. When you really believe in something, you have to fight for it<br /><br />To come mid-season to a team in this situation is not easy. I think it’s good, in relation to next season, because it helps you to prepare. But for the moment it’s not a very easy situation, especially for myself as this is only the second time I have done it in my career.<br /><br />I think it’s a similar process to us. A coach that comes mid-season, trying to do things now that help the team to get a position in the table but that he can also transfer to the next season. So when they change system, when they go with four at the back or five, when they go with two in the middle or three, when they go with <b>[Pierre-Emerick]</b> <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> as a nine or on the left, I think it’s a normal process of a team in this situation. Lately, they have found a way of playing that has given them very good results and I think this is the kind of feeling that a manager likes to have, because then probably the manager says, ‘Okay, this is working and it’s something that I must keep for the future.’ I think you have to look to the future and that’s what we are all doing.</p>
