If you are successful in any job, I believe it is because you are in love with that job, and if you have a successful family it is because people are in love with each other. I’m romantic in the sense that the people I love, they have to know that I love them, and they do know it, and they feel it. My wife did a tattoo and challenged me to do it. I didn’t at first because I always felt, ‘Urrrgh, it hurts’ and ‘I don’t have to do this to my skin’, and so on and so on. But it was her birthday and I thought it would be a good gift to her. So I had my wife and my kids’ names on my wrist and it was not as painful as I thought. It was easy. For me, the perfect weekend is when I am at home with my family. Perhaps watch my son play football and then have dinner in a restaurant. <b>[When I watch my son play]</b> I am the quietest father of the group.

It’s a special contract for me because I’m used to signing new contracts with clubs after a big achievement, with Chelsea after being champion, in Inter after winning a Scudetto, at Real Madrid after winning La Liga. Here it is just a consequence of my work. We believe in each other and we are happy with each other. I think I am doing the things that the owners and the board think are the right things for the future of the football club.<br /><br /><b>[The players in particular will feel the benefit of this deal]</b> I think honestly it is good for them, even if there are one or two - or more, I don’t know! - who are not happy with my new contract, it is good even for them to know that I am going to stay!</p>

But I made a few changes thinking about the characteristics of this game and I think this kid <b>[McTominay]</b> has a great desire to recover the ball when the team is not in possession, he’s a kid that chases the ball, that tries to recover high up the pitch and when he has the ball it is always simple and against opponents like Huddersfield, so close and with so many bodies behind the ball, the simplicity sometimes is genius.<br /><br />You don’t have space, you have to open spaces by playing simple, so was a decision to play the kid but Paul came on very, very well with a great attitude with the spaces that we had at that time because we were winning 1-0 and Paul could show his talents and his qualities. I always try to do what is best for the team in any moment. I prefer to look at it in the beautiful way of a little kid that arrived here with his mum at nine-years-old for the first training session, 10 or 11 years later the kid is playing in a Manchester United shirt in an important match in the Premier League at home at Old Trafford, so I prefer to look at that perspective.<br /><br />Paul is a fantastic player, no doubt for me one of the most talented midfield players in the world but to sit on the bench one day is not the end of the world.</p>

We have Alexis, we have Romelu Lukaku, we have Martial, we have Rashford. Rashford can play on the left and on the right, Alexis is exactly the same, all of them apart from Lukaku can also play from behind, they can also play as a second striker.<br /><br />It’s bad for you because you like to have things to write and things to speculate especially in the summer, but I don’t want attacking players so don’t speak about attacking players coming here because nobody is coming here. Juan Mata, Lukaku, Rashford, Martial, Alexis … I don’t want attacking players so for speculation in the summer you have to go to other areas, but for attacking players I am really happy.

To be honest, at half-time he was already, because I can analyse body language, he was already at half-time showing that he was ready, he was already with the physio, was already starting his warming up.

A big lie that our relationship is not good, a big lie that we don’t communicate, a big lie that we don’t agree with his positions and his involvement in the dynamic of the team. So, be objective and say what we all know: in the last couple of matches he didn’t play well. Period. End of story. Now, it’s my problem and Paul’s problem to deal with it and try to improve his performance level.<br /><br />I would like you to tell me which position Pogba played in against Newcastle. Anyone of you want to tell me? OK, midfield, but did we play with one number six and two number eights, or two sixes and one 10? We played with one six and two eights. We played with <b>[Nemanja]</b> Matic as a six, <b>[Jesse]</b> Lingard on the right side of Matic and Pogba on the left side<br /><br />Do you know which is Pogba’s preferred system? Four-three-three. Do you know Pogba’s favourite position in a 4-3-3? Eight on the left, so it’s easy and honest and objective to say Paul didn’t play well against Newcastle, but don’t let people read things that are not true. You are paid to read the game and explain the game. Don’t say bull<em>**</em>.<br /><br />He had a big injury in the season, big injury, he almost went to surgery like <b>[Ousmane]</b> Dembele in Barcelona with a similar injury, the decision was not to do it and go to a conservative treatment, everyone <b>[was]</b> really happy. He had a red card against Arsenal, probably in his best match and the team’s best moment. He was out for a long, long time and in this moment he is not playing well, period. And the team needs him at a good level. When he is not a good level, the team is not as good. It happens with every team when the most crucial players are not performing. You don’t need to come with ‘we want to sell him’, you don’t need that. Some people go in that direction, some of them I know for many, many years and their surname is liar, and that’s not nice.

They want to perform the best they can, they don’t like to make mistakes.

So, if the referees are happy with that technological support, then yes, let’s go for the VAR. I think, from my perspective, I like the feeling.<br /><br />Of course, they need adjustments.

Against Liverpool if you play bad when you have the ball you can be in trouble. In the second half it was not our intention - I cannot say this was the plan. Liverpool pushed us into a defensive situation but we kept control. It was a complete performance by us with two different halves. If people don’t think we deserved it, I don’t care. I am a bit tired, we have a match on Tuesday. I don’t care what people say. The boys are happy, I’m happy.</p>

If you leave the technical area a couple of metres - in this case 20 metres! - to speak with a player and not complaining with a refereeing decisions … I think they made the right decision</p>

We could finish this season with 88, 89, 90 points. Not acceptable, the last defeat. Not acceptable, the performance at Huddersfield. Not acceptable, the performance at Newcastle. So, we lost a few matches that we should do better. Can we improve next season? Let’s try. Can Manchester City keep this level or improve this level? Only they can say. But if they have the team they have and if they are going to invest on top of the team they have, of course it is going to be very difficult for us</p>

I know that one thing is to go to a club that is prepared to win and you just need to arrive and give the last touches, to give your personal quality, personal knowledge and the team, and the club, is ready just for the last click I knew that was not the case here. The owners knew that. The CEO, he knew that. So when the question was, in this period of my career, am I ready for this kind of job? Yes, I am ready because my career was about new things all the time. I was always very Portuguese in the sense that I’m always ready to discover and try new things, always ready to change country, to change club, to change culture, to change everything in the search of new things. I did all of that. So when I came in this period to Manchester United I was ready for this and I knew it was not to come and have simultaneous success<br /><br />In spite of it, three trophies, three finals, probably a third or fourth in worst-case scenario.

He has all the attributes that a full-back needs: physicality, tactical intelligence and technical quality, combined with a Porto Academy mentality which prepares players for the maturity they need at the professional level. In his age group, he is the best full-back in Europe and we all believe he has a bright future ahead of him at Manchester United.</p>

It’s the determination of making it happen. The majority of French players were too comfortable or not wanting to risk too much, or not confident enough to make things happen. <b>[Kylian]</b> Mbappe didn’t have a great game, nor Ousmane Dembele or Antoine Griezmann. The midfield were very positional, Paul didn’t interfere a lot in the game, but then - this action is the action of a No 8. That’s what people used to call the box-to-box midfielders. And in this case, that was the action of an attacking part of box-to-box. It’s a pity it wasn’t a clean shot to make it a brilliant goal, but it got them the three points</p>

If I was in charge of the FA there would be no doubt that I would keep Gareth Southgate and Steve Holland in their jobs and give them the chance to take the team to the next Euros and the next World Cup.

If during the season, he trains with us and if during the season, he has a couple of occasions to play minutes with us, I don’t know, it depends, especially some cup matches.

That’s the spirit we need, because our first two or three weeks in the Premier League are going to be really hard for us… we didn’t prepare for that.<br /><br /><b>[Mourinho was able to draw some positives from the fixtures]</b> People like Herrera, Eric Bailly, Matteo Darmian, Mata, all these guys, were phenomenal during the whole pre-season, playing almost every minute of every game. The game today - if we win 2-1, we lose 2-1 or draw 2-2 - it doesn’t change anything but of course I know the players and I know I can count on them. I know that these guys are amazing professionals and I know that they give everything for the club, for the prestige of the club. The guys were absolutely phenomenal. My players were amazing in their effort but we have more effort in front of us because in a few days, we go to Munich and in 10 days, we start the Premier League</p>

I gave a list to my club with five names a few months ago and I wait to see if it’s possible to have one of these players.<br /><br />The market ends on August 31, so there is plenty of time but obviously, the objective for me as manager is always to have the players as soon as possible and try to coach them in the team and develop the team with them.<br /><br />We are Manchester United. We have to improve every year and I know that a lot of players, a lot of good players, will come in next summer. That’s for sure<br /><br /><b>[Mourinho has softened his public stance, even putting his frustrations into context in an interview]</b> I think in every pre-season it happens basically the same with probably every club, which the manager wants more. It is our nature and our way to always want more for your team. But then club decisions are different and normally you don’t get what you want, which happened basically during all my career. So, if I get one player until the end of the market, that’s fine</p>

I think his objective is to win a top-two position in the Championship to be promoted, but of course we had Derby County last season in the FA Cup at Old Trafford and every team from the Championship that visits a Premier League team is always a special motivation for them</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has slammed his critics in an astonishing rant]</b> Speaking about Marcus, I think I can expect that Sunday I’m going to be highly criticised for not playing him tomorrow, because some of the boys are really obsessed with me and some of them have a problem with some compulsive lies. So I can expect that Sunday some of them will wake up in the morning and the first thing they think of is Jose Mourinho, so I can imagine on Sunday I am going to be criticised for not playing Marcus but it’s not my fault, he’s suspended, so probably you should remind them he is suspended and cannot play. So I’m going to do something, not for you, but the United fans, and I think I hold myself to the United fans and so for them I am going to spend two mins with you.<br /><br />In 2016-17, Marcus Rashford played 32 Premier League matches, 11 Europa League matches, including the final, three FA Cup matches, six League Cup matches, including the final, and the Community Shield. He had 53 appearances, but if you want to take to the minutes of play, he played 3,068, and if you want to divide that by 90-minute matches, he played 34.2 matches of 90-minute matches in 2016-17. In 2017-18, he played 35 Premier League matches, eight in the Champions League, five in the FA Cup, three League Cup matches and the European Super Cup final. He played a total of 52 matches with 2,676 mins, and if you divide that by 90, it gives you 29.7 matches, so with me, in two seasons, he had 105 appearances, 5,774 mins, 63.7 matches of 90 minutes, including five finals, so the people speaking about these minutes, I think they are a bit confused<br /><br />Marcus is not Dominic Solanke, not Ruben Loftus-Cheek, not Dominic Calvert-Lewin, he’s Marcus Rashford, a Manchester United player, with an incredible number of appearances and an incredible number of minutes played at the highest level in the best possible competitions. So Manchester United supporters, for you and just for you, to know what we are doing with Marcus, Luke Shaw, Jesse Lingard, Scott McTominay, that’s what we are doing here<br /><br />Some of the persons, everybody knows they have double salaries, they work also for the clubs and of course they are not independent and they conduct things in the direction they want, that’s obvious. It’s natural, not ethical, but I accept it. The ones that wake up in the morning and the first thing that comes into their mind is Jose Mourinho and Manchester United, I feel sorry for them because there are more exciting things in life. The most important thing of all is that the kid is a good kid, a good player, knows what Manchester United did for him, starting in the academy, then Mr Van Gaal’s support, my support, the club’s support, a new contract, new shirt, and selected for every single match. Since I was here, he was never one day out for selection because of my decision, only if injured or suspended. He was never, ever out for selection, so he knows, and that’s the most important thing</p>

I have no direct relation with the people that write or the people that listen. I have a direct relation with the players - not only Paul - the players. And he never told me he wants to leave.

Juan Mata and Ander Herrera, even if they are not playing or not playing a lot, not starting matches, by the personality point-of-view and character point-of-view, by what they represent in the modern society in football, they are almost unique pieces that I also don’t want to lose</p>

I think that’s going to be devastating for Man United and Jose, but it’s still a bit early to tell. There were signs they were on the right track, they had a comfortable win in Europe. But maybe that European game has affected some of the players on Saturday. Maybe that was the real key element that Manchester United underperformed. Manchester United have always been able to cope with that situation but maybe they didn’t cope with it so well. It’s always a good time to play against a team when they come back from Europe, whether it’s the Europa League or Champions League.

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba and Jose Mourinho have seen their Manchester United row branded stupid]</b> If you are a captain or vice-captain, you’re more often than not speaking on behalf of the players, and there is nothing wrong with giving the manager your thoughts. But this shouldn’t be done in the media - it helps nobody for these arguments to be played out in public. Apart from the media themselves of course! In modern football, players are very powerful, they are the stars of the show. It’s normal for them to have opinions, but they need to be backed up. I’m really surprised it has got to this stage. This sort of thing really needs to be kept in-house. You’re all grown-ups, figure it out in the dressing room. For Mourinho to have gone as far as removing the vice-captaincy, Pogba must have provoked him - whether it was the comments after the Wolves game or something else. But these arguments affect everybody else and start having an impact on the pitch. As someone who wants Manchester United to do well, I’m fed up of waking up and seeing these headlines. Football should be about what happens on the pitch, not who has the biggest d*ck. It’s a stupid situation.<br /><br />I don’t think the solution to all this is for one or the other to leave. Mourinho is one of the best managers in world football and Pogba is a great player, a World Cup winner, who is still young and will improve. If a player is not happy, they have the right to speak to the manager about it, and if they are not doing that, it’s strange. Teams need to win and lose together</p>

If I’m not happy, he doesn’t play. Manchester United is bigger than anyone and I have to defend that<br /><br />I explain in a very detailed way to the people that have to know in detail, which is the squad and especially Paul, so Paul and the other players in the squad know in detail the reason why myself and my coaching staff, we decided to do that. I always analyse a player as a player. When a player is captain, I analyse the player by the player and captain perspective, and after weeks of analysing and changing opinions with my coaching staff, we made the decision Paul is just a player and not a captain. Decision made. I informed the player and the players. When I was asked after the match on Tuesday, I confirmed my decision and now I’m confirming it again. It’s the end of the story<br /><br />I can anticipate more questions by saying the relationship of player and manager is good. It’s not anymore a relationship of a captain, or one of the captains, and a manager. It’s just a player-manager relationship. Some players trained as well as him but not better than him, and he’ll play tomorrow, so end of story.<br /><br /><b>[Mourinho refused to reveal what he said to provoke Pogba’s reaction]</b> No, I cannot tell you. The training session was open, you had some cameras with potential to get some of the words. Maybe you have to change that potential if you want to know everything, because I’m not going to comment.<br /><br />Disruptive? I think for you it was amazing, because you made a story, an incredible story out of 15 minutes of open training session. Maybe it is your fault <b>[United’s press officer]</b> … what happened the other day happens many days, conversations with players I have many, many, many times. It was not the case, but loud criticism, loud instructions happen every day. Coaching is about that, but you make a story about it.

  <p><b>[Mourinho drools over Juve centre-back duo]</b> Things were not coming <b>[off]</b>, but everybody tried, everybody was strong, everybody was strong mentally to try until the end. Juventus felt it and, instead of the control they had in the first half, in the second half they defended and they ended the game with an extra central defender to add to the amazing Chiellini, the amazing Bonucci. Mr Bonucci and Mr Chiellini could give some Harvard University classes about how to be a central defender. A team with everything - they have talent everywhere, all over the pitch. So it was a really difficult match for us. I thought before the game, and during the game, I thought that we could take something out of this game, but it was not possible. We didn’t manage to score but I’m happy with the players.<br /><br />Juventus have a different level of quality and stability and experience and knowhow and at the base of the team, they have Bonucci and Chiellini. That’s the base that allows them to play with the freedom that they play in attack. With Cristiano <b>[Ronaldo]</b>, with Dybala, with people creating. Lose the ball? No problem, we are here, so I think probably the effort of the boys would deserve a goal in the last minute of the second half. We deserved a draw, a point, but it was not possible. But I have no complaints with my boys. I have a positive feeling towards their effort and on Sunday <b>[against Everton]</b>, we have another match to think about<br /><br />Since the draw, we’ve known it’s going to be a fight with Valencia for the second position and that is what we are going to try <b>[to do]</b>.

In the tunnel, before the game, I was speaking with (Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli) and I was telling him ‘since I left Inter, you have seven titles in a row and it looks like the eighth is coming’. And he told me: ‘I don’t want the eighth. I want 10 in a row’. I think that’s a fantastic answer and a fantastic statement.

To be honest, I don’t know the structure of how Juventus is run, but I like the philosophy behind their work<br /><br />My belief is that you did not take me seriously when I said that the second position was a phenomenal position for us and that this season was going to be difficult.

In other matches we should have better results and until end of December we have to focus on what we have in potential, problems with quality and try to go. In this moment we are outside the top four and we have to push hard and to work hard and try to get into this top four position.<br /><br /><b>[United are five points off fourth-placed Arsenal and Mourinho feels that represents a far more achievable goal]</b> When you are outside the top four I don’t think you should speak about title. When you are top four you can look up, see the distance, look to the fixtures, to the calendar. You can look to the situation at the moment, injuries, suspensions, form and then you can feel it, but in this moment we are outside top four. So the point is now to get the points we need to try and be in the end of December in a better position than we are in now</p>

We work every day but the reality is that we don’t start matches well, but if we don’t start well and we end well, that’s fine. It’s good fun for the fans, but football is 90 minutes and especially when your opponent is strong, if you give them a 45 minute advantage, or even 20 or even 10, you have a mountain to climb. The good thing is that lately, apart from the Juventus match, we were strong enough to climb the mountain and change the match in the last few minutes. When you play against a super team, like tomorrow, if you give an advantage away, it’s difficult to climb the mountain. We work a lot on our defensive organization. I’m sure you’re not going to say I do not work on that because you say the opposite! The reality is that we concede too many goals, and the way that we concede them shows our weaknesses. Weaknesses that sometimes you can hide, sometimes you can’t. It’s a big match to play tomorrow, they’re favourites to win the competition<br /><br /><b>[When quizzed on another hot topic, the European Super League]</b> I’m not interested in that</p>

Crystal Palace deserve the credit. They came for this and they got it and fought for it and gave everything for it. I don’t want to take their credit away We should also blame ourselves as we started really well and did the most difficult thing apart from score which is to find the spaces to play, by analysing the opponents and training and bringing the ideas to the game. We used the sides very well and made them move to one sides and then go to the other but there was not enough intensity, not enough desire. It is a game we really need to win. If we play with the same philosophy against Young Boys then we won’t win and have to go to Valencia and win there. There are games that are special and not just one more: this was a special game, the first of eight Premier League games until the end of December and a game we need to win and it was not enough from the heart. You must play with brain and also with heart and I think there was not enough heart<br /><br />You cannot change players’ natures dramatically, The solution is that probably I have to make certain choices based on heart and then probably I will blame myself because I will think heart is not enough and am missing some quality. Palace deserve some credit but we have to blame ourselves. Hennessey apart from the brilliant saves, he wasted 10 minutes every time he had the ball for goal kicks, but we also lost probably 30 minutes by letting them breathe when they have the ball. We didn’t have that intensity that in my opinion is basically related with your brain, with your heart.

He played against Russia three days ago or two days ago, but of course, we need him when he plays. He was probably our best player. He was a brave lad, but he probably punished himself.</p>

The performance had lots of good things but lots of disappointing things. This is the kind of game if you score in the first minute you go for a different kind of performance. You could pay with not just a defeat. David’s save, the only save in the game, was phenomenal, only the best goalkeeper in the world can save. More than one chance. We had what I call half chances a lot, when the winger has the ball and 20 metres to attack but has the fear of the penalty from the defender he has to go by him. We can’t blame one player. The most important thing is a goal. Of course I’m happy with the intensity the boys put in, it’s not difficult to cope with the pressure of a result that doesn’t suit us</p>

In our club, when a player does not play, it is always because the player is not behaving and has disciplinary issues. Of course that is not the case again. He has an important injury, I don’t want to risk by saying for how long he will be out but from the top of my experience I would say he is not playing this year. No scans yet. But the player is experienced, the player knows what the injury is and also from the top of my experience, just the painful scream and the way the injury happened I know it’s going to be for a long time. It’s not a little muscular injury that in one week or 10 days the player is ready, is for me and also for Alexis, the feelings before the scans is that the grade is different than the Lindelof one and the Lindelof one was not an easy one, so I think Alexis has what I used to call an aggressive muscular injury.<br /><br />No he is not injured, but it is quite curious because you always speak about the ones who are not playing.

Everybody knows Marouane is not Maradona but everyone knows what Marouane is and what he can give.

I know him very well and I know the positions he can play, the jobs he can do. This season you saw him as a third central defender against Burnley and you saw him as a striker and as a number eight, which is basically the position where Marouane has more balance and know how but he’s very important in both boxes, in the first third and in the last third.

Obviously, the manager wants him to stay, the board wants him to stay, David wants him to stay… his agent is not the kind of agent that is manipulative like others.

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has found support from a former Manchester United star]</b> Jose Mourinho is an emotional man, he has been all his career. We know that - but, at the minute, everything he does, everybody is jumping on it, trying to make it a negative story. Pundits likes Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes, the ones who keep having a go at Mourinho and United all the time, they’ve not managed, they’ve not had to make the big decisions. I understand they have to have opinions - I’ve done both roles, I can see it from both sides - but they don’t know what it’s like to be in that situation as a manager. Let’s have it right: there was nothing wrong with Mourinho’s reaction to Marouane Fellaini’s winner against Young Boys in the week.<br /><br />When the pressure is on, and the pundits are sharpening their knives, and you can see it happening in front of you as your team is drawing 0-0 with Young Boys after drawing with Palace, to get a last-gasp winner is incredible. In Turin, after the Juventus game, I agreed that he didn’t need to go on the pitch - irrespective of how he felt he’d been treated by the Italian fans - because it was such a great comeback from the boys, he should’ve just let them take the glory. But the one on Tuesday night was completely different. His reaction totally makes sense to me. If I was playing for Jose, and had looked across and seen that reaction, I would’ve been absolutely buzzing. This is a manager who wants to win, who has got passion. I’m all for Mourinho doing that, there’s nothing wrong with showing your emotions.<br /><br />It’s been difficult for Jose, and I don’t think people are recognising this. Since Sir Alex left, it hasn’t worked out - David Moyes and Louis van Gaal took the club backwards five years. Mourinho has been playing catch-up since he arrived. People expected him to come in and wave a magic wand, but they’re so far behind the likes of City, Liverpool, and Tottenham, who have had their teams for a period of time. It’s an incredibly tough job</p>

We don’t score chances that we have and chances in this case, goals have a huge impact in the way the game goes, obviously Young Boys wouldn’t defend the way they did if after 10 mins they are losing 2-0, sometimes is because of efficiency. Other times it is because of the way we approach the game, and obviously it’s a little confusing, because all of the work is based on strong starts and being intense and aggressive since the beginning</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho believes it is becoming increasingly difficult for top clubs to purchase talent from their competitors]</b> It depends. I will give you an example, that I hope is a good example. I hope you can interpret it in the right way. Is Manchester United by history, by its dimensions, bigger than Tottenham? With all the respect - Tottenham is an amazing club - I think everybody would say yes. Can we go to Tottenham and buy their best players? No - because they don’t sell or because they are so powerful that they can say no. A few years ago, who was Tottenham’s best player? Michael Carrick. A few years later, who was the best player? Berbatov. Can we go now there and bring Harry Kane, Dele Alli, <b>[Christian]</b> Eriksen, <b>[Heung-min]</b> Son? Can we go there and bring the guys here? No. So, who is more powerful now. Them or us?<br /><br />Football changes. It is more difficult to buy players of a high, high, high level. The clubs are more powerful and don’t want to sell. Before, the smaller clubs, they were almost begging the big clubs, ‘get my best player, I need to sell. Please, you are powerful, buy my best player’. At this moment, they don’t want to sell. It is more difficult to make the team better and stronger with buying. Unless you do what some clubs do, and for some reason they can do and others cannot. Which is, I need a right back and a left back. Send away the ones you have and buy four at the same time. It is difficult, so we do what we can. Last season was fantastic to finish second and we are fighting hard. I know we have to do better than we are doing. But one thing is to do better and another thing is to try and compare ourselves with what Manchester United was in the past. Not just because Manchester United was fantastic, but because there was a big difference to the others and, at the moment, it is not like that</p>

Obviously there was a great improvement in that team from last season in relation to this season, but I don’t think Everton will be in front of us at the end of the season. There are six teams that should stay in the first six positions. Season after season, two of these teams are staying outside the top four. Last season was Arsenal and Chelsea, and this season two of these six are going to stay outside. Who is the best team of the six? The team with more potential? The team with less potential? Who is the team performing not so well? These will be the questions and answers around the top six. At the end of the season, the top six will be done by the six teams we all know have that responsibility to finish in the top six</p>

Of course <b>[Victor]</b> Lindelof and Alexis <b>[Sanchez]</b>, we don’t even speak about them but we need answers and for sure we are going to play with players not in the maximum of their potential but players who will put themselves available for the team like Smalling did in the last match, like Jones did against Southampton, players in difficulty who go one step forward to try and help the team</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has reiterated his belief that he did a “fantastic job” in delivering a second-place finish for Manchester United]</b> Because I’m not speaking about our own situation but you can finish 10th, I’m not saying us, I’m saying a team can finish 10th and a manager feels like a champion. Correct? If you speak with David Wagner, Rafa Benitez, Claudio <b>[Ranieri]</b> now, if you speak with them and tell them you are going to finish 10th they will feel like a champion. I made a fantastic job, I stayed in front of many teams with more potential than my team. Last season I finished second and I felt we stayed ahead of teams with more potential than us. It’s as simple as that<br /><br />I want to be positive and think we are going to win but if we don’t, we give credit to the people that deserve credit. The game is not going to be 11 against 0, it’s going to be 11 against 11, good players in the other side. I repeat that the position, the points sometimes don’t say much about the real potential of the team. <b>[Ranieri is]</b> one of the two most important managers in the history of the Premier League, in my opinion, so they have the potential to come here and to give us a very difficult match</p>

We press the ball more, put difficulties to the opponent, we were fast in our transitions, so we had that spirit, we had that mentality that brought our game to a good level, to a better level.<br /><br />You know there are special players with special characteristics. Just to give you a couple of examples, Herrera, Rashford, they are the kind of players that even if their game was not phenomenal, that intensity, that desire, that passion, that sacrifice is always present.

  <p><b>[Mourinho salutes Man Utd successor <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> for stunning PSG success]</b> In terms of players I was immediately thinking about <b>[Dusan]</b> Tadic because I think he was a key player in that amazing match <b>[between Real Madrid and Ajax]</b>. But then after United’s victory, and putting together the two matchdays, Tuesday, Wednesday, and also because normally when things go wrong, everybody goes in the direction of the guilty manager, let’s say that. I think independent of the performances, Ajax and Manchester United results are phenomenal results, and if the responsibility in the bad days is for the managers, the responsibility of the good days is then also for the managers. So for me, <b>[Erik]</b> ten Hag from Ajax and <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> from Manchester United. Incredible results, so credit to them. I would say in relation to Ajax by the tactical perspective and also by the mental aspect of their game. For Manchester United I would say the mental side of it, the self-belief, so for me very special days for these two men.<br /><br />You can go in the pragmatic way and say football is not about ‘ifs’, it’s about results. Manchester United had four shots during 95 minutes, and in four shots scored three goals, and PSG had almost 70 per cent of ball possession, had more than 10 shots, and they scored only one. That’s the pragmatic way of looking at football, Manchester United scores three, and they deserve to go through</p>

But I would do two matches between English teams, which would mean two teams would be in the semi-finals. I think if the draw gives something like Manchester City versus Manchester United, or Tottenham against Liverpool, for example, I think they would be absolutely fantastic matches.<br /><br />My second choice would be not by tactical or emotional reasons but by what I think would be fantastic extra motivation. I would do Ajax versus Porto, as that would mean one of them reach the semi-finals. They are doing so, so well during the competition that I think it would be amazing for one of them. It would be amazing for Portugal as a country, Netherlands as a country, to have a team in the semi-final<br /><br />I wouldn’t like Juventus against Barcelona because I think it would be something really special. Barcelona against Juventus in a possible final or semi-final. Two great teams that are not being successful in the Champions League for a few years, of course Juventus so much more than Barcelona. And led by two big players, Cristiano <b>[Ronaldo]</b> and <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi, is something I wouldn’t waste on a quarter-final, I would wait a little bit more</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho was not surprised to see Lionel Messi dash the Red Devils’ Champions League dreams]</b> I think the United approach was different. In the first leg they tried to occupy that central zone. Messi’s position is easy to understand but it is not easy to create a cage to control him. He comes from the right, then stays in the middle, then <b>[Ivan]</b> Rakitic goes right and allows him to stay in the middle. It’s very difficult. Manchester United in the first match, zonally they occupied that area very well. When he came into the inside he was finding Fred, he was finding <b>[Scott]</b> McTominay coming to the inside all the time. But I think in <b>[the second leg]</b> because United were losing 1-0, they tried to start with a different perspective. Now it was <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba wide left, McTominay much more on the right and Jesse Lingard starting as a 10 behind the strikers. In front of the defensive line was only Fred. That’s the area that Messi comes to get the ball and when Messi has the ball one, one, one … you are dead. That’s why I never liked individual man-on-man against Messi.

But when you get into the quarter-finals, in a very respectful way, I always say there’s a 12.5 per cent chance for each team <b>[to win]</b>.

It’s 90 minutes, it’s the game of a career for the majority of the people. I think they’ll both be dreaming about it and they have good reason to dream about it.

When you have a squad with a profile that is very professional, very ambitious, hard-working, talented, a club structure, you don’t have that depreciation.<br /><br />When you’re almost alone when you don’t have the support of a club as a whole, then some players go towards someone who is against the coach, who is the nice guy. I don’t want to be the nice guy because this nice guy is a puppet after three months and that does not end well. But you can’t be the coach who is always negative. We must look for a balance. In fact, the problem of the coach is the same as a teacher at school. I understood this when one day a player told me: ‘Coach, please, if you want to criticise me, please don’t do it in front of the other players’. ‘Why’, I replied. Because it’s an attack on my status<br /><br />That’s a hell of a change. A team is a team. A group of players is a group of brothers. The coach is there like a father, he’s family, and in family, you talk openly. When a big player says something like that, you have to change the way you do things. The nice guy is not a coach, but you cannot be a man of permanent conflict. We must find a position, the one I could have with very mature squads. When you’re not the boss, you’re not the one with the power. You must be the leader</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has claimed he felt ‘almost caged’ in England]</b> I lived in England most of those years <b>[the 15 years since he left Portugal]</b>. I also spent some years in Spain where we walked there in the same habitat. Italy not so much. Italy really likes the game, the tactics. I usually have people talking about it, more polemic, less polemic, more aggressiveness, less aggressiveness, but they are people of great credibility and you have great names in football to discuss about football. But in England it’s day and night. For example, I’ve sometimes felt almost caged because you can’t even comment on the referee before the game. I was punished and well punished for pre-match statements and statements such as ‘I hope the referee is very well, that he resists pressure from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> Road, that he has an excellent performance’. This is forbidden. This is considered to somehow induce the referee, put some kind of pressure on him.<br /><br />Even speaking well of the referee, as I did, I was punished. In Portugal, you tell referees what you want, before the game, during and after the game, you’re punished with ridiculous small fines. There’s total impunity. And we’re talking only at this level. And then obviously we’re a country that should like this. The kind of TV shows that exist in Portugal and that exist simultaneously in three, four, five different channels and that are repeated from Monday to Sunday and that survive, is because Portuguese people like this. So maybe we have the football we want to have.<br /><br /><b>[Mourinho also heaped praise on Portuguese wonderkid <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a>]</b> To start with, I think it’s more important to describe even superficially <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>’s team, which was the habitat where he developed, and which allowed him to have conditions for it. I think things start there a little bit. The Portuguese championship is a championship that obviously has a big gap between the top teams and the others that allows a team to develop a dominant game, which is what <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> is developing at the moment. It’s a dominating team, that enters the field and wants to win, wants to score, that doesn’t have fears, that is winning by 1-0, 2-0 and that wants to win by three or four and that doesn’t fear the power - that also isn’t much - of the opponents. Joao is developing in a habitat created by Bruno Lage <b>[the coach]</b> and he develops his qualities.<br /><br />He said the other day that his position was that of a free role. A free role in high level football may not exist. A free role but subject to certain principles of play that he must know and surely knows. I think he’s a player who has a fantastic ability. From the point of view of defensive organisation, it’s better than what you might think. Usually when you say you have a free role, you think you’re not defending. He defends and I think he defends well. And I think that Bruno has defined from game to game the moments of pressure, the positions of pressure, and <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> presses, recovers, closes spaces, has a very good understanding of the game. I think he’s on the right track to be a great player. This issue of selling, not selling, should sell, should not sell, should leave, should not leave, <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> is the one who knows, <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> knows, his family knows.

In the context of 38 matches you cannot lose many points, especially at home against direct rivals if you want to win the title. I thought it was very important because there was not a contradiction between our words to the players, our ambitions, and then the result of the match. If you say ‘this season is to be champions’ and then the first match you lose 3-0 at home to a direct rival, you give one step back.<br /><br />So it was one step forward, there was a big relation between that match and what we tried to give to the team in pre-season which was mental strength, being compact, tactical discipline and then be really ambitious on that approach that sometimes I call the ‘all in approach’. You have to put everything in that game, in every minute of the game, every second of the game, it’s all in.

  <dd>Who are the highest-paid football coaches of all time? It’s no surprise to find Jose Mourinho towards the top of this list. The Portuguese enjoyed tremendous success in the dugout at the start of the millennium and has spent the best part of 15 years at the very top of the game, having graduated from <a href="bobby-robson.html">Bobby Robson</a>’s translator at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> to lead the likes of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and Inter. It was at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, however, where he earned his top pay, earning a reported £26.6m each year. He is currently out of work after being sacked <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> shortly before Christmas in 2018</dd>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho says he misses football and cannot enjoy his time away from the game, having been without a job since he was sacked by <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in December last year]</b> This is basically the first time I have time to think, the first time I am in Setubal at the end of July or beginning of August in more than 20 years. I have some time to think, to rethink, to analyse and what I feel is exactly that ‘Ze’ (Mourinho’s nickname as a boy) is full of fire! My friends tell me ‘enjoy your time, enjoy your July, enjoy your August, enjoy what you never had’. Honestly, I can’t enjoy. I am not happy enough to enjoy.<br /><br />I miss my football, I have the fire, I have a compromise with myself, with people that love me, with so many fans that I have around the world, so many people that I inspired. Ze has to be Ze and Ze until the last day, but I don’t see the last day because my next move will be like the start! I don’t feel it’s just one more year in accumulation of how many years I’ve worked, how many titles I’ve won. That is history, that is the museum! My future will start in my next move and, as I was saying, it looks a little bit ridiculous with so many beautiful things around me and so many things I didn’t <b>[have]</b> for so many years, but I can’t really enjoy my free time<br /><br /><b>[But with clubs like Inter, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> having already appointed new bosses this summer, the Portuguese looks unlikely to find a new team any time soon]</b> The most difficult thing for me is saying ‘no’ to the possibilities.

To say ‘no’ is very, very, very, very difficult. Why do I say ‘no’? I say ‘no’ because it’s not <b>[at]</b> the level of challenge that I want.

I have to be patient and wait for the right opportunity and the right opportunity is one that is at the same size and the same level that I am as a manager. It is the most difficult thing because I have the impulse during this period, so many times to say ‘Yes, I go’. But no, I cannot go. I cannot go. I have to wait for the exact right one. I <b>[have]</b> never told who <b>[is the right one]</b>. I never do that. Lots of respect for the people that think I am the right guy for them and I never do that</p>

This is about Mr Levy and the club. He has a vision and part of that is to make the club better and bigger. There is no better and bigger club without a better and bigger team. So, to keep the best players is obviously part of that plan. It was not like a promise to me. It was part of his explanation about his vision. Without being specific about players he told me he does not sell players when the manager doesn’t want to sell<br /><br /><a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>’s one of the best strikers in the world, no doubt. He just needs his team with him, if his team is England or <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, to bring him or to go with him to the next level. And what is the next level? Titles. I think he needs to win. He needs to bring something to highlight his quality, the goals he scores, what he brings to the team. He is a top striker and I’ve worked with some of the top ones<br /><br /><b>[He wants to see <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> rediscover his best form]</b> I have spoken with him and asked if he was Dele or Dele’s brother. He told me he was Dele. ‘OK,’ I said, ‘play like Dele’. He is potentially a fantastic player. I have to create a tactical situation he is happy with, give him the right dynamics and prepare him physically because he has had important injuries and he is not on the top of his form. I cannot expect him to go to <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> - if he plays - and be man of the match. But he needs to go through a process to bring the real Dele back because the real Dele is the one who has impressed us all<br /><br />I’m not going to try to be Einstein. I’m going to try to make the players play the way I want. Offensive football but winning matches. Not offensive football and don’t win a match for 10 or 11 months. But, yes, attacking football. You are not going to see <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> playing at left-back that is for sure</p>

Our squad is not a big squad in numbers, and he will start for sure because it’s impossible to play all the time with the same players.</p>

He was always telling me, a goalkeeper of a top team had to be different to the others because the goalkeeper of a top team doesn’t have 10 saves to make.

For some players, individually, it was their best performance since I arrived. Absolutely, good, good, good performances. We did what was possible to do. I think we deserve much more than this frustration for the result, but I’m proud of the boys.<br /><br />The only frustration from the game is that we conceded the goal from a throw-in and yesterday we spent half an hour on defensive throw-ins. I don’t know if the boys were disappointed that the throw-in was our throw-in and became theirs. I don’t know if there was a couple of seconds were <b>[players thought]</b> ‘it’s my ball and now there’s a throw-in against me’.

But we have to do things when it is possible to do, it is the right thing to do. This is not the last match of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s history. Next Wednesday we have another one, next season we have many more. We have to be calm, be loyal to these boys, respecting everything they are trying to do. If it happens it happens, if it doesn’t happen it doesn’t happen. But good feelings, not a good result but good feelings with the boys<br /><br />I promised I did not want to speak about the boys that are not playing and I have to try. But you know how important they are for us. It is not easy. Again, this is a kind of game, I am not saying we would win, but it is the kind of game where you have a goalscorer, where you have a guy who smells goals, probably you win it.<br /><br />You feel the same when you see the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game, in the last 20 minutes how many times we just need a tap-in. That missing link is there. But we are doing our work. We all know. Injuries, it is the <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> situation, we have our problems. But in this game and the game against Middlesbrough - okay you can say it is a Championship team but at this moment there is no big difference between <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and Championship - I think we showed good things. This organisation, this commitment, the intensity is going higher, the creation is there. I am happy with lots of things we did in the last few games.</p>

You know me quite well, enough to know that I am really happy. Difficult? Yes, but if it was not difficult it wouldn’t be for me. I like the players and who they are. I like very much the relationship I have with them. If you see a bad face from me it is because of a bad result. I cannot change myself. That’s just me. The reality is that I am happy and I look forward to what is coming, and even more for what is coming next season. I want to start working with them in July<br /><br />It’s very important. I can see small details. Even the warm-ups. I can see what TV and video don’t give me. To see the warm-ups and to see what the players do individually. Some skills that sometimes during the game are hidden. It’s a different intensity. It’s a different experience. I couldn’t miss the opportunity<br /><br />The players needed some days off. For their body and soul, they needed a rest. But not for me. I think the best way to try and help the team is to work</p>

  <p><b>[Mourinho: <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are ‘too nice’ but defeat to <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves FC</a> was ‘totally unfair’]</b> I don’t think it was a fair result. Both teams were looking to win with different styles. They are so powerful on the counter-attack. We tried different solutions. It worked in a way because we scored two goals. I think it’s unfair, the result, totally unfair.<br /><br />The players didn’t deserve the defeat. We were punished by, I would say, mentality mistakes. You have to be ruthless against teams like <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> that play fantastically well on the counter-attack. We deserve much more than these results. The front three combined well, they did what they can. They did the plan that we worked on in the week<br /><br />It was a great game. My team didn’t deserve to lose at all. It is difficult to find a reason to lose the game, apart from a couple of individual mistakes. The team was good, they were in control. In the beginning of the game we were superb, <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> were really in trouble I would say. In the last period of the game they know what we cannot do, and then they just compact with everybody in the box and that is obviously the most difficult thing for us in this moment. It’s really, really frustrating and I’m sad obviously, but I am more sad for the players<br /><br />We don’t have that aggression. We are too good, too nice. That was maybe the only difference between the teams</p>

But in football anything is possible and you have to be ready to cope with these unpredictable things. So we know everything. We need to give a different shape to the squad to be ready for these unexpected things that happen to us but we all know that we have to try to win against <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> and we have to try to win on Tuesday.

An average of 28 in 40. So we are there. But of course, now we have to wait<br /><br />And just because of one game, in a fixture where the majority of the strikers in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> struggle to show that sharpness, to show that quality that they all have, people only turn to Harry. Because Harry is special, because with Harry anything less than scoring a hat-trick is not good enough. But I’m not that way. I don’t analyse things that way. I’m very, very patient. He will have all the time he needs to recover to his normal level<br /><br /><b>[The <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> manager insists he won’t need to dip into the summer transfer window for reinforcements in the final third if everyone can stay fit]</b> It’s fantastic. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> always had a fantastic group of attacking players and in the January market <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Steven Bergwijn</a> coming even improved that. Not just to be one more, but to be one more fantastic player with great ability.

All I can say is with six attacking players available in this moment, I don’t need <b>[to sign]</b> attacking players.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho tasted victory in his first north London derby as <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> came from behind to beat <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> 2-1 on Sunday]</b> The game was more tactical than anything. I think Mikel <b>[<a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>]</b> found a way for them to play, to be stable and to improve - they are improving and we felt that we should adapt slightly to them and I think we did it very well. I think during the game nobody thought about it, even myself I didn’t, but <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> had 48 hours more than us to rest, so it was hard but come from their hearts this effort, this battle. Even in the last minutes of the game after 2-1, zero problems, everything under control so we are happy. We are happy because we made the fans happy, we are happy because we are still in the fight to win a Europa League position.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> will give <a href="serge-aurier.html">Serge Aurier</a> the time he needs to grieve]</b> In this moment, what myself and other people at the club have spoken to him about is just about supporting a person that had a tragic moment within the family. Everyone is different. People react in different ways so we are going to respect 100 per cent Serge’s decisions. <b>[There is]</b> no pressure from us. This afternoon, after training, we will have a better idea of what he wants to do<br /><br /><b>[<a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Ndombele</a> and <a href="dele-alli.html">Alli</a> doubtful with injuries]</b> Yesterday in training, <a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Ndombele</a> was injured. I don’t think he will be selected but we have another training session. <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> may be training with us in the afternoon but I also don’t believe that he can be <b>[available]</b>. <a href="serge-aurier.html">Serge Aurier</a>, of course, is a big question mark at this moment. Every player is part of my plans. Every one. I don’t give up on players. No player has a privilege. Every player is for me the same. <b>[There is]</b> no problem at all.<br /><br /><b>[No decision made on Rose’s future]</b> No decision is made. To be honest, since he left I have not spoken with him. His feelings are important. His happiness is important. I think <a href="steve-bruce.html">Steve Bruce</a> and <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> also deserve to have an important word on this situation. He is our player and he has a contract so everything is open. We have three more matches in the next couple of weeks. After that there will be plenty of time to make decisions.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> boss Jose Mourinho has branded the decision to fine <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> but overturn their European ban disgraceful and a disaster]</b> If <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> is not guilty of it, to be punished by some million is a disgrace. If you’re not guilty you’re not punished. In the other way, if you’re guilty you should be banned. In any case, it’s a disaster. I’m not saying <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> is guilty. I’m saying if you’re not guilty you don’t pay. Even with a pound<br /><br />I know that money is quite easy for them but still. If you’re guilty you should be banned from the competition. I’m nobody to know if they’re guilty or not. My criticism is for the decision.<br /><br />I think it is going to be the end of Financial Fair Play because there is no point. In this moment, we are speaking about <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> but in the past other clubs were in a similar situation and you know the results of it. So I think it is better to open the circus door and let everybody enjoy and go inside for free and come out again. Do it with freedom.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has asked why other managers are not questioned on team selection]</b> Look, that is a question you normally do to me but you do not do to <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, to Pep <b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>]</b>, to all the coaches of the big clubs with big players. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> plays <b>[Christian]</b> <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a>, you don’t ask him why he doesn’t start <b>[Callum]</b> <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Hudson-Odoi</a> or something. When <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> plays someone and <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a> is on the bench, you never ask about <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a>. It looks like I am the only guy that has to play 15 players from the start, or I am the only guy who doesn’t have the right to have good players on the bench. If I start with <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Bergwijn</a> today, you would now be asking me what Lucas <b>[<a href="lucas-moura.html">Moura</a>]</b> has to do to start, what <b>[Heung-Min]</b> Son has to do to start. They have to do nothing. They have to be team players and team players are player that start that go on the bench, that come in for half-an-hour, that come in for one minute<br /><br />How many times has Nuno <b>[Espirito Santo]</b> left <b>[Adama]</b> <a href="adama-traore.html">Traore</a> on the bench to win matches in the last 30 minutes. You don’t ask Nuno why <a href="adama-traore.html">Traore</a> is on the bench and why he’s playing <b>[Diogo]</b> <a href="diogo-jota.html">Jota</a> or <b>[Daniel]</b> Podence or <b>[Leander]</b> Dendoncker. It’s just me. So he doesn’t have to do anything else, he’s a team player. He plays for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and if <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> wants to try and compete against the best teams, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> cannot have 11 good players, they need more and we’ll have them on the bench<br /><br />Against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, it was a bit of the same. We conceded and after that, the reaction was automatic and I think it’s what you need. I don’t like to hide things from the players, I try to always be very honest with them even if it’s something they don’t like, and I am a great motivator but I told them ‘I know you are tired and I know you only have energy in your brain, not in your legs. Your body is dead, but your brain is not and it is there you have to go and get your energy’ and I think the players were fantastic in this. I am so happy that no injuries are coming because it wouldn’t be a surprise for me with the players who are playing almost every minute of every game. 12 more days then finally they have a holiday and hopefully we manage to get a Europa League spot. It was the fourth match with two days in between and to manage to do 10 points in these four matches is what keeps us in the fight <b>[for the Europa League]</b><br /><br /><b>[Kane notched up his 200th club career goal in the victory]</b> He’s a young guy. If you feel 200 goals at this age with the remaining years he has in front of him, it is very normal that he speaks about going for 200 more. He is a fantastic player, a top goalscorer, he’s young and he has a lot in front of him. So I’m with him, let’s go for 200 more</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho: <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are better than Europa League level]</b> I think <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> would be even better than that without all the problems that we had. No other team had even similar problems. In the most difficult moments of the season, I was speaking about just surviving to leave us in a position where we could eventually fight for that. The fact that we are fourth <b>[in the form table]</b> since my arrival, without <b>[Hugo]</b> <a href="hugo-lloris.html">Lloris</a>, <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, <b>[Moussa]</b> <a href="moussa-sissoko.html">Sissoko</a> and Son, is a good reflection of the potential that we have and the work we are doing. The minimum we deserve is to finish in a position that keeps us in European football, a competition that is not our level, we are better than that. Football is not about what you deserve, it is about what you get. We need to win these two matches now.<br /><br />In quite a funny way, I’m telling the players: Two more victories to win the Europa League. I know it is not like that and the Europa League is a long competition and has some good teams, some from the Champions League, which makes it really difficult. It’s just a feeling to try to motivate the boys because our level is Champions League. I’m just trying to motivate the troops. It’s not possible that <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> or <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have more motivation than us to get one of these spots. To play in the Europa League is good, you can rotate players and it’s a fantastic experience for younger people who for them, Champions League comes too early.<br /><br />I’m not looking to that fight. I don’t know mathematically what is possible for them. They (Leicester and Manchester United) play the last game, I don’t know if things can be decided there. If United do it, they will do it by playing very well in the second part of the season. When you play well, you deserve. On top of that, everyone knows they were a bit lucky, more than one time. Luck that others didn’t have. That luck</p>

  <p><b>[Oliver Skipp signs new <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> deal]</b> In his mind he wants to go on loan, <b>[for]</b> six months, the whole season. He feels that he needs that, I also feel that would be good for his evolution, so maybe that is the direction we go. I think he can be more than a player, he can be a future captain here.</p>
