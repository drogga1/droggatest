If you are successful in any job, I believe it is because you are in love with that job, and if you have a successful family it is because people are in love with each other. I’m romantic in the sense that the people I love, they have to know that I love them, and they do know it, and they feel it. My wife did a tattoo and challenged me to do it. I didn’t at first because I always felt, ‘Urrrgh, it hurts’ and ‘I don’t have to do this to my skin’, and so on and so on. But it was her birthday and I thought it would be a good gift to her. So I had my wife and my kids’ names on my wrist and it was not as painful as I thought. It was easy. For me, the perfect weekend is when I am at home with my family. Perhaps watch my son play football and then have dinner in a restaurant. <b>[When I watch my son play]</b> I am the quietest father of the group.

It is my time to honour Steve <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>. It is with opponents like him that I am the manager that I am, because I learn with my players and I learn with my best opponents. I learn with my players’ problems, my players’ doubts, my players’ qualities and I learn with my best opponent, with the problems they give me - the way they make me think, the way they make me analyse them and studying the best way to play against them.<br /><br /><a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> is for sure one of my favourite enemies - an enemy with all the good feeling I can express with that word in football. For sure, in England he is my dear enemy. For sure, he is the one that made me a better manager. To stop him or try and stop him has been very, very difficult. I tried to bring him to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, I tried to bring him to Inter, I tried to bring him to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> but he was always a dear enemy. I want to honour him and I hope <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> has the same feeling as I have, which is we need people like him as our opponents</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho seemingly takes a swipe at <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>]</b> I’m not the smartest guy to choose countries and clubs.

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho on winning]</b> I don’t know what ‘to win at all costs’ means. What I know is that you can win it once not being good, you can win it once because you were very lucky, but <b>[for a manager]</b> to win it so many times, you can’t do it without the top qualities.

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho on himself]</b> There are people who are not happy with so many successes. I am a fantastic manager when I’m not winning matches and I’m a fantastic manager when I am. You like ‘up and down,’ but it’s not like that. The pundits get big money not to say easy things. They have to be geniuses in their analysis or they don’t deserve the money they get. There’s an easy way for them to think: ‘We won four Premier Leagues, three with him and one with his team, so this guy is not bad.’</p>
