  <p><b>[David Sullivan expresses regret over permanent signing of <a href="andy-carroll.html">Andy Carroll</a>. <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> would not have splashed out £15million on <a href="andy-carroll.html">Andy Carroll</a> had they known the England striker would spend so long out injured]</b> Had we known he would be out for this long, we would not have signed him.<br /><br />We are not a rich enough club to deal with that. You know any player can get injured, but we can’t buy a player knowing he is going to be out for half the season. When we signed him we were assured by the medical staff that the very, very latest he would be back was 1 September. That would have meant he would only miss two league games<br /><br /><b>[Sullivan retains hope Carroll will prove his worth for the club]</b> If you ask me the same question at the end of the season, I hope I will be able give you a different answer and say ‘Yes, it was the right decision to sign <a href="andy-carroll.html">Andy Carroll</a>. He is a fantastic player and on his day he is unplayable. We love him and that is why we signed him. He is desperate to come back; he is sweating blood in training<br /><br /><b>[Sullivan acknowledged he was worried about the depths <a href="west-ham-united.html">the Hammers</a> have sunk to in Carroll’s absence]</b> I am deeply concerned. Anybody who looks at where we are in the table and is not concerned are kidding themselves. I really believe Sam is the man for the job. If he wasn’t our manager he is exactly the type of manager you would be bringing in to be the manager. Where do you get someone better than Sam to do the job that is now necessary? If you asked me what kind of season Sam has had up to now, I would say ‘disappointing’. But let’s judge him at the end of the season. I think the <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> manager would have been sacked by most fans after a month of the season but now he is flavour of the month</p>

  <p><b>[Whilst I understand as a businessman you can’t afford to become emotional over too much, how difficult will it be for you to say goodbye to this grand old stadium on Tuesday night and what emotions do you expect to feel?]</b> Great sadness, but I know within 12 months 95 per cent of supporters will realise it’s the right move. However, on the night it will be very emotional for us all. There might be more tears spilt than at any place in the UK at one time for a very long time</p>

How important is victory?]</b> The best climax, but the way results went at the weekend we have to win to keep the European dream alive. The best win was the great escape win at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> and 4­0 in the Carling Cup at Upton Park a few years ago.</p>

  <p><b>[As a lifelong Hammer, is it possible for you to name your top club player and why?]</b> It has to be Bobby Moore as I knew him and he was so modest and a gentleman. But <a href="geoff-hurst.html">Geoff Hurst</a>, Trevor Brooking and Billy Bonds were all close seconds. It’s hard to separate great players</p>

We lived in airport houses in South Hornchurch opposite the old aerodrome. The latter is now a housing estate.</p>

  <p><b>[Is it fair to say that of all your achievements taking charge of the club is your greatest and where do you think we can be in two years?]</b> Yes, but we are only halfway to where we want to be. However, it’s very hard to compete with clubs. Like great corporate and brand support built up over decades, like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Man United, or clubs funded by foreign tax zillionaires who pay no British tax like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> etc. But if <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> can do it, why not us?</p>
