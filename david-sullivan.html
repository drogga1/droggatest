  <p><b>[David Sullivan expresses regret over permanent signing of <a href="andy-carroll.html">Andy Carroll</a>. <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> would not have splashed out £15million on <a href="andy-carroll.html">Andy Carroll</a> had they known the England striker would spend so long out injured]</b> Had we known he would be out for this long, we would not have signed him.<br /><br />We are not a rich enough club to deal with that. You know any player can get injured, but we can’t buy a player knowing he is going to be out for half the season. When we signed him we were assured by the medical staff that the very, very latest he would be back was 1 September. That would have meant he would only miss two league games<br /><br /><b>[Sullivan retains hope Carroll will prove his worth for the club]</b> If you ask me the same question at the end of the season, I hope I will be able give you a different answer and say ‘Yes, it was the right decision to sign <a href="andy-carroll.html">Andy Carroll</a>. He is a fantastic player and on his day he is unplayable. We love him and that is why we signed him. He is desperate to come back; he is sweating blood in training<br /><br /><b>[Sullivan acknowledged he was worried about the depths <a href="west-ham-united.html">the Hammers</a> have sunk to in Carroll’s absence]</b> I am deeply concerned. Anybody who looks at where we are in the table and is not concerned are kidding themselves. I really believe Sam is the man for the job. If he wasn’t our manager he is exactly the type of manager you would be bringing in to be the manager. Where do you get someone better than Sam to do the job that is now necessary? If you asked me what kind of season Sam has had up to now, I would say ‘disappointing’. But let’s judge him at the end of the season. I think the <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> manager would have been sacked by most fans after a month of the season but now he is flavour of the month</p>

  <p><b>[Whilst I understand as a businessman you can’t afford to become emotional over too much, how difficult will it be for you to say goodbye to this grand old stadium on Tuesday night and what emotions do you expect to feel?]</b> Great sadness, but I know within 12 months 95 per cent of supporters will realise it’s the right move. However, on the night it will be very emotional for us all. There might be more tears spilt than at any place in the UK at one time for a very long time</p>

  <p><b>[Is it fair to say that of all your achievements taking charge of the club is your greatest and where do you think we can be in two years?]</b> Yes, but we are only halfway to where we want to be. However, it’s very hard to compete with clubs. Like great corporate and brand support built up over decades, like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Man United, or clubs funded by foreign tax zillionaires who pay no British tax like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> etc. But if <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> can do it, why not us?</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham joint-chairman David Sullivan has hit out following the completion of Dimitri Payet’s £25 million move to Marseille]</b> The club would like to place on record its sincere disappointment that Dimitri Payet did not show the same commitment and respect to West Ham United that the club and fans showed him. Particularly when it rewarded him with a lucrative new five-and-a-half-year deal only last year. I would like to make it clear that we have no financial need to sell out best players and that the decision to allow Payet to leave was in accordance with the wishes of our manager and the interests of squad unity. To be frank, my board and I would have preferred for him to have stayed in order to make an example of him, as no player is bigger than the club.<br /><br />I am confident that the qualty of the players have brought in during January already, the squad will be stronger at the end of this transfer window than it was at the start. We now look forward to building on our recent good run of form with five league wins in the last seven matches as we focus on continuing our rise up the Premier League table</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham United co-owner David Sullivan has claimed that Dimitri Payet did not speak to his team-mates for up to eight weeks before his exit from the club]</b> I think for the last six or eight weeks, he’s not been talking to anybody in the squad. He’s gone to the corner of a room for his meals and isolated himself from everybody. Before that, he was bubbly and happy, shakes everyone’s hand before the match. Either it was a tactic or something in his head had changed. The team wanted him out. The manager, with the greatest reluctance, wanted him out. And as much as we didn’t want him out, you can’t go against the consensus of the team and manager.<br /><br /><b>[Marseille]</b> were very difficult to deal with. They’re lucky we accepted the £25m. I think he’s worth more than that. The player’s surrendered his January wages, which is another four or five hundred thousand so you get that there. There’s a little bit of dignity we got with that. That was a deal breaker to us. Our attitude was ‘you’ve refused to play’ - why should you get paid?</p>

He has a proven goalscoring record in the Premier League, La Liga and the Bundesliga, as well in the UEFA Champions League and at international level with Mexico. We now have some fantastic options in attacking positions and, like all West Ham fans, I am looking forward to seeing Javier score goals in a claret and blue shirt next season</p>

  <p><b>[David Moyes has left his role as West Ham United manager after keeping the club in the Premier League]</b> I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to David Moyes and his staff for achieving the target of keeping West Ham United in the Premier League. Throughout his time here, David has carried himself with dignity and honesty and we have all found him to be a pleasure to work with. He, Alan, Stuart and Billy accepted the challenge and attacked it head on, turning around a difficult situation. They deserve great respect for the job they have done and they leave the club with our best wishes. When David and his team arrived, it was the wish of both parties that the focus be only on the six months until the end of the season, at which point a decision would be made with regards to the future. Having taken stock of the situation and reflected now the campaign is complete, we feel that it is right to move in a different direction. We are already taking steps to identify and recruit the manager we believe can take West Ham United forward in line with our ambitions. We aim to appoint a high-calibre figure who we feel will lead the club into an exciting future for our loyal supporters within the next ten days</p>

  <p><b>[Manuel Pellegrini has been appointed West Ham manager on a three-year contract at the London Stadium]</b> I am delighted to welcome Manuel Pellegrini to West Ham United. He is one of the world’s most respected football coaches and we look forward to working with him. It was important that we appointed someone with knowledge and experience of the Premier League, who already has an understanding - not only of the teams and players we face - but of West Ham United and our ambitions. Manuel brings a reputation for attacking football and getting the best out of his players. We believe he will attract new talent to the London Stadium as well as improving the current squad. Above all, he is a winner, who knows what it takes to succeed at the highest level and is driven to continue that success. Manuel is the first West Ham United manager to have a Premier League title on his CV, and we believe that his experience, quality and proven record of taking teams forward quickly will ensure that he is successful here<br /><br />We have listened to fans who asked us to be ambitious. We hope they agree it is an exciting appointment. Manuel will shortly announce the names of the new staff he will bring in and he will then get down to shaping the squad he wants. We all wish him the very best of luck</p>
