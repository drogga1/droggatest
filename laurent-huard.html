  <p><b>[Meet Man Utd fan and Ligue 1 Rising Star James Lea Siliki]</b> In the heart of the game, he’s a very good player who improves the team. He’s a mix of Blaise Matuidi and Geoffrey Kondogbia. He’s maybe not as good as Matuidi at winning the ball and is not as powerful as Kondogbia, but he has something in addition - he can be a goal scorer.</p>

  <p><b>[Adil Aouchiche - Equalling <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a> just the start for <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>’s teen star]</b> The year with Thiago has been instructive on the tactical aspect, his position and the demands of the coach. With us, he worked on the collective and competitive aspect: he was made to look for solutions and understand that everything was not a given. He has now tried to bridge the age gap, despite some difficulties and passages on the bench.<br /><br />He looks a lot at his team-mates and uses them as an example for himself. He wants all the time to be half an hour early in training. He tries to be punctual and give himself the best chance to earn more opportunities. But he also knows that he still has work to do, both physically and tactically</p>
