<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> midfielder Ottavio Bianchi has said that comparing <a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is like comparing Picasso to Mozart]</b> I played with <b>[Enrique Omar]</b> Sivori, an impressive Argentine left-footer, I trained Diego <b>[Maradona]</b> and I would have loved to work with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. I try to watch him whenever I can because I’m in love with these kinds of players – the kinds of players that have football in their blood. But they come from different times – it’s like when people compare <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>, <b>[Johan]</b> <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. All I can say is that it has been a pleasure to see each and every one on the pitch. We’re fortunate that in each era we’ve had a succession of players of this magnitude. It’s the same with artists; you might like <b>[Henri]</b> Matisse, <b>[Paul]</b> Gauguin, <b>[Pablo]</b> Picasso, Beethoven, Mozart or whoever, but they are all so far outside the established parameters that all you can do is wait for the next genius to appear in each respective discipline. They are so good that trying to compare them and their distinctions just isn’t nice. You can’t classify the best painters or musicians because everyone lives in their own time in history<br /><br /><b>[Bianchi also commented on the situation at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, with reports of a falling-out between club captain <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and director of football <a href="eric-abidal.html">Eric Abidal</a>, and hopes his former side can take advantage when the pair meet]</b> I read in the newspapers that there are big problems at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and what I do know is that these kinds of players need a very particular environment to express their full greatness. If they are sad, it’s a lot more difficult for them. Traditionally, players of that kind of quality can’t showcase their full footballing talents if something is bothering them. It seems to me that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> aren’t in the best health at the moment. Institutional problems are usually noticeable on the pitch and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> looks somewhat sad on the field. He can’t just win on his own, just as <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> couldn’t. He needs to be surrounded by high-level players and that’s why he had his best years with the two phenomenons <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> and <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a> behind him. <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> is the ideal player for any team. He’s a player that has everything to be the ideal footballer prototype. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is a pure talent, but <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> is as desirable as a player can be. So with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> having their problems and <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> having nothing to lose, they have enough skill in the squad to create serious problems for Barca</p>
