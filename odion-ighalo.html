  <p><b>[Odion Ighalo has expressed his delight after sealing a switch to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> on loan from Shanghai Shenhua]</b> It’s a dream come true because since I was a kid I followed and dreamt of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. But it is a reality now. I cannot say much more now until I get started. It’s been crazy. Obviously, I am happy to be in Manchester first of all. This is a great opportunity for me and I am grateful to God, and to my agent, and the coach who has given me this opportunity to be here. I am happy to be here and to work out with the team and finish very well this season. The plan is to just chill today because I travelled a very long way from Shanghai to Manchester. Today is to just rest and tomorrow we start to work</p>

  <p><b>[Odion Ighalo has revealed that he took a pay-cut to join <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> on loan from Shanghai Shenhua on deadline day]</b> Yeah, it was very dramatic. My agent called me the day before and said <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>. I would love to go. A few other clubs had shown interest, I said please, just pick United, if it’s going to be possible. At 11pm in Shanghai, my agent called me <b>[to say]</b> that United want to do the deal, so I woke up that night and started looking for a translator to go to the directors’ room and hit his door and all that. I said: ‘My agent wants to speak to you, United are coming for me, you have to make this happen<br /><br />So they started talking and discussing. I didn’t sleep throughout that night, because it was going to end at 7am, Shanghai time, and the transfer <b>[window]</b> is going to close there. So, from 11pm, there was paperwork, negotiating and all that, for the loan deal and all that, so we are talking and other teams are calling them, wanting me, but I told my agent that this is what I want. I want to come here. He said you’re going to get a pay-cut to go to United. I said: ‘I don’t care. Make this deal happen. I want to go to United. I don’t care how much is the pay-cut, I know that, make it happen’.<br /><br />So the director and everybody didn’t know what to say anymore, because I had already made up my mind, so my agent started putting it in order, and, at 5am, we finished. My agent said he’d forwarded all the papers to United, they will confirm for me if everything is okay. I think, around 5-6am, he said everything is okay, it’s done. I was excited. I called my mum and she was happy and crying. This is your dream and all that and I’m happy for you. It was dramatic, I didn’t sleep through, I was very happy that finally, we got the deal done<br /><br />I’m very happy. First, I want to say thank God for making this happen and it’s just like a dream come true for me, because I know many people used to say when they join a team, they say that they dream of playing for that team. Mine was not the case. I supported the team when I was young. People that know me, even back in Nigeria, and even when I was playing at <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, my team-mates knew that I loved <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, I support them. When I played against <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> that emotion is there, because it is my dream. It is a nice reality, so I’m very happy and I’m looking forward to starting</p>

  <p><b>[Odion Ighalo says <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> might be the best player in Europe right now]</b> These players are great players. <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> is a very good player; young, very good left foot, I’ve watched some of his game. Martial is very skilful, he can do so much magic with the ball and Rashford I think is, for me, one of the best, if not the best player in Europe right now. He’s doing well, scoring goals; he’s fast, he has good technique. Unfortunately, he is injured now and hopefully, I am looking forward to playing with him because he is a good player. So, for me, it is just a plus to the team, to work hard with these guys and make sure we end the season very well<br /><br /><b>[When asked what qualities he can bring to the team after being officially unveiled as a United player on Wednesday]</b> They have a striker that stays mostly in the middle, because Martial likes to come from the side, even <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> and all that, so you need someone in the middle that can keep the ball, hold the ball, because I’ve watched so many United games. So they need a physicality there up front to keep the ball, to give and to make some movement, which I believe, if everything goes well, I can add to the team<br /><br />I watch United and some other teams, and I have that feeling of let me go there again and see how it’s going to be, because it’s the best league in the world. Every player would like to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I’ve done it before and I was looking forward to doing it again. Thank God, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> gave me the opportunity to be able to do it now so I’m looking forward to it</p>

  <p><b>[Odion Ighalo will not travel to Spain for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s warm-weather training camp]</b> Odion will stay in Manchester, because he arrived from China in the last 14 days. Because of the situation in China, we’re not sure if he’d be allowed back into England if he leaves the country again, so he’s staying here working with a personal coach, individual programme and his family then can settle in England as well. That’s a plus. Of course he might have liked to have come with the players and got to know them, but the risk <b>[of potential border restrictions tightening]</b>… we don’t want to take that<br /><br />Of course, we come back and we kick on. We want to get results. Towards the end now, before this break, we played okay and didn’t concede too many goals. But we didn’t create chances and missed that little bit of spark, I felt. Maybe because of the mental tiredness. Physically, they did really well in every aspects of the games but mentally, now, we kick on</p>

  <p><b>[Odion Ighalo has vowed to dedicate every goal he scores for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to his late sister Mary]</b> My sister was a strong United fan.

Mary’s husband followed <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, while their children were <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans, but she stayed loyal to United.

Even when she came to watch me in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> playing for <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> she hoped I would join United<br /><br />The painful part for me is that I now have signed for United, but she is not here to see it. However, I know she is up there watching me. That is why I am going to play with her name on my boots, so she is always with me at Old Trafford or in any game for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Every goal I score from now until I finish my career will be dedicated to God and to her.<br /><br />I have written her name on my special white T-shirt and put her name on my boots. I want to show the world she is always with me. It means she can feel me playing at Old Trafford, feel that dream we all prayed for, even though she is not here to see it. But she will be on my feet, assisting me on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[The former <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> forward feared his move to Old Trafford could have been scuppered by the crisis]</b> I was a bit scared. My agent, Atta Aneke, called me from Norway and said United wanted me, but were looking at another striker because I was in China and there was the coronavirus. I wanted it to happen, to fulfil a lifetime dream, so joining United was more important to me than money<br /><br /><b>[Ighalo concluded by thanking United fans for their support]</b> I want to thank the fans for all the messages of support since the day I arrived in Manchester. This is the biggest club in the world. I know it’s a new team and a big challenge, but I am going to give my best in every game to make sure we accomplish what we want. God bless all the United fans</p>

We had to go all out from the first minute and push to go to the next round and we did. The first goal opened up everything and the red card made it difficult for them, with our attacking and playing at home too. From the start, we worked hard until the last minute</p>

It’s a moment I will cherish for the rest of my life<br /><br />The fans see me as one of their own because I came to this team because I want to play and because I supported them since I was young, and I want to do my best to help the team to move forward. They appreciate that and I appreciate them. From the first day I set foot in Manchester, they have been behind me. I promise them I’m going to give my best: win, lose … I don’t care about the circumstances. I’ll keep giving my best<br /><br />There is transition in life in everything you’re doing. It’s difficult sometimes when the team is losing games; as a fan, you get angry. Now, in the club, I have to give my best to make sure we are winning and getting results. Some games, it’s going to be difficult because other teams are spending more money in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and in Europe, so it will be more difficult, but this team has young players and, working this way, I think we have a better future<br /><br />I watched him when I was young.

The league is faster, sharper, I need more strength. I’m getting better every day but I’m not 100 per cent fit<br /><br />I’m happy because I know a lot of supporters on social media were waiting for this moment, for me to get my first goal. I’ve not seen my phone yet but I know messages have been coming in, so I will thank everyone. Now, the work starts again. I have to keep pushing<br /><br /><b>[Ighalo celebrated his goal by paying tribute to his sister]</b> I lost my sister in December. She’s a <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> fan.

When I’m called upon, I will give my best<br /><br />It’s been great here. The lads are all great guys. It’s a happy dressing room. The coach and everyone around the club make me feel at home. I’m really enjoying my time here. We have quality players in the team. Martial is on fire, scoring goals. Bruno <b>[Fernandes]</b> is doing well, <b>[Daniel]</b> James too, everybody from the goalkeeper to the top is working really hard. So, I think this is very good for the team. We need to keep the momentum going and keep winning games and fighting in every match, to make sure we get our objectives at the end of the season<br /><br />It was 2-2 and I played my first game in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> – and scored a goal! I was happy. If I have the opportunity to go back again there, it will be very good. Every game, from now on, is going to be tough for United because it’s the second half of the season. Some teams are fighting to stay in the league, some are fighting to go to the Champions League and some into Europe. Every game is going to be tough from now on. But this team is a big team. We have what it takes to win games, to win games home and away</p>

But when you are inside you know how big the club is.<br /><br />I am inspired by the way the club is structured, I am inspired by the direction of the club, I am inspired by the development of the young players and how they are coming through from the grassroots to the first team.<br /><br />I am inspired by a lot of things at United, I am really inspired and I am looking forward to spending more time with the team<br /><br /><b>[On how he is perceived, Ighalo added]</b> Many people would say he is a gentle guy but inside he is a beast. I am a fighter, I never give up, I go for what I believe I can achieve and I give my best, 100 per cent, no matter the outcome of the game, win or lose, I always give 100 per cent from the beginning</p>

Because the season is still on and I’m yet to finish my loan deal. I don’t just take decisions alone in my life. I have a principle and I have a guideline for everything I do.

When the season’s finished and I get two offers from the two teams, then I will sit and think about it, pray about it and whatever God says I should do, I will go with that<br /><br />I don’t just sit down and take decisions, and I don’t get carried away with whatever people say. I came to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to play for a pay cut because I wanted to. So anything could happen, but I want the season to finish and my loan to finish.

I have to sit down and finish the season well, sit down with my agent, see what’s on the ground: A, B, C, D, is on the ground. Okay we have to pick</p>

We’ve not seen the best of him yet in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Once <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> settles down in England you will see what that guy can do. He has vision, he wants the ball always. He can shoot, he can score goals, he is very intelligent. Before the ball comes, he is a step ahead to know what he wants to do.

Now it is for us to finish the season well, for me to do well and score goals. But even me as a person cannot start talking about a contract when you don’t know when you’re going to resume. I’ve been around the club for a few months and everything is working perfectly well for me and the team is going fantastically. We’ll see how it goes<br /><br /><b>[Even if his United career turns out to be brief, Ighalo will have the memory of a thunderous and technically brilliant Europa League strike against LASK to look back on and cherish in the colours of a club he has supported since childhood]</b> Yeah, for now I would say it is the best goal in my career. After that goal, I did not know how I scored that goal. My team-mates were showing me a video and going ‘wow, wow, wow’ and I was asking myself, ‘How did you do that?’</p>

  <p><b>[Ighalo tips <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> for greatness at Man Utd]</b> He is intelligent, he has foresight, he has vision. He sees what he wants to do with the ball before it comes to him. You can see the understanding between him and Martial, you can see the understanding between me and him, so he’s a very good player. And he’s not even settled down yet! He comes from a very different place to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. When that guy has settled down, he’s going to take <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> by storm<br /><br />Anthony, since I came, he’s been scoring goals and doing so well, fighting a lot. He is a great player, he has great technique. He can do anything with the ball and he’s been doing fantastically well. I just hope he keeps going and scoring more goals and we end the season very well. Watching it from outside it’s different. You only watch games every weekend and see how skilful he is. But I train with this guy every day, you understand? Every blessed day I train with him, and it’s incredible what he does in training, do you understand? He does it so easy, you know? Sometimes in games it’s difficult to do it, sometimes you face a tougher opponent but this is someone who every day you see in training and say wow, he’s a good player</p>

  <p><b>[Odion Ighalo believes working with <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> will add even more goals to his game]</b> When I moved to United, I learned a few things from him. During games, there was even a game I scored in and he said ‘You should have scored more if you do this or do that’. I thought about it and I know if I would have done what Ole said, I would have scored more. He says: ‘You’re a striker, take the chance’. So I’ve learnt a lot from him, in terms of positioning and how to do one or two things in a game. As a striker, it’s good when a striker is coaching you. And, as a striker, you benefit even more than the defenders. He is someone who has scored goals for a long time and has done a lot for United, so it’s good to learn from him<br /><br /><b>[Ighalo added on <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>, having previously spent time in Norwegian football with Lyn]</b> He’s a big player <b>[in Norway]</b>. Playing for United is amazing - for me, it’s the biggest team in the world. In your country, they are going to value it, like the way I am in Nigeria. In Norway, everyone rates him so highly because he did a lot for United, and he’s Norwegian. He was always on TV when I was there.<br /><br /><b>[on Solskjaer]</b> He’s a very calm guy; he’s a good guy. Outside of football, he’s a good guy. When everybody is laughing in training, he joins in and he talks to us, but, when it’s the game, you see a serious face. We have to do this, we have to do that - then it’s business time</p>

I was in good form, good shape, scoring goals and now we’ve stopped now for over a month. I’ve given it my best and hopefully, we’ll come back to play. The team had a good momentum before the pandemic started. At the moment I’m on loan, and this will cut short my time at the club. The club, myself, every footballer is going through a lot because we can’t do what we love and what we know how to do best, so we’re just thinking about that for now and to finish the season before we start thinking about the contract.

  <p><b>[Odion Ighalo is determined to help <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> push higher up <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> table after expressing his delight at extending his loan deal]</b> I’m really happy. It’s a dream for me to be here. I’m buzzing and ready to go. The last few days have been difficult as there have been different talks about it but now I’m really happy so I need to concentrate fully. I’m here until the end of January, so it’s good for me. I decided I want to stay and I’m happy. Since the first day I arrived, I made it clear that I wanted whatever it takes to continue that work. It was very difficult, there were some talks, but I’m happy they finally agreed and got everything done. Everything is official now. I’m sending thanks to the Shanghai president and director for the support because they know this is what I want. So I’m thanking them and I’m happy that this has happened. They wish me all the best too. Like I’ve said, since I was young, I’ve been supporting this club and playing for it is a dream. Now I’ve extended my loan, it makes it even more clear and I’m committed as I know, in my head, I’m here until January ending. I just want to work hard and enjoy it, support the team and do whatever I can to make us go higher and higher<br /><br />It’s different from where I’m coming from and different to where I was before.

  <p><b>[Odion Ighalo claims to see shades of <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a> in <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> youngster Mason Greenwood]</b> I will start with <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a>. He’s a very good player. I think I used to see with my eyes he’s looking like <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a>. He can shoot with both feet, he’s a very intelligent player, young and is not afraid. Anto <b>[Martial]</b> is a very skilful, good striker who scores goals. Marcus <b>[Rashford]</b> always wants the ball. He can run behind defenders. He can come and get the ball to feet and shoot from any angle. These guys are very good, very young guys and I’m grateful to be playing with this set of strikers.<br /><br />I think it’s more beneficial for us strikers because we have a former striker as coach. I know that. Even in some games we play, he calls you to talk to you. Like I remember at the Derby game, I scored two goals and he called me to say: ‘You’re the striker. You’re supposed to score three goals in this game! It’s important. I needed to shoot. I had <a href="juan-mata.html">Juan Mata</a> who called me and I was rolling the ball back. He said: ‘No, as a striker, in that place, you should shoot. Always try to shoot to the goal. It doesn’t matter if the keeper touches it, aim for your target and shoot. So I benefit a lot from him - the way he talks in training and the way he wants me to move and to keep the ball and all that. It’s very good.</p>

In one game in China I got called all sorts of names and after the game, I didn’t shake his hand. I walked straight into the dressing room, I was angry, I reported it to <a href="fa.html">the FA</a>.

Despite the colour of our skin, we are all the same, we live in the same world, the same life. I don’t condone racism, but at the same time, I don’t condone riots.

We are fighting now so that for the next generation it will be cut off, finally. We have to start from the younger generation, educate them, let them see that all humans are the same.

We’ve just finished training and are getting ready to fly down to Brighton. It’s a tough game on Tuesday evening but we don’t have any excuses. We’re only going there to win. The manager will probably rotate the team and bring in fresh legs so that we can keep going. It’s one of the advantages of having a big squad, having players ready to come in to change the game and come in to play in any position, so it’s really good for us</p>
