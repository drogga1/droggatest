  <p><b>[Colin Little says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> duo <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> &amp; <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> hailed as ‘best homegrown strikers in the country’]</b> I honestly think you can’t look at any team and think there are any two better homegrown strikers in the country. <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> and <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> are really good strikers but we’ve got two on our books right now. Without blowing our own trumpet, that’s just incredible isn’t it? Both are still young, both are <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> kids from an early age. It’s why, but for anything else, if they were the two people who come out of this academy, you would be like ‘wow’. I mean what are forwards worth nowadays? People who score goals - at that age? You’re looking at it, thinking what an incredible asset to have, and you’ve got the other ones like Brandon Williams and James Garner, and others, behind them. It’s a testament to everybody and, let’s be honest with you, from all the way down with Eamon Mulvey’s group, all the way through, those players have gone through every single age group. From Tony Whelan, and everybody is where they are now. I mean, they could be in our first team for nearly 20 years. It can be a 20-year career from 18 to 38<br /><br /><b>[Little added on the training drills he has overseen to help bring the best out of <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> and <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> in the past]</b> If you put on a coaching session for Marcus or Mason, and they made the run, you want the ball arriving at exactly the right time. We have this little saying ‘get it in the right place’. Mason’s pass to Marcus against <b>[Manchester]</b> City was perfect. Straight after the game, I texted him to say: ‘Get it to the right place!’ All of a sudden, it starts to become a habit for the forwards to find each other and give themselves easy passes. If someone is in a better position, there’s a pass for you. Share it out</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United academy coach Colin Little has hailed <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> for proving the pundits wrong, having been previously criticised for not being efficient enough in front of goal]</b> I remember Michael <b>[Owen]</b> doing a talk with us and it was mentioned. He literally said - you are born a goalscorer.<br /><br />I saw <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a> and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> in the TV studio saying the same thing - you can’t teach people it. They were saying name one player and I was screaming at the TV!<br /><br />It’s a load of rubbish. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> was a tricky winger. Before <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> got to him, <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> used to only score about six or seven a season. You could maybe say Mason <b>[Greenwood]</b> is more natural but maybe Michael is right that he was born a goalscorer<br /><br />He says no coach ever taught him, apart from Steve Heighway teaching him the near-post run, but maybe he is an exception and freakish. So his way of looking at it was - I was born to do that so everybody else must have been. But others have to learn it. Marcus has got 19 goals and it winds me up because that <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> one <b>[when his header hit the woodwork first and was eventually given as an own-goal against Tom Heaton]</b> would have made it 20. I’m sure Michael once said Marcus was not a 20-goal-a-season striker, so I was looking forward to ringing him up about it!<br /><br /><b>[Little believes that the development of the 22-year-old is underscored by the variety of goals as well as the quantity of them]</b> People would say Marcus won’t be able to score the right amount of goals on the left but he has got so many different ones now. You can tell a striker is getting better by the variety of goals he scores; from his head, left foot and right foot<br /><br />If you actually look through his goals, he is scoring a variety. You add on penalties and free-kicks and then your numbers really start to go up. Balls were going in the box and he was stood in all sorts of different areas but not the right place to score. So the phrase I use is a forward has to be an eternal optimist. You have got to believe the cross is going to arrive at that place. That right area is called prime real estate and you have got to get there. He worked on it and is in the right places now</p>
