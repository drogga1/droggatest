  <p><b>[Quote on <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a>]</b> What a servant he has been for his country. To get 100 caps for any country is amazing but for England, with the competition he has had to fend off over the last yen years, it is phenomenal. <b>[. . .]</b> I was lucky enough play on the left side for England many times with him behind me. It’s a dream. You see him coming up in your wing mirrors, overlapping you every time, giving you options, and the one thing about Ashley is he never moans about not getting the ball, which was great for me. And his quality in the final third is brilliant. A lot of people forget he started out as a striker at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I remember playing against him as a kid and he was a brilliant striker as well. He’s just a great player</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole has hailed Chelsea boss Antonio Conte as exceptional]</b> You’ve got to give him credit, he’s come over to a new country and his language is good, but it must be so hard because he’s such an expressive man. I imagine most of his management skills are his emotional connection and how he speaks to people and to go to another country and do that shows how exceptional he is. Already his team has got his personality. They look strong. You can’t see anything else than Chelsea winning the league now.<br /><br />The only thing that would make me a little bit nervous is if Costa picks up a long-term injury. And the other thing is that Tottenham look like a good team this year, which is bad news. Harry Kane and Dele Alli would get into most teams around the world. But apart from that, I think Chelsea are still a good couple of years ahead of them.</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole thinks <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> will have a place in the club’s history]</b> I think he’ll go down as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s greatest player. He’s certainly the most talented all-round footballer I’ve played with and he’s already a hero with the fans. I hope he stays there for the rest of his career. My first game in France with <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a>, <b>[then-coach]</b> <a href="rudi-garcia.html">Rudi Garcia</a> was saying to me, ‘we’ve got this good kid, Eden Hazard’. He said ‘I want you to play with him’. And then he scored two of the best goals you’ll see within 20 minutes and I thought, ‘I don’t know if I’m good enough to play with him’</p>

  <p><b>[With John Terry set to leave Chelsea after 22 years of loyal service, Joe Cole has warned his former club that their skipper will cost a lot of money to replace]</b> When I signed for Chelsea <b>[in 2003]</b>, he was the first person to see me as I walked through the door. Although he’s only a few months older, he put his arm around me and it was like, ‘I’ll look after you’ like the new kid at school, like an older brother. Chelsea will miss that. They are a well-run club but forget everything he does on the pitch, it’s the unseen things as a captain.<br /><br />I remember I was having a bit of a rough time there. He recognised it and got one of the video analysts to make a compilation of all my best bits. It was a little touch but it really lifted me. For him to even notice that… in football you’re so focused on yourself and your own game, to have an eye on everyone else in the club is remarkable. You can’t quantify that. He was a younger man then, as well, and to have that empathy - that’s one of a million things the club will miss. They’ll have to spend a lot of money to replace him. He’d love it out here. He’d be perfect for any club out here. Anyone would take him</p>

  <p><b>[Win or lose Europa League, Mourinho already a success at Man Utd]</b> Not only do I think he will be a success, he’s already a success. I’ve seen ex-players criticise him, but he’s already a success theres. And when he wins the Europa League, I’ll go as far as to say that - after <b>[Antonio]</b> Conte - he’s probably the manager of the season, to get that group of players to win two trophies and get to the Champions League. Sure, they might finish fifth or sixth. But he’s gone so far deep in Europe that these games where he drew at home to Swansea and all that is difficult. If he would have not been in Europe he would have won that game for sure, and probably finished fourth anyway.<br /><br />The criticism he’s gotten this year has been just ridiculous and unjust. He’s already won a trophy. Let’s just say he’s gone deep in the Europa League and there’s probably a good chance he’s going to win, so that’s two trophies<br /><br />You can’t compare it to the <b>[Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> era because the league’s moved on. Fergie, what he did in that era was great, but what <b>[Mourinho]</b> took over was a massive club with a lot of players who were not at the standard of the teams around them. He’s only signed four players so far, so he’s been very specific with who he wants<br /><br />I think Mourinho was the best <b>[I ever played for]</b>. I wouldn’t say favourite to play for because he cracked the whip with me a lot. But I respect him and I really like him as a person, and he got the best out of me I’d probably say<br /><br />They’ll be back on the top of the three very soon. If you could say for him to leave Man United I’d like that, because they’ll be competing with Chelsea next season, that’s for sure</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole believes the Premier League champions should move heaven and earth to sign Alexis Sanchez and Sergio Aguero this summer]</b> I’d go, ‘Go get me Aguero or Sanchez or both, and I want no one else,’ and I can guarantee you they’ll win the league next year. The thing is everything is in place. Everyone keeps talking to me about, ‘Oh, they need to replace Moses or Alonso’. They don’t, they’ve been brilliant. You don’t need to replace them. There’s enough young players as well in the academy that can come. They just need an extra bit. What <b>[Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> did well over the years is reignite with one or two big players.<br /><br />Realistically, you could build to the future and spend a fortune and try and go and get <b>[Harry]</b> Kane and all from Tottenham, but I think that’s not going to happen, they’re not going to move them. You think Aguero and Sanchez there’s maybe little bit of instability at their clubs so I’d be moving heaven and earth to get both of them, or one of them.<br /><br /><b>[Antonio Conte]</b> I think he’s incredible, really. I was a bit apprehensive at the start because every team Mourinho has ever left has always gone <b>[down]</b>. So it makes it even more remarkable that Conte has filled his shoes and done as well as he has. I was over there training in December and January with kids and reserves. Incredible job he’s done there. They look so well organised and so well drilled, and they’ve gone through the season without a blip, so all credit to him<br /><br />I still think after <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi and <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo, I think Hazard is the No.1 for me. I think he’ll win a Ballon d’Or at one stage. He’s been the best player in England again this year</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole on how Tampa Bay Rowdies restored his love of football]</b> For sure <b>[I doubted myself in England]</b>. My knee injury in my last season at Chelsea was a big factor in that. It was a big game changer for me as a player and getting back to my top level after that was proving difficult. I was breaking down, the more I pushed myself, the more I broke down. I basically now think, less is more. I cut a lot of stuff out. I train when I feel good, I listen to my body. I am getting better and better. I feel as good now as when I was 30, while I am still enjoying it, I will keep playing.<br /><br />You eat better naturally in this sort of climate. You eat fresh fish and vegetables. You are out in the pool a lot, walking, keeping your body moving. All these factors led to better health. This option just came out of the blue really. I wasn’t really looking for it. When I left Aston Villa, my body let me down. My mind still wanted to play football but it didn’t know whether my body could. I went to Coventry to see if I still had the joy and the love of the game. I wanted to see if my body would also let me. It did and I changed a few things in my preparation. This came out of the blue, I came out for a holiday here and it just looked great so it was a good decision<br /><br />We want to win the league. It is a play-off system. It is an American league so it is all down to the play-offs so first of all. We want to get into the play-offs which is the top eight out of sixteen. We are sitting high at the minute. We want to go and win the title. Off the pitch, it is continuing the marketing and everything so we can bring an MLS team to Tampa Bay which would be a great thing for the city and a great thing for the fans. Everyone is buzzing and excited about that.<br /><br />The club is ready for it. This town is amazing - when people set their sights to things, Bill, the owner and other people here. They live in America, it is the land of opportunity. It will be done, I am pretty sure <b>[that it will happen]</b>. The day will come for it. That’s the dream, to be part of it, it would be nice to come back here one day, maybe in five years time and see the team established as one of the top teams in the MLS<br /><br />Soccer is growing out here, with time it could be anything, it could be competing with European league and all that. It is moving at a rate. Kids love it, every kid plays it. It is going in the right direction<br /><br />I will play on, while I am still enjoying it. It is a hard question to answer <b>[whether I will retire at the end of the season]</b>. I am not avoiding it but it is just something that you don’t know but I will be in football, I will stay in football in the coaching or managing side for sure. I enjoy it. I am in a blessed position where I don’t have to be doing something that I don’t like. So my passion is to be in coaching or managing, I am doing something I like and I will go down that road.<br /><br />I do bits and pieces <b>[of coaching]</b>. I am doing my coaching badges. I am finishing them off at IMG, the local academy. I am doing well over there. I will be working with England and the FA. I have done a bit of work when I have gone home with the local teams. You just try to get as much experience when you can. I have enjoyed it so far. I have dipped my toes in and taken my toes out. Let’s see what happens when I do it day-in, day-out but I am pretty sure I still will<br /><br /><b>[On Drogba recently scored on his debut for Pheonix]</b> Yes, I spoke to him the other day. He is very happy. It is a lovely place that they are in, Scottsdale, beautiful part of the world. That club is literally a club affiliated with another club and they only had a pop up stadium that they built in three months. They are filling out every week, selling out. People just can’t get enough of it. There are so many opportunities for people over here<br /><br />I enjoy life here. We live next to the Salvador Dali Museum and are near to the stadium so we like to pop in there. We travel too, we are lucky enough to travel too as footballers. We go all over America as well. We were in Louisville the other day, we went to the Muhammad Ali Center, that was amazing. We are going to go to New York in September and things like that. I like to look around, listen to the birds and see the world. It is a great life. As you get older, you appreciate it a bit more<br /><br />Everyone loves it, it is a holiday destination. You have got Disneyland around the corner, Busch Gardens, the beaches are some of the best in the world. Certainly the best in America. It is a great place to come on holiday and visit. I am inundated with visitors. I may as well set up a bed and breakfast. I’ve also had messages from all sorts of people. From players, people in merchandising catering, so many people want to come and work here</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole thinks that Romelu Lukaku would be a perfect replacement for Diego Costa]</b> Obviously the Costa thing has come out. Conte has told him that he wants him out so you would be looking at a striker. Lukaku, there’s a market for him, and you are competing for players. I like Lukaku. I’d take Lukaku, he is like for like with Costa, but they only need one or two players and just keep the continuity going.<br /><br />I don’t know his character so it is hard to say <b>[whether the comeback could affect him]</b>, but I would say is that the pressure is different when you play for Chelsea, rather than Everton. He is younger <b>[than Costa]</b>, that’s in his favour.<br /><br />Sergio Aguero is in his prime, Alexis Sanchez is in his prime. I think one of them three could be enough to make sure Chelsea are not weakened and maybe strengthened a little bit as well. The club will have to do their due diligence on the characters as well.<br /><br />The financial structure of it and the cost… I wouldn’t look outside of Lukaku, Sanchez and Aguero. <b>[Alvaro]</b> Morata is another one but he has never played in England so there is a little question mark there. Certainly they would be the players to look at.<br /><br />It is tough at Chelsea, people keep telling me that we need to get the wing backs in, but Moses has been excellent. Alonso has been excellent so you are going to have to go some way to find players who are better for next season. I went back in December and you could tell that they had the feel of champions, the place was very relaxed and calm. You know the quality’s there so you just look to get a feel around the place. I went to watch them twice and they got the job done in both games, which shows what a team they were. They went on to win it comfortably and Conte put together a really top side<br /><br />I spoke to the lads <b>[about Conte]</b>. I sadly didn’t get the chance to speak with him because he is a busy man, but I was just looking at what he did from afar. I thought they were such a well-drilled team. It was the first time Chelsea had reinvented themselves for many years. I think Conte has come in with that system, and it seems to be the system that’s in vogue at the moment. They are the best at it Chelsea, they know it inside out and he has got the players to buy into it. They were so well-drilled <b>[in the system]</b> and that’s what got them over the line in the end</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole has spent his career battling Tottenham Hotspur with both Chelsea and West Ham United]</b> For me, if I was England manager, I think Harry Kane and Dele Alli are the players you have got to build your team around. We have got quality. A fit <b>[Daniel]</b> Sturridge gets into any top team in the world.<br /><br /><b>[Jack]</b> Wilshere is a top player but you have to make sure their bodies are right. There’s enough quality to win you games but certainly Kane and Alli, put your arm around them to and say, we are going to build the team around you. There are not many strikers in world football as good as Kane at the moment. Dele Alli is developing into one of the best No. 10s/9.5-type players around. <b>[It hurts]</b> more than you would know <b>[to say it]</b>, it is a tough one.<br /><br />I admire what they have done at Tottenham, from a professional point of view. Only time will tell whether that group of players go on and win things but certainly the future is bright for them. For England, the future for England is Kane and Alli<br /><br />With England, I am very excited about the group. I know they haven’t done well in the past three tournaments but I am very excited. They have pace, ability and the expectations are very low at the moment. It has got to benefit these young lads. I like the team, I like the players. I think Gareth is a good manager and he has the strength of knowing them. He has worked with all of them before. It has seemed to have worked with Germany <b>[taking over from the youth team]</b>. Not only that, you look at England from the U21s downwards, outstanding results that people have been getting there. I think from Dan Ashworth onward, the coaches have been doing a fantastic job and I think we are going in the right direction</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole is worried that Chelsea will miss John Terry more than they might have imagined next season]</b> He is the greatest captain in the club’s history, that’s for sure. It is going to be a big miss for the club, I am sure the people will have an idea of what they can do to replace him but he might be one of those players that you don’t realise the void until he is gone.<br /><br />It is going to be tough to replace him. He has had a magic career. He has got many good years ahead of him, I am sure. He is one of the greatest, for sure. Time will be kind on JT, what he has achieved and his longevity as well. He is one of the greats - a top, top player.<br /><br />On the ball he was brilliant, he could play with both feet, his organisation <b>[was great]</b>. You ask any striker who has played against him and it was a complete nightmare for them. He has a great understanding of the game. You don’t get into that category that he has put himself in without having all the aspects that you need. He will go down as a true warrior. Someone who made players around him better so I can’t speak highly enough of him and what he has done<br /><br />I told him how good it was when I was out here. I know that there were options for him over here but he had to sit down with his family <b>[and see what was best]</b>. He has got an enthusiasm for playing football which shines through when he plays, he loves competing. So when that leaves you, that’s when you pack it in. No-one should tell you when it is the right time <b>[to retire]</b>. It’s different, some people like to go out on the top, others like to carry on going and squeeze as much out of it as possible. He still has the desire to play</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole is praying that Eden Hazard’s latest injury prevents him from joining Real Madrid this summer]</b> He is fantastic. He is one of the top players in the world. It is a shame he got this injury with Belgium but with the speculation that was coming, on a selfish point of view for Chelsea, it might mean that we can keep hold of him for another year <b>[with Real Madrid interested]</b>. For me, he is the best player at the club. I think he is the best player in the league. I can’t speak highly enough of him. He would be very expensive to replace. I don’t know where you could go to replace him. Eden is a leader in the dressing room. He is also very well liked in the dressing room. People around the club like him and he appears to have settled very well. He is an established player and it is very important that the club keeps hold of him.<br /><br />When I went to speak to coach Rudi Garcia about playing at Lille he said ‘ok we have got Dimitri Payet, who is a very, very good player and we have got Eden Hazard, who is a special player. We have got this formation and here’s where we are playing you, Hazard and Payet’. I had heard about him <b>[a bit]</b>, he was linked with clubs already when I signed. On my debut, he scored two goals and I saw that he was special player. He was like a hero there, he came through the system. I knew straight away. Players are the best judge and when you play with someone and see him day-in, day-out I knew he was a special player. I was asked about him <b>[by Chelsea]</b>. Obviously, I gave him a glowing endorsement, I remember talking about it<br /><br />I remember he also had a choice of many clubs to go to. I said Chelsea was the right place for him <b>[while I was at Lille]</b>. It was a transitional time <b>[for Chelsea]</b>, plus living in London is big for foreign players, particularly the lads from Belgium, with the train going to Belgium. When you are a young lad, with a young family as well, I think it was the right fit for him. If he stays at Chelsea, I think he will go on to be the greatest player in the club’s history. I stand by that<br /><br />He was good and he was confident. In England, he would have been told <b>[to rein in]</b> his attitude, you know. For me, I think his attitude was spot on. He wasn’t running around tracking players and making tackles. Things like that. He would take the ball in any situation. He was a brave kid and he is a brave player now. I liked his attitude. He had swagger. I had no doubts about his attitude, I would have had more concerns with a nervous kid, who is a bit nervous. He did it his own way. He had the ability and he knew it<br /><br />He is a nice person as well. If you speak to him, you see he is a good guy. I think my French was better than his English back then but his English has come on. He didn’t have to train to his maximum every day because come Saturday, he knew he would be the matchwinner. I would love to manage a player like him <b>[one day]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte should stay as Chelsea manager]</b> I would love to see him stay. I think he is very highly regarded by the players and the fans. It has got to be a choice for the people who are a lot more informed of the situation than me. I trust the people, the higher-ups at Chelsea to make the right decisions for the club because the club has been serial winners for 20 years and I am sure it will carry on. All of the chasing pack will have to spend a lot of money this summer <b>[after Manchester City won the title]</b>. Man City are a special side but I also feel like Manchester United will close the gap next year.

  <p><b>[In 2009 Joe Cole suffered a pivotal injury in his career after tearing a cruciate ligament in a 4-1 win against Southend]</b> I do yoga. I do that but real relaxing yoga and nothing too strenuous as there’s thousands of different types. My wife does it as well. I would say that I am more or less a pescatarian now. I don’t eat meat. I try to cut down on fish and just have it once or twice around games, apart from that I am a vegetarian. I eat good quality food and I have good quality rest. That’s the main thing. I don’t do anything like ice baths or anything like that. A lot of people seem to like it but I just have good quality food and rest.<br /><br />You make a lot of sacrifices to be a footballer but it is more than worth it. A lot of people find it strange <b>[to give up meat]</b> but it is working because I am still here, I am still working and I am still running so <b>[I am happy with it]</b>. So many different ways, what has really helped me is training less actually but with more quality. As much as you get all these recovery protocols and little things you are supposed to be doing, but the most important thing is listening to your body. When I am tired, the manager understands.<br /><br />On most days anyway, as sometimes you have to push through it. Particularly when we are close to games, the Tampa Bay Rowdies have been good with me and allowing me to listen to my body and train only when needed. It was always going to be on how I feel. I feel great and I love playing football still so I thought I would keep going. I am still affecting the games in a positive way. I am still enjoying myself so it was an easy decision in the end. The Rowdies were happy with me. We moved on, we will do another year and then we will assess it at the end of the year.<br /><br />It is one of them things, everyone around you wants to plan a year in advance, eight months in advance but being a footballer, in particular, it is a week by week situation. You just see how you feel. I think ‘yes I feel good’ and try something. Then come November time I will sit down with my family and see what I am doing. If it comes to the day where I wasn’t enjoying it or there was a massive opportunity on the other side of the fence that I couldn’t turn down then you would have to make a decision. I am just focusing on giving myself the opportunity to play on for as long as I possibly can.<br /><br />Yes, we want to win the league. I think that would be a great way to finish my career, with some silverware. I feel like we have got a chance, we have definitely got a chance of doing it and that would be a great way to say thank you to the people of Tampa and everything. That’s not to say this is the end. We will see how things go at the end of the year.</p>

  <p><b>[LA Galaxy striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has made a massive impact in American football]</b> He’s had a massive impact. He is a massive player. Massive personality. It is exactly what the MLS needed and I feel like he will have a big impact both on and off the pitch for both the league and the Galaxy. Nowadays, branding and things like that have become very important. I think we have a very individualistic culture and the clubs out here they need people of this stature who bring the following they have, to bring even more attention. I think it will be a great lifestyle for Zlatan and I am sure he will love it. It is a wonderful way of life and I think the players appreciate the anonymity that the United States offers, to a certain degree at least, compared to the melting pots of Europe and the intensity of the football. That won’t last forever though, that’s for sure. The lessons they have learned from the 60s, 70s and 80s when they brought the names over, they are now being smart about it. I think that clever business people are involved. It is going in the right direction and I would advise anyone to come out here.</p>

  <p><b>[Mateo Kovacic is different class]</b> I think he’s different class. We know he isn’t a prolific goalscorer from midfield but when you watch him closely what he does is he drives with the ball. Straight away that’s unnerving the <b>[opposition]</b> back four because he’s got that ability to just ghost past players. Cesc Fabregas is a great player but what he gives Chelsea on top of what Cesc can’t do is he can drive and take players out of the game from a central midfield position. It allows space then for the Willians, the Eden Hazards and the Pedros to receive the ball. I think he’s vital for the way Chelsea want to play. He would like to score more goals from midfield I’m sure. He’ll be one of those players I think when he’s not there, that’s when you’re going to notice him. He drives and links the play from the defence to the attack so well.</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole has announced his retirement from professional football]</b> After 20 years as a professional, the time has come for me to hang up my boots. 716 professional games, 104 goals, for seven great clubs - West Ham, Chelsea, Liverpool, Lille, Aston Villa, Coventry City and the Tampa Bay Rowdies - as well the honour of playing for England. It has been a dream come true. All of it.<br /><br />There are key moments in every professional’s career. One of mine came when I was a young West Ham player. A senior pro, who was nearing his own retirement, said to me: ‘Enjoy every game, young man. It goes by in the blink of an eye and you’ll miss it badly after it’s gone’. He was right. Those words resonate even more now than they did back then. I tried to play and live by his advice every single day because being a professional footballer is an absolute honour.<br /><br />Countless people have helped me through my career. I don’t want to single anyone out individually for fear of overlooking someone else! Simply, to the managers, coaches, back room staff and everyone who has helped me along the way: thank you.<br /><br />My favourite thing about being a professional footballer was the feeling you enjoy after coming back into the dressing room after a win. It will be difficult to replicate that but I’ll always remember all of my former teammates who I shared that experience with. I’ve been incredibly fortunate to have played with some of the very best players of my era and even more fortunate to call a lot of them friends.<br /><br />As a fan, I loved watching wholehearted, skilful players and this is what inspired me. I remembered what was special for me when I was sitting in the stands watching games and I tried to replicate this. I hope I was able to do this for some of the fans and people who have watched my games over the years.<br /><br />Winning trophies at Chelsea was particularly special for me. Those memories will live with me forever, as will the chance I had to share them with my family. My wife, Carly, and our three amazing children, my Dad, George, my Mum, Susan, are what I’m most proud of.<br /><br />Looking to the future, I want to stay involved in the game. I feel I can offer a lot as a coach and have really enjoyed the opportunity to undertake some of these duties with the Rowdies. To lend my experience to help other young footballers achieve their dreams, just like I did, is a big passion of mine.<br /><br />Whatever is next, I hope the next two decades are as special as my last 20 years as a professional have been. Again, a huge thanks to everyone who helped me along that path.</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole claims players with ambitions of landing major honours will continue to favour moves to Chelsea]</b> Because the expectation is that they <b>[Chelsea]</b> have always got to be there, which Chelsea have been for the last 20 years, it becomes a crisis quicker than it does at Arsenal. With Arsenal, they’re probably not going to win anything, they’re in a 10-year transitional period. Chelsea demand to win things. If you’re a player, you’d much rather move to Chelsea than Arsenal, there’s a better quality of player there and you’ve got more chance of winning things.<br /><br />The response was excellent, I think Sarri’s put his marker down, ‘I’m going this way, we’re sticking with my philosophy’ and the lads bought into it. I don’t think there’s much difference between the Chelsea we saw <b>[against Malmo]</b> and the Chelsea of the first two months of the season. Maybe they ran into a very good Bournemouth team and a Manchester City team on immense form, so it inflates things. It was a massive result for Sarri.

  <p><b>[Chelsea’s players must recognise the importance of a crucial run of fixtures in the next two weeks]</b> When you get that many great players in one dressing room it’s hard to manage. But Sarri is doing a good job. After this run of three away games, which was very difficult for us, there was a settling-in period against Malmo. The Man Utd game, the cup final, this next two weeks is going to be defining in Chelsea’s season. That’s clear. It always comes to a head. Every season comes to a head where you get a week or two and it’s a crucial week. It’s important that the players recognise it and I think they do. If they get four or five great results over the next month, the season could be a real positive one for the club<br /><br />Last year was a really bad year in terms of where we finished up, obviously missing out on the Champions League. I think time will tell on how successful Sarri will be. One thing you have to admire is he’s committed to his style and his philosophy and he wants the club to adhere to that. You have to admire that so much. Against Malmo they were excellent in trying to do what the manager wanted<br /><br />If you’re lucky enough to be playing in Europe you have four competitions to try and win every year. This is my fan head on. You want to win one of them trophies. We’d all love to win the Champions League, it’s probably the most difficult one to win, you need the gods to be on your side, the margins are so small. The Premier League is probably the best indicator of how well you did over the course of the season. And then both cups are really prestigious to win. Chelsea want to be getting their hands on one of them trophies. That will always be the standard that this club is set by. That’s a good thing. I don’t think it’s a bad thing. You want to set standards and the club has certainly set high standards for everyone involved</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole switches focus to NHS heroes with £1m charity drive]</b> The help the NHS does now needs to be remembered. It is going to be a massive thing for our generation. There’s been nothing like this in our lifetimes that has affected the world so much and touched all our lives. People are losing loved ones at the top end of the scale; then there’s people’s jobs being taken away or just being locked in. It is something that has made us realise that we are all in it together. We need to be better to people. We need to hold onto it when we come out of this on the other end. Globally, we need to make sure it can’t happen again. We started up the charity initiative which has gone crazy and it has taken up a lot of our time. Me and my wife have been looking to help because we have a lot of friends in the NHS: doctors, nurses and surgeons. We wanted to put our money somewhere and we didn’t find the right place that we liked. We met some friends and started it four weeks ago. It has gone from strength to strength and we have raised over to £750,000 and we are going strong. We are getting PPE to the frontline with the donations from companies and brands. We are just bringing awareness to it and trying to do our bit. We have 20 volunteers working with us with all different skill sets. It has taken on a life of itself and it has been a force for good. This is not something that is just for the next four or five weeks. This is something we hope stays around for a long time because these people are heroes with what they do. We are delighted we can do a little bit to help but you have to do it<br /><br />It was an unbelievable year. My journey at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is not done yet; I am sure I will be back someday in some capacity. I learned so much. It is amazing what a high-level environment it is and it is shown by the achievements. Everyone there was brilliant and I just wanted to broaden up my horizons. I will probably come back at some point. I had set up training ground visits all over the world that I was lining up. I was going to be with England U21s in March for that campaign. I was going to get over to Germany to work. I had all these things in place which have been knocked back. I want to go around the world and meet the top managers at top clubs to see what everyone is doing to be at the front. There’s a sense of that <b>[wanting to be a coach like <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> or <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>]</b>, but I don’t see it in the near future. I see a different route. I will come out of this and we will all have different perspectives on life. It is something that I will do at some point and stepping into that I want to be well informed by going around the world and I love my job at BT Sport. I am picking up and learning all the time. When my time comes I will know, but at the moment I have a lot to do. The show, my charity and I feel like it is a lot on my plate<br /><br />Mason is a terrific player with the world at his feet. He is a fantastic footballer with a great attitude. It is like 99 per cent of the lads in the academy who are so well-schooled off the pitch in that system that they have been brought up in. He has the right attitude. I think he could potentially be at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for the next 10 or 15 years. It is a privilege to have watched him come through the youth stage in the latter stages that I did. He has developed into the player he has.

That first game when we sit down together as a world community to kick-start <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> will be a great moment. We will all sit back and we will all remember how much we are privileged to be living in this age where we can watch these <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players and these Champions League players do their thing</p>

I think they’re the right type of players for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, so the club in that sense I think is in a strong, strong position and, you know, a lot of people have to share out the credit for that, but I think mainly you’ve got to look at Frank coming in. I think he’s taken it in his stride and he looks like he’s going to be a top, top manager.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> star <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> would shine for any team in the world]</b> I’m sure he has plenty of options. Any of the big clubs, not just in England but Europe. I think he’s the type that can pull on any shirt and it wouldn’t be too heavy for him. I include the England shirt with that. His England career has been a long time coming for various reasons but no shirt would be too heavy for Jack. He’d be able to wear it<br /><br />I love Jack. I think he’s an immense talent. I love watching him play. Jack is the kind of player that, as fans, you go to watch football for. He plays strong-minded, super talented, he’s artistic and he’s become a pivotal figure at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>. I think if they were to go down I think even the most ardent of Villa fans would wish him well on his way, and he’s just a great player.</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole says <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a> fits the ethos at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> Similar to <b>[Timo]</b> Werner, he fits the ethos - he is young, he’s hungry, he’s explosive and athletic. I think he’s got a lot of talent, if he comes to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, working with the group there - in Brendan <b>[Rodgers]</b> he’s got a great manager and a great team up at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. But <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s a step up from <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. I know they are sitting above <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in the table at the moment but having the opportunity to work with Frank and improve would be immense for him. He’s got the left-back position for England in his hands at the moment. My advice would be to keep performing, keep consistent and if he does do that he can be England’s left-back and, if he does come to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s left-back for many years. He’s a terrific player, a real talent</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole says the time has come for <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> to experiment with <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> in a midfield role]</b> Trent has won everything in the game he can win. He is 21 and I bet he doesn’t even think about that. He goes onto the pitch and is free. If I was <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> now I would use this opportunity to have a look at him in the midfield. He is one of the best passers in the country anywhere. I would maybe even try him in the midfield for England. That range of passing, the set-pieces, he is just a fantastic talent and he is going to be having the time of his life</p>
