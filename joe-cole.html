  <p><b>[Quote on Ashley Cole]</b> What a servant he has been for his country. To get 100 caps for any country is amazing but for England, with the competition he has had to fend off over the last yen years, it is phenomenal. <b>[. . .]</b> I was lucky enough play on the left side for England many times with him behind me. It’s a dream. You see him coming up in your wing mirrors, overlapping you every time, giving you options, and the one thing about Ashley is he never moans about not getting the ball, which was great for me. And his quality in the final third is brilliant. A lot of people forget he started out as a striker at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I remember playing against him as a kid and he was a brilliant striker as well. He’s just a great player</p>

He’s certainly the most talented all-round footballer I’ve played with and he’s already a hero with the fans. I hope he stays there for the rest of his career. My first game in France with Lille, <b>[then-coach]</b> <a href="rudi-garcia.html">Rudi Garcia</a> was saying to me, ‘we’ve got this good kid, Eden Hazard’. He said ‘I want you to play with him’. And then he scored two of the best goals you’ll see within 20 minutes and I thought, ‘I don’t know if I’m good enough to play with him’</p>

  <p><b>[The Blues saw their <a href="kepa-arrizabalaga.html">Kepa Arrizabalaga</a> refuse to be substituted during a meeting with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at Wembley Stadium]</b> I think the manager’s in such a strong position. He made the right decision, the points are in the pocket. I think he leaves him in. And by the way he’s a full international, he’s a very good goalkeeper. He’s played for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, he’s played for big clubs, he won’t let you down. Sometimes the goalkeepers, you might say he’s not had much to do.

They were outstanding defensively<br /><br /><b>[Cole also praised the bravery of <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> in pulling a big-money addition out of the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> side while being fully aware that such a decision could backfire and generate plenty of unwelcome discussion]</b> I think it’s easy for someone like <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a>, who had them years of dominance and stature at the club, to do things like that. I think for a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> manager to things like that, there’s other factors to it. We’ve seen the history where the club have changed managers quite regularly. So it’s more of a gamble <b>[at Chelsea]</b>. If <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a> at Man United does that, everything’s going in that direction and that’s that. But at this club things can change very quickly. You can’t criticise the board for that as well because they’ve won things and they’ve been successful. He’s deliberated it a lot and he knows if it goes wrong, it’s going to come on him. But I applaud him for his bravery and I think it’s the right thing</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole sees benefits to Chelsea’s two-window transfer ban]</b> It’s an opportunity. No one would have chosen to have a transfer ban, but what this has done is give us a moment in time and an opportunity to change the culture and the energy and how the club is perceived. The young players are excited - there’s an excitement in the club that I’ve not sensed before. The club has been exceptional over the past 20 years, particularly since Roman Abramovich <b>[bought the Blues in 2003]</b>, it’s been the most successful club in the country in terms of winning trophies. I think we need to recognise that, but if you’re going to catch Manchester City, you need more. More cohesion, <b>[to be]</b> more settled, everything around the club - and I think Frank’s the man to bring that<br /><br /><b>[Cole is convinced that Lampard and Chelsea have picked the right time for a reunion]</b> He knows the time is right. People say you can’t turn it down. You can turn it down, there’s always an option. He could have said no. He feels he’s ready and, having known Frank for many years, if he’s ready, he’s ready. It’ll be a success. In everything he’s done he’s been successful. I can’t see there being anyone better qualified to manage Chelsea at this time</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole says <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> is capable of being Chelsea’s No.9 for many, many years]</b> Tammy’s got all the attributes to be a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> centre forward in the long run because of his pace, strength and hold up play. He just needs to keep improving because he’s a young man and there’s no reason why he can’t become Chelsea’s No.9 for many, many years. He keeps defenders honest. With <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a> they can maybe play a high line and Tammy can learn from <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Mason Mount was also on target for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> at Norwich]</b> <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> brings energy and he understands what Frank wants to do, how Frank wants to play because he’s been at the club for so many years<br /><br />Frank deserves a lot of credit for picking these players, they’ve come in for a little bit of criticism but he’s stuck by them. I think today was a pivotal, pivotal moment in the career for <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> as a manager because those decisions have come to the fore today and they’ve worked very well for him. Those boys are in there on merit, forget the age, all good managers put that to the side, if you’re good enough, you’re old enough</p>

He had had his whole youth career in the academy, then his first six months at Derby with Frank and then <a href="ashley-cole.html">Ashley Cole</a> has come in to play next to him for six months. Ash <b>[Cole]</b> used to speak to him every game, you couldn’t think of a better way to be educated and become a top-class centre-back.

  <p><b>[Joe Cole has not been surprised by <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a>’s emergence at Chelsea]</b> When I was playing in America <b>[with Tampa Bay Rowdies]</b>, I came around to train with the kids. We were having shooting session and the kids’ shooting was erratic, but James was on the money, on the money, whipping crosses, it was like watching Beckham<br /><br />It was a crazy game. They were hard to break down and we took advantage of them going down to nine men, it was a shame we couldn’t win. Scoring a goal is a bonus. The manager told me to come on and liven the boys up, we had chances to win it but from where we were at half-time it’s a good result. I had some mad nights and some great nights, but for everything that it was, it was certainly right up there. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans know the story of what we have done in the Champions League but I don’t really want to talk about that. For a performance like today you need personalities and characters - at 4-1 down it is easy to give it away and give it up</p>

They set up to have the ball and keep possession, so when you do that you’re playing in an expansive way. Rodrigo in particular is going to have to run in-behind.

  <p><b>[Joe Cole says <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> looked Lionel Messi-esque at times in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s 2-0 victory over Watford]</b> There’s nothing <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> can do about it. The pass <b>[from Sadio Mane]</b> into the space is unbelievable but don’t underestimate that, the weight of pass there. He’s inviting Salah to take it on his good foot. But then it’s all about <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a> there, we saw him score a goal in the week which was just unbelievable. From <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>’s perspective as well, look at the amount of defenders trying to get back. I know they’re 0-0 at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, give good credit to them, but the finish, that little touch he took there, most players haven’t got that composure, that little <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> touch, where you chop inside and just want to get the shot away. That little extra touch took it out so he could get his body shape right and just lift it into the top corner. It’s unbelievable talent and that’s the difference between the two teams. The high elite people get to this level. He wanted to improve his right foot and he’s scored three absolute worldies on his right this week<br /><br /><b>[Cole considers them to be out of sight]</b> I think the title’s done. This year it’s coming to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> no problem whatsoever. But, there will be another two or three more games like this. We really felt the tension when it was 1-0. You have to go through pain to win a title, you have to go through games where you’re not playing well and things are just not working and you show character, and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> showed a lot of character. There were so many incidents where <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> got a little bit agitated, but when they did finally get it and <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> strung a few passes together, all the little things you have to do when you know your team’s not playing well, they got there in the end.

  <p><b>[Joe Cole hopes the club will continue to show faith in a promising academy graduate who remains in talks over a new contract]</b> Well, you certainly don’t need to replace <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a>. I think he has made himself irreplaceable as a member of the group at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because he’s a young lad who epitomises what the club is about.

Whether or not I did it publicly, that is always the discussion to have with your coaching staff, what’s the benefit? For the young lad, this is football, it can be a tough, brutal sport at times.

  <p><b>[Joe Cole says <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> is already a massive asset for Chelsea]</b> We are the cream of Europe now in England, and Scotland too with Billy. We are producing big amounts of these players. They just keep coming through the production line. The future is bright for British football. It’s fantastic<br /><br />Billy is terrific, a real talent. A cultured footballer. He can be what he wants. I like him in that midfield role. But I think he might eventually develop and play further up the pitch, like a 10. All Billy needs to do is keep his feet on the ground. He’s another massive asset for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It will all come down to how he performs. Once you’ve got that shirt it’s up to you to deal with it. To be where he is and playing how he is, is a massive achievement for him and his parents. He’s a well-grounded young man.<br /><br /><b>[Asked to pick out his top five, the ex-England international]</b> It’s a real tough one but I’m going for <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a>, <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a>, <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a>, <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> and <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a>. They are all very similar, handle the ball so well. All very much modern-day midfielders. They could be in any order. These guys are really pushing each other to get better. You can bet they’re all watching each other and trying to improve</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole says Restart from scratch if we cannot finish the Premier League]</b> Obviously we need to finish the season as soon as we can, if we’re allowed to. That would be ideal. If we can’t finish the season, and it’s getting close to the following season, the only situation which I think is fair is to just restart it. Everyone’s tribal. Everyone wants what’s best for their clubs. But unless you do a blanket thing for everyone, it’s going to have knock-on effects. In my opinion, that’s the only solution. Restart from scratch if we cannot finish the league<br /><br />I’m sure there are more intelligent people than me coming up with solutions but we’re in a situation as a country where we have to stick together. Everyone in the football world needs to understand that as well. Finishing a 100 metre race at 70 metres leaves a lot of arguments. We’ve seen so many times in sport - it throws up so many surprises, doesn’t it? You can never be sure what’s going to happen. We’re in a situation where people have to be selfless in their lives and in football we need to lead the way. It’s going to benefit some clubs and others are going to be very upset but bigger things than football are at stake. It’s people’s lives and livelihoods</p>

He is a top player. I’m a big fan of <a href="ross-barkley.html">Ross Barkley</a>. Always have been.

He’s a fantastic manager. But I was playing with better players. More expectation. I grew into my body a bit. And winning trophies breeds confidence. I like everything about Ross. Technically, he’s spot on. The mental aspect of the game, he’s getting better and better. Tactically he is improving all the time. I just think he’s a top, top player for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and England. As football evolves, players like him are getting more and more valued. He’s a fantastic player</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole switches focus to NHS heroes with £1m charity drive]</b> The help the NHS does now needs to be remembered. It is going to be a massive thing for our generation. There’s been nothing like this in our lifetimes that has affected the world so much and touched all our lives. People are losing loved ones at the top end of the scale; then there’s people’s jobs being taken away or just being locked in. It is something that has made us realise that we are all in it together. We need to be better to people. We need to hold onto it when we come out of this on the other end. Globally, we need to make sure it can’t happen again. We started up the charity initiative which has gone crazy and it has taken up a lot of our time. Me and my wife have been looking to help because we have a lot of friends in the NHS: doctors, nurses and surgeons. We wanted to put our money somewhere and we didn’t find the right place that we liked. We met some friends and started it four weeks ago. It has gone from strength to strength and we have raised over to £750,000 and we are going strong. We are getting PPE to the frontline with the donations from companies and brands. We are just bringing awareness to it and trying to do our bit. We have 20 volunteers working with us with all different skill sets. It has taken on a life of itself and it has been a force for good. This is not something that is just for the next four or five weeks. This is something we hope stays around for a long time because these people are heroes with what they do. We are delighted we can do a little bit to help but you have to do it<br /><br />It was an unbelievable year. My journey at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is not done yet; I am sure I will be back someday in some capacity. I learned so much. It is amazing what a high-level environment it is and it is shown by the achievements. Everyone there was brilliant and I just wanted to broaden up my horizons. I will probably come back at some point. I had set up training ground visits all over the world that I was lining up. I was going to be with England U21s in March for that campaign. I was going to get over to Germany to work. I had all these things in place which have been knocked back. I want to go around the world and meet the top managers at top clubs to see what everyone is doing to be at the front. There’s a sense of that <b>[wanting to be a coach like <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> or John Terry]</b>, but I don’t see it in the near future. I see a different route. I will come out of this and we will all have different perspectives on life. It is something that I will do at some point and stepping into that I want to be well informed by going around the world and I love my job at BT Sport. I am picking up and learning all the time. When my time comes I will know, but at the moment I have a lot to do. The show, my charity and I feel like it is a lot on my plate<br /><br />Mason is a terrific player with the world at his feet. He is a fantastic footballer with a great attitude. It is like 99 per cent of the lads in the academy who are so well-schooled off the pitch in that system that they have been brought up in. He has the right attitude. I think he could potentially be at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for the next 10 or 15 years. It is a privilege to have watched him come through the youth stage in the latter stages that I did. He has developed into the player he has. I think he will be better after this stoppage as he will have time to take it all in and realise what he has done. After this, he will be a better and stronger player. That first game when we sit down together as a world community to kick-start <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> will be a great moment. We will all sit back and we will all remember how much we are privileged to be living in this age where we can watch these <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players and these Champions League players do their thing</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Cole says <a href="fabio-capello.html">Fabio Capello</a> didn’t fully commit to England and disrespected David James]</b> You have to say he is a legendary manager of the game, what he’s achieved is unbelievable. I think it was never a marriage that worked in the sense that, I don’t feel like he committed fully to the England national team - and when I say that, I do with full respect because I do think he was a great, great manager, but you need to be across the whole thing, like Gareth <b>[Southgate]</b> is doing. He is really showing the way in terms of what is required in that situation and I felt Fabio, for whatever reason, didn’t commit fully to the task, but I say that respectfully because working with him, I could see he had that quality. The things he’d do, the things he’d say, he had something. I just think it was always tinged<br /><br /><b>[The Italian boss narrowed it down to <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> or David James]</b> That’s wrong. I wouldn’t consider myself in the bracket of senior players who maybe had the manager’s ear with things like that, but I just think that’s disrespectful to Jamo to say that. You can have a valid footballing reason for talking about someone, if you can back it up. For instance, when I talk about Fabio I think of a legend of a game, a great manager, I just think, was he fully committed to the England national team during that spell?’ We just weren’t good enough. I don’t want to make excuses. That Germany team went on to win the World Cup <b>[in 2014]</b>. We weren’t good enough at the time - we had injuries, you can’t point fingers just at the manager, as footballers we just weren’t good enough to do it</p>

  <p><b>[Former Blues favourite Joe Cole thinks <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s side are improving, but that <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> can get his team over the line]</b> It’s hard because none of us have seen any kind of form, we don’t know what’s going on. You look at the logic and <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is going to be back fit for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>. <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> will have settled in a little bit more.

The logical thing is <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> will come back stronger because they’ve got their best player back in <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>, but I think Frank’s got enough to hang on in there and nick that fourth place. I know Frank’s a winner and he’ll be looking at <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup as well. That’s vitally important for that club because over the last 20 years has been built on winning trophies and that’s what the fans want to see<br /><br />The managers have a real hire wire job to do, you’ve got to crack the whip to get the players fit, and any players in their squad who are a little bit fragile, or susceptible to injuries, they’re the ones that you risk losing. A hamstring problem, a three or four-week problem now, that’s the season done. Managers have to get the right balance to get the fitness into the legs but also keeping them fresh enough so they don’t pick up any silly niggling injuries. An experienced manager now is vital. If you get it wrong and lose two or three of your best players for a three or four-week spell, you really give yourself less of a chance of achieving your goal.</p>
