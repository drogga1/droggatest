  <p><b>[Christian Karembeu says <a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a> should sign <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> before the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> presidential elections]</b> Mr. Perez never disappoints with the signings. He always signs big players. He had his logic of signing all the Ballon Dór winners- <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a>, (Fabio) <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, (Luis) Figo- all came to Madrid. Maybe he can do that with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, you never know!<br /><br />The next strategy could be <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>. He is young and can improve himself to be better. <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> could be the one. But it depends on the election<br /><br />I think it is not good to announce if he (Luis Enrique) did so. It’s a little bit early. It’s not good because in dressing room, when you control them, they (the players) know that the coach is going. When they are focusing on the championship, it affects the concentration. Also, seeing that <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> were confronting some problems, not sport-wise, but personal issues- all of this makes it very confusing in their performance</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Karembeu insist that <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>’s success as the coach of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> had not come as a surprise for him]</b> I wasn’t surprised. First of all, because he is always committed in what he wants to do. He is a winner, winning is in his DNA. He hates losing. So I think he is managing the team well. He was very humble to come to the Cantera. He knows everything as a player and as a coach. I am not surprised. But to succeeded so quick, maybe that was surprising. We all know he is an excellent coach and player</p>

Same goes for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> because they played against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> without <a href="raphael-varane.html">Varane</a> and they performed very well. So, I believe the Clasico will be of high intensity and will be highly demanding, actions, shows and I hope <b>[there are]</b> goals, too!</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Karembeu says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> will stay at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> this summer despite recent revelations that he wants to leave the club]</b> I don’t think he will leave. We need to be realistic. He has a contract and with any contact there are rules and laws. His release clause is €1 billion and no club will be able to pay that. I think <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> will stay and they will find a solution. We will see what happens, but I think he will stay<br /><br />He broke all the records. He belongs to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and I think he knows that. He has achieved many, many goals with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. He is a worldwide brand, just like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, so I think he is in the best place and I think he will end up staying.</p>

Only Real can win it <b>[the Champions League]</b>, that’s it. In Kiev, who’s going to play against Real, this I don’t know. Real will be in Kiev, yes. He was an amazing player and he will become an amazing coach. He’s doing it already</p>

They played a final of a European Championship at home. He saw some interesting performances. It was a successful competition. He has to bounce back.</p>

  <p><b>[Karembeu believes errors made by officials should be accepted as part of the game]</b> Obviously, we live in a new generation. If we have to implement new technologies such as VAR, we have to accept it, but again, we have to remain human - errors are human. We are allowed to let the referee make some mistakes. He’s just like us. A player is also making mistakes. Why not the referee? We’ll always speak about the ‘Hand of God’ of <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>. Football is theatrical, it’s a show</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Karembeu says <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> can become <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s greatest ever manager]</b> He would be the No. 1 manager in Madrid’s history. The club have always broken records and maybe <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zizou</a> will do it. I am a <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> fan and a former player so I would like <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> to make the record by winning three times in a row. It would give them the dimension of the biggest club in the world, but they have a real adversary in front of them with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. They are very dangerous with <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah, <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane and <b>[Roberto]</b> <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>. Nobody was expecting them <b>[to make the final]</b>, but the way they play is fantastic. Through the qualifiers they won with their own way of playing, with speed and efficiency in front of the goal. By winning many games the trust and confidence comes through the team and that’s why they have delivered great performances.</p>

He is ready for Madrid, although he will have to prove it. That shirt weighs a lot. He is a player for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. You have to sign him now! The president <b>[Florentino Perez]</b> knows it. He’s fabulous. But also very, very expensive. And you have to respect <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. I hope to see Kylian playing in white one day. You must understand that there is nothing like playing in Madrid<br /><br /><b>[Karembeu believes the right approach is being taken and is excited by the project being pieced together by Perez and Zidane]</b> Yes, the season was bad. In my time we also went from winning the Champions to suffering later. Madrid always returns. They have a good base, starting with the great captain, <b>[Sergio]</b> <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Ramos</a>. The signings have been good</p>
