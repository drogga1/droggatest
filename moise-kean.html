<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have held positive talks over renewing the contract of teenage sensation Moise Kean.</p>

  <p><b>[As the racial abuse rained down on him from the Curva Nord at <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a>’s Sardegna Arena, Moise Kean remained silent. He simply stood still, arms outstretched, his gaze fixed firmly upon those who had spent the previous 85 minutes subjecting him to monkey chants, boos and whistles. In doing so, he showed them the face of a new group of Italians: young, black and defiant. And it only made the ultras angrier]</b> I’m sorry but we’re all in the same country and if we live here, we must be treated as Italians</p>

He is happy with where he is playing for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and if the club decided to keep him, he’ll stay, otherwise, if they think of selling him and he wants to go to Inter we’ll see what happens, if they call him, he’ll think about it. My child was a fan of Inter as a child.<br /><br /><b>[The younger Kean caused controversy at the recent European Under-21 championships after he and <a href="nicolo-zaniolo.html">Nicolo Zaniolo</a> were suspended by head coach Gigi di Biagio after arriving late for a team meeting]</b> On this I agree. A coach is also an educator and an educator is also a father of a team. Di Biagio did very well and is right to have done what he did. So next time my son knows that certain things should not be done and he sees it as point of reference. In Di Biagio’s position I would have done even worse than he did, so he really learns his lesson<br /><br /><b>[Kean has already drawn comparisons to <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a> in his young career]</b> He must grow a lot more mentally. If you are strong and don’t have a head it’s all wrong. It all starts from the head. At first I told my son not to do like <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a>. He must imitate <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> or <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>, not <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Moise Kean’s father has said that he stopped his son from joining <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> several years ago]</b> I did stop his transfer at the time, his mother wanted to send him to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I said no because I wanted him to stay at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and keep learning. He was not mature enough yet. To send a young boy abroad aged just 14-15 years old didn’t convince me at that time<br /><br /><b>[Kean’s father, who was born in the Ivory Coast, believes his son has what it takes to be a success in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> I completely trust my son, he will make a big impact in English football with his new team. He is someone who brings joy wherever he plays. I’m sure my son will not look bad in England. He will make our family, Italy and Ivory Coast proud</p>

I will give my best to this team. I was convinced to sign because <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> is a club looking to the future and so am I. I know about the size of the Club.

Champions League is fascinating and exciting. What I want is to bring <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> into the Champions League. I feel ready. I have always had to take big responsibility because of my age. I always played football with older boys when I was growing up and that made me stronger. It probably made me what I am now<br /><br /><b>[Kean’s breakout season in Italy wasn’t all smooth sailing with the teenager subject to racist abuse during a match against <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> in April]</b> We have to fight against racism, everybody knows that, and the club was very helpful to me in that situation. I was concentrating strongly on playing to the best of my ability so that I could repay <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> for the support they gave me</p>

  <p><b>[Kean’s father wants <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> move for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> striker]</b> Sending my son to England was a mistake, because he’s still too young. He’s not feeling good at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, I didn’t like this transfer. I hope he can come back to Italy as soon as possible, I hope he goes to Rome, but the important thing is that he comes back here. I don’t have a relationship with <a href="mino-raiola.html">Raiola</a>, I have never met him, I don’t think he even wants to see me. He demanded my son’s power of attorney when he was 14 and together with my ex-wife he wanted to take him to England.<br /><br />At <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, where he is playing now, he is not settling in well.
