  <p><b>[Italy teenager Moise Kean says he is ready to break records]</b> I always try to be ready and train regularly so that I’m prepared when the time comes. More than being happy, I find it extra motivation to keep working hard. There are many more records for me to beat and I intend to beat them.<br /><br />When I got the call, I was fired up, excited, happy, eager to show what I could do. Ciro Immobile gave me a great assist and it’s thanks to him and the whole team that I was able to score. Wherever the coach puts me, I am happy to play. It was a good movement and I saw the gap, so I just went for it. The first goal was a huge sensation and a great moment for me<br /><br />Obviously, training alongside my teammates at Juventus, including Cristiano Ronaldo, it’s impossible not to learn every day</p>

  <p><b>[Isabelle says even Moise Kean birth was a miracle]</b> The doctors told me that I couldn’t have any more children. <b>[My son]</b> Giovanni also asked me for a little brother. One night I dreamed of Moses. He had come to help me and, four months later, I was pregnant again.<br /><br />There wasn’t a lot of money coming in. I worked at a treatment facility and often did night shifts. Then, one day, Moise called me at 5:30 in the evening. I was going to work in Nizza Monferrato. I got scared; I thought something had happened to him. Instead he says to me, ‘Mum, I’ve got a surprise for you’. I replied, ‘Don’t tell me that Juve didn’t sign you!’ He said ‘No, Mum, I’ve signed! You don’t have to work anymore and you can live with me in Turin’. Moise’s success has repaid all the sacrifices I made in the past</p>

A coach is also an educator and an educator is also a father of a team. Di Biagio did very well and is right to have done what he did. So next time my son knows that certain things should not be done and he sees it as point of reference. In Di Biagio’s position I would have done even worse than he did, so he really learns his lesson<br /><br /><b>[Kean has already drawn comparisons to <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a> in his young career]</b> He must grow a lot more mentally. If you are strong and don’t have a head it’s all wrong. It all starts from the head. At first I told my son not to do like <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a>.
