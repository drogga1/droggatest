  <p><b>[Hodgson will go if England fail at Euro 2016]</b> I have spoken to Roy. The air didn’t really need clearing to be honest. I had a cup of coffee with him, which turned into a few drinks. We are all on the same page. Roy is a really good manager and he would be the last person in the world who if - and I don’t think it will happen - but if we had a bad Euros, he would not expect to be kept on. He is a proud man.<br /><br />Roy is a consummate professional and he knows how we want to work. One of my values is, you pay for performance. Roy understands that if we have a great Euros, that will set him up well. So I think the past history of giving England managers long, long contracts, I can see why it gives certainty, but I like to have a bit of uncertainty to encourage people to go that extra yard to get results</p>

  <p><b>[FA defends Neville appointment amid backlash over sexist tweets]</b> The assessment of the FA’s integrity/regulatory team is that those comments would not meet the threshold for issuing a charge against any participants <b>[in football]</b> but as part of the induction process, Phil will be educated on all aspects of the FA’s regulatory functions and his responsibilities thereunder. The background vetting <b>[independently conducted to senior executive search standards]</b> highlighted some but not all the historic social media comments that have been brought to light. A thorough discussion about our expectations around standards and culture was part of the process.<br /><br />For clarity we were only made aware of some of those comments through the media reporting yesterday but I am pleased that Phil has apologised for those remarks today, and can confirm that the decision to close his social media account was his alone. I have personally been impressed by Phil’s determination, his integrity and values that came through strongly in his background checks and references.</p>

  <p><b>[FA chief executive Martin Glenn added on Southgate’s new deal]</b> Securing Gareth on a longer-term contract was always a priority for us. He has performed remarkably well and has given everyone the belief that England can compete on a world stage again. He is also a tremendous ambassador for the organisation, our development teams and the wider work of The FA, although his focus is rightly solely on helping the elite team. We wish him all the best for the rest of the UEFA Nations League and UEFA EURO 2020 qualifying next year, which of course brings with it the exciting prospect of final-round matches at Wembley</p>
