<blockquote>
  <p><b>[The City of Umhlathuze have revealed that they will consider legal recourse against Thanda Royal Zulu if the sale of the team’s PSL franchise goes through]</b> Obviously we are not happy with the deal. Because it deprives us of an opportunity to have a PSL team.<br /><br />What we have instructed our legal team to do - besides writing to the PSL‚ begging them to not proceed with the deal - is to look into the contract that we have signed with the team. We are not at odds with the PSL. We had nothing to do with the PSL. We had an agreement with the team. We have to look into the legalities in terms of the contracts that we signed<br /><br />Luckily the R15 million sponsorship investment was not through yet‚ because it was to be used in the coming seasons. We cannot say that they must bring back the money that we invested in the stadium facilities‚ because the facility will remain with us. But there are contractual obligations that our lawyers have to look into … in terms of breach of contract. Currently we are not aware how much that would be‚ or how we would go about it<br /><br /><b>[Ncalane also stated that the municipality would also explore whether there was any recourse for what they have spent on the Sports Complex]</b> Maybe - I don’t know‚ I’m not a lawyer - but maybe‚ out of the deal <b>[to sell the franchise]</b> a certain portion should come back <b>[to the council]</b></p>
