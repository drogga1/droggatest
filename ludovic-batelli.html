  <p><b>[Why wonderkids Mbappe and Maxime Lopez are the next big things from Ligue 1]</b> There are good players, very good players and then there are players with the talent of Kylian, who, for me, are in a category of their own.<br /><br /><b>[On Kylian Mbappe]</b> It’s also about to his character, how mature he is and quickly made his game has grown. He has an immediate vision of the things he can put into practice through his technical abilities. If you just allow him to play, he can make the difference both individually and collectively<br /><br />They are two players who have extremely high technical talents. They are not the same sort of players but they are both big talents. Maxime is about the pass, about his capacity to make others play. Kylian is quick and penetrative with the ball<br /><br />There are similarities between the two players because they have common points in terms of maturity, serenity and listening. They are not only focused on themselves, they are interested in everything they do and are attentive to anything that is likely to make them progress</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Maxime Lopez]</b> Rudi Garcia has made Maxime a very important player at Marseille. He’s a team player and very creative with his passes. He likes to play - and to play with his team-mates. He has a very interesting profile and uses the ball simply. But he also has a real ability to eliminate opponents through his passing and vision. He is also has very good at set pieces.<br /><br />He’s developed on an emotional level. I saw some negative behaviour with the youths and reserves, but he’s really improved in this area - he has the attitude of a high-level player</p>
