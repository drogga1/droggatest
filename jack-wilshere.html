Everyone is happy. We are playing better football and we have brought in good players, so I am looking forward to getting back in there with the boys.</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere has no plans to rest this summer and will instead work hard on getting back to full fitness after an injury-disrupted first season at West Ham]</b> It will be a summer of work for me. I’ve worked so hard to get to this level and I want to maintain that, getting back to pre-season where I have left off. I don’t want to lose my fitness so I have to work through the summer.<br /><br />It’s been a frustrating year but I wanted to get back before the end of the season to get some minutes and confidence going into pre-season, so it feels good. <br /><br />I’ve worked so hard to get to this point, it’s a big off-season for me because I’m now quite fit and I don’t want to go away and come back and start again. <br /><br />So I have to do some work in the summer. I’m confident in my body. This injury just took its time to heal. I’m confident I can play far more games next season<br /><br /><b>[Capped 34 times by England, Wilshere accepts that injuries may strike again but that he is being sensible in his return]</b> Injuries can happen at any point. I’m not naive enough to think that is the end of my injury problems but I will do everything I can to avoid them with strength and rehab work. I’ve been training for a while but training and playing games is a completely different type of fitness. I know from previous injuries that when you are back to training you are not there. You have to work hard to get to the level players are playing. I’ve done that by working hard but this is just another step. I had ten minutes a couple of weeks ago, now I have got 25 and I want to get even more next week and push on.</p>

  <p><b>[Wilshere opens up on nightmare years on and off the pitch]</b> It was 2016, and I picked up an injury in training. It was tough to take, because I was making my way back to where I wanted to be. I came home and all of a sudden my four-year-old son was having seizures on the floor. It happened time and time again and it happened every day for three or four months. There were times when, in the middle of the night, I’d be rushing to the hospital. Me and my wife would sit up most nights because the seizures were mostly happening at night. We’d put him to bed but we couldn’t sleep because we didn’t know what was happening with him. We would just sit up. I just sort of forget about football. I can remember saying to my wife ‘I’m not sure I can do this anymore<br /><br />It makes you realise that football isn’t everything. As men, we don’t like to show weakness and we don’t like to talk about things. That’s why I speak so highly of <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>. He said to me ‘you deal with your son, you take out however long it takes’. That’s why this injury took so long. People say ‘he’s always injured, he’s injury prone, he’s never going to be fit’, but they don’t realise what goes on behind closed doors<br /><br />I didn’t want to be rehabbing. I was in and out of hospitals, I wasn’t sleeping, and I didn’t really care to be honest. My main focus was my son. I sort of switched off from the outside world a little bit, and it makes you change the way you think about things and life. I’m a footballer, and that’s great, but family comes first always. I try to be the best dad and I try to spend as much time with them as I can. Everything I do is for them.<br /><br />Thankfully now, my son is good. Thanks to the doctors and the specialists he’s good and under control now. I want to come back for him, for my daughter Delilah and my new baby Siena, who hasn’t seen me play football yet. You should never give up. I want to play for as long as possible. I do genuinely love football. It’s my life, it’s my kids’ lives, we’re a football family. My goal is to get back in the team and win as many games as possible. At the moment, that is all I’m focused on</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have been informed by Jack Wilshere that Bournemouth winger Ryan Fraser is the ‘ideal candidate to load the bullets for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette to fire’]</b> I think Ryan Fraser would be a great signing. I know him well. He’s probably the hardest working player I’ve ever worked with. He’s got an exceptional attitude. On the pitch he runs around all day - he’s the first one on the pitch in the morning and the last one off it. His physical attributes have really come on. He’s really improved that side of his game. He’s really come on.<br /><br />Technically he’s really come on. You can see that by all the chances he created last year. You can see that by the large number of assists he got last season. That’s credit to him and credit to Eddie <b>[Howe]</b>. Eddie put a lot of trust in him and it’s been rewarded. He’s nurtured him and he’s turned him into a top player - and if he goes to Arsenal I wish him all the luck in the world as he’s a great guy and a great player.<br /><br /><b>[Arsenal are considered to be in need of more creativity in the current market, with Aaron Ramsey having departed and questions continuing to be asked of Mesut Ozil]</b> Ryan would be the ideal candidate to load the bullets for Aubameyang and Lacazette to fire up front. Imagine him and Ozil in the side. Imagine the number of chances they would create for the strikers. I always say Ozil is one of the best players I’ve ever seen and I’ve played with and worked with. Imagine if Arsenal had Fraser to add to the quality that Ozil can provide? They would be some team. The fans would love it</p>

They set up differently to what we expected and maybe they caught us by surprise. We didn’t know who should press the centre-back and who should stay and when you’ve got a player like Jonjo Shelvey in the middle controlling the game it makes it difficult</p>

When you play against experienced players who understand the game, it’s going to happen. You can’t get frustrated. They’re clever players. A team like us who like to attack could learn from that. They do that counter-press. They lose the ball and bang, they go straight away. They’re going to make fouls. If you do get out of it, it happens so quickly and they bring you down</p>

  <p><b>[Wilshere looking to follow lead of <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> &amp; <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> as he plans coaching future at the age of 27]</b> When I talk about what I want to do after my playing career, what interests me is the development of kids. I like coaching and giving advice to kids. It is rewarding. I know <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> started working with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s youth team, used that as a stepping stone. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> is at the top already. I see myself going into coaching kids, going into an academy and see if I enjoy it. When you have a playing career for 15 years, there’s a lot of pressure, travelling away and it would be nice to spend a bit more time at home with my family but I definitely want to do some kind of coaching<br /><br />I look at <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> and <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> and I think: ‘wow - fair play to you.’. They’ve gone into a pressure situation where they are coaching, they are working but they also have to win games and that’s even more pressure<br /><br />There’s maybe a little less pressure working with kids where winning is not everything, your goal is to develop players, get them ready for the next step. That’s what interests me first, but then things change<br /><br /><a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> did great at Derby but probably didn’t expect to be at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> this soon and he’s doing unbelievably well. Things change and things come up, you never know.<br /><br />I’ve got a few years left playing, but it will be interesting to speak to Steve or Frank and see how young or how early they were thinking about being a coach, they probably were about my age because it takes a while to get your qualifications. I want to keep it ticking over with the Elites, getting more experience with your coaching because you’re then ready when you finish</p>

  <p><b>[Former Gunners team-mate Jack Wilshere says <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> will get the best out of his <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> squad if given time at the club]</b> They’ve got world-class players. They spent £60 million on <b>[Pierre-Emerick]</b> <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>, £40m on <b>[Alexandre]</b> <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a>, <b>[Mesut]</b> <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> is world class.

Going forward we were always a joke. I’m not just talking about the defence but defensively, as a team, they would get chances and I think <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> has changed that a bit<br /><br />When I was playing with him you don’t really think about that but, when I look back, you could tell. He was one of those guys in training who was always on it. He wouldn’t accept anything less than 100 per cent. Even if we were doing possession, he would try and base it around a game and try and talk to you about what we should be doing. Around the training ground he was first in, never late, he would do everything properly. His discipline was unreal. On the pitch as well, he was the leader for us. In the dressing room and around the place he wouldn’t get involved in any banter. His English was good, he knew the game, he was good. He was a big player for us</p>

  <p><b>[Wilshere reveals how he was reluctant to join Gunners]</b> I was playing for Luton and we were playing against Barnet and the ref was actually scouting for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.

He just wanted to sign me for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.<br /><br />It was strange because there must have been some sort of transfer window where that sort of thing could happen but, I’ll be honest with you, I didn’t want to go. I was 15 minutes from Luton to get to London every day. My dad with his job he would have to finish work early.<br /><br />My dad didn’t put any pressure on me but, at the time, I didn’t know what to do. I remember it so clearly, I was nine and I was in the park with my mate. My dad pulled up in his little red van and said: ‘This is your last day you’ve got to make a decision’.<br /><br />I said to my mate: ‘F*ck it. I’m going to Arsenal’, and the rest is history. Fair play to my dad because we didn’t have much as a kid, he was a plumber. He used to finish work at 4pm, then we’d be out the door and it would take an hour to get to London from where I lived and that was like three times a week from when I was 10</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere has opened up on breaking into <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s first team]</b> Cesc would always give me words of advice. Kieran Gibbs was around the team and then Aaron <b>[Ramsey]</b> came in. We’d all got close in that pre-season because we were the young players, young players tend to stick together when they come into the first team. I was quite quiet at that stage, it sounds mad but I didn’t really feel like I deserved to be there. I felt like I was a kid and there was a lot of injuries and I’d got my chance. Cesc was good. He would give me words of advice because at that point I was with the first team, then with the reserves. Cesc would always say, ‘I watched you the other night in the reserves and you did well’.<br /><br />To be honest, I didn’t even think I was <b>[playing that well]</b>. I thought I was doing alright. When we got to half-time, I had done a few good things in the first half but I felt like they had dominated. They had a way of making you feel like you were running around in circles for no reason. They used to make these little passes in midfield and you didn’t know whether to press or to hold back and wait for them. It wasn’t until after the game actually <b>[that I realised how well I’d played]</b>. It was Paul Akers, the kit man, who was like, ‘You just had <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> and <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> in your pocket’. I said, ‘no chance’ and he was like, ‘I’m telling you’. Then I got man of the match. It’s difficult when you’re in a game to know how well you played and what people are thinking of games. Over the next few days I remember <a href="samir-nasri.html">Nasri</a> saying to me after the game, ‘You need to stay at this level now, you’ve just gone up a couple of levels, this needs to be your level, week in, week out’.

  <p><b>[Emery’s advice that forced Jack Wilshere out of Arsenal]</b> I got offered a new deal at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.

We sort of got to the point where we’d almost agreed it and I was almost ready to sign. Then the news came that Arsene was leaving and I just thought: ‘How can I sign a new deal at a club that is based on appearances?

I wanted to see who was going to come in and then when Emery did come in I wanted to sit down and have a conversation with him.

  <p><b>[Wilshere says <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> didn’t play him in preferred position at Arsenal]</b> We disagreed on that a few times. But we laughed about it as well. When I first got into the team I played on the right wing and I actually really enjoyed it. I never saw myself playing there but I really enjoyed it, cutting in from the right, taking either a shot or a through ball and I really enjoyed it. Then when I started playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, we used to play a 4-2-3-1 and I’d play in the two in midfield. I think that was only because of the injuries at the time but then I took my opportunity, he stuck by me and I learnt that position that year. Then when I came back from that injury, I think he saw me playing further forward. He wanted me to play as a No.10 and, don’t get me wrong, I did enjoy it but I found it more difficult playing there. I enjoyed it more playing a little bit deeper and getting on the ball, controlling the game. And then obviously, I started playing holding midfield for England and I loved it.<br /><br /><b>[despite his success in the role with England, Wilshere says that <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> never saw him playing as a No. 6, causing a bit of a disagreement between the two]</b> Things went really well when I was playing there and I felt like I was learning that role and then I came back and had a conversation with Arsene and he was like, ‘No, I don’t see you playing there’. We didn’t really play that formation where there was that one holding midfielder anyway but I wanted to play in the two but he kept playing me in the No.10 role which I enjoyed. Listen, I was playing No.10 with the No.10 on my back so I was living the dream but I just felt I could give a little bit more when I was deeper.</p>
