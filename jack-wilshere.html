  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are close to announcing that a core of five British players have signed new five-year contracts with the club worth a staggering £71.2 million]</b> I’m talking to the club and I will probably be committing my future to them in the next couple of weeks</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere is certain that Wayne Rooney is the ideal choice to captain the national team]</b> He is great. Even before he was made captain, I looked up to him. He is a leader, a personality and is not scared to tell you when you are doing something wrong. I look forward to playing for him. He is the perfect choice for us. He was thrown into the scene at Everton, like me when I was young, and he has had a fantastic career and scored so many goals. He is the standout choice for me. He was always vocal but now he is putting his arm around us youngsters and having a word with us<br /><br /><b>[On Jordan Henderson]</b> I played with Jordan for a few years, Under-21s level, and I always worked well with him. He is so fit and really gets up the pitch well. He has high quality. It was disappointing that Gerrard and Lampard retired but that is the level we want to get to. There is also Fabian and Colback - there is a good battle going on. It is a big season for me and I have had a good pre-season for the first time in a few years. I played every game <b>[for Arsenal]</b> apart from Leicester and I am feeling strong and stronger every game. I feel as though I’m where I want to be</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere plans to study the likes of Andrea Pirlo and Javier Mascherano to refine his skills as a defensive midfielder]</b> spoke with the manager and Gary Neville in the week and they told me they wanted me to play that role and I quite enjoyed it. It was my first time ever playing there so, over the next month or so, I am going to look at a few videos of this game and of players who play in that position regularly - Pirlo, Mascherano and players like that - and I’ll get better. I felt it went well <b>[on Monday]</b> but, next time we meet up, I feel it can only go better.<br /><br />We didn’t surprise ourselves. I know a few people have been saying a few things but we believed in ourselves and we showed that <b>[against Switzerland]</b>. We knew the longer the second half went on at 0-0, they weren’t going to be happy, the fans weren’t going to be happy and we used that. We won the ball back in a dangerous position and we used our pace. We got the goal and we knew again they were going to come out. We had to stay together, defend well and we did that so we are happy</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere has revealed that Roy Hodgson is giving the England squad homework]</b> Between meet-ups we’ve got to do a little bit more work. We’ve got to do our homework, to go through videos and analyse the games, because we don’t get long together. I’ll speak with Gary Neville. We’re in contact. That <b>[diamond]</b> formation is going to be the way forward and we’ll only get better at it.<br /><br />It’s a new role and the first time I’ve ever played back there on my own. Sometimes I just want to get forward and you have to be disciplined. I’ll get better at it. When the manager told me I was going to play there, I watched videos of Pirlo and Mascherano, the best players who play there. It was Pirlo’s use of the ball they wanted me to look at and the way Mascherano breaks up play and gets around. I watched Argentina’s game against Germany in the World Cup final and he was fantastic. He didn’t do much but he was fantastic. And we’ve seen what Pirlo can do because he’s done it to us a few times. They’re the best players in the role and I can only learn from them</p>

We knew we were going to win, it’s a matter of keeping concentration and keeping going. We know once we got it <b>[the first goal]</b> we could get a few. It was a very professional performance. We showed them respect and kept going. I’m happy to play either. I enjoy getting forward and I enjoy getting on the ball and starting attacks. We didn’t play against one of the top nations in the world but we had to do a job and we kept going.</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere has described England captain Wayne Rooney as the dad of the squad]</b> He’s a natural leader. You can see that. Even when Steven Gerrard was captain, Rooney was a big voice in the dressing room. He gets everyone going, he encourages and he’s not scared to tell you when you’re doing something wrong. He’s the only one now who has been playing for England for 10 years, with the likes of Gerrard. He’s been through that generation. Now it really feels like he’s the dad figure, if you like. He puts his arm around us, brings us together and gets us going. Ever since I came into the squad he was like that. He’s just a natural leader. He loves the game. He’s first out to training. You can tell his hunger has never changed. It’s refreshing to see.</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere has revealed that Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will not allow him to play in the same holding midfield role in which he has impressed for England]</b> Yes, but the formation we play at Arsenal is a bit different. I wouldn’t mind playing it at Arsenal and I’ve already spoken to the manager about it, and he doesn’t see me playing that role just yet. I enjoy my role for Arsenal as well because I can get a bit further forward, but I wouldn’t mind playing the holding role for Arsenal. That’s the manager’s decision. At the moment, I think <b>[Mikel]</b> Arteta is injured and <b>[Mathieu]</b> Flamini is playing that role. It’s down to him. If he wants me to play there, I’ll play it..<br /><br />I’m really enjoying my new position. I’ve said before, after the first game in Switzerland, that I’d only get better and better. It was my first game ever playing in that role. The main thing is the coaches are getting their points across in terms of what they want me to do, not just over here but when we’re away from here. We’re working on it, because I don’t play that role for my club, but I am really enjoying it</p>

The injury last season was the hardest to take mentally, because I have been through a lot. I missed the fight of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, being involved in all the big games and making a difference for a team and I wanted to feel that again and almost fall back in love with the game again. I wanted to get back playing week-in week-out, being involved in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I have missed a lot of football. When you are injured and injured for a while it is hard. You have to go to the training ground and go and watch everyone go out and play, go to the Emirates and watch them play. It is difficult. I needed it <b>[the move]</b> for myself. When you are playing football it is the best job in the world. Everybody wants to do it. You wake up in the morning and you go and play football with your mates. I did that for a while and to have that taken away and have to go the gym. I’m only just getting back to my level now</p>

I’ve got a year left at Arsenal and as soon as the season ends I’ll sit down and I’ll think about it. But my main concern at the moment is trying to keep Bournemouth in this league because no matter what happens next year, if I’m here if I’m not, if I’m at Arsenal - whatever - you know no one wants a relegation next to their name. You don’t want to be involved in a team that got relegated so that’s what we’re doing now, trying to put Bournemouth in a good position and at the end of the season I’ll have a think about it</p>

We have a great understanding and of course I want to stay.<br /><br />I definitely feel I am back. I felt good coming back to Arsenal and into training and <b>[Wenger]</b> has been good. Everyone says ‘you are never fit’ but last season I was fit for the whole season. It was only in April that I got injured, but my rehab went well.

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere says he is ready for regular playing time at Arsenal as his fitness levels are the best they’ve ever been]</b> I always hear the boss say it’s my first five-metre burst, when I receive the ball and get away from defenders, and I feel that’s getting better and better each day. I feel like the way to improve that is in games when you’re playing against opposition that want to win and want to win the ball back and you have to be able to keep the ball.<br /><br />That’s coming back and my fitness levels, if I’m honest, are probably the best they’ve ever been. I look at my numbers after the game and I’ve been out for four months and I’m not the one who hasn’t run the most. Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t run the most, we’ve got a lot of players that do that, but my numbers are good so I’m happy.<br /><br />When I first broke into the first team, even looking back when I was 16, you take things for granted. I was training every day and when you’re a 16-year-old, you can do that. As you get older your body changes, you pick up injuries, you have to be more careful with certain situations and it makes you stronger as well. I’ve always loved playing football and that’s what I wanted to do.<br /><br />Of course there’s been times when it’s been tough, when you’re injured and you wake up in the morning, you think ‘Oh I’ve got to go to training, all the other lads are training, you’ve got to go to the gym’. That makes you stronger and it makes you appreciate it more and try and do everything you can to keep fit and keep on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere hails Arsenal’s summer recruits]</b> Lacazette, of course <b>[has impressed]</b>. I think he’s gone a little bit under the radar with Morata <b>[doing so well]</b>, but to come in from the French league to a big club in England and score four goals in his first seven or eight games <b>[is very good]</b>. He’s doing well and he’s only going to get better. His movement is world class and, for a midfielder, that’s what you want from your striker. He nearly scored against Brighton in the first minute and that could have been goal of the season. Sometimes he comes to feet and then he can go in behind as well. I’m sure there’s much more to come, not just from those two but from the whole team.<br /><br />Sead’s turned into a real fans’ favourite because he’s no-nonsense, even in training. He’s a natural-born winner. He’s a monster physically and you’d hate to play against him. You look at when the winger receives the ball, he’s onto him, not giving him an inch. He wins the ball back a lot for the team, so he’s doing well</p>

I look around this team and you can’t question our character. People try and put us down, they always have. I don’t think the comments were justified. When we look back at the game we look back at ourselves and what we did wrong. I don’t think we can look back and question our character. We did certain things wrong but we certainly didn’t want to let the lead slip. We will move on.</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere is not expecting to sign a new contract at Arsenal]</b> There’s not a decision to make in January. I’ve still got six months left of my contract, I’m an Arsenal player and I’m enjoying playing week in, week out. I’ve had loads of questions about my future and there’s nothing more I can say until something’s official and we can concentrate on the future but right now, I’m concentrating on each game as it comes. I’ve just got back into the team and the club, I suppose, were just waiting for that moment where I’ve proved my fitness and I’ve proved that I can play in the Premier League each week for a top club so now that’s happened. We’re not waiting for anything really, maybe the right time when there’s a little break in the fixtures - which there’s not - but I’m sure in a couple of weeks, something will get done or the boss will say something and we’ll go from there<br /><br />I want to be Arsenal captain. I really enjoyed the other night <b>[against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup]</b>, it was my first start as captain and walking the boys out was a special feeling for me and my family so that is something that I want to do. I never really stopped dreaming about that. There was a time last year when Arsenal were playing against Bournemouth at the Vitality where I sat in the crowd watching and thinking ‘am I going to go back to Arsenal and play?’ but apart from that, I never really thought about not becoming the player everyone thought I would be or not fulfilling my potential. I just wanted to prove my fitness at Bournemouth then come back here and try and get into the team. I played the long game and I worked hard. I’m not saying that’s over but I’m in the team now and I need to work even harder maybe to keep my place and improve as a player as well</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere revealed manager Arsene Wenger told him he could leave Arsenal before the start of the Premier League season]</b> It was an honest conversation. It had been boiling up for a while. Everybody knew I had a year left on my deal and had been out on loan, got injured and wasn’t really in his plans. He just said: ‘At the moment we are not going to be offering you a contract so, if you can get one somewhere else, you can go.<br /><br />Obviously I wasn’t happy with what the manager had said but, at the same time, part of me knew all this already. All I needed was some clarity on where I stood at the football club. How did I feel after? It did make me think. He’d said I could fight for my position and, if I performed well in the Carabao Cup and Europa League, I’d have a chance. I had three or four weeks left in the transfer window but I didn’t find anything I wanted and at the same time I wasn’t really fit. So I decided to build up my fitness. I always had confidence I could get back into the midfield, and keep my place, if I was fit.<br /><br />I’d been in a similar situation the previous year. I’d come back from the Euros and picked up an injury in pre-season and, for the first few games, I was not in the team. I knew I had to play at that stage of my career because, the year before, I had missed a lot of football <b>[an ankle injury had restricted him to three appearances for Arsenal]</b>. I couldn’t just be coming on from the bench, so I went to Bournemouth. A lot of people disagreed with that decision but I played a lot of games and proved to myself I still could. So when the boss said I could leave, I wasn’t still thinking: ‘I need to get out and play games.’ It was more of a case of getting fully fit and showing what I could do. When I was at Bournemouth, getting back here was always the aim. This is where I wanted to be</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere has announced that he will leave Arsenal after 17 years despite having agreed to sign a new contract on reduced terms]</b> I can confirm that I will be leaving Arsenal when my contract expires at the end of June. Following a number of extensive conversations with those at the club, and in particular a recent meeting with new manager Unai Emery, I felt that I was ultimately left with little choice but to make the decision that I have due to purely footballing reasons. As has widely been reported, I, along with my representative have been in talks with the club for a number of months with a view to signing a new contract to extend my stay at the Emirartes.<br /><br />My intention throughout these discussions has always been to remain an Arsenal player. I have been on the books at Arsenal for 17 years and have always felt part of the fabric of the club. Such was my desire to stay that I had in fact recently agreed to sign a financially reduced contract in order to commit my future to the club. However following my meeting with the new manager I was made aware that although the reduced contract offer remained, it was made clear to me that my playing time would be significantly reduced should I decide to stay.<br /><br />I am sure everyone can understand that at this point in my life and career I need to be playing regular first team football and following my meeting with Mr Emery I came away feeling that it would be very difficult to do so at Arsenal. Given this, I feel I have no option but to pursue other opportunities in order to progress my career on the pitch. I have experienced some incredible times at Arsenal and have met friends that will last a lifetime. I leave with memories that will stay with me forever from my time at the club. From making my debut at such a young age, to playing in the Champions League and of course winning two FA Cups in consecutive seasons, there are just too many highlights to mention.<br /><br />There will be the opportunity to talk properly when the time is right but for now I would just like to thank everyone at the club for everything over the past 17 years, in particular Arsene Wenger and his staff, all of my teammates over the years, everyone at the Academy for helping me to fulfil my dream and of course the fans, who I have always shared such a special relationship with. I will never be able to truly repay the love, faith and belief that the fans have always shown in me. It’s meant so much to me and my family over the years and I hope you are able to celebrate the success you deserve in the coming years. Thank you. I would like to place on record my respect for Mr Emery and my appreciation for his honesty, and I wish him, the team and the club all the very best for the future. I’m feeling fit, sharp and strong and will be working tirelessly to ensure I am in peak condition ahead of the new season.

  <p><b>[Jack Wilshere has admitted that he is willing to go abroad as he weighs up his options after leaving Arsenal as a free agent]</b> I am willing to go abroad if the right opportunity comes up. Also, everyone knows I like the Premier League and the battle of it. It is literally the best thing that comes up and the best opportunity that we will take. I am not really in any rush, today <b>[Saturday]</b> is actually my last day with my contract at Arsenal, so it’s been a bit of a strange day. I have played 10 years as a professional there and had 17 years at the club. We are looking at things and I am keeping myself fit. So if something does come up I am ready to go.<br /><br />This has been a good opportunity for me to rest and reflect on my life and what I want - I am not going to rush that decision. The transfer window finishes early August, so we still have some time and with the World Cup still going on things happen after the World Cup and during. Everyone knows what deadline day is like, it’s manic and teams start to panic so we will see. I am not putting a deadline on anything</p>

I said even when I was left out, I am an England fan and I’ll be supporting the boys. It’s in my blood, it’s too hard not to. I remember for the first game I was in Ibiza with my missus and kids. We found some little bar somewhere because I felt I had to watch it. I’m enjoying it and I’m looking forward to watching them tonight <b>[against Colombia]</b>. With regards to the future, Gareth said the door was still open to me and I wished him well for the tournament.<br /><br />I think it was important for the players in the squad. I’ve been in tournaments before when you’ve been away for a while and you’re not really playing, you’re just training. Sometimes you can feel like you’re not really part of it. I think it was a good decision, we had qualified and it didn’t really matter if we came first or second. Some have argued we are almost better off finishing second. You can help build momentum in training by keeping the pace and intensity high. Make things happen in training and then you can transfer that onto the pitch. Gareth will probably make a few changes again tonight and the players will feel fresher and raring to go</p>

Obviously I had to consider all my options - abroad and in England - but once I sat down, it was clear for me.

But over the last couple of years, I’ve had a really good run. I went to Bournemouth and had a great time. The idea was just to prove to myself that I can still play at that level.

But at the time I was injured and it was difficult, because I wasn’t fit and I wasn’t playing, and not many teams wanted me injured. So I decided to stay and I got back into the team and they finally offered me a deal in January which was ready to sign, and then Arsene got sacked.<br /><br />It was strange, everyone was just shocked and Per Mertesacker, the captain, said a few words, and I think everyone was just in shock.

  <p><b>[Wilshere opens up on nightmare years on and off the pitch]</b> It was 2016, and I picked up an injury in training. It was tough to take, because I was making my way back to where I wanted to be. I came home and all of a sudden my four-year-old son was having seizures on the floor. It happened time and time again and it happened every day for three or four months. There were times when, in the middle of the night, I’d be rushing to the hospital. Me and my wife would sit up most nights because the seizures were mostly happening at night. We’d put him to bed but we couldn’t sleep because we didn’t know what was happening with him. We would just sit up. I just sort of forget about football. I can remember saying to my wife ‘I’m not sure I can do this anymore<br /><br />It makes you realise that football isn’t everything. As men, we don’t like to show weakness and we don’t like to talk about things. That’s why I speak so highly of <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>. He said to me ‘you deal with your son, you take out however long it takes’. That’s why this injury took so long. People say ‘he’s always injured, he’s injury prone, he’s never going to be fit’, but they don’t realise what goes on behind closed doors<br /><br />I didn’t want to be rehabbing. I was in and out of hospitals, I wasn’t sleeping, and I didn’t really care to be honest. My main focus was my son. I sort of switched off from the outside world a little bit, and it makes you change the way you think about things and life. I’m a footballer, and that’s great, but family comes first always. I try to be the best dad and I try to spend as much time with them as I can. Everything I do is for them.<br /><br />Thankfully now, my son is good. Thanks to the doctors and the specialists he’s good and under control now. I want to come back for him, for my daughter Delilah and my new baby Siena, who hasn’t seen me play football yet. You should never give up. I want to play for as long as possible. I do genuinely love football. It’s my life, it’s my kids’ lives, we’re a football family. My goal is to get back in the team and win as many games as possible. At the moment, that is all I’m focused on</p>

We’d all got close in that pre-season because we were the young players, young players tend to stick together when they come into the first team. I was quite quiet at that stage, it sounds mad but I didn’t really feel like I deserved to be there. I felt like I was a kid and there was a lot of injuries and I’d got my chance. Cesc was good. He would give me words of advice because at that point I was with the first team, then with the reserves. Cesc would always say, ‘I watched you the other night in the reserves and you did well’.<br /><br />To be honest, I didn’t even think I was <b>[playing that well]</b>. I thought I was doing alright. When we got to half-time, I had done a few good things in the first half but I felt like they had dominated. They had a way of making you feel like you were running around in circles for no reason. They used to make these little passes in midfield and you didn’t know whether to press or to hold back and wait for them. It wasn’t until after the game actually <b>[that I realised how well I’d played]</b>. It was Paul Akers, the kit man, who was like, ‘You just had <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> and <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> in your pocket’. I said, ‘no chance’ and he was like, ‘I’m telling you’. Then I got man of the match. It’s difficult when you’re in a game to know how well you played and what people are thinking of games. Over the next few days I remember <a href="samir-nasri.html">Nasri</a> saying to me after the game, ‘You need to stay at this level now, you’ve just gone up a couple of levels, this needs to be your level, week in, week out’. It’s alright everyone else saying it, but when it comes from your team-mates, the people who see you every day, it meant more</p>

  <p><b>[Emery’s advice that forced Jack Wilshere out of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> I got offered a new deal at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I obviously had a year left and even into January I was playing in the team and there were still no discussions happening. Then finally the discussions happened. I got offered a new deal and I wasn’t really happy with it. I’d have conversations with Arsene and he was doing all he could for me. We sort of got to the point where we’d almost agreed it and I was almost ready to sign. Then the news came that Arsene was leaving and I just thought: ‘How can I sign a new deal at a club that is based on appearances? I need to play to get a decent amount of money with a manager who I don’t know if he likes me’. I wanted to see who was going to come in and then when Emery did come in I wanted to sit down and have a conversation with him. He said to me: ‘If I was you I would leave, you’re not in my starting XI’. He had plans to buy a midfield, I think he bought <b>[Lucas]</b> <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Torreira</a> and a few others and I wasn’t in his plans. That was the moment when I decided. A lot of people who I’d grown up with, the staff, the physios, my friends basically <b>[had left]</b> - it felt like the club was going in a different direction and I decided to leave. I was part of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, it’s a massive club and I was a big part of it, it was difficult. It was a sad time to leave and even now I look back and think: ‘Yeah, that was a tough time’.</p>

  <p><b>[Wilshere says <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> didn’t play him in preferred position at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> We disagreed on that a few times. But we laughed about it as well. When I first got into the team I played on the right wing and I actually really enjoyed it. I never saw myself playing there but I really enjoyed it, cutting in from the right, taking either a shot or a through ball and I really enjoyed it. Then when I started playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, we used to play a 4-2-3-1 and I’d play in the two in midfield. I think that was only because of the injuries at the time but then I took my opportunity, he stuck by me and I learnt that position that year. Then when I came back from that injury, I think he saw me playing further forward. He wanted me to play as a No.10 and, don’t get me wrong, I did enjoy it but I found it more difficult playing there. I enjoyed it more playing a little bit deeper and getting on the ball, controlling the game. And then obviously, I started playing holding midfield for England and I loved it.<br /><br /><b>[despite his success in the role with England, Wilshere says that <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> never saw him playing as a No. 6, causing a bit of a disagreement between the two]</b> Things went really well when I was playing there and I felt like I was learning that role and then I came back and had a conversation with Arsene and he was like, ‘No, I don’t see you playing there’. We didn’t really play that formation where there was that one holding midfielder anyway but I wanted to play in the two but he kept playing me in the No.10 role which I enjoyed. Listen, I was playing No.10 with the No.10 on my back so I was living the dream but I just felt I could give a little bit more when I was deeper.</p>
