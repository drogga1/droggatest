  <p><b>[Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patricio spoke glowing terms and relishes pitting his wits against <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> Ronaldo]</b> For us as athletes, we want to train, we want to face the best in the world and that is what we work towards every day so we can compete and improve.<br /><br />To have the opportunity of working with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> across the board in training, he is a fantastic professional that gives us a reason to be proud and we learn a lot.<br /><br />We are also lucky to share the dressing room with him and work alongside him. For any player or coach, it gives a reason to be proud</p>

Manchester City failed to collect their first trophy of the 2019-20 season after losing the Premier League Asia Trophy final to Wolves on penalties. Following a goalless draw in Shanghai on Saturday, Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patricio saved three penalties to seal a 3-2 shoot-out victory for Nuno Espirito Santo’s side</p>

  <p><b>[Nuno Espirito Santo to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> talk leads Rui Patricio to make plea to <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> boss to stay put]</b> Nuno is an outstanding coach, and he is also a leader. We need him to keep developing, not only the staff but the players as well. It’s extremely important to keep Nuno at the club. We have ambitions, so that’s the only way to develop the club. Every competition we are involved in, we want to win<br /><br />Obviously, stability is needed in any club for the club to develop. It’s not just about the coach. We have a good staff who work very well for the club. We have to work hard as a team – players and staff</p>
