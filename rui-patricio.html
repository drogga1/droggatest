  <p><b>[Chaotic scenes at Portuguese giants Sporting have seen 19 players suspended amid a war of words between the first-team squad and outspoken president Bruno de Carvalho]</b> On behalf of the Sporting squad, through this joint statement, we express our disgust with our president’s public statements after yesterday’s game for which we did not achieve the result we desired. The lack of support at this moment from the one who is supposed to be our leader, pointing the finger to publicly blame an athlete’s performance when a group is ruled by its combined effort.</p>

We need him to keep developing, not only the staff but the players as well. It’s extremely important to keep Nuno at the club. We have ambitions, so that’s the only way to develop the club. Every competition we are involved in, we want to win<br /><br />Obviously, stability is needed in any club for the club to develop. It’s not just about the coach. We have a good staff who work very well for the club. We have to work hard as a team - players and staff</p>
