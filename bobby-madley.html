  <p><b>[Former <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> referee Bobby Madley has revealed he was sacked for sending a video in which he mocked a disabled person]</b> F*ck me, I have a chance of winning the parents race this year <b>[â€¦]</b> Out of context, I accept this reads shamefully. I accept that. However, my intention was that the joke was aimed at myself<br /><br />I regret taking the video, I regret sending that video, and while it was a dark humoured joke, it was just that: a joke. It was not intended to shame anyone, it was not intended to be seen by anyone other than the person I sent it to privately in a text message on my own personal phone<br /><br />I started refereeing at 16, my career was over at 32. I had my dream job, a well paid and incredibly enjoyable job that I loved every single minute of. The footballs and medals are now all I have to remember those years of dedication and hard work</p>
