<blockquote>
  <p>[The lack of transfer activity at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> this summer has come as a surprise to former Reds star Ray Houghton] I don’t know the reason behind it. I think the manager has been brilliant in previous seasons because he has got them in really early. I remember when [Sadio] Mane first came in from <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> – I did one of the pre-season games and the manager was constantly on the sidelines getting back into position and he did it two seasons ago with Mohamed and he didn’t really know what was going on. Coming from Roma and being at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, I think he was given bit more of a license to go and express himself whereas at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> the manager was constantly on him trying to get him back into position and the same last season with <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a> and Alisson.<br /><br />So he’s always went out there and brought in the right player at the right time, just this time around I’m slightly surprised <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> haven’t gone out there and brought in one or two more additions just to improve the squad. Because don’t forget, there’s a few who have left. Moreno has gone, Sturridge has gone amongst others, so you have depleted the squad and I think you have to add to that. But if you’re going to be competing to win the league again this season, you’ve got to show that consistency</p>
