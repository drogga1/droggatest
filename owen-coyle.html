  <p><b>[Manager Owen Coyle says <a href="fabrice-muamba.html">Fabrice Muamba</a> could make full recovery]</b> They say that is something that has happened before. Every case is individual and on its own merits.<br /><br />The two things that Fabrice have that can help him in this battle are that he is such a fit young man and the life he’s had. He’s had to fight every step of the way in his young journey, so those two things I am sure will stand him in good stead. Football pales into insignificance at this moment, as we know, but he’s an outstanding young individual and we pray that he gets back to that level again<br /><br />It’s early days, but I’ve spoken to Shauna, his partner, and his dad Marcel about it and where we all were on Saturday night, I would never have envisaged the improvement that has come. I was fortunate to see Fabrice and had a brief conversation. He has still got a long way to go but it’s encouraging</p>
