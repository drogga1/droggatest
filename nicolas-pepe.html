A leaked video of Nicolas Pepe in an Arsenal shirt has emerged on social media ahead of any official announcement that his move from Lille has been completed</p>

<p>: 2019 08 01
Arsenal have confirmed the signing of Nicolas Pepe from Lille in a £72 million deal</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolas Pepe has said he was inspired to join Arsenal to emulate his heroes past a present after sealing a move to North London in a club record deal]</b> When I knew I was coming to Arsenal, I immediately thought of the French guys who play here. I thought of Mesut Ozil, the world champion, Alexandre Lacazette, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and many more. Of course, these are players who sprang to mind because I used to watch them when I was at Lille. Also, Lacazette used to play for Lyon and so I have had the opportunity to play against him. It will be an honour to play alongside him<br /><br /><b>[He joins a list of several Ivorians to play for the Gunners]</b> Kolo Toure was with <b>[the Ivory Coast]</b> squad as an assistant coach <b>[at the Africa Cup of Nations]</b>. He spoke to me a lot about the very high level, how he got to Arsenal and how you always have to work hard and really graft on a daily basis to get right to the very top. Toure, Emannuel Eboue and Gervinho are the major players from the Ivory Coast. We talk a lot about Gervinho, for example, who played for Lille and ended up at Arsenal, so I am on the same path. They are definitely examples to us young Ivorians and I hope we will continue to follow these examples</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolas Pepe admits his €80 million price tag is a little crazy]</b> It is pleasant and flattering, but it is not me who stumped up that amount. It is flattering, but I am not thinking about that at all. I came to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because I am ambitious, to win titles, that’s why I came. Me, personally, I am dealing with it normally, my brother, my friends, they might go ‘It’s €80m’, but for me it was normal. For them it is like what the hell, I was at Angers, I played at Orleans and for them to see €80m, it is crazy for them. I was also surprised too, because I’ve come some way, so it is a source of pride for me. It is something that I will quickly put to one side and concentrate on football<br /><br /><b>[Pepe is adamant he made the right call]</b> Lille boss <a href="christophe-galtier.html">Christophe Galtier</a> imagined me at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, in terms of what he said, for me it was a decision that might surprise people, because it is not a club that is in the Champions League, but it is also a club with a lot of ambition, we are playing in the Europa League which is still a European competition. We want to win it. The coach (Unai Emery) is used to this competition, he has already won it with <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>, last year they were in the final. The aim is to do better and therefore win this competition</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal winger Nicolas Pepe has admitted that he’s lost some confidence after a slow start to life at Arsenal]</b> The truth is that my first few weeks in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> are not easy. I think that I haven’t performed well enough yet. In terms of stats or my impact on the game, for sure it’s not the same as in Lille last season or against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at the beginning of the season. It’s a matter of confidence. My confidence must come back. I’m not worried about it.

The language is different. It’s a new league. For sure everything is different for me. I must adapt quickly but I’m confident it’s gonna happen soon.<br /><br />Overall, it’s a good start for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> this season, we are in the good part of the table. Against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, we came back despite the fact we were one man down, this is one of those games which gives the team confidence and mental strength. At Old Trafford, we are behind but we manage to tie the game. For sure we are strong mentally and we have to continue building that strength in order to win away games and then be a contender for a Champions League spot at the end of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolas Pepe admitted after his match-winning cameo against Vitoria that he has struggled to deal with the big expectations that come with being <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s club-record signing]</b> Of course <b>[I knew it would be harder]</b>. It is a league totally different to <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a>, with a different intensity. For me, I had to adapt quickly because expectations were high. Unfortunately, that is not what I did at the beginning but I have always had the manager’s trust and the players have supported me. I am not at my best physically because I didn’t have a proper pre-season like the others as I was at the Africa Cup of Nations. I am trying to work hard to be stronger physically to perform well and adapt to the Premier League<br /><br />Scoring two goals is good for the confidence. But the most important thing is that there was a win at the end. It showed our mental strength and our character. We had already done it against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> where we were behind and came back. Now, we can focus on the Crystal Palace game <b>[on Sunday]</b> which will arrive very quickly<br /><br />It’s been hard <b>[to keep my confidence high]</b>, but the manager trusts me. Even if I haven’t been decisive for a while, I always had the manager’s trust. It is always important to have the manager’s faith. The key is to have good people around you. I have my family here with me so I can be good mentally, especially when things are not going well. I rely a lot on them. For me, it was always going to be difficult to come here in the unknown, with a different language. So to have my family with me is important. It’s not easy starting out here but I’m beginning to find my feet with the help of my team-mates<br /><br /><b>[Lacazette and <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> have been key to helping Pepe settle since his move from Lille]</b> As soon as I arrived they helped me. I talked a lot to them. We have played very little together, maybe just around 30 minutes. But we get on well. For us, it is <b>[important]</b> to understand each other. I hope we will play more together</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal forward Nicolas Pepe says the departure of head coach <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> was painful while admitting that his start to life in north London has been negative]</b> It was painful because he is a coach who gave me the chance to come to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. We mustn’t forget that. For me, it was something painful<br /><br />I would say that my start has been a bit negative. Based on my own expectations of myself, I expected a bit more. I expect more and it is up to me to work hard and make the difference in each match. It is normal for people to criticise me as much as they are doing because I am not making the difference in each match. I understand them. It is certainly up to me to reverse this situation through hard work. There are lots of aspects that I need to improve. Score more quickly, take the opportunities to score that I’ve been missing. It’s like that, that’s football. I also need to improve on the physical aspect because coming from France to England, there is this box-to-box aspect that you have to take into account.<br /><br /><b>[Pepe says <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> has made a positive impact on the squad during his short time in charge]</b> As he was a player, he understands us better. He speaks a lot with us, so for us it is quite simple for us to understand him like for him it is quite easy to understand us. Right now there are some players who are playing others who are not. That’s football, it’s like that. It is the coach who decides. If I am on the bench, it is up to me to put the work in to get back in the starting XI.</p>

It’s down to us the players, not the coach. Freddie is close to us because he used to be a player not long ago. He knows what we feel so it’s easier for us to talk with him. We will continue to work hard to make things better and win again. We are not disturbed by the managerial situation. I had a similar situation in Lille <b>[who had five different head coaches in 2017]</b> and we kept going. With hard work, it will get better with Freddie or someone else<br /><br />Us players have to do better quickly. We have won only one game out of the last 12. It is not enough, we are <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. It is about us, not the coach or anything else. We have to wake up quickly, starting against Everton</p>

I told him I felt ready. I showed that I was ready<br /><br />This one feels a lot better. We scored twice, we conceded zero goals. This will really do a lot for everyone’s confidence levels. We are doing a lot, a lot of video during training in order to perform well during the match. Today we performed well, we were solid defensively, we were good going forward. It is all new for us. A new system, new instructions. We are adapting quickly. That has been seen in the last three matches, even though we did not win, we were very good, we were just missing the victory, which we were able to do tonight. We need to continue like this. Now we have to go on a run to get to this top four that we need to do</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolas Pepe is ready to make up for past mistakes when <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> host <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> at Emirates Stadium]</b> It’s going to be difficult, but it’s not impossible. Looking ahead, our sole focus is on getting a win in our home game against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, and in general we have to stop dropping points and making silly mistakes. I missed a very good chance when we played them earlier in the season, but I’ve managed to score other opportunities that I’ve had. It’s not something I’ve thought about since then - on the day, it was a chance that would’ve given us a 1-0 lead, but I’ve put it to the back of my mind. All players miss opportunities, but I know the goals will come - that’s part of football. I’m ready to put it right in the match on Saturday<br /><br />I’ve done OK, but I can certainly do more. In fact, I must do more, and that is certainly something I will be looking to improve on during the second half of the season. The hardest period so far for me was when the team went through a difficult spell when we weren’t managing to win a game. We worked hard as a team throughout this time and we finally managed to get that victory at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> last month, which was an important moment for us and the fans<br /><br />The manager has stressed the importance of defending well as a team, and making interceptions when our opponents are trying to attack. He’s shown that he has real confidence in me, and he knows exactly what I’m capable of. In terms of working on my own game, he wants me to get into one-on-one situations, get crosses in, score goals and get assists, of course</p>
