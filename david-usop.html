  <p><b>[David Usop received a hit when Croatian striker Mateo Roskam is set to miss the upcoming games due to injury]</b> This is bad news for us because we really need Mateo’s service for the game against Pahang. I hope he can recover fully as soon as possible because we need him to lead our front line.</p>

  <p><b>[David Usop is hoping that the return of striker Mateo Roskam can change their luck this Saturday]</b> Mateo’s condition is getting better and I am confident that he can return to action against Pulau Pinang this Satudray. This is definitely good news to us because the squad can really use his service right now</p>

  <p><b>[David Usop led Sarawak to their second league win of the season with a couple of tactical rearrangement that worked wonders against PKNS]</b> Sometimes we play good and sometimes we play bad. Today we played compact because we know PKNS are not a team to look down on. They also had a lot of chances, just that we managed to convert ours. I’m very happy with my boys who fought hard.<br /><br />We looked at history that PKNS can win big and concede a lot also. We know their strikeforce is a very experience one but a slow one. We used our speed and our flanks well<br /><br />Mark has been performing the last few matches and scored a few from distance. We played his deeper today with a free role so that he can drop deep to collect the ball. He played well as a number 10 / number 8<br /><br />Our team has been performing well lately, just struggling with goals. I hope with the ones we scored today, it gives the team confidence ahead of the next match</p>

  <p><b>[P Maniam praises Juliano Mineiro while David Usop criticises Shahril Sa’ri]</b> Our aim was to take away a minimum of one point but that wasn’t to be. In the first half, we should have scored two or three goals. It was unlucky for the boys, who did well but just couldn’t score. The second goal is a keeper’s ball. He was supposed to come out to claim but he didn’t. Other games he’s alright but tonight he’s not himself. So it’s an individual mistake.</p>

  <p><b>[David Usop was disappointed with the team’s finishing during the game against Terengganu]</b> The players played well to get a win but our failures in finding the finishing touch is the reason why we lost the game.</p>
