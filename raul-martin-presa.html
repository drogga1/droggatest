<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Rayo-Albacete clash abandoned after ‘Nazi’ chants against Roman Zozulya]</b> It is a very sad night for Rayo and sport. We want to condemn sharply the insults that a part of the fans, located in the background, has uttered to a rival player. Football is to unite, it is not for disunity. You cannot afford what we experienced today. We have asked that this attitude stops. We agree the two teams must play in better conditions. We will not tolerate any type of violence. Sanction for Rayo? Rayo is a victim. We have put all the means within our reach. The coach called for respect. We have been a victim.<br /><br />For us, this was a vital match. Most of the fans have been respectful. We feel sorry and shame that this happens. Here players are trained in respect. I have spoken with Roman Zozulya and I have given him a hug, because he is a human being and deserves respect. At Rayo Vallecano you have the right to play around the world regardless of race or ideology. Rayo wanted Zozulya to play. We can’t blame everyone for some. It would be unfair. Today a lot of damage has been done to Rayo and football<br /><br />So I think we have all made the right decision to defend our football and our competition. He is having a bad time and, frankly, he is very affected. Obviously it has been a pretty tough situation for him. I can only say that Roman, since he arrived at Albacete, has had exemplary behaviour and besides being a great footballer he is a great companion</p>
