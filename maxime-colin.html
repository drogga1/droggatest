<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Maxime Colin has hailed the beautiful story of N’Golo Kante]</b> At the time the gaffer <b>[Michel Estevan]</b> wanted him to play right-back. I was the first right-back and he was the second one. It wasn’t at all his position. He never played - the gaffer didn’t really believe in him. It’s really a beautiful story. In Boulogne, no one expected him to reach this point. But he’s really a special guy. His best quality is to have the same level at every club. He’s really humble and never complained about training like a lot of other footballers. He just does his job. He’s done really well and I’m really happy for him.<br /><br />We have friends in common at Boulogne, so once they knew the draw they all decided to come and see us. I hope N’Golo will play</p>
