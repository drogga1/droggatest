  <p><b>[Former Kenya international James Situma has urged <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> forward <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> to remain with the European champions]</b> Let me ask; you are in a team that is winning crazily, are the Champions League winners for last season, and are about to lift <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title, what else do you want in life?<br /><br />Where do you want to go and leave a team that is dominating the most popular and competitive leagues in the world? If the coach has not asked him to leave, he should never entertain the thought of exiting <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. He has scored very vital goals so he must stay and fight for starting berths. Let me tell him to be patient and wait for his time. Players want to join teams that win the Champions League so why should he leave a team that is doing just that?<br /><br /><b>[The former Mathare United defender and captain also explained <a href="divock-origi.html">Origi</a>’s choice for picking the European country over Kenya]</b> He is a Kenyan. If you ask me anytime I will tell you <a href="divock-origi.html">Origi</a> is a Kenyan but because he was brought up in Belgium and the need for a better life, he had to make a decision. We have had challenges in our football leadership and that maybe gave him an easy chance to decide and play for Belgium. As a parent also, you would also not want to see your child suffer especially when there is a better country playing regularly in the World Cup and European competitions crying for his services. As a parent, you will not have a hard time telling your kid where to stay. All in all, <a href="divock-origi.html">Origi</a> is a Kenyan and we must be proud of him. He is 100% Kenyan<br /><br /><b>[Situma further urged <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> not to lose focus on <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> race]</b> That is the worst mistake they can do <b>[thinking the race is wrapped up already]</b>. You never say it is done in football as something mysterious can happen and deny you what looked obvious before</p>
