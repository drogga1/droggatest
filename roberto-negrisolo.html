  <p><b>[Roberto Negrisolo speaks about Brazil goalkeeper Alisson]</b> I don’t think many people have realised who Alisson is. This guy is a phenomenon. He is the number one of number ones. He is the <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> of goalkeepers, because he has the same mentality as <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. He is a goalkeeper who can mark an era. The way he behaves in the goal, he reminds me of Dino Zoff. I’d also compare him to Michel Preud’homme, who had the class of someone born to be a goalkeeper</p>

  <p><b>[On Alisson Becker]</b> The way he behaves in the goal, he reminds me of Dino Zoff. I’d also compare him to Michel Preud-Homme, who had the class of someone born to be a goalkeeper. I told Alisson when I met him at Roma’s Trigoria ground that he was born for this. He was already strong when he arrived, but has improved even more since he has been in Italy.<br /><br />I don’t think many people have realised who Alisson is. This guy is a phenomenon. He is the number one of number ones. He is the Messi of goalkeepers, because he has the same mentality as Messi. He is a goalkeeper who can define an era.</p>
