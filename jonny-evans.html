  <p><b>[Jonny Evans says Manchester United’s record goalscorer Wayne Rooney still has plenty more years in the tank]</b> It is not only the time that he has played for Manchester United, but you must also consider he has played in the majority of the games every single season and at the intensity that he plays the game. It is just incredible the way he has done it. He has still got plenty more years in the tank as well, he is still scoring goals for Manchester United and I think he will get quite a few more before the season is over.<br /><br /><b>[Rooney’s hat-trick in a Champions League clash with Fenerbahce]</b> I was at his debut when he scored those goals as well, as a youth player in the stands and as a fan. That was just mind-blowing to see what he did on his debut. I even remember he had to cut his shirt because it was too tight around his neck! He was a man before his time and what he did that night was special. It laid the foundations for him going forward to become a Manchester United legend</p>

  <p><b>[West Brom defender Jonny Evans has revealed how computer game Football Manager was responsible for his international debut with Northern Ireland]</b> It’s actually a funny story. Well, I think it’s a funny story. I played, I think it was against Germany, for the Under-21s, on a Friday night. I get a call on a Saturday night. Northern Ireland have been beaten 3-0 by Iceland and Sanchez was not happy. I got a call, ‘We want you in the full squad tomorrow morning.’ I think I was actually on my way out to a nightclub. I carried on my night anyway and joined up with the squad the next day<br /><br /><b>[On Lawrie Sanchez]</b> We were training and I think Sanchez could see after a few sessions that I could use my left foot. So he’s thought, ‘Right, I’ll put him at left-back in the session.’ As I’m playing left-back, he’s thought, ‘I’m going to have to play him’. He was so impressed with me in training, he just thought he’d have to throw me in. He just said to me, ‘You’re going to play’. Terry Gibson later told me that the reason I got called up… Sanchez didn’t know anything about me at the time, I played reserve football<br /><br />He <b>[Gibson]</b> said, ‘We didn’t know anything about you, but my son saw you on Championship Manager’. The son recommended me to Terry, Terry recommended me to Sanchez and that’s how it went. I ended up playing the game, 3-2, a David Healy hat-trick</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City have completed the £3.5 million signing of Jonny Evans from West Brom]</b> It’s great to join and I’m happy it’s all gone through. When this opportunity came up, it’s one that I couldn’t turn down. It’s an ambitious club, the owners are ambitious and everyone wants to push the club forward. I hope that I can give lots to the team and the club. It’s a great place to play football, the fans really get behind the team and the players are fantastic - these are all factors that made me want to sign for this club.</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Maguire is good enough to play for Manchester United or any top club]</b> I think he’s got the lot. Physically he’s got it and he’s good with the ball. His technique is fantastic and I think he proved that throughout the World Cup. He has great ability and he’s very composed. I’m looking forward to playing alongside him - if I get the nod. I’m certainly looking forward to see him playing more often. I think if he went to any top club he would fit in no problem. There’s no reason why he couldn’t play for Manchester United. He’s got the ability to do it. In the few days I’ve seen him since he’s been back, he’s obviously an outstanding player. It’s great that we’ve got players like that at the club so we can all push each other on</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester defender Jonny Evans admits he and his team-mates needed the international break to try and refocus on football following the King Power Stadium helicopter tragedy]</b> Obviously every game we go into there’s a huge determination to win, but in those two games <b>[Cardiff and Burnley]</b> there was heightened emotion in most players and it’s very, very hard to play like that. You have to keep your emotions at a certain level at the right times in games and it’s important that we do that for the rest of the season. The break probably did come at a good time. It wasn’t until I’d gone away on international duty that I realised how emotionally drained and tired everyone would have felt. It was a tough couple of weeks, but I thought everyone dealt with it really well, the club as a whole and the players. Now we’ve come back it’s important for us to re-focus and continue playing well..</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> defender Jonny Evans has backed his old <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> team-mate <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> to be a success at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> after his record-breaking transfer. He believes he can be as big a success at United as <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> is at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>]</b> Both are great on the ball, and Harry has got explosive pace people don’t see. He is powerful and good in the air. Everyone will compare the transfer fees but it’s so difficult to judge transfer fees nowadays. We are all human and it is weird we get traded for money. In the transfer market it’s all supply and demand and things can go up and down at any moment. The most important thing is for him to be judged on how he plays. I don’t have any worries about him there. He is tailor-made for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, it was a great move for him. He’s a player they needed. He’s got a really likeable nature about him. He will be a real hit there, he is a fantastic player</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> team-mate Jonny Evans says <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> could star for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for a decade and his £80 million fee may prove a bargain]</b> I think Harry will be at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> for eight, nine or ten years. When it comes to that point, I think people will look back at the fee and say it was a bargain. I’ve been really impressed with Harry, I think he’ll go on to be a real success at United and he could go on to be their captain, there’s no doubt about that<br /><br />I only spent a season playing with him, but it felt like we formed a good relationship, on and off the pitch. He’s a fantastic player and he suits everything United are looking for. Not just in his playing style, but how he behaves off the pitch and the personality he can bring<br /><br /><b>[He believes the England international is well suited to living under the microscope and called him the complete modern defender]</b> We talk about the pressure of being at United, but I think it’s the level of scrutiny that’s the hardest thing to get used to. Harry’s got the personality to handle that. He’s a very laid-back character, but also very driven to succeed and a very intelligent guy. He’s unbelievable with the ball at his feet, can attack the ball well in the air, and, with all that in his locker, I think he’s the complete defender in the modern game</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> defender Jonny Evans believes that former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> man <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> would have been able to play in any team from any point in the history of football in his prime]</b> Being absolutely <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> daft as a kid growing up in Northern Ireland, it was pretty inevitable that <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> was my hero. What an unbelievable player he was. We had this incredible team with all these star players, and he was the leader of them all, hard as nails <b>[…]</b> he was just there to be idolised. Just this huge, influential character. I idolised him. I remember when I was doing my YTS (Youth Training Scheme) at United, they’d always give us pieces of work to do. In this particular case, I think during the first year of the course, it was some material from a level two coaching course, and you had to fill in an analysis of a player.<br /><br />So, you have all of the player’s attributes down the left-hand column, then on a scale of 1-20 we all had to rate how good this player was in that particular field. There were, if I remember right, around 15 categories that you had to score the player on. <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a> had filled in a few of these forms on different first-team players, as examples to compare them on all the different categories. One of those examples was <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>, and every single box was right near the top. <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> was basically saying to everyone: This guy has got everything<br /><br />Everyone knows Roy was a real leader who inspired other players, but he was also an unbelievable player in his own right. Without a doubt, he could play in any team at any time, even today. I’ve spoken to <a href="darren-fletcher.html">Darren Fletcher</a> about this at length when we used to commute together to West Brom. I didn’t really get the chance to train with Roy at close quarters, but Fletch did, and he said that Roy’s touch and technique were so underrated. Everyone thought he was a midfield enforcer going around tackling people, but I think he had abilities that were just way beyond everyone</p>
