  <p><b>[Former Manchester United defender Jonny Evans has backed his old Leicester City team-mate Harry Maguire to be a success at Old Trafford after his record-breaking transfer. He believes he can be as big a success at United as Van Dijk is at Anfield]</b> Both are great on the ball, and Harry has got explosive pace people don’t see. He is powerful and good in the air. Everyone will compare the transfer fees but it’s so difficult to judge transfer fees nowadays. We are all human and it is weird we get traded for money. In the transfer market it’s all supply and demand and things can go up and down at any moment. The most important thing is for him to be judged on how he plays. I don’t have any worries about him there. He is tailor-made for Manchester United, it was a great move for him. He’s a player they needed. He’s got a really likeable nature about him. He will be a real hit there, he is a fantastic player</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> team-mate Jonny Evans says <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> could star for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for a decade and his £80 million fee may prove a bargain]</b> I think Harry will be at Old Trafford for eight, nine or ten years. When it comes to that point, I think people will look back at the fee and say it was a bargain. I’ve been really impressed with Harry, I think he’ll go on to be a real success at United and he could go on to be their captain, there’s no doubt about that<br /><br />I only spent a season playing with him, but it felt like we formed a good relationship, on and off the pitch. He’s a fantastic player and he suits everything United are looking for. Not just in his playing style, but how he behaves off the pitch and the personality he can bring<br /><br /><b>[He believes the England international is well suited to living under the microscope and called him the complete modern defender]</b> We talk about the pressure of being at United, but I think it’s the level of scrutiny that’s the hardest thing to get used to. Harry’s got the personality to handle that. He’s a very laid-back character, but also very driven to succeed and a very intelligent guy. He’s unbelievable with the ball at his feet, can attack the ball well in the air, and, with all that in his locker, I think he’s the complete defender in the modern game</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City defender Jonny Evans believes that former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> man <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> would have been able to play in any team from any point in the history of football in his prime]</b> Being absolutely <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> daft as a kid growing up in Northern Ireland, it was pretty inevitable that <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> was my hero. What an unbelievable player he was. We had this incredible team with all these star players, and he was the leader of them all, hard as nails <b>[…]</b> he was just there to be idolised. Just this huge, influential character. I idolised him. I remember when I was doing my YTS (Youth Training Scheme) at United, they’d always give us pieces of work to do. In this particular case, I think during the first year of the course, it was some material from a level two coaching course, and you had to fill in an analysis of a player.<br /><br />So, you have all of the player’s attributes down the left-hand column, then on a scale of 1-20 we all had to rate how good this player was in that particular field. There were, if I remember right, around 15 categories that you had to score the player on. <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a> had filled in a few of these forms on different first-team players, as examples to compare them on all the different categories. One of those examples was <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>, and every single box was right near the top. <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> was basically saying to everyone: This guy has got everything<br /><br />Everyone knows Roy was a real leader who inspired other players, but he was also an unbelievable player in his own right. Without a doubt, he could play in any team at any time, even today. I’ve spoken to <a href="darren-fletcher.html">Darren Fletcher</a> about this at length when we used to commute together to West Brom. I didn’t really get the chance to train with Roy at close quarters, but Fletch did, and he said that Roy’s touch and technique were so underrated. Everyone thought he was a midfield enforcer going around tackling people, but I think he had abilities that were just way beyond everyone</p>
