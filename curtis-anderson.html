  <p><b>[Curtis Anderson is more familiar with the quality of the next generation of England stars than most and he is in no doubt that they can lead the country to World Cup glory]</b> That team was ridiculous. We had <a href="rhian-brewster.html">Rhian Brewster</a>, who’s just about breaking in at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, Emile Smith-Rowe at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, Morgan Gibbs-White at Wolves: everybody in that squad is in and around their first teams now. I think that team, as long as they keep going in the direction they’re going, we definitely have a chance of winning the World Cup in a couple of years. When everyone matures a bit and you add in a couple of senior players that are already there, anything is possible<br /><br />It was difficult leaving City because it was my whole life. I left my parents at the age of 12 to move to Manchester. It was a good environment because I matured very fast. But I know where I want to go and I didn’t think staying would be the best for me. It’s different to being an outfield player, where you can come on for 20 minutes. That’s why I went to America to play games; you have to have something that sets you apart from everyone else<br /><br /><b>[<a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a>’s switch to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> has been such a success that a number of young British players have made the same move to the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>]</b> We all knew he was very good and he knew he was very good as well. <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a>’s doing very well at City, he’s in the squad but he’s good enough to play and he’s not playing. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a>’s good enough to play to but if he were still at City, we don’t know if he would be playing. There’s <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a>, <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>, <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a>. Was he going to be playing at 18 or 19? Probably not. So, he went to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and has taken his chance. He believed and backed himself to make it somewhere else and now a lot of players are starting to look at going down that route whereas maybe in the past they wouldn’t have done<br /><br /><b>[Anderson is quick to add that he still expects <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> to break into City’s first team sooner or later because of the midfielder’s intelligence and touch]</b> You could always see he was miles ahead of everybody else with his feet and in his head. He was always very good. He didn’t really start playing at higher age grades until he was about 16 or 17 because he was really small. He’s still quite small but now he knows how to use his height in his favour. He’s so fast with his feet and that far ahead of everybody else that it doesn’t matter anymore<br /><br /><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a> was playing in the sixth tier of English football three years ago and is now on the cusp of <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>’s squad]</b> He was at Stockport County, went to League Two, League One, Championship and now <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>. I’ve no doubt I can do the same thing as soon as I get my opportunity. I don’t have any self-doubt. I know as soon as I get my chance, I’ll go on loan to the lower leagues, do well and keep going all the way to the top</p>
