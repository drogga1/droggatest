<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Neymar is my role model’ - Meet David Olaoye, the ambitious Englishman making history in Argentina]</b> I’m a left winger, forward, and I’d like to compare myself to Neymar. I got a free transfer from my old club in Slovenia, I felt like it was a place where my football wasn’t really going to develop.<br /><br />Here in Argentina people are crazy about football, I really like it here and I wanted to come here. I had never heard of El Porvenir before arriving, but they have received me well. When I first came I did not speak any Spanish at all so it was hard to fit in but now they make jokes and make me feel part of the team. I’m living in club digs, it’s ok but a little boring at times - my team-mates speak very little English but I’m picking up Spanish from them. I quickly learned hijo de puta; I hear it a lot at the stadium on gamedays!<br /><br /><b>[On his skin colour]</b> I’ve had no problem, no problem. If someone says something to me that’s not really nice or racial it doesn’t affect me at all. It happened to me in Greece too and it didn’t affect me, I just laugh it off<br /><br />My main goal in Argentina is to play in the Primera Division, before I even think of leaving. From there to England, or another top country. Here I want to play for Boca, and over there for Manchester United,<br /><br />Neymar is my favourite, favourite player, I’m always looking at him and what he does for PSG, and see what I can bring over into my game that will make me improve as a player. The Primera C is probably around Conference level in England, Primera could be Championship, maybe Premier League, but here it’s much more physical, the tackles hit hard, but in Primera some football is played too. My heroes? Ronaldinho or Brazilian Ronaldo, out of the Argentines Messi and Maradona<br /><br />I think the idea of missing your family and being far from home discourages people from going away. It’s a shame because they could have the chance to develop their careers even more.<br /><br />I think that being abroad could make them play better, there are less distractions from friends or whatever and they can focus more on their objectives and goals. <b>[Jadon]</b> Sancho, when he went from Manchester City to Dortmund probably thought that it was the next step for his career, he wouldn’t be playing in the first team for City right now.<br /><br />It’s the next step in his career in another big club and I think more players should look into it. If you then do well then a club in the Premier League or Championship will want you, that’s football</p>
