  <p><b>[Ong Kim Swee and Irfan Bakti’s thoughts on 48-team 2026 World Cup]</b> The expansion of the World Cup to include 48 teams from the current 32 beginning from the 2026 edition is a positive move, as maybe now developing football nations, such as those in Asia, can break down the monopoly of European sides in the tournament. However what’s more important is for these countries to plan ahead from now on. We in South East Asia such as Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, if we intend to take advantage of the expansion and qualify for the 48-team World Cup, we must plan what we want to do from now on.<br /><br />For Malaysia, all parties such as the Malaysian FA <b>[FAM]</b> and the education ministry must prepare from now, as the players who will make up the national team at that time are currently still in school. And even if we do not make it to the 2026 edition, we must have a Plan B, and that is to prepare for the following edition, in 2030.</p>

  <p><b>[Qualification for his side will only be secured if they are able to collect 10 or 11 points from their six Group B matches]</b> If we were to qualify to the final tournament, we need to collect at least 10 or 11 points from all the six matches. And that means collecting the maximum nine points from all three of our matches at home.<br /><br />In this style of competition, where the matches are held over the course of a year, it is important for teams to do well in their first match. And for us, yes that means having to do well against group favourites, North Korea in our first match<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether there will be significant changes to his lineup for the qualification]</b> Only one round of the Super League <b>[MSL]</b> has been played <b>[last weekend]</b>, so it is too early too tell. However I can tell you this; my scouts have been to most of the grounds last weekend<br /><br /><b>[The fact that six of the nine goals scored in the first MSL round were scored by Malaysian strikers]</b> Of course this is good. If local strikers are able to score more goals, they’ll get even more playing time at their clubs, which in turn will help their chances with the national team</p>

We know that the defence is our problem area, so his inclusion will definitely help the team. It <b>[Kiko’s future call-up]</b> depends on the status. I have to check first whether he already possesses a Malaysian passport, and we have to go through a lot of processes. He’s definitely a good player, he would an asset for us, but if the rules state I can call him up and he can play, <b>[only then]</b> I will call him up. But we have to know the situation. I cannot simply say ‘I want him’, only for the AFC to disallow it later.</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia will open their qualifying campaign away to the hermit kingdom on March 28]</b> I feel that in terms of the match, it is not too tricky. It is the travelling that is a little complicated, as we are not too familiar with the country. But then again I don’t think we’ll be facing any problems as many other national teams have played away matches there.<br /><br />…there are flights to North Korea from there <b>[the Philippines]</b>…if we manage to secure a friendly match against the Philippines, <b>[after the friendly]</b> we’ll immediately travel to Pyongyang. That means we’ll be in North Korea for one week<br /><br />If the friendly against the Philippines does not materialise, I have plans for the team to take on Chinese Super League clubs in test matches, either in Beijing or Shanghai. And then from there we will take a flight to North Korea. The weather over there in March will still be considerably chilly, so we have to adapt to the situation<br /><br />If they played more international friendlies, then they would definitely be ranked higher. But they’re not the kind of team that play friendlies often</p>

  <p><b>[Ong Kim Swee emphasizes on the importance of the game against Philippines]</b> Of course when any incident happened, it will give a certain impact but the most important thing is to continue doing our job. Though it is only a friendly, but this is a big test for us after four months of no international actions and it is important for us to get a win and improve our ranking. We cannot underestimate this friendly game because it can give a lof impact to our positions in the ranking.<br /><br />Whatever’s decision that will be made by AFC, the important thing for me is the safety of our officials and players. If the government say we don’t go, then we don’t go. If they say we have to go, then we will go. I believe football got nothing to do with this issue<br /><br />Khair Jones can play in left-back position, Matt Davies used to play there during AFF Suzuki Cup as well as Fadhli Shas. Rizal Ghazali can play on the right-back position. The players will be released after the game because some of them involved in the FA Cup quarter-final. I believe they can get good rest and club can prepare their players well.<br /><br />I understand their situation with the tight schedule and everything. I always hope that if we can communicate well with the clubs, we can have good relationship between club and the national team and it can bring benefits to our country</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia boss Ong Kim Swee explains why he has dropped Kelantan goalkeeper Khairul Fahmi Che Mat for Malaysia’s friendly against the Philippines]</b> Khairul didn’t play in his last two games with Kelantan. Like I said during the AFF Suzuki Cup previously, we have three good goalkeepers. Fahmi played three games in the Suzuki Cup and I think this time, it’s a good chance for other goalkeepers to be tested. This would give us options for when we play against other teams later on.<br /><br />Afif has been performing very well with Pahang so he deserves another chance. However, whether he plays or not, he still needs to prove himself. Aidil already retired, but Fadhli <b>[Shas]</b>, Shahrom <b>[Kalam]</b>, Ronny <b>[Harun]</b> and Afif are playing regularly with their clubs so I hope if he can get the chance, he should grab the opportunity<br /><br />North Korea are ranked better than us. I think they have a balanced squad compared if we were to compare with Middle Eastern teams or such as the likes of South Korea and Japan. We know that they used to qualify for the World Cup so we have to prepare and it won’t be easy for us. We must analyse their previous games, especially their style of play with their new coach<br /><br />The important thing is to take the game against Philippines very seriously. This is the best chance to evaluate our strength and weaknesses after months of not playing with each other<br /><br />When I first took over the team as interim head coach, we drew 0-0 in Selayang and in Cebu. They are still with the same <b>[head]</b> coach and I think they are getting better, despite having different players. They only lost to Thailand in the AFF Suzuki Cup so we cannot take them easily. They are the favorites because they played plenty of international matches</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia head coach Datuk Ong Kim Swee was able to see the lighter side of things]</b> Maybe there’s a curse on the Philippines and Malaysia, whereby we’ve drawn 0-0 three <b>[consecutive]</b> times, even in Kuala Lumpur.<br /><br />I believe it’s always tough to play the Philippines. There were two sides of the game, you could see in the first half they controlled more of the game. But in the second half we got back in the game. I believe this game served its purpose… I think it is a fair result<br /><br />Like the Philippines, we wanted to win. But they have improved tremendously in the past few years and based on their <b>[FIFA]</b> ranking, they’re better than us. But to get a point <b>[draw]</b> away from home, for us is a very valuable point. So I don’t think the draw meant that we did not achieve what we wanted<br /><br />You could see that Amri Yahyah, Safee Sali, Shahrom Kalam and Ronny Harun, all of them worked very well and worked very hard. I believe we still need the senior <b>[experienced]</b> players to guide the younger members of the squad in the future</p>

I hope I can meet with the president soon to draw up plans to face the Under-22 Asia Cup qualification and the SEA Games in August.<br /><br />This is the fourth time I will be with the SEA Games team, thus giving me a lot of experience and advantage. The approximately five-month period before the SEA Games is not long, but the national Under-22 squad has already started training since early this year and it will be a bit of an advantage</p>

I have a pool of 45 players and will call up some of them to join the camp as replacements for the players who will be dropped, as well as for another friendly one week before the camp is over.

After that there were changes in the team where I only took over the team and I hope we can use this opportunity to improve every aspect.<br /><br />I believe most important is to play with our strengths. This is our second game with China. They are a very good team and to play China in China will be very tough for us.

  <p><b>[Despite a 2-2 draw against Guangzhou R&amp;F’s reserve side, Malaysia U22 boss Ong Kim Swee was not happy with the performance shown]</b> I am not particularly happy with their performance. After making seven changes to the lineup that started against China U22 <b>[a 1-0 defeat last Saturday]</b>, a number of players did not play at a satisfactory level. But what’s important is they played positively to come back from two goals down, which is a good sign.<br /><br />They need to have belief in themselves, that they can play well. Even if the opposition are a Chinese Super League side, my boys showed too much respect and they kept making mistakes and lacked confidence. So I instructed them to play more aggresively, to play further up the pitch, and it worked when Safawi was brought on in the second half<br /><br />I did not get to see the incident clearly myself, I’ll review the video afterwards and decide for myself whether the sending off was called for. In any case, it <b>[the sending off]</b> should not have happened. My players should know that when they are a man down, our gameplan and system will be disrupted, and our job will be harder. But <b>[thankfully]</b> today they proved that they can come back from behind<br /><br />I hope in the last friendly, those fielded will display good cohesion, before I decide whom to drop from the squad once we return home</p>

What we need to do is to get back our focus for the second game and hope that they players will recover well before playing Thailand.

In January, China will be very cold. Most likely we would plan to go China 10 days before our first game. In December when we start training, its pre-season here and I don’t think we’ll face any problems with the team’s to release their players</p>

  <p><b>[The Malaysia U23 head coach Ong Kim Swee is adamant that it all stemmed from the opposition and that his boys had to react to what happened]</b> When you play against the Middle East countries, they are used to beat us. But when we are on top of them, this is what normally happen. But at the end of the day, the boys have to learn. When we are leading 2-0, we don’t want this to happen. In a real game situation, it’s definitely not going to help us. Where probably action will be taken. So we must understand the situation where we can’t afford to have this kind of situation to happen that can kill our hopes to go further. You can see that the incident all start from the opponent <b>[UAE]</b>. We have to defend ourselves and our officials have to defend our players. Somethings that we need to do to protect whoever we can. We didn’t provoke anything. If we do provoke, yes I can accuse my players.</p>
