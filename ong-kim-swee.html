  <p><b>[Ong Kim Swee and Irfan Bakti’s thoughts on 48-team 2026 World Cup]</b> The expansion of the World Cup to include 48 teams from the current 32 beginning from the 2026 edition is a positive move, as maybe now developing football nations, such as those in Asia, can break down the monopoly of European sides in the tournament. However what’s more important is for these countries to plan ahead from now on. We in South East Asia such as Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, if we intend to take advantage of the expansion and qualify for the 48-team World Cup, we must plan what we want to do from now on.<br /><br />For Malaysia, all parties such as the Malaysian FA <b>[FAM]</b> and the education ministry must prepare from now, as the players who will make up the national team at that time are currently still in school. And even if we do not make it to the 2026 edition, we must have a Plan B, and that is to prepare for the following edition, in 2030.</p>

  <p><b>[Qualification for his side will only be secured if they are able to collect 10 or 11 points from their six Group B matches]</b> If we were to qualify to the final tournament, we need to collect at least 10 or 11 points from all the six matches. And that means collecting the maximum nine points from all three of our matches at home.<br /><br />In this style of competition, where the matches are held over the course of a year, it is important for teams to do well in their first match. And for us, yes that means having to do well against group favourites, North Korea in our first match<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether there will be significant changes to his lineup for the qualification]</b> Only one round of the Super League <b>[MSL]</b> has been played <b>[last weekend]</b>, so it is too early too tell. However I can tell you this; my scouts have been to most of the grounds last weekend<br /><br /><b>[The fact that six of the nine goals scored in the first MSL round were scored by Malaysian strikers]</b> Of course this is good. If local strikers are able to score more goals, they’ll get even more playing time at their clubs, which in turn will help their chances with the national team</p>

We know that the defence is our problem area, so his inclusion will definitely help the team. It <b>[Kiko’s future call-up]</b> depends on the status. I have to check first whether he already possesses a Malaysian passport, and we have to go through a lot of processes. He’s definitely a good player, he would an asset for us, but if the rules state I can call him up and he can play, <b>[only then]</b> I will call him up. But we have to know the situation. I cannot simply say ‘I want him’, only for the AFC to disallow it later.</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia will open their qualifying campaign away to the hermit kingdom on March 28]</b> I feel that in terms of the match, it is not too tricky. It is the travelling that is a little complicated, as we are not too familiar with the country. But then again I don’t think we’ll be facing any problems as many other national teams have played away matches there.<br /><br />…there are flights to North Korea from there <b>[the Philippines]</b>…if we manage to secure a friendly match against the Philippines, <b>[after the friendly]</b> we’ll immediately travel to Pyongyang. That means we’ll be in North Korea for one week<br /><br />If the friendly against the Philippines does not materialise, I have plans for the team to take on Chinese Super League clubs in test matches, either in Beijing or Shanghai. And then from there we will take a flight to North Korea. The weather over there in March will still be considerably chilly, so we have to adapt to the situation<br /><br />If they played more international friendlies, then they would definitely be ranked higher. But they’re not the kind of team that play friendlies often</p>

  <p><b>[Ong Kim Swee emphasizes on the importance of the game against Philippines]</b> Of course when any incident happened, it will give a certain impact but the most important thing is to continue doing our job. Though it is only a friendly, but this is a big test for us after four months of no international actions and it is important for us to get a win and improve our ranking. We cannot underestimate this friendly game because it can give a lof impact to our positions in the ranking.<br /><br />Whatever’s decision that will be made by AFC, the important thing for me is the safety of our officials and players. If the government say we don’t go, then we don’t go. If they say we have to go, then we will go. I believe football got nothing to do with this issue<br /><br />Khair Jones can play in left-back position, Matt Davies used to play there during AFF Suzuki Cup as well as Fadhli Shas. Rizal Ghazali can play on the right-back position. The players will be released after the game because some of them involved in the FA Cup quarter-final. I believe they can get good rest and club can prepare their players well.<br /><br />I understand their situation with the tight schedule and everything. I always hope that if we can communicate well with the clubs, we can have good relationship between club and the national team and it can bring benefits to our country</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia boss Ong Kim Swee explains why he has dropped Kelantan goalkeeper Khairul Fahmi Che Mat for Malaysia’s friendly against the Philippines]</b> Khairul didn’t play in his last two games with Kelantan. Like I said during the AFF Suzuki Cup previously, we have three good goalkeepers. Fahmi played three games in the Suzuki Cup and I think this time, it’s a good chance for other goalkeepers to be tested. This would give us options for when we play against other teams later on.<br /><br />Afif has been performing very well with Pahang so he deserves another chance. However, whether he plays or not, he still needs to prove himself. Aidil already retired, but Fadhli <b>[Shas]</b>, Shahrom <b>[Kalam]</b>, Ronny <b>[Harun]</b> and Afif are playing regularly with their clubs so I hope if he can get the chance, he should grab the opportunity<br /><br />North Korea are ranked better than us. I think they have a balanced squad compared if we were to compare with Middle Eastern teams or such as the likes of South Korea and Japan. We know that they used to qualify for the World Cup so we have to prepare and it won’t be easy for us. We must analyse their previous games, especially their style of play with their new coach<br /><br />The important thing is to take the game against Philippines very seriously. This is the best chance to evaluate our strength and weaknesses after months of not playing with each other<br /><br />When I first took over the team as interim head coach, we drew 0-0 in Selayang and in Cebu. They are still with the same <b>[head]</b> coach and I think they are getting better, despite having different players. They only lost to Thailand in the AFF Suzuki Cup so we cannot take them easily. They are the favorites because they played plenty of international matches</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia head coach Datuk Ong Kim Swee was able to see the lighter side of things]</b> Maybe there’s a curse on the Philippines and Malaysia, whereby we’ve drawn 0-0 three <b>[consecutive]</b> times, even in Kuala Lumpur.<br /><br />I believe it’s always tough to play the Philippines. There were two sides of the game, you could see in the first half they controlled more of the game. But in the second half we got back in the game. I believe this game served its purpose… I think it is a fair result<br /><br />Like the Philippines, we wanted to win. But they have improved tremendously in the past few years and based on their <b>[FIFA]</b> ranking, they’re better than us. But to get a point <b>[draw]</b> away from home, for us is a very valuable point. So I don’t think the draw meant that we did not achieve what we wanted<br /><br />You could see that Amri Yahyah, Safee Sali, Shahrom Kalam and Ronny Harun, all of them worked very well and worked very hard. I believe we still need the senior <b>[experienced]</b> players to guide the younger members of the squad in the future</p>

I hope I can meet with the president soon to draw up plans to face the Under-22 Asia Cup qualification and the SEA Games in August.<br /><br />This is the fourth time I will be with the SEA Games team, thus giving me a lot of experience and advantage. The approximately five-month period before the SEA Games is not long, but the national Under-22 squad has already started training since early this year and it will be a bit of an advantage</p>

I have a pool of 45 players and will call up some of them to join the camp as replacements for the players who will be dropped, as well as for another friendly one week before the camp is over.

After that there were changes in the team where I only took over the team and I hope we can use this opportunity to improve every aspect.<br /><br />I believe most important is to play with our strengths. This is our second game with China. They are a very good team and to play China in China will be very tough for us.

  <p><b>[Despite a 2-2 draw against Guangzhou R&amp;F’s reserve side, Malaysia U22 boss Ong Kim Swee was not happy with the performance shown]</b> I am not particularly happy with their performance. After making seven changes to the lineup that started against China U22 <b>[a 1-0 defeat last Saturday]</b>, a number of players did not play at a satisfactory level. But what’s important is they played positively to come back from two goals down, which is a good sign.<br /><br />They need to have belief in themselves, that they can play well. Even if the opposition are a Chinese Super League side, my boys showed too much respect and they kept making mistakes and lacked confidence. So I instructed them to play more aggresively, to play further up the pitch, and it worked when Safawi was brought on in the second half<br /><br />I did not get to see the incident clearly myself, I’ll review the video afterwards and decide for myself whether the sending off was called for. In any case, it <b>[the sending off]</b> should not have happened. My players should know that when they are a man down, our gameplan and system will be disrupted, and our job will be harder. But <b>[thankfully]</b> today they proved that they can come back from behind<br /><br />I hope in the last friendly, those fielded will display good cohesion, before I decide whom to drop from the squad once we return home</p>

What we need to do is to get back our focus for the second game and hope that they players will recover well before playing Thailand.

In January, China will be very cold. Most likely we would plan to go China 10 days before our first game. In December when we start training, its pre-season here and I don’t think we’ll face any problems with the team’s to release their players</p>

  <p><b>[The Young Tigers’ situation going into the 2017 Kuala Lumpur SEA Games is a lot better than in the previous edition]</b> <b>[Main concern is]</b> fatigue and tiredness. The boys have been playing in so many matches so in the first two days of training I have been resting Amirul <b>[Hisyam Awang Kechik]</b>, Ariff Farhan <b>[Md Isa]</b>, Syamer Kutty <b>[Abba]</b>. From the report we have received, they are completely exhausted so they have been given a rest to allow them to recover fully. Kumaahran <b>[Sathasivam]</b> seems to have seriously injured his hamstring, and in a few days we have to assess whether he can recover fully in time.<br /><br />Beto too may recover soon although he was not listed in the preliminary squad, and he has been training with us. I hope his injury will heal in time for me to assess his chances<br /><br />The 27 players I have now are already sufficient to fill the positions. <b>[Our situation is]</b> not as bad as the previous SEA Games, when we had a match on every other day. In the coming edition, after we play against Brunei <b>[in the first group match]</b>, we’ll play Singapore two days after that. But afterwards we’ll have a four-day break <b>[before the third group match]</b>, and then there will be two days <b>[after the last group match]</b> before the semi-final match and the final. We have a lot more depth, and I believe whoever play will deliver</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia’s SEA Games squad finalised as 6 new faces joins Bangkok group]</b> It is not an easy decision to make. This is my fourth games and this has been the toughest decision to make. But the boys will be back with the squad after the games. Yesterday Thanabalan had his MRI and based on the report, he should be available. At least for 30 minute against Brunei and fully available for Singapore. Kumaahran is fit and ready. The first 3 - 4 days, I left out few players <b>[from training]</b>. Davies and Azam only did light training the past few days. I’ll try to rotate them from game to game. We have more depth this time and I will try to change it according to tactics.<br /><br />Bangkok is the past. It was a good result there. Now we have to look forward. I believe the six players give us a good mixture and many benefits as a team. So, anybody can play<br /><br />I have always worked with great pressure. It’s normal. It’s important to face the pressure in the right way. Sometimes you are more serious, sometimes you laugh. It’s important to have this habit to face the pressure. For young players it is difficult because they are not used to the pressure. They can pay for the pressure. It’s very difficult to judge a young player only during the training session, but there are moments you have to take risks because you don’t have other possibilities and you have to go with the young player</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia U22 head coach Datuk Ong Kim Swee was not concerned by the frustrating performance shown by his men in their Group A 2017 SEA Games opener]</b> It’s normal. It’s the first game of the tournament, the boys created a lot of chances and we knew that Brunei were going to make it very, very difficult for us and all their players were behind the ball. It’s good that we managed to get the win and the second goal. Getting the three points in the first game is very important. We got caught, we knew that Brunei were going to come with counter-attacks and that was what happened. We fell asleep after we opened the scoring early in the game and made it very difficult for ourselves.<br /><br />Brunei players were behind the ball in their own area. That’s why our back three had so much possession and everyone was going forward and chasing. I am not so concerned, I believe in the second or third game they will get much better.<br /><br />We have Thanabalan <b>[Nadarajah]</b>, Akhyar <b>[Abdul Rashid]</b>, the boys will come back strongly in the second game.

They lost in the first match and a defeat to us will result in an early exit. We have to be careful with their gameplay as well their provocations. We have to control the situation, especially if any incidents occur that may disrupt our plans. We are not under pressure, so we have to stick to our usual gameplan.<br /><br />When a team lose especially in a tournament such as this, they know that another defeat will doom them. They now have nothing to lose, so they will break into counter-attacks often and press higher. This is what we have to be wary of, while at the same time we have to avoid playing to their tempo<br /><br />There were injuries in our previous match so there will be player changes. Akhyar <b>[Rashid]</b> and Thanabalan <b>[Nadarajah’s]</b> injuries have healed fully and they will most likely be fielded</p>

Unfortunately we couldn’t find our rhythm in the first half. But in the second half, we changed totally our movement and we played much better. And I think that is the real strength of our team. I believe we’ll play better after this.<br /><br />It’s good to happen now <b>[the defensive mistakes]</b> where we have time to recover. Especially the two goals we concede against Brunei and Singapore were down to our mistake. We lose concentration and today we make one mistake in passing. And that shouldn’t happen. If we want to go further and we qualify for next stage, we have to stop doing all these kind of mistakes<br /><br />We are not there yet. Almost but not there yet. We need to beat Myanmar to confirm to qualify. We still have two more games. We’ll focus on Myanmar then we’ll think about Laos</p>

We only have to concentrate on ourselves. We need to qualify and we’ll try to get maximum points on Monday. No, I don’t believe in concentrating on a player. You have to be aware but not concentrate on just one. But we know that Aung Thu is a good player and we need to be switched on to stop his penetration runs<br /><br />It’s only two games. Most important, I believe Thailand just need wins. They are not looking at how many goals they score. They have Vietnam after this, so I think that’s their main rivals. Even without their best players, I believe Thailand can beat any team in group B but I think we’ll see their best team against Vietnam</p>

That’s something that motivates us to perform as part of the Malaysian contingent.<br /><br />It’s good that they responded well, but we can’t allow that to happen all the time.

  <p><b>[Ong Kim Swee on the hope of a nation and why this 2017 team has what it takes]</b> You know football is our main sport. During 89’ when we won the gold medal, before they play in the SEA Games, they played a friendly game against Melaka and I played against them. Of course, that can motivate any player to be part of the team in the future. Asian level is of course higher but the uniqueness of SEA Games is when the governments of every country are involved. We can see that all the countries in South-East Asia except for probably Philippines, that football is their number one sport. This makes it more challenging where every country want the gold medal.<br /><br />Whether you win or lose the overall medal standings, if you win the football event - it’s considered like winning the SEA Games. This is something like what we did in Indonesia. I remember they were winning about 100 over gold medal but suddenly they lost the football gold medal to us, even their people say that it means nothing to them<br /><br />So that is what the event means to people. So for us being the host this time around, even the ministers have been calling and checking on the team. I hope this time we’ll take advantage of being the host country to grab back the gold medal<br /><br />I always say that you can’t run away from pressure. I always have pressure not only when there’s a big game, even a friendly game, even the match against Brunei. If you don’t have pressure, it means that you’re taking things lightly and you’re overconfident<br /><br />Because the families and friends are around here, we have to take it as an advantage and not as added pressure. I believe this team has quality. I don’t want to compare with previous editions but the with the results that we achieved in AFC U23, it proved that we can be a gold medal contender<br /><br />With the inclusion of the six players, whether you like it or not, they are all regulars in their team. Of course you can’t compare Safawi and Haziq because in JDT <b>[Johor Darul Ta’zim]</b>, they rotate their players. Like when I talk to my staffs, in Bangkok we go there with a certain expectations but this SEA Games with the inclusion of these six, I can say that we are gold medal contenders where we can match with all the other teams.<br /><br />Indonesia will be a better team than the last time we faced them, Thailand are there and Vietnam being here much more earlier showed how serious they are. I believe the players themselves showed a very good attitude, they know what are expected of them.<br /><br />Only that we cannot get carried away because we are the host. We have to be focus in every single games, especially tactically we must be very aware of what we need to do. If the players can capture that and understand what we want, I believe we can achieve that<br /><br />What I can say with the previous editions, I think 2011 and this squad there are similarities where we don’t have prima donnas or so called star players. Where everybody work together and stick to the plan, on and off the field.<br /><br />2013 we were without 8 of our best players like Junior <b>[Eldstal]</b>, Gary <b>[Steven Robbat]</b> and Wan Zack <b>[Haikal]</b> - but we still manage to get to the semi-final. That team actually I expected them to retain the gold medal but unfortunately we couldn’t get past the semis. In 2015 for me was the worst preparations.<br /><br />This year, even though we only had 10 days before, the boys have been playing regularly together for the past one year. When I come in, I only change a few things and of course there are a few players who were with me during the Young Tigers time - they make my job easier. Most of them know what my character is and they need to do<br /><br />Football even if you put it as a Under-19 at the SEA Games, it will still spark something because it’s football. The beauty is that when you have the Under-22 even though normally it’s Under-23, it is the right roadmap set by AFC. It gives the opportunity for the respective countries not only for this tournament but more than that. We qualify now for AFC U23, so we are looking forward to that with the same batch of players. After that, we have the Asian Games where the same batch of players are going to play. So when we start well, there’s a momentum to look out. I think for it being Under-22 tournament, it prepares the teams in SEA for youth tournaments in Asia</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysia head coach Ong Kim Swee has sounded out a warning to their potential opponents in the knockout stage of the SEA Games’ football competition]</b> I’ve been saying since before the tournament began that we have the potential to beat anyone. We’re very disciplined, and with good tactics we can meet whomever we meet. When you look at the first two games, we struggled because we did not play the way we wanted to. If we stick to our gameplan, I believe our boys can do .<br /><br />So far I haven’t seen any problems regarding attitude in my players. They showed good character in the last two games and today they stuck to the gameplan. Our boys have the potential and know what to do in crucial games<br /><br />I have four midfielders; Danial <b>[Amier Norhisham]</b>, Syamer Kutty <b>[Abba]</b>, Azam <b>[Nor Azam Abdul Azih]</b> and Amirul <b>[Hisyam Awang Kechik]</b>. The good thing is that each of them compliments each other, whoever plays. That’s good for us, where we are not facing problems with two midfielders<br /><br />Thanabalan has a finishing instinct and works very hard. Throughout the match he ran non-stop, and that was his advantage. If he maintains this performance, he will definitely be a threat to any team we play against<br /><br /><b>[the 46-year old trainer was forgiving towards his captain Adib Zainuddin, whose blunder led to Myanmar’s consolation goal]</b> Well, everybody makes mistakes. He did not want to do that but it happened. He and the teammate who passed the ball to him have to learn that in very crucial moments and situations, we have to be very safe in our own third</p>

  <p><b>[Result all that matters for Ong ahead of crunch semis]</b> Sometimes it doesn’t look pretty but we got the result. My concern was just three points and not to collect any yellow cards or injuries today. We even managed to give some time off for Irfan <b>[Zakaria]</b> and Adam <b>[Nor Azlin]</b> today. They showed good commitment and they want to be in the first XI. We’ll see. By Saturday there may be some changes. Amirul performed much better today, Syafiq worked very hard and Jafri got two goals today. We made a stupid mistake in front of the penalty box and they scored with a very good free kick. You can’t blame anybody for that. Before the game, we know we have qualified. I made eight changes to the first XI. Why should we kill ourselves when we have a much more important game on Saturday. Come to semi-final, I need to see who is fresh to play. It might goes to 120 minutes, you’ll never know.<br /><br />You can’t choose who you want at the moment. If you say you want Thailand, if you reach the final, you still have to play either Vietnam or Indonesia. Whoever we have to play against, we have to be ready. We have to be prepared mentally and tactically.<br /><br />We don’t want to finish here. We want to finish on 29th with a much better record. It’s good that we win four out of four but now we have to prepare for Saturday’s game. I’m thinking how to qualify. But to qualify, you need to have a good strategy and I believe that the opponent will be the toughest among the four games that we’ve gone through</p>

We all have to realise that this is only a football match and like my Indonesian counterpart, I hope there are no issues, apart from what happens on the pitch.<br /><br />Every team that comes in the competition know the schedule and I’m sure they all have their own plans and it’s no different from past games where we faced the same issue.<br /><br />The players know what they want, especially when we are up against Indonesia. What is important is for the players to keep their focus and follow the plan. There’s no need for me to do any extra motivation.

It’s good that we have qualified for the final but it’s not over yet. It’s good to celebrate <b>[beating Indonesia]</b> but the players need to focus on the final.<br /><br />The boys worked hard. In the first half we weren’t really pushing forward, but in the second half we came back strongly. We controlled most of the possession in the second half, showed good character, they knew what they wanted, and all these made our job easier. Indonesia played well and we initially were too careful, but in the second half we played higher up the pitch especially the midfield. Only then were we able to gain more possession and attack them more often<br /><br />The boys have risen to the occassion, if you look at the way they played in the first match against Brunei, the line-up has kept on changing but everybody produced results everytime. It’s good that we didn’t concede today as it will give us more confidence, but we must stay grounded. Thailand are a good team and we have to be very, very focussed.<br /><br />I had to prepare for all eventualities and by the 85th minute I still had to spare substitutions. That’s why we kept them until late <b>[in the game]</b>.<br /><br />We’re playing in the final at home so we shouldn’t be afraid of them.

He has to push this away and take it as a very good learning process.<br /><br />We gave a good challenge, a good fight to Thailand. We know that they are a good team but to concede that kind of goal, it came at a wrong time. At the end, the boys gave everything they had and unfortunately we can’t get the equaliser<br /><br />You can see Safawi not performing that well today and doesn’t give enough depth in attack. Once Syafiq get in, you can see a lot of movement forward. Of course, you have to think about Safawi playing a lot of games and is fatigue. Of course, we had to change the strikers. Even Jafri, he gave everything for 75 minutes and he was struggling. Akhyar came in and did a lot of runs and that was what we needed at that time<br /><br />If you ask me whether I’m happy, of course I’m not because we didn’t win the gold medal. But overall, the boys gave everything and that is very important in a very short limited that we have. We proved in the group stage and semi-final that we can compete with any team in South-East Asia. Even though we lose today, I believe we’re on the right track.
