  <p>[Ong Kim Swee and Irfan Bakti’s thoughts on 48-team 2026 World Cup] The expansion of the World Cup to include 48 teams from the current 32 beginning from the 2026 edition is a positive move, as maybe now developing football nations, such as those in Asia, can break down the monopoly of European sides in the tournament. However what’s more important is for these countries to plan ahead from now on. We in South East Asia such as Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, if we intend to take advantage of the expansion and qualify for the 48-team World Cup, we must plan what we want to do from now on.<br /><br />For Malaysia, all parties such as the Malaysian FA [FAM] and the education ministry must prepare from now, as the players who will make up the national team at that time are currently still in school. And even if we do not make it to the 2026 edition, we must have a Plan B, and that is to prepare for the following edition, in 2030.</p>

  <p>[Qualification for his side will only be secured if they are able to collect 10 or 11 points from their six Group B matches] If we were to qualify to the final tournament, we need to collect at least 10 or 11 points from all the six matches. And that means collecting the maximum nine points from all three of our matches at home.<br /><br />In this style of competition, where the matches are held over the course of a year, it is important for teams to do well in their first match. And for us, yes that means having to do well against group favourites, North Korea in our first match<br /><br />[When asked whether there will be significant changes to his lineup for the qualification] Only one round of the Super League [MSL] has been played [last weekend], so it is too early too tell. However I can tell you this; my scouts have been to most of the grounds last weekend<br /><br />[The fact that six of the nine goals scored in the first MSL round were scored by Malaysian strikers] Of course this is good. If local strikers are able to score more goals, they’ll get even more playing time at their clubs, which in turn will help their chances with the national team</p>

  <p>[Malaysia head coach Datuk Ong Kim Swee is open to the idea of selecting Pahang’s naturalised Malaysian player Fransisco Javier Insa Bohigues for his team’s future matches] It [he] will be good for us. We know that the defence is our problem area, so his inclusion will definitely help the team. It [Kiko’s future call-up] depends on the status. I have to check first whether he already possesses a Malaysian passport, and we have to go through a lot of processes. He’s definitely a good player, he would an asset for us, but if the rules state I can call him up and he can play, [only then] I will call him up. But we have to know the situation. I cannot simply say ‘I want him’, only for the AFC to disallow it later.</p>

  <p>[Malaysia will open their qualifying campaign away to the hermit kingdom on March 28] I feel that in terms of the match, it is not too tricky. It is the travelling that is a little complicated, as we are not too familiar with the country. But then again I don’t think we’ll be facing any problems as many other national teams have played away matches there.<br /><br />…there are flights to North Korea from there [the Philippines]…if we manage to secure a friendly match against the Philippines, [after the friendly] we’ll immediately travel to Pyongyang. That means we’ll be in North Korea for one week<br /><br />If the friendly against the Philippines does not materialise, I have plans for the team to take on Chinese Super League clubs in test matches, either in Beijing or Shanghai. And then from there we will take a flight to North Korea. The weather over there in March will still be considerably chilly, so we have to adapt to the situation<br /><br />If they played more international friendlies, then they would definitely be ranked higher. But they’re not the kind of team that play friendlies often</p>

  <p>[The Malaysia U23 head coach Ong Kim Swee is adamant that it all stemmed from the opposition and that his boys had to react to what happened] When you play against the Middle East countries, they are used to beat us. But when we are on top of them, this is what normally happen. But at the end of the day, the boys have to learn. When we are leading 2-0, we don’t want this to happen. In a real game situation, it’s definitely not going to help us. Where probably action will be taken. So we must understand the situation where we can’t afford to have this kind of situation to happen that can kill our hopes to go further. You can see that the incident all start from the opponent [UAE]. We have to defend ourselves and our officials have to defend our players. Somethings that we need to do to protect whoever we can. We didn’t provoke anything. If we do provoke, yes I can accuse my players.</p>
