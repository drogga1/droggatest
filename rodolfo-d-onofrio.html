  <p><b>[River Plate confirm <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> interest in Exequiel Palacios]</b> I wrote to <b>[Madrid president]</b> <a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a> a few days ago to thank him for having us at the Bernabeu<br /><br />We are not currently talking about Palacios but about 20 days ago <b>[Madrid director Emilio]</b> <a href="emilio-butragueno.html">Butragueno</a> spoke to <a href="enzo-francescoli.html">Enzo Francescoli</a> about the player, but with a view to continuing negotiations later<br /><br />The economic differences between <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and River are very large. It’s very difficult to retain a player, but history tells us that the player sees a future opportunity and we can’t cut his career.<br /><br />The club can’t be closed and must open themselves up to negotiation. That a player from River goes to Madrid is also prestigious for River<br /><br /><b>[Asked if Palacios is ready to play for Madrid]</b> He’s at a great level, but I think it would be good to play for one more year in Argentina. However, that is not my decision. We will negotiate, Madrid know that.<br /><br />He is very young but he is very serious, and seems older than he is. A very complete player. If they really love him, the move would be ideal for both the player and Real Madrid</p>

  <p><b>[River deny agreeing <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> move for wonderkid Palacios]</b> He has not been sold, but there is an interest from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> in Palacios. The <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> sporting director spoke to <b>[River Plate sporting director Enzo]</b> <a href="enzo-francescoli.html">Francescoli</a> regarding their interest on the player, and we will speak further along. But he hasn’t been sold</p>

  <p><b>[River president D’Onofrio sees ‘no reasons’ for stadium closure]</b> There are no reasons for the River stadium to be closed tomorrow. I can assure you that River is not responsible. It’s a shame that we had to go through this. River said that we cannot play against a team that is going through an understandable psychological situation. We agreed with Daniel<br /><br /><b>[The 69-year-old was also appologetic to the supporters who made the trip to the match, only to have their plans ruined by the violence outside the stadium]</b> I feel bad, frustrated, tired. I apologise to the fans. My daughter lives in Italy, I have two granddaughters, they arrived today and fly back tomorrow. I have this situation at home, imagine all the ones that came from all over the country. I said to <a href="conmebol.html">CONMEBOL</a> from the start that we could not play today. I’m not going to give up. I don’t want to win this way</p>

  <p><b>[River Plate president Rodolfo d’Onofrio fired over Claudio Tapia’s antics]</b> I wouldn’t even think of going to drink <b>[popular Argentine beverage]</b> mate with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, bringing him framed photos or giving him presents. You should have a cordial relationship, but one where it is clear that he is the player. Not one where the player does not know or realise if he is a player or the president, it gets confusing with such a strong relationship.</p>

  <p><b>[What is more, the all-action midfielder could prove the bargain of the transfer window. His transfer buyout fee is set at a measly €15 million (£13.3m/$16.4m), small change for the likes of Madrid and Inter]</b> Our intention was to try and raise it, but when the player and his agent do not want to accept a higher clause we can’t do anything</p>
