  <p><b>[Erik Lamela heaps praise on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> after <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> defeated <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> Hotspur]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is incredible, he proves this in every game, not just here. It was a very difficult game for us, they have world-class attacking players and they control possession, there is so much quality. In that situation, they make you run a lot and it can be draining when it is on this level</p>

  <p><b>[Erik Lamela thinks his Tottenham teammate Juan Foyth proved his character with Argentina at the Copa America this summer]</b> He’s a young player who always wants to train hard and play. He always shows very good character and I’m so happy for him - what a way to finish the season! It’s important for him. He’s young and developing well. He still has a lot of time. I’m so happy for him and will always try to help him as much as I can. To be there, the pressure is big in Argentina. The team always has to win. Juan has big character and I believe in him. He is a player who is always confident, I can see that in every training session, in every game. I hope it’s the start of his career in the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Erik Lamela interview: <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> midfielder is the last of the magnificent seven]</b> Honestly, I did not think I would stay this many years. But now I feel very good. I am enjoying it, I feel motivated and I feel part of the team here. I love the people at the training ground. I am almost one of the longest players to be here, no? We know that we have to play in the Europa League. It is very important for the club, for the fans and for the players. For everyone here</p>
