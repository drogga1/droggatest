  <p><b>[Tottenham winger Erik Lamela insists he is not thinking about a return to Italy]</b> There’s never been anything with the Bianconeri. Inter? I only think about the club I’m at, and I am very good here at Tottenham. The club is getting better and better, and I love living in London. Pochettino is from Argentina like me and he knows that it is not easy for a young player to settle in quickly in a completely different culture. At the beginning I had many problems with the language, injuries and different football. After the first season many people told me to leave England, but I didn’t want to give up, it was a challenge. Now I’m still here, so I made the right choice<br /><br /><b>[Lamela believes Spurs can use the result as motivation ahead of their upcoming Champions League tie against Juventus]</b> I am optimistic about the game, I think we can do it,” he added. “Details will be fundamental in getting qualification. Juventus are a very strong team, they have played two Champions League finals in the last three campaigns, but we are a strong side too. The draw against Liverpool can give us a boost</p>

  <p><b>[Erik Lamela ready to help Spurs take last step in Pochettino’s revolution]</b> My personal goal is to win a place in the team, as after the injury I was in and out. Obviously there are a lot of skilled players and the competition is high. I want to help the team with whatever it needs, be it defensively, in attack or wherever. That’s what the most important thing is for me. For the team, the ambition is that we’re able to lift a trophy this year. We already know we can finish in the top four, but the truth is that third, second or fourth is the same. This team needs to win a trophy, whether it’s the league or a cup. There are a lot of competitions. Hopefully we have the chance. It’s one of the goals: To play, that the team does well, that we can be champion and that I’m able to get back to the national team<br /><br /><b>[He didn’t figure in Jorge Sampaoli’s plans]</b> I think the injury played against me. When I came back, it was very gradual. I was going back and forth between playing as a starter and as a substitute. First I came in for a few minutes, then a little more. Last year, I think I only played three months with continuity, and maybe that wasn’t enough. The manager decided to take players who came in with a more competitive rhythm than I had in the last year<br /><br /><b>[On Mauricio Pochettino]</b> Obviously I get along with him really well. He’s made it possible for me to stay so many years. I think it’s been four years since I’ve met him, and the team has changed a lot since he took over. I think he’s had a lot to do with that. I think he gets along with the rest of my teammates as well, and he’s really important for the team to be where it is today.<br /><br />Without a doubt we’re in the top four teams in the last four years. The results say it all, that we’re always there. We are missing one more step that hopefully we can take this year. Hopefully the team is able to win something. I think the team deserves it, as we’re always right there. We’re missing that one last touch, but hopefully this year it happens and we’re able to fight from the start of the tournament because after that it’s too late</p>

  <p><b>[Erik Lamela heaps praise on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> after <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> defeated <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> Hotspur]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is incredible, he proves this in every game, not just here. It was a very difficult game for us, they have world-class attacking players and they control possession, there is so much quality. In that situation, they make you run a lot and it can be draining when it is on this level</p>

  <p><b>[Erik Lamela insists his love for River Plate will not lead him to seek an imminent move away from Tottenham]</b> I don’t know, in this moment I am thinking only Tottenham. Tottenham is the club that is giving me everything. Of course I love River but, it is not time to think about coming back.<br /><br />I think River are playing very good at the moment, without me. I am confident that they can win <b>[against Boca]</b>, I hope they can show in another final that they have experience and I believe in the team<br /><br />I feel that it’s something that I owe to myself. I left River after the team had fallen down to Serie B. I have something that hasn’t finished in my history with River. I owe to them who I am and I owe to myself to play there once I finish my European experience</p>

  <p><b>[Erik Lamela says he is ready to put an injury-ravaged season behind him and make history with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> by lifting the Champions League trophy in Madrid]</b> I’m feeling good. I still have a few more days to train after tomorrow to arrive in the best condition. We’ve prepared well. We’ve trained hard and we are ready mentally and physically. It’s been good for the team. It’s been a difficult <b>[season]</b>. When I pick up a new injury, with everything that I’ve lived through in my career now with the injuries, it’s difficult. It’s part of the game no? Sometimes it happens to me, sometimes to other players. I hope now to enjoy this game because it’s like a present I’ve been given after such a difficult period I’ve been through. I’m preparing myself to give my best. The last two months I’ve finished the season with just the last two games and it’s been hard. The last part of the season is the most important, no? But now it’s an opportunity we need to take. We talk among ourselves that it’s a great opportunity to be in the history of this club and that’s what we want. We’re trying to arrive in the best condition, the best feeling and I think I am confident we’re going to play a very good game.<br /><br /><b>[Lamela thinks it is the indomitable belief of the players that has carried the team to Madrid]</b> Of course, we always believed. This team always fights and all the players believe. Now in the final, we believe more than ever</p>

  <p><b>[Erik Lamela thinks his <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> teammate Juan Foyth proved his character with Argentina at the Copa America this summer]</b> He’s a young player who always wants to train hard and play. He always shows very good character and I’m so happy for him - what a way to finish the season! It’s important for him. He’s young and developing well. He still has a lot of time. I’m so happy for him and will always try to help him as much as I can. To be there, the pressure is big in Argentina. The team always has to win. Juan has big character and I believe in him. He is a player who is always confident, I can see that in every training session, in every game. I hope it’s the start of his career in the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Erik Lamela interview: <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> midfielder is the last of the magnificent seven]</b> Honestly, I did not think I would stay this many years. But now I feel very good. I am enjoying it, I feel motivated and I feel part of the team here. I love the people at the training ground. I am almost one of the longest players to be here, no? We know that we have to play in the Europa League. It is very important for the club, for the fans and for the players. For everyone here</p>
