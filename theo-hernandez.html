  <p><b>[Theo Hernandez, a left-back just as <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Paolo Maldini</a> was in his playing days, was delighted to have joined Milan]</b> It is a real honour to be sitting next to <b>[<a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a>]</b>. He will always be the best full-back in the world. We met in Ibiza, where he had some very beautiful and sincere words for me. Since then, I have had the desire to join Milan. I trained hard to succeed and in the end I did it</p>

  <p><b>[The left-back has reflected on his time at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and on some of the difficulties he endured during that period]</b> I was insulted and criticised a lot. I did some silly things, but I’ve matured a lot as a person. I consider myself a fun guy, but a calm guy who spends a lot of time in the house with his dogs or watching tennis on TV<br /><br /><b>[He spoke about his move to <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>, and the fact that <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Paolo Maldini</a> was eager for him to join the Italian club]</b> That’s an honour as he made history in football. He was very convincing. I didn’t need long to decide to accept the offer<br /><br /><b>[He also spoke about his relationship with the team’s new coach <a href="stefano-pioli.html">Stefano Pioli</a>]</b> He doesn’t speak Spanish and I still don’t speak good Italian, but we understand each other</p>

  <p><a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a> has always been a reference point for me. Everyone would like to see themselves in him, as he had a glorious career and represents Milan. When you have a champion like that in front of you, there’s no need to think it over. I want to help bring Milan back to where it belongs, for its history and the love of its fans. I will now work to earn my place in the France squad and be ready for when Euro 2020 comes around next summer, although certain choices simply aren’t up to me. I could play alongside my brother <a href="lucas-hernandez.html">Lucas Hernandez</a>. Not bad, eh?</p>

  <p><b>[Milan full-back Theo Hernandez says playing alongside <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> is a gift]</b> It has been a very important year for me. I adapted very quickly to a new league and the pressures of a big club. The confidence that the coach has in me, the help from my teammates and the affection of our fans are fundamental. Coach <a href="stefano-pioli.html">Pioli</a>’s confidence in me is particularly decisive. I am in a top club and have the opportunity to learn from the best, that’s one of the things I appreciate the most. Being able to train with <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> is a gift, the chance to work with one of the best players in the world<br /><br />I immediately felt at home here, with my teammates, the culture, the city and the philosophy of the club. All these factors together got the best out of me. I’m still very young, so we’ll see what the future holds with regards to my tactical position. I feel important and that fills me with confidence, but I don’t have the experience yet to be a leader</p>
