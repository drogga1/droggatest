  <p><b>[Julian Weigl backs <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> to reach Champions League quarter-finals]</b> We should have and could have taken more from this game. We put in a top performance, we created many chances. We had to win 2-0, 3-1 tonight. A 1-0 defeat is not the best position for the return leg, but we play in our stadium and it is still possible. But it hurts. I was fully convinced that one of our chances would go in, we absolutely would have deserved it. I don’t quite know what to say, it’s really annoying</p>

I wanted to improve my sporting situation. It is no secret that I can work well under <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a>. I communicated my thoughts to the <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> officials<br /><br /><b>[Despite the public flirtation between Tuchel and Weigl, the player remained at the Westfalenstadion, with <a href="lucien-favre.html">Favre</a> convincing him he still had a role to play at the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> club]</b> I had an important talk with the coach during the training camp when it wasn’t quite clear what my future would look like yet. He told me that he had seen that <b>[Axel]</b> <a href="axel-witsel.html">Witsel</a> and I could play well together, that I looked in good shape and would have a great chance of playing. That was very important for me to hear. Therefore, I finally decided to concentrate only on BVB</p>

  <p><b>[Benfica fan honours pledge to run 1km in the nude after Weigl signing]</b> Hello Portugal, my name is Duarte Mendes and as you know, on December 17 I wrote on Twitter ‘If Weigl comes to <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> I run 1km naked’. Today, I’m here to do that. God forgives, but Julian doesn’t<br /><br /><b>[Mendes said after the run]</b> I’m tired but very, very happy because the goal was accomplished. My promise was kept and now it’s time to enjoy the moment. This feeling is incredible. To Weigl: I love you. I hope you have lots of success in <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>.
