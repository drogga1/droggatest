  <p><b>[When asked about interest from Sevilla in Anthony Martial]</b> We are indeed studying this possibility, we are talking about a large club. Sevilla has a good position in La Liga and has a great coach. But for now, I can not say more.</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Martial’s agent admits he can’t confirm that the Frenchman will be staying at Manchester United]</b> I can’t confirm Martial will remain at Old Trafford next season, I am sorry but I can’t add anything else about it. Martial’s objective is to win the FA Cup and to finish in second place with Manchester United. That way the Red Devils would qualify for the Champions League<br /><br />I’ve never met Juventus chiefs and Doyen Sports do not represent the interest of Martial. Everything that was reported by Italian media is fake news</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Martial has given his agent the green light to sound out interest in a potential summer move]</b> Will Martial stay in Manchester in the summer? I’m sorry, but at the moment I cannot say anything else about it</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Martial is looking to leave Manchester United after three seasons at Old Trafford]</b> After considering all possibilities and options, Anthony wants to leave Manchester United. There are many reasons, for now it is too early to discuss it. Anthony will talk soon to go through that. Man United want to extend Anthony’s deal and they do not want him to leave, but we have not come to an agreement for several months. I think that when Man United, who are the most powerful club, cannot come to an agreement after eight months it is because they really don’t want to make him a key player. The decision is related to that. It is a decision that has been thought through thoroughly. However, it is important to remember that he is under contract, Man United have the last word and we will respect the club’s decision.<br /><br />We do not have the same vision of Anthony’s future. Right now Anthony is disappointed because he has shown for three seasons the love he feels for the club and its fans. On top of that, I can tell you that without the fans’ unconditional support Anthony would have already asked for a transfer. I think he has done his best over the last three years. It is important to remember that this season he scored 11 goals and gave 10 assists in five months. He was chosen Player of the Month three times by fans. Where will he play? Right now I don’t think that’s the most important question. Anthony just wants to play, to feel happy and connect with his coach, that is essential</p>
