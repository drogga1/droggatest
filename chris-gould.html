<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Christian Ramirez]</b> Few players have the natural goal-scoring instincts that he has. He has a very good understanding of where to be, and when to be there. He’s incredibly composed, and he has a plan in his head of how to execute in the box. You put players in the position where they can be successful, and that <b>[position change]</b> seemed very, very obvious very quickly.<br /><br />I’m sure he had some questions about it, but once he kind of realized what we were seeing, and how we wanted him to play, and how we were trying to use his best assets, he took off. It’s a credit to him. He’s a student, and his approach was second to none. He took complete ownership of the change<br /><br />What Christian has done is a real reflection of his internal character. To overcome the obstacles he has overcome, and taken on the challenges he has faced, and continue to succeed shows the mental strength that he has</p>
