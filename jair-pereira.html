  <p><b>[Jair Pereira’s sending off in the 50th minute was a different story]</b> I would say it was ‘malinchista’ <b>[using a term for Mexicans biased against their own nation]</b>. I want to express that because during a game there are circumstances where the same things happen with foreign players and that happen with other types of people and it’s not judged in the same way.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico wasn’t surprised that Curacao gave it a challenge Sunday]</b> Maybe in the past teams won games easily but today football has grown so much. You have to play the games, you can’t see anyone as a lesser. They’re teams that really do have great players. The only thing we had in mind was to achieve our top goal, which was to classify for the knockout stage in first place. So, we have to get ready. We have to look at all the good things we did and look at correcting the errors the national team.<br /><br /><b>[On Cesar Montes]</b> Cesar Montes is a great player, so it was simply about getting together and having good communication and that’s going to help us a lot. I think today we solved issues well, we kept the clean sheet and what more can I say? Cesar is a great player who helps out the team a lot with the enormous quality he has</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Keep an eye on Estadio Hidalgo]</b> Today we’re focused on trying to play a very competitive game, trying to get three points that are going to be very important. Today, we’re leaving aside the rivalry of who has the best youth system, them or them, no. Today what’s important is how the team plays and for us to rediscover the level of the team that we had and try to be the better team on the field and leave with a victory.</p>
