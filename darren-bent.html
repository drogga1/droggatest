  <p><b>[Darren Bent says Jack Clarke is an old school winger]</b> A lot of the modern day wingers now are shoot first, supply second and I hate that. As a centre forward, I can’t stand that! Whereas you look at when I was growing up, in my day wide men would create goals first for your centre forward and then if there’s an opportunity to shoot, then you go and get yourself goals. It’s completely changed around now though. For me, I do like him because he does look to create first and then get himself a goal<br /><br />For me, he’s at the perfect club <b>[in Tottenham]</b> that are going to be patient with him first and foremost, he’s signed a long-term deal - it’s the exact same as when I was there, I signed five plus one - give him two years to develop, play at Leeds another season then slowly integrate him into the Spurs squad but as I said, what a move for him. I’d say he’s an old school winger with modern flair. He can go past people, good with either feet, quick, quite tricky on the ball, quite elusive and as I said, likes to supply first so I really like him</p>

My thing with people has always been quality on the ball. Whether it was his final cross or his shot on goal, it was always under-hit or there was never really any quality there.

Defensively, he’s all over the place, positionally, he’s all over the place. People get in behind him, I don’t think he’s particularly great on the ball - yeah, he scored a great goal the other day which was chalked off but when you look at the right-backs that they’ve had. People aimed a lot of <a href="kieran-trippier.html">Trippier</a> but you knew what you were getting from <a href="kieran-trippier.html">Trippier</a>. Technically on the ball, he was very good, positionally he got himself into the right areas. <a href="serge-aurier.html">Aurier</a>, he’s powerful, but he’s often left wanting. He’ll break forward and leave that right side exposed, a lot of the time the right centre-half is one-v-one with the wide man. That’s something they definitely need to work on</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Bent says he was upset after Sunderland acquired <a href="asamoah-gyan.html">Asamoah Gyan</a> in 2010]</b> I remember being at Sunderland, scoring 25 goals, then the following season they bring in <a href="asamoah-gyan.html">Asamoah Gyan</a> and it just kind of unsettled me a little bit because I’m like ‘Well, things are going really well here, I’m doing really well, so why do you feel the need to sign someone else, who arguably in that World Cup was one of the best players?’. He was brilliant for Ghana and it kind of upset me a little bit. So I think in that situation you need to leave it as it is, let that play out, and if you are going to bring in players in other areas, be like squad-type players where if you do get injuries, they can come straight back in</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Bent says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> ‘a step closer to winning a trophy’ under <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> &amp; capable of a top four finish]</b> There was probably a time where no one would’ve ever thought that <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> would in charge of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> because the gulf between the two clubs was massive. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in the 00s were so dominant. It was a strange one <b>[hiring Mourinho]</b> but one that’s brilliant for the club and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I don’t know if that makes <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> ‘relevant’ again but <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> know now that they’ve got someone in the dugout who’s a serial winner, who wins trophies.

It’s possible for anyone to get fourth because no one’s putting any results together. At one stage, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> would have said that top four would have been impossible but all of a sudden they must be thinking that if they can put more results together, then they’re going to be right in there<br /><br />I know <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> will say that playing his ex-team doesn’t really mean anything but I can say as an ex-player that whenever I was playing against an old team, you always wanted to put one over on them. Whether they let you go and you want to show them that they made the wrong decision or you decide to go because it’s the best thing for your career and you want to show that you’ve improved as a player. There’s a lot riding on it. If he’s going to say that this game doesn’t mean anything to him then I think he’s lying</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Bent says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> will take <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> into the January transfer market]</b> He can only work with what he’s got. He’s managed to obviously turn Toby and get him to sign a new contract, so he likes him as a defender and believes that he can improve them at the back. But I think in January he’s going to have to dip into that transfer market and get someone in because at one stage I used to look at <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Toby Alderweireld</a> and <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Jan Vertonghen</a> and think defensively that partnership is one of the strongest in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br />Now, both of them have lost a little bit of legs you’d have to say, obviously age comes to everyone. Vertonghen’s had big injuries so maybe that’s playing a part as well. I think he will definitely dip into that transfer market and try and bring a defender in and maybe even a full-back. Listen, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> at the minute, going forward they’ve got no issues whatsoever.<br /><br />They’ve got <a href="son-heungmin.html">Son Heung-min</a> when he comes back from suspension, <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a>, <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>, Erik Lamela, these guys can make the difference.

It wouldn’t surprise me if someone like <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> came in because a team like <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> always has possession of the ball, it’s not as frantic as <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and he has got the ability. On the ball, he’s powerful, he can go past people, he can dribble - there’s so much he can do but for whatever reason at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, he cannot find his feet. I remember my first season at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, I really struggled to find my feet but mine came from not playing enough games</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Bent says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> will look to offload Juan Foyth in the next transfer window]</b> Do you know what it is? I think it’s a case of wrong place, wrong time. He came to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> at a time where, to be fair, <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Vertonghen</a> and <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Alderweireld</a> were playing really well together, fantastically well defensively, so he was never was going to get in there. At right-back they had <a href="kieran-trippier.html">Kieran Trippier</a>, he was playing, an international playing really well for England and for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> so he kind of had to slot in when people weren’t really playing. He eventually got his chance and he was in and out, we hadn’t seen the best of him. Then obviously they bought in <a href="davinson-sanchez.html">Davinson Sanchez</a> and for whatever reason it hasn’t really clicked for him. The same thing happened to me at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, I signed when there were already three strikers there and you can never really find your feet, you never really get the opportunity. For himself, he’s probably thinking it’s for the best. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> would probably agree with him - go somewhere else, start again and rebuild</p>

This is a team that’s got to be competing for Champions Leagues and trophies.

When you look at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, and I’m not disrespecting <a href="pierre-emile-hojbjerg.html">Hojbjerg</a> one bit, he’s had a very, very good season, look at where <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> have come from in the last eight years or whatever, you talk about Mousa Dembele, <a href="scott-parker.html">Scott Parker</a>, <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a>, <b>[Victor]</b> <a href="victor-wanyama.html">Wanyama</a> - they’ve had so many very good midfielder players.

  <p><b>[Darren Bent says Berbatov only spoke to team-mates at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>!]</b> Well, it wasn’t difficult, because he never spoke to me! We could be in the club canteen, completely empty, and I could be sitting at one table and he would go and sit at another table. There’s no one on the planet he would come and sit next to to have a conversation with. I don’t know if it was shyness or what, and it wasn’t just me. There could be me and another team-mate sitting there talking, there could be five extra seats on our table, and he’d sit at the table further away from us. I was used to it, because I played with him at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> first, and this was when I was at Fulham with him as well. I just told the other lads: ‘Yeah, that’s just Berba’. But when I asked a few of the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> players who played with him: ‘Was he like that when he was with you? They were like: ‘No!’ But it’s because they didn’t allow him to get away with that at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, he was forced to, they kind of made him do it. But with us, because he was obviously the best player, he was like: ‘Nah thanks’<br /><br />At Fulham it was quite tough for him and he ended up leaving, but at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> on the pitch he was absolutely sensational, his touch, everything about him. So he was that way in the dressing room and the canteen and didn’t really speak to anyone, but to be fair to him on the pitch he was a team player. He might not have run as much as some people, but you know he’d always make the right pass, he always had that bit of quality that could win you the game, so he could kind of get away with it. But when he was at Fulham it wasn’t really happening for him, and then you put that with the canteen stuff as well, it becomes a difficult environment. He can be frustrating, but at Fulham not one person shouted at him because he was the best player. It was like he was so superior to everybody people didn’t think it was their right to say anything to him, even if he made the wrong decisions and made mistakes, which did happen sometimes, no one ever said anything to him</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Bent says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> must do all they can to beat Europe’s top teams to the signing of <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> from Bayer Leverkusen this summer]</b> He’s a very good player and he’s linked with a lot of big clubs around the world so if you can steal him, then what a coup that would be for your club. If you can get top players like that, you go and get them. His favoured position is a number 10 so that would be perfect because you’re talking about him, <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> and Heung-min Son - I think that would work really, really well. At times, I know all teams have a transfer structure where they might go: ‘We need defenders, we need midfielders,’ whatever it may be, but sometimes little curveballs get thrown in. When a player of such quality all of a sudden gets thrown into the market, you’ve got to rip that transfer sheet up and go: ‘He’s the best player available, we’ve got to take him</p>

It’s not like you’re taking a risk. <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>’s a top player, he’s a superstar signing that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> need and even if it’s on loan, that’s the sort of superstar that they need to maybe encourage other superstars to come there. For me, I’d go all out and pay that £8 million, pay that and try and get him. £8million for a top player like him for a year? You take that risk because at the end, you never know, at the end of the year it might work out really, really well. He could transform <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> into an absolute powerhouse of a team. I wouldn’t even consider it - I’d just do it.</p>
