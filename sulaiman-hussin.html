  <p><b>[UKM head coach Sulaiman Hussin is grateful towards rivals UiTM for showing the way]</b> <b>[Admittedly]</b> I was not too pleased with the way we played, we made simple mistakes while playing at home and gave space to Shahzan Muda. But I’m not too concerned with playing attractive football in competitive matches. The most important thing is our result; the win and promotion to the Premier League.<br /><br />As you can see, the club and university board is present at the match, and they told me that we have a lot of money. So I hope it will be as smooth-sailing as this season has been, we will be funded and able to compete in the Premier League. I want to relax a bit for one or two days, but after that we have to get down to planning for next season immediately, not after the final. Funding is important, and if UKM want to compete in the second tier, we have to prepare financially better than this season. We need at least RM 5 million <b>[around USD 1.2 million]</b><br /><br />I’ve always been jealous of UiTM, but also grateful. Thank you UiTM and particularly Mr. Mustaza <b>[UiTM secretary and general manager Mustaza Ahmad]</b>, it’s because of them that we’ve been promoted. UiTM have been the only successful side in the university league, and back then I wondered why they weren’t being challenged by other universities. When I took over at UKM, I emulated the formula used by UiTM to get where they are today. I was envious of their achievements, but today we’ve managed to follow them. God willing, we’re going to get a ‘university derby’ between UiTM and UKM<br /><br />Our squad comprises 18 sports and recreation undergraduates, a trainee-teacher <b>[team captain Hafizudin Sulaiman]</b> as well as six or seven professional footballers. I’ve always wanted my players to also have formal education, and praise Allah we are now in the Premier League, while my boys have university degrees</p>

  <p><b>[UKM boss reveals secret behind Varsity Boys’ success this season]</b> What I want my players to do is simple; to develop their bond with each other. When there is no distance between a coach and his players, the players will feel close to their boss and they will love him and play for him. I prefer to keep my boys near me, so that everywhere I turn I see them. I don’t want them to be far from me, I don’t want them to form cliques.<br /><br />We need to win at home, regardless of the scoreline. At the same time we must not concede to Sime Darby. We will be without two key midfielders; Nurzaidi Bunari who just underwent an operation for ACL three days ago, and Asnan Ahmad who broke his toe. I have to think of their replacements, but I’ve told the boys that whoever is picked must give their best<br /><br />Sime Darby are experienced, they’ve played in the Super League and the Premier League before. It’s an honour for us to face such a good side. They have a slight advantage over us as most of their squad members are experienced and fully-professional footballers. We respect them, but although most of my boys are students, we will match them on the pitch. My team are very motivated to play in the final</p>
