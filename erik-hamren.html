  <p><b>[Albin Ekdal has been included in Sweden’s 23-man squad for Euro 2016]</b> I think we have a good mix, with a world-class player taking a big responsibility for the team, as Zlatan is doing, but also the team taking a big responsibility for Zlatan.</p>

  <p><b>[Though Erik Hamren is more than happy to share when it comes to the Sweden captain, who acknowledged the challenge of having a dressing room in awe of the talismanic forward]</b> Everything I wanted him to bring as captain he has brought. You have to remember that half of my squad have grown up idolising Zlatan</p>

  <p><b>[On Zlatan Ibrahimovic]</b> I made a good decision in making him captain because he needs to take a lot of responsibility for the team as captain, and he’s been really good at it.<br /><br />It’s a challenge - a world class player and good players, but not as good as as him - to get a good team. We have found a good chemistry between the world class player and the team and vice versa. He’s always been fantastic, but now he is matching his club level in the past with Sweden</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Save Sweden and prove his worth to Man Utd - Zlatan can’t flop against Belgium]</b> I think we have one player at the same level as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and that’s Zlatan. We have many players who play in good European sides but we don’t have anyone else like Zlatan.<br /><br /><b>[Hamren has unsurprisingly defended his captain’s performances in France]</b> I think he <b>[Ibrahimovic]</b> did what he needed to in the last two matches. It was tough <b>[against Italy]</b>, though, because they defended very well.<br /><br />We had more of the ball than we did against Ireland but we didn’t create much pressure and obviously a centre forward needs support from wingers. Ibrahimovic is one of the greatest forwards that I’ve ever encountered. He’s a winner and, if he’s disappointed, I think everyone can understand that and accept it. He was very disappointed like all of us. But I think he does his best at all times. The fear, though, is that Zlatan’s best is no longer good enough</p>

  <p><b>[Quote on <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a>]</b> It will be impossible to find another <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a>. He is special, he is unique. We will not find another player like him in Sweden, because he is unique</p>
