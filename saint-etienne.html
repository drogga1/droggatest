  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> unable to agree <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a> loan extension at Saint-Etienne]</b> Throughout our discussions with Saint-Etienne, our aim has been to protect the welfare of <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a> as well as the interests of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Football Club, while honouring the terms of the loan. Despite the loan ending on June 30, we were willing to find a way for William to play in the <b>[French]</b> cup final on July 24, despite having no contractual obligation to do so<br /><br />As William is returning from injury, we asked that Saint-Etienne follow a clear training plan with William in close collaboration with us, to ensure he is fully fit for the start of next season. To our surprise, we were unable to reach agreement to this plan which was proposed by our medical experts, and we are simply not prepared to risk the welfare of an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> player<br /><br />While it was not our primary concern, and ultimately not relevant as our training plan was not accepted, we also expected not to be financially disadvantaged by extending the loan. This was also not acceptable to Saint-Etienne. We know this is a disappointment for William but he understands we are working to protect his long-term interests and those of Arsenal<br /><br />ASSE, which simply wanted the extension of the initial loan until July 24, could not find an agreement in the evening with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to allow the defender to properly prepare and play this meeting, the English club imposing absolutely unacceptable sports and financial conditions</p>
