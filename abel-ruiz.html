  <p><b>[Abel Ruiz, also present at the presser, opined that Vinicius Junior not playing for Brazil would be a big miss]</b> We know that Vinicius is not playing and that’s a big miss and as the coach said, we need to improve in every.</p>

  <p><b>[Ruiz was considered on the verge of breaking into the senior side, with his innate goalscoring instinct marking him out as a natural heir to Suarez over the next few years]</b> I look closely at his aggression and at how he scores his goals. He is one of the best in the world, if not the best<br /><br /><b>[Ruiz is nevertheless aware that he will have to bide his time at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>]</b> It is what it is, this year I have learned a lot and we went down and now we want to go back. We will have a good team. I am not thinking about offers or loans. I want to rest now and start the season at my best, grow and feed off the best</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> starlet Abel Ruiz modelling his game on <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> &amp; <a href="david-villa.html">David Villa</a>]</b> The first goal summed up his style. It was an amazing game and amazing goal. I am now focusing on <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>. I love his aggressive attitude and the way in which he goes looking for goals. But I also loved <a href="david-villa.html">David Villa</a>. He is one of the most complete strikers I’ve ever seen. I would like to have some of his movements. So, I am still learning from both of them. But thank you very much for including me on the NxGn list! It makes me feel so proud to see my work and my efforts recognised in that way<br /><br />It’s been a very good season so far. In the championship we are doing good things and I am happy with my development as well<br /><br /><b>[Making the leap from the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> B team to senior squad has arguably never been harder but Ruiz]</b> I’m here because I trust in this club, just like the rest of my team-mates in the B team. We all think we can join the first team and this is our goal. We try to improve ourselves every day in order to achieve that dream. And working with the first team is incredible. It is another world to us. They are the elite, the best and the most experienced players in the world</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> teenager Abel Ruiz has revealed what it’s like to train with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> as he discussed his own future at the Spanish champions]</b> He’s incredible, he’s impressive. When I go to train with them, I can enjoy being able to pass to him and being able to receive his passes. You can’t describe that feeling. For me, he’s the best player in the world and he proves it each day. He’s a unique talent. He’s someone unreachable and it’s going to be very difficult to have someone like him again in the history of football<br /><br /><b>[Ruiz admitted there might come a time when he has to leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in order to experience regular first-team football]</b> It’s not that I didn’t want to stay as I’ve always said that my first option was <b>[to stay at]</b> <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, but it’s true that you want to keep growing and keep improving and, in the end, you’re looking to do the best thing for yourself. In this case, the decision was to stay in the Segunda B <b>[with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> B]</b> and wait for opportunities in the first team. I train day by day and I go step by step, I think the secret is growing little by little. The opportunities will come and you have to be ready, which is what we’re trying to do in the academy. I want to grow as a player and as a person at this club because they’ve given me everything since the first day. As long as they believe in me, I’m going to believe in them. In the end, it’s true that if you don’t get the opportunities that you want, you will have to look elsewhere and find some minutes in these competitions</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> loanee Abel Ruiz says his Braga team-mate Francisco Trincao is ‘more than ready’ to star for the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> club when his July transfer is completed]</b> He has a lot of personality. He’s a very good player and I’m sure he’ll do well at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. He has so much quality. He can go wide on either side, right or left. He has a good shot, he’s very complete<br /><br />I’d say he’s similar to <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, but you can’t compare anyone to Leo. He’s your typical left-footer with good dribbling - he’s skilful. If he plays on the right, he comes inside and hits a fierce shot. On the left, he beats players and sets up a lot of goals.<br /><br />He’s more than ready. He’s perfectly capable of playing there and he’ll do very well. We don’t know how the squad will be made up next season but obviously he’ll have competition. Great teams have great players in all positions and he’ll have to win himself a place, just like anywhere else</p>
