  <p>[The Gunners have not received the clearance they are looking for, but Tahir Taghizadeh claims their fears are unfounded] Absolutely. I would be delighted for him to have a conversation with me. This is a Class A event, if our purpose is to play political games around it it is something different, you are being paid as a footballer not a politician, let’s leave other issues aside. My message to Mkhitaryan would be: you’re a footballer, you want to play football? Go to Baku, you are safe there. If you want to play the issue then that’s a different story. What I can guarantee is that the Azerbaijan government will do everything what needs to be done and provide safety and security for every fan, player and staff member coming to this game</p>

  <p>[Mkhitaryan accused of making ‘political statement’ in missing Europa League final with Arsenal] Our reaction? The right word would be disappointment. Obviously that’s his decision - his, his family’s and the club’s - but we are disappointed in it. We did our utmost to assure his safety would be guaranteed and the safety of anybody travelling to Baku, as well as the fans, team crews and other players<br /><br />Do I think he is making a political statement? I am afraid so. Honestly, there is a concern here that what Mkhitaryan has done is not connected to his ethnicity or anything he’s doing as a pro footballer, but there is an issue. He has visited Nagorno-Karabakh, an occupied portion of Azerbaijan, at least once and that was an unsanctioned visit. Those people are usually black-listed in Azerbaijan, which means they are not able to get a visa or travel to Azerbaijan. But in this case, Mkhitaryan’s case has been settled and there is no issue whatsoever. There is absolutely no problem for Azerbaijan to receive Mkhitaryan and to provide for his physical safety and security. His physical safety is assured by every word I say. It’s ultimately his decision, but if we are looking for reasons to justify a decision that maybe longer in the making, that’s something different.<br /><br />Absolutely I would talk to them, at any moment. If there is any contact I would be delighted to do that. If there is any chance of alleviating his concerns and doubts that are overshadowing his decision making, I would be delighted. I think this will be a great celebration of a great game. I have no dog in this fight because I am neither a fan of Chelsea nor Arsenal, but it will be a great celebration and I think his participation can only make it shine brighter</p>
