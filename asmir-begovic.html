  <p><b>[Bournemouth sign Begovic from Chelsea]</b> Bournemouth is an exciting, ambitious club which has everything in place for a very bright future. Being part of a title-winning team at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> was amazing but I felt now was the right time to move on because I want to be playing regular football. I am coming into an important part of my career and I want to show people what I am capable of. When I spoke to <a href="eddie-howe.html">Eddie Howe</a> I knew Bournemouth was the right club for me and I want to bring my experience to the squad, both on and off the pitch. I’m really excited to be part of the journey here and hope I can help take the club to another level</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea accept £10m Begovic bid from Bournemouth]</b> I find it very difficult, not playing for a long time and that’s something that I would like to do. If the club would allow me to do that, under the right circumstances, then that’s what I’ll do. If not, I will continue to work hard and support everyone and the team. I have a huge respect for the manager and the club so they know my feelings and it is nothing other than wanting to play</p>

  <p><b>[Asmir Begovic would welcome <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> following him from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to Bournemouth]</b> If he fancies Bournemouth it would be great to have him there. He’s a great player and a great guy as well, so from that point of view it would be really, really good. He’s obviously the best defender ever in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He’s a legend at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and he deserves the right to make the right decision for himself and his family. I hope he does whatever is right for him and he’s happy with the decision, and I wish him all the best for the future</p>

  <p><b>[Bournemouth goalkeeper Asmir Begovic revealed that he refuses to take his children to football games because of the vicious insults that are commonplace on match days]</b> At most sporting events, 50,000 people aren’t calling the referee a f<em>cking w</em>nker. It’s such a unique thing <b>[to football]</b>. I watch all other sports and yeah, there’s plenty of heckling. In football, there are thousands of people coming together to call one person a name. I find football atmospheres vile. I don’t take my kids to games. I don’t go to games myself unless I have a friend to watch or support but even then, I don’t sit with fans. I have two kids. The language that people use, the abuse that people give; they went to one match and my daughter was asking questions like, ‘Daddy, why is this guy calling you names?’. They hear it when they get to an age, and I thought, ‘No. I’m not doing this anymore’<br /><br /><b>[Kolosinac and <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> were accosted by armed aggressors in north London in July, but escaped injury]</b> It was shocking. You can’t even go in the street anymore. You drive your car and you’re looking behind your back. I’ve spoken to Sead. They had to contact the police and security. They’ve had to have 24/7 surveillance. You shouldn’t have to do that. I don’t know what the cure is (for abuse in general). It’s like one of those questions: ‘How do we cure cancer?’. I don’t know. Can we just change the culture in games, can we not abuse the referee?</p>

  <p><b>[A goalkeeper makes the top 10 fastest goalscorers in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> as well.

However, it was certainly a fluke and the Bosnia-Herzegovina international expressed sympathy for his opposite number Artur Boruc, who was caught out by the clearance]</b> It is a terrible feeling to be on the end of one of those but that’s football. One bad bounce for a goalkeeper makes you look silly</p>

  <p><b>[Begovic floats idea of ‘football feast’ as <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> keeper waits on outcome of coronavirus break]</b> We have to finish the season, in my opinion. It’s going to be a different way but there’s got to be a positive way to end all of this. First and foremost we have to shut everything down, get this virus under control, get everyone fit and healthy and I think the sooner everything gets shut down, the sooner this will all be over. Then it’s just a way of trying to fit in all of the games. I really don’t like it when people talk about cancelling, I don’t like behind closed doors because, ultimately, we’re competitors. The fans want to see it out on the pitch. There has to be a way of deciding things on the pitch - promotion, relegation, Champions League places, championships and that’s the way we have to do it. We could have a football feast. Six or seven weeks of games every night and rekindling the fun of the game. It’s a difficult time for everyone, especially here in Italy and I think there’s a way football can really empower everything and bring joy back to the people<br /><br />I don’t think it’s a solution. It’s a collective thing. People lose out on the experience - players, staff and, of course, the fans. It’s a religion, it’s a culture, it’s a way of life. It was strange playing behind closed doors. Playing in the <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> when it’s empty, you are used to having the fans, when you’re the home team you get a crowd advantage, people push you and support you. It was so quiet. The buzz wasn’t there, the adrenalin wasn’t there and it definitely hurt as the home team. We were talking to the players on the other team and it wasn’t any fun either<br /><br />I’d rather just delay everything and get the fans in there. The game as we know it, it’s with fans, they’re part of the whole package. There has to be a way of packing everything in, whether that’s a short pre-season next year, but we’ll see what decisions are made in the next few days. The players could cope with it at all. We love to play. We can play every three days. I’ve been in England for many years with the Christmas period and it’s tricky but we’ve got squads now, players are so fit and we’ve had some rest now</p>

The best thing about him is how competitive he is. At his age, he is still pushing every day to be the best. He is a team player in so many ways, his standards make everyone else better. He can change games with his presence. A world-class player who is a joy to watch<br /><br />He can be anything he wants to be. He is one of the top goalkeepers in the world right now and if he keeps going like this it’s only a matter of time before he becomes unanimously the best. He is phenomenal, a huge talent and a good guy too, with a very good work rate. What he has already achieved in the game is quite remarkable really. I can only see good things in the future for him</p>
