  <p><b>[Bosnia-Herzegovina’s players remain confident of booking their place at Euro 2016 despite being held to a 1-1 draw by Republic of Ireland in the play-off first leg in Zenica]</b> We couldn’t quite get the ball down and play the way we wanted. The weather made it difficult, the fog made it tough. It was a tight game and it’s all to play for on Monday.</p>

  <p><b>[Bosnia-Herzegovina goalkeeper Asmir Begovic has identified former Stoke City team-mate Jonathan Walters as a key threat]</b> I’ll speak to some of the defenders and everyone on the team about Jon, and the other guys that I know as we did before the first leg, and try to prepare each other, inform each other as much as possible. He’s a quality player, a seasoned pro. He’s played at Premier League level for a very long time and I think his quality is there for everyone to see. So I’m sure he’ll be excited for the game, but I’m sure we’ll also be ready for his qualities and try to stop him, to limit him as much as possible.<br /><br />Honestly, I think before the first tie, I think it’s two evenly matched teams. I don’t think there was one clear favourite or so much of a better team. As the first game showed there’s really not much in it between the two sides and I expect more of the same. Maybe being at home, Ireland will expect a little bit more and we’ll try to use that to our advantage</p>

  <p><b>[Asmir Begovic admits that he is so desperate to play that he is prepared to miss out on a potential Premier League winners medal]</b> I find it very difficult, not playing for a long time and that’s <b>[move clubs]</b> something that I would like to do. If the club would allow me to do that, under the right circumstances, then that’s what I’ll do. If not, I will continue to work hard and support everyone and the team. If everyone is happy then I hope something gets done, but if not, I have a huge respect for the manager and the club so they know my feelings and it is nothing other than wanting to play. It has been obviously not the longest relationship <b>[with Conte]</b>, but so far, so good. We are quite open about it. He knows I am desperate to play and that’s all it is really. If he can make it happen for me then he will, but it won’t be just like that for anyone and if it can happen, in the next couple of days, then so be it. For me, it is about wanting to play.<br /><br />Of course <b>[I thought I could compete]</b>. Because chances to play for Chelsea don’t come around everyday and top clubs like this in general. When they come around, if you don’t believe in yourself, and don’t think things can happen for yourself then you shouldn’t be in this game. I truly believed there was a chance and something could happen, and ultimately I didn’t get as many games as I would have liked. Thibaut is on absolute fire this year and is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, I knew that, and I wanted to test myself against those guys. I feel like I am one of them <b>[the best]</b> but unfortunately no club is big enough to have two really good goalkeepers. I do <b>[I feel like a great player]</b>, that’s the thing as well. I am 29, 30 in the summer and I feel fantastic. I feel in such great shape that it would be a waste not to play and show people what I can do. That’s the only thing, I do believe that I can play at this level and show everyone what I can do and that remains to be seen<br /><br />That’s a tough part and I hope the team lifts the title and maybe I will be part of that. It is difficult to say, but it is difficult when you don’t play for a certain amount of time and that overrides everything. I am a footballer, I like to play and I came here to challenge myself. I have enjoyed everything so far and if I am still here then I will continue to work hard and that’s all I can do. It is the best squad in the league for sure, it is a disposal of riches but that is what this club can do and have. It is fantastic, working with these guys on a daily basis is pretty awesome and when they come in like this it is like nothing and we don’t miss a beat. I think you need to rotate and not having Champions League may have helped us to focus a little bit on our training and everything else. I think a squad, with the demands of the game and how long the season is, it is crucial for any success</p>

  <p><b>[Asmir Begovic has aired his frustration at a lack of competitive minutes at Chelsea]</b> I think it <b>[not playing]</b> bugs every professional. The thing that keeps me going is lifting silverware and being in a successful side. It bugs me but in terms of moving clubs it’s not an option at the moment. I know my role in the team and the leadership I can bring. I am fully committed to the team until the end of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Asmir Begovic thinks John Terry showed that he can still cut it for Chelsea after an impressive performance against Wolves in the FA Cup]</b> Yes, absolutely <b>[he has still got it]</b>. I mean, he has been a world-class defender and arguably the best ever in the Premier League’s history. He has got talent and ability and when he is called to play; he is reliable and he is there to be used. We have great competition for places, especially in that defensive area, and whenever he is called upon to play we are very comfortable. It is important when you don’t have a much of a chance to show your quality that you bring something to the team when you are called upon. Obviously as a team are doing really well, so it is difficult to change your team on a weekly basis. But, given the opportunity, it is nice to show what we can do. All the boys who were in front of me <b>[were great]</b>. Especially the three centre halves, I thought they were fantastic. JT, Zoums and Nathan, so they helped out a lot. They stayed together and we had to deal with a lot of crosses and high balls into the box. Eventually as the game went on we tried to stop those things coming in and that helped a little. We did really well.<br /><br />You don’t get the sense of that <b>[it is close to the end]</b>. I mean the way he trains every day, he is fit as a fiddle so I don’t think he is coming to an end. In his mind and what he is planning to do is something that he can answer, but I can see him continuing to play. When he is playing like this I don’t see why he should quit, but obviously two trophies would be a great way to go out, so who knows?</p>

  <p><b>[Asmir Begovic focused on Chelsea despite collapse of deadline day transfer to Bournemouth]</b> was no problem <b>[coming back in after Bournemouth’s interest]</b>. I have been around the block a little bit so it is all an experience. I was looking forward to this game, excited to play and looking forward to help this team and contribute to the result. Whatever happens in the future and what happened before is not important, those are distractions that we don’t need. I am here to help the cause and the team and if the club count on me and want me to stay then I’ll stay. That’s what the case is <b>[at the moment]</b> and I am happy with that. I’ll help out until the end of the season and hopefully help us to lift a trophy or two. It is important to get games and we are in it to win trophies, and obviously if I can play in the final and help the team win it then that would be amazing.<br /><br />Yes, absolutely <b>[we wanted to play a strong team]</b>. I think it is important that we treat this competition very seriously. We are in it to win it and I think what Wolves have done in previous rounds has obviously played a part. The first half was very difficult. We expected them to come out of the gates with the crowd behind them - it was a great atmosphere. It was difficult for us to get a hold of the game and control the game but I felt like we did a lot more in the second half. We created more chances to score the big important goals. They are a very, very good club and team so it was important for us to play a strong team and put in a good performance. I think this competition is getting tougher each and every year.<br /><br />I think all the divisions are improving and all the teams are improving so it is difficult to not treat it seriously. All the time I have been here, in the FA Cup and all the competitions, we have treated these competitions very seriously. It is instilled within the club and we have a really good squad and whatever changes are made, whether for fitness or whatever, we are ready to rotate players. I think it is important to give the FA Cup the respect it deserves. It is the best <b>[domestic]</b> cup in the world and I want to win it. Job done. Yes, that is the best way to sum it up really</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho’s methods and demeanour may have been questioned at Manchester United]</b> He’s a very passionate, emotional manager. He’s emotional, he feels everything. When things aren’t going his well or right for the team then he feels that. He wants success more than anyone and wants the whole team to do really well. I think in that aspect you maybe saw that in some of his actions and stuff.<br /><br />Great guy, yeah. Absolutely loved playing for him. My favourite ever manager to play for. His character, loves to joke, loves to be funny, but at the same time he gets his message across. If he needs to say something the other way and have a pop at you or say it how it is, he just says the truth, he just says how it is and says it in front of everyone. I think that’s what most players respect as well</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> goalkeeper Asmir Begovic revealed that he refuses to take his children to football games because of the vicious insults that are commonplace on match days]</b> At most sporting events, 50,000 people aren’t calling the referee a fucking wanker. It’s such a unique thing <b>[to football]</b>. I watch all other sports and yeah, there’s plenty of heckling. In football, there are thousands of people coming together to call one person a name. I find football atmospheres vile. I don’t take my kids to games. I don’t go to games myself unless I have a friend to watch or support but even then, I don’t sit with fans. I have two kids. The language that people use, the abuse that people give; they went to one match and my daughter was asking questions like, ‘Daddy, why is this guy calling you names?’. They hear it when they get to an age, and I thought, ‘No. I’m not doing this anymore’<br /><br /><b>[Kolosinac and <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> were accosted by armed aggressors in north London in July, but escaped injury]</b> It was shocking. You can’t even go in the street anymore. You drive your car and you’re looking behind your back. I’ve spoken to Sead. They had to contact the police and security. They’ve had to have 24/7 surveillance. You shouldn’t have to do that. I don’t know what the cure is (for abuse in general). It’s like one of those questions: ‘How do we cure cancer?’. I don’t know. Can we just change the culture in games, can we not abuse the referee?</p>

  <p><b>[Begovic floats idea of ‘football feast’ as <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> keeper waits on outcome of coronavirus break]</b> We have to finish the season, in my opinion. It’s going to be a different way but there’s got to be a positive way to end all of this. First and foremost we have to shut everything down, get this virus under control, get everyone fit and healthy and I think the sooner everything gets shut down, the sooner this will all be over. Then it’s just a way of trying to fit in all of the games. I really don’t like it when people talk about cancelling, I don’t like behind closed doors because, ultimately, we’re competitors. The fans want to see it out on the pitch. There has to be a way of deciding things on the pitch - promotion, relegation, Champions League places, championships and that’s the way we have to do it. We could have a football feast. Six or seven weeks of games every night and rekindling the fun of the game. It’s a difficult time for everyone, especially here in Italy and I think there’s a way football can really empower everything and bring joy back to the people<br /><br />I don’t think it’s a solution. It’s a collective thing. People lose out on the experience - players, staff and, of course, the fans. It’s a religion, it’s a culture, it’s a way of life. It was strange playing behind closed doors. Playing in the <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> when it’s empty, you are used to having the fans, when you’re the home team you get a crowd advantage, people push you and support you. It was so quiet. The buzz wasn’t there, the adrenalin wasn’t there and it definitely hurt as the home team. We were talking to the players on the other team and it wasn’t any fun either<br /><br />I’d rather just delay everything and get the fans in there. The game as we know it, it’s with fans, they’re part of the whole package. There has to be a way of packing everything in, whether that’s a short pre-season next year, but we’ll see what decisions are made in the next few days. The players could cope with it at all. We love to play. We can play every three days. I’ve been in England for many years with the Christmas period and it’s tricky but we’ve got squads now, players are so fit and we’ve had some rest now</p>
