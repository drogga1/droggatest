  <p><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> Head of recruitment Steve <a href="keira-walsh.html">Walsh</a> on <a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Riyad Mahrez</a>]</b> The first time I saw him was July 27, 2012 when Le Havre played against Arles-Avignon. That was a French second division game. I had actually gone to watch Ryan Mendes, who has joined <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> on loan from <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a>. Riyad was a bit raw but he had a great touch, he could kill the ball dead and go past people. I liked his positiveness. He would take the ball to the fullback rather than lounging towards him. He would go with pace, commit the defender, and either cross the ball or have a go at getting past him.<br /><br />Some of his decision-making wasn’t great and also defensively he wasn’t the best. But you could see he had real talent. We had him monitored from then on in<br /><br />He didn’t really know where <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> was, like a lot of foreign players, but when he came over he was blown away by the facilities<br /><br />Each player at the club gets a individual fitness programme. Part of Riyad’s is to do weights. Don’t get me wrong, he doesn’t go in pumping iron but he is certainly stronger than he was when he came. The fitness people at the club, such as Matty Reeves (head of conditioning), do a great job<br /><br />Riyad can last the full match and has to be aerobically fit to do both sides of the game: attacking and defence. But we never want to stifle that creativity<br /><br />In this league, you need people who can go past opponents because it is the only way of creating space. He has quickness in feet and has got a trick but can also with his body movement send defenders the wrong way. That is some real art</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> Head of Recruitment Steve <a href="keira-walsh.html">Walsh</a>]</b> I keep telling the same joke over and over again about Kante: No matter who we’re playing, we play three in midfield. We play Danny Drinkwater in the middle as a holding player and we play <a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kante</a> either side!</p>

  <p><b>[Everton director of football Steve Walsh considers Manchester United’s Wayne Rooney to be one of the greatest players]</b> Wayne Rooney is one of the greatest players that has ever played the game in England and for us not to be interested would be wrong. He started his career here and if the opportunity arose that he could come back and it sat well with everyone it is something we would consider.<br /><br />He is a class apart, he sees things, and all the things that have been said about Wayne are true. He comes into that category of being one of England’s greatest ever players, so why wouldn’t we be interested? I think the whole thing would be euphoric. I think we could sell a lot of shirts, that’s for sure. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Wayne is contracted to Manchester United and made a decision to continue to play for them. Let’s wait and see what happens in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney is open to a summer return to boyhood club Everton]</b> If the opportunity arose for him to come back, and it sat right with everybody, then it’s something we’d look at. All the things said about him are true and I think he’s one of England’s greatest ever players, so why would he not be of interest to us?</p>

  <p><b>[On Wayne Rooney]</b> He’s a top player. If the opportunity arose to bring him back, and it sat well with everyone, I’d drive over myself and get him. The only person this can be driven by is Wayne and how much he wants to come back to Everton.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a> may be generating talk of interest from the likes of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> legend Steve <a href="keira-walsh.html">Walsh</a> says the midfielder is happy where he is]</b> <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a>’s happy where he is, that’s number one. And I think he’s grateful that <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> gave him a chance in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> because he was playing for <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> and, OK, doing very well, but it’s a big step up. We spent some good money on him and are now developing him into a top-class player. I think he understands the grass isn’t always greener on the other side and I’m sure he’s a loyal kind of guy, he seems it. He’s down to earth and a great lad. He’s got everything to make him one of the top players in the world if he continues with the progress he is making<br /><br />The one thing with <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a>, which I knew from the first day I met him, was that he oozes confidence. He’s a character, he’s got something about him. He’s really high in confidence and that’s what I like about him<br /><br />This kid can play anywhere across the attacking midfield, it depends what system you are playing. Where he’s had most of his joy <b>[at club level]</b> is this free role, cutting in and playing balls down the channels for <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a>. He is an outstanding player and deserves to be selected for the England squad</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> were warned against a £75 million deal for big baby <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> by <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s former director of football Steve <a href="keira-walsh.html">Walsh</a>]</b> He would be the first to admit that he probably needs to reinvent himself now a little bit. Obviously, it didn’t go right at United. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> was asked in an interview with a newspaper how he accounted for his success. He said 80 per cent of it was recruitment. I think Jose may have lost sight of that fact.<br /><br />You have to work out what you want and need. Don’t try to attract players with no plan: ‘He’s available so we will take him’. <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> is a good example. During the title-winning season we only lost three times but two of those were against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. They pasted us at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, 5-2. We played well and Jamie <b>[<a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a>]</b> scored a remarkable goal, but Sanchez was outstanding that day. He was instrumental in both games. But it is not about collecting players, it is about having a clear plan and a strategy of how you want to play.<br /><br />When Jose signed <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> from <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, I remember saying to him, ‘You have to be careful with <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>. He is a big baby, you know.’ He said he could handle him. I don’t think he really got <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> on-side mentally, which you have to do. That is the case with him and <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>. They aren’t my type of players. They are more about themselves than the team. I wouldn’t have touched them. Because they are good players doesn’t mean you are going to get a good team out of it<br /><br />United have made a lot of signings. Look at £50 million for <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a>. Now, perhaps it is too early and he will improve, but my eyes tell me when he gets the ball he is not the best. He is a good athlete and very quick, strong, and a good defender, but United don’t need a good defender, they need someone who can play, get on the ball. If I had been at United, I would have said, ‘Put your £50 million away, go and get <a href="kieran-trippier.html">Kieran Trippier</a> for half that. He is an England international. He isn’t a great defender or a physical specimen, but he can play right-back and get the ball in early and you have strikers who can score goals.’ It is common sense</p>
