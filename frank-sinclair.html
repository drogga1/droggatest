  <p><b>[Frank Sinclair says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> should target England international left-back <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a> ahead of Bournemouth’s Nathan Ake]</b> For me the obvious player is <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a>, although <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> won’t want to lose him. Obviously Frank chopped and changed at left-back. In recent games <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Cesar Azpilicueta</a> has played out there, which he did in a title winning side for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. But his strengths are at right-back and the left-back issues clearly need resolving. <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Chilwell</a> is a full international and in the top two or three English full backs in the country. He’s in great form, but whether <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> will sell him is very debatable. Roman Abramovich would need to splash out at least £70m or £80m to bring him in. And, given his own uncertainty with the football club, I don’t think he’s ready to do that<br /><br /><b>[Sinclair believes that <a href="nathan-ake.html">Nathan Ake</a> would be a luxury signing to a team already well stocked in the heart of the defence]</b> When you look at the centre back situation, I think we’re quite healthy there and he’s not an out-and-out left back. He can play centre-back - and even in a holding role - but those are positions where there’s good competition. I’m sure if <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> thinks Ake is the best partner for <a href="antonio-rudiger.html">Antonio Rudiger</a>, as a left-sided centre-back, then he’ll spend the money. But to just shoehorn him into the squad as a possibility at left-back, I don’t really see it</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Sinclair says <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> star <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a> considered to be the perfect fit for <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>’s side]</b> I think they need quite a bit. The position that stands out to me at the moment is the left-back scenario. Obviously with <b>[Cesar]</b> <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpilicueta</a> playing there at the moment, being shifted from right-back. <b>[Marcos]</b> Alonso has been in and out, as well as <a href="emerson.html">Emerson</a>. I think that is the first thing that needs sorting out. Whether <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have a left-back in mind … There have been whispers about the left-back at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>, who is an England international. He’s a very good player and I think he would fit into the way that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> play at the moment - the way he does bomb on and gives you that width and attacking threat. I think it’s definitely a case of left-back and probably a striker to either compete with <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> or even be the main man</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Sinclair says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> remain a couple of transfer windows away from being capable of challenging for the title]</b> <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are quite a way from winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. The better question though is, how far is everybody off <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at the moment? There’s certainly a lot for teams to make up on, and I think there are no signs that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are not going to get stronger and stronger throughout the next decade maybe.<br /><br /><a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have a lot of work to do. You can’t just keep bringing young players through, expect them to handle <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and have a realistic chance of winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with youngsters. I’m comfortable that in the next two or three years they’ll maintain finishing in and around the top four and getting in the Champions League. But to kick on again, I think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will probably have to use a couple of transfer windows to bring in the right type of players that will work in tandem with developing the youngsters that are top-class players at the club already<br /><br />If I was Reece, I might be clever and try and to start playing centre half or something because <b>[Trent]</b> <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a> is going to be a hard man to lodge out of that position the way that he’s playing at the moment. But it’s internationals and you need world-class players in every position if you want to really seriously challenge at that level. So to have someone like <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a>, who will fight for that second slot as the natural right-back, that’s a good thing for England.<br /><br />The one thing about Reece that will get him into England squads regularly is his adaptability, he can play centre-half, he can play right-back, he can play central midfield. He came back off a great loan period at Wigan, where for the second half of that loan spell, he played in midfield and was unbelievable in there as well. When I spoke to <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> after a FA Youth Cup victory for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> a couple of seasons ago, he touched on how good <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a> was. He was saying <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a> gets a lot of the plaudits, but <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a> is just unbelievable. So now he’s coming to fruition and I can see him kicking on and being in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s team for the next 10 years or so and being a real mainstay</p>

  <p><b>[Former Blues defender Frank Sinclair says <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> wouldn’t immediately get into <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s team if he joined from Borussia Dortmund]</b> <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> is a fantastic player and a great talent but he plays in similar positions to the likes of <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a> and <a href="willian.html">Willian</a>, so there will be tough competition for places if he does join in the summer. Whether he is a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> target, I don’t know, as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have more than enough players in those positions that can play in those wide areas or in the No.10 role - they have plenty of options. Is <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> any better than <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Hudson-Odoi</a> on that left-hand side? When you look at the potential of both players, would you spend close to £150 million ($186m), which I’d expect he would cost, to bring <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> to this country or would you just stick to <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a>? Personally, I don’t think <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> automatically gets into <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s team<br /><br /><a href="luka-jovic.html">Jovic</a> is a very good player but when you look at centre-forwards, he’s pretty similar to Abraham in the way that he leads the line. I’d be quite reserved when it comes to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> signing <a href="luka-jovic.html">Luka Jovic</a>. Just because you’re leaving a club of the size of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, it doesn’t automatically mean that you’re going to come to a club like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, settle in and score goals in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> because it is a different ask for players that have come from abroad. Werner is an excellent player, who has obviously played well in Europe this season. There are talks about him going to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as well, which just shows how much he is sought after at the moment. If you look at his all-round game, you’d probably say that he has more to his game than Abraham at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> defender Frank Sinclair says fans shouldn’t ask too much of Tammy Abraham]</b> We’ve seen just how hard it is to develop from the academy and become the main striker at a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club, let alone a club like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It is very difficult to do.<br /><br />He’s going to have a great career at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and if he can score anywhere near the amount of goals that both <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>, <a href="jimmy-floyd-hasselbaink.html">Hasselbaink</a> or <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> scored at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, then he’ll be right up there. He’s shown that he is capable of scoring goals in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the next stage is doing that season in, season out</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Sinclair urge <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> teenager Jude Bellingham not to switch to Chelsea]</b> He has to think about playing games, getting better and improving as a player - which I think will be very difficult for him to do at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. You look at the youngsters coming through the ranks at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and you’d say that there are better players coming through the academy than Bellingham anyway. So, if he is going to move on from <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> and kick on at a higher level, it is really important that he goes to a club where he can play week in, week out as that’s the only way he’ll improve and fulfil the potential that he’s got. I think Bellingham needs to be very wary of his next move</p>
