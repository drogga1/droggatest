<blockquote>
  <p>Chilean President Sebastian Piñera announced a major reshuffle of his cabinet the day after a massive demonstration in the streets of the capital in the latest anti-government protests over economic inequality.<br /><br />Just a day earlier, Chileans had filled downtown Santiago in their calls for change. The city’s mayor, Karla Rubilar, estimated that about a million people took part in Friday’s demonstration. She wrote that the protesters ‘represent the dream of a new Chile’	<br /><br />Chile had long been seen as a tranquil nation in an increasingly turbulent region. But in the past week, Piñera has deployed army troops, and The Guardian reports that hundreds of people were shot during the unrest. The government says at least 20 people have died in the protests, the Associated Press reports	<br /><br />Protests began over a 4-cent price hike in subway fares, but soon spun out to encompass the significant income inequality in the country	<br /><br />Piñera subsequently announced he was raising minimum wage and pensions, capping health care costs, and raising taxes on the wealthy, among a raft of other changes under the name Nueva Agenda Social	<br /><br />Curfews were lifted in many places on Saturday and Sunday. The country has been in a state of emergency for nine days, which Piñera indicated he may soon lift.</p>
