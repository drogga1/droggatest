No-one deserves to be in a team because they’re maybe more recognisable as a face and good for marketing. That’s all good and well but you have to earn your place.

You could see that as a message. But I knew that could happen when I signed my contract. There’s always competition at <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> and at other top clubs. Competition is never a problem. The club and the coach make their decisions. Your job as a player is to deal with them<br /><br />Things were serious when <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> came in <b>[in 2015]</b>, for all sides involved. I could imagine going to <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> then. But the club said: ‘We want you to stay’. I wasn’t out of contract, that’s why it was pretty clear-cut in the end. But it wasn’t just a poker game</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Muller happy <a href="serge-gnabry.html">Serge Gnabry</a> struggled at Arsenal]</b> I’m happy he is scoring so much in London now and not five years ago, because if that were the case he probably wouldn’t be with us now!<br /><br />I certainly do <b>[enjoy coming back to London]</b>. I have a lot of friends here. A lot of them were in the stands tonight and I think they were giving me good power. Three goals should give us a lot of confidence. We need to be prepared for the second leg and we can’t take it serious enough. It’s still open but I think we have a good advantage.<br /><br />I think we knew we had to be patient. We had the game under control in the first half I think we had a couple of chances with Lewa and Thomas and didn’t take them.

But goalkeeper <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a> we owe thanks for it not being 1-1 in the 85th minute. Of course, we are complaining after playing a very high level.

  <p><b>[Newly-extended Muller considered leaving Bayern under Kovac]</b> In autumn, I was left out of the starting 11 for six games in a row. It was difficult. Of course, it made me think. Emotionally, it was very tense back then. I wasn’t necessarily thinking that I would be extending my contract in the spring. With the change of coach and different playing style, everything has developed positively. Not only have I been playing more, but I’ve also been able to put my stamp on our games again<br /><br />We try to stick to what is specified from above. I don’t know what is specified and restricted in other areas.<br /><br />We have to fit into the overall structure. I don’t know if football has a special position</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich attacker Thomas Muller has selected former <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> veteran Maik Franz as his toughest ever opponent]</b> When I was very young I had a lot of respect for Maik Franz. In one of my first seasons he came in for a one-on-one tackle near the halfway line at the Allianz Arena – I thought he was going to crack me. That’s why I jumped up and fell down even though he pulled away. In fact, it was a dive, but an unintentional one. Actually, it was a lifesaver<br /><br />It was a very intense game. We were under a lot of pressure with the story from last year. The danger of becoming the big losers was huge at the time. We would have lost three Champions League finals within four years. So the best moment was when the referee blew the whistle. We were dead.</p>

Martin Hinteregger is a very good player in set-piece situations, but if the ball comes in and no one feels responsible for it, of course we have to talk about it. We have made it our goal to have three victories this week. This is a very crucial week for us.

I got the ball in the box and tried to score. In the moment right now, in my very good shape at the moment, I assist many goals.

They are very, very good, they are special, they are not like normal very good players in the world of football. They are outstanding because they play always at the limit. Always, their whole 10 years, they score 50 goals each year. That’s crazy. On my way to the World Cup, we won with Germany against both. On my way to several Champions League finals, we won against both. Every football player needs also the team, and that’s why we love football so much.</p>

  <p><b>[Muller admits Bayern stay was in doubt as he seeks to explain longevity in Munich]</b> You need the quality, the attitude, the strength and you just have to deliver on the pitch. Without all that it’s not possible to play for <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> for as long as I do. You simply have to perform. The club signs a player because they hope to achieve their goals with him. Ten months ago, the situation was quite different. Who knows if we would have extended my contract to 2023 then. In the footballing business, but also in everyday life, there are often only subtle differences between different decisions<br /><br /><b>[Asked to pick out his best position]</b> I prefer to play right behind our top striker, <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a>. From there I can also get into the open spaces on the edges. I don’t act as a static ball distributor, I’m always on the prowl. But I’m also more than just a ‘Raumdeuter’.

We have waived our salary for completely different reasons, namely for our employees. My statement related to the fact that I was annoyed that I was asked about transfers next season after a cup semi-final. It is pretended that these top transfers - which we absolutely need - can be managed with a snap of your fingers. As if 100 or 50 million euros are not (big) sums in these times we are in right now. Personally, I want the best possible squad for me next season. I have big goals, I want to win the Champions League . I want us to attack properly, to continue this run that we currently have.
