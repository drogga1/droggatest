  <p><b>[Thomas Muller says his poor form for Bayern Munich this season is down to the team’s unconvincing attacking performances]</b> My <b>[goal-scoring]</b> stats are not the same as in recent years. When the team’s not playing well offensively, it’s always a problem for me because I’m not an individualistic player. I don’t take the ball in the middle of the pitch and dribble past six guys. When our positioning and ball game and passing is not that good, then my game is struggling as well. I can score from set pieces and so on, but I have to be involved in the combinations, make my runs without the ball, go deep. When we find our game, play more balls on the ground, through the middle, and combine better, it’s more comfortable for me as well. If I only looked at my running, I should have scored 35 goals by now because I’m running more than last year.<br /><br />I don’t think that’s the problem. Everybody needs to look at the mirror and think why it doesn’t work that well. I think it’s more of a problem of the team than of individuals. We as players have to find the solution to be a team, to be more compact on the pitch. The distances between us are too big. We have problems with the second ball. Against Freiburg and Bremen, we had so much defending to do that we didn’t create many chances. We are not satisfied if we win in a game that doesn’t feel like it was our game. We won the last three away games narrowly. They were tough games. You can search for reasons. Maybe it was the pitches. Right now, the weather isn’t that good. But that’s only a small part. We don’t play the style we want to play. The ball isn’t <b>[moving around]</b> the way we want to. We have a good mentality and very good players. But we want more - more control</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Muller has been stunned by the rapid growth of the Chinese Super League]</b> The sums with which players are lured away from Europe are astronomical. I understand this, one wants to upgrade the league, of course. And since it is a long journey from Europe to China, one must, of course, find arguments for which the players are willing to make the effort. In general this league is already quite good. There are now top players in some teams. But one hundred percent I cannot estimate the situation.<br /><br /><b>[Muller also believes that the Chinese national team will soon benefit from the influx of talent]</b> In principle, China should have a huge potential. Just because of the number of people who live there… And as I have noticed, much has been done for the football in recent years, even from the political side. Therefore, in the next ten years it should be expected that there will be top Chinese players</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Muller talks goal pressure]</b> It doesn’t matter to me if I’m the goalscorer or the playmaker. I want to help the team but I think the expectations are very high. So I need to score goals so that people are satisfied. Normally Bayern want to win everything we play. So it’s not about titles in the future but it’s all about being the best in every game and every training session and every competition. We want to win everything.<br /><br /><b>[Colombian playmaker James has arrived on an initial two-year loan from Real Madrid while France international Tolisso has joined from Lyon]</b> It’s always something in between. I think both players are very good. They are both good characters. We’ve spent the last week together so we can look out for each other and have fun. On the pitch, they are both very important and have good qualities. They show it in every training session. So it’s more play together than a competition with each other<br /><br />It is a difficult position for us players because first, to play football is our profession. So we earn our money with that but also you have to think about the best competitions are in Europe. You have to decide. But I think the top, top players who have the mindset to win competition every year, every year on a high level, they stay in Europe and maybe when they are over the peak but also on a good level, they can go around the world and see things that can also be interesting. But it’s also a very crazy time. As a player you have to handle this situation</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Muller felt like he was in a horror film on Monday when Virgil van Dijk equalised for Netherlands against Germany]</b> It’s a strange feeling, as it was a positive performance - which we have been waiting a while for. We used the momentum from the last two games and there were many positives to take from the game. We defended well for 82 minutes and put together some good attacks. One thing I would say is that we should have made it 3-0 and sealed the win. Suddenly it was 2-2 and the referee has blown for full time - it was like a horror film. The team didn’t deserve to not win the game, but this result is typical of our year in general. Ultimately we want to take the positives into our next few games. I’m certain that we are going in the right direction. None of us can see into the future, but it is clear that the side is having more playing together and feels more united. We enjoy each other’s successes and want to work together to improve certain things. We know that we are making progress still. But I am sad that we are here talking about draw and not a convincing 3-0 win.<br /><br />If you take the whole year into account, it was statistically our worst year. However, we have recently gained some new momentum, which we can look to build upon next year. We may not be back among the world’s best teams, but we have shown that we can play some good football - even with a different side<br /><br />I don’t think now is the right time to have one. It’s hard to get over the fact that we only drew the game. Obviously my teammates and the coach congratulated me, but I turn up for international duty to win games and experience wins. It’s naturally a big personal achievement, but I didn’t wake up to get my 100th, I woke up to beat the Netherlands</p>

Maybe now I need more a <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> to score the goals, but we at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> have Robert ‘Lewan-goal-ski’! I think maybe right now he is the better option than <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. I played against both <b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b>, I won against both, I lost against both. They are very, very good, they are special, they are not like normal very good players in the world of football. They are outstanding because they play always at the limit. Always, their whole 10 years, they score 50 goals each year. That’s crazy. On my way to the World Cup, we won with Germany against both. On my way to several Champions League finals, we won against both. Every football player needs also the team, and that’s why we love football so much.</p>

  <p><b>[Muller admits <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> stay was in doubt as he seeks to explain longevity in Munich]</b> You need the quality, the attitude, the strength and you just have to deliver on the pitch. Without all that it’s not possible to play for <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> for as long as I do. You simply have to perform. The club signs a player because they hope to achieve their goals with him. Ten months ago, the situation was quite different. Who knows if we would have extended my contract to 2023 then. In the footballing business, but also in everyday life, there are often only subtle differences between different decisions<br /><br /><b>[Asked to pick out his best position]</b> I prefer to play right behind our top striker, <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a>. From there I can also get into the open spaces on the edges. I don’t act as a static ball distributor, I’m always on the prowl. But I’m also more than just a ‘Raumdeuter’. My skills on the ball are also very good. But of course, my great strength is making runs with the right timing</p>

He is a very good player, if not the best player of his age group in Europe at the moment. His skills are exceptional. Of course, we always want the best players at Bayern</p>

  <p><b>[Muller backtracks over Bayern-Havertz transfer rumour comments]</b> At <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> there is no internal dispute over the waiver of salaries with regard to possible transfers in summer. We have waived our salary for completely different reasons, namely for our employees. My statement related to the fact that I was annoyed that I was asked about transfers next season after a cup semi-final. It is pretended that these top transfers - which we absolutely need - can be managed with a snap of your fingers. As if 100 or 50 million euros are not (big) sums in these times we are in right now. Personally, I want the best possible squad for me next season. I have big goals, I want to win the Champions League . I want us to attack properly, to continue this run that we currently have. I (will) no longer speak publicly about transfers. Let us be relaxed about the future</p>
