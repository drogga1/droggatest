  <p><b>[Ricky van Wolfswinkel will be out of action ‘for a long time’ as he undergoes treatment on a brain aneurysm discovered after a severe concussion in Champions League qualifying]</b> Because of the brain aneurysm, I will need treatment. Having treatment will mean that I won’t be able to play football for a long time. At this moment, we are not able to determine a date of returning. It’s just clear that it won’t be for at least another six months. The return date will of course depend on the results and the reaction of the brain aneurysm after the operation. The months after will decide when I could be back<br /><br /><b>[While now set for an extended stint on the sidelines, the 30-year-old is simply happy his condition was disovered before it was too late]</b> I’m just very grateful for the fact that the brain aneurysm got discovered now. Normally, a brain aneurysm is not discovered on time, always too late when it has already ruptured or started damage. I want to say thank you to the FCB medical department and to the doctors of the university hospital in Basel. During the upcoming months, I will keep supporting FCB and my team-mates - like I always have. For now, I will focus on my health and my recovery to do what I love most as soon as possible - and that’s to play football</p>
