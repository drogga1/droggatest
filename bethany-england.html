  <p><b>[Beth England’s journey to England international has been a long one]</b> I think the first year and a half at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> I struggled to find my feet a bit. I moved away from home, everything was different, I went from part-time to full time, so that was quite a big adaptation. There were some great players in that squad then, especially the forwards, so it was quite difficult I think I ended up playing wingback for the Spring Series - which I hated, which was a lot of running!<br /><br />As much as I didn’t agree with it at the time, it was the right decision for me to go on loan and going to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is probably the best thing to happen to me. I felt like I had a really good season for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and then managed to kick on even better last season at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It was a tough journey because, in my head, any player that gets loaned out, you think that your manager doesn’t want you. But it was changing that mindset and showing you that I can be the player that you need me to be and thankfully I did that so I was really proud of way I handled it and managed to get back into the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> squad - and now I’ve got the nine shirt. So <b>[it’s been]</b> quite a big journey, but I’ve loved every minute of it, with the tears and all<br /><br /><b>[Her form ensured a place on <a href="phil-neville.html">Phil Neville</a>’s radar]</b> I’ve started <b>[the season]</b> quite well. My mum is always the go to. She’s my best friend and she’s my number one fan. She’s proud. Obviously, she’s been on this journey with me ever since I was a kid, coming to every football game. She tries her best to get up and down the country even though she’s crap on motorways - it takes her hours to get to London for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> games!<br /><br />I couldn’t have appreciated it more because it was nice to know that the fans had my back and, again, they’ve been on the journey with me. Everyone’s saying I need a new chant now I’m finally here! But as long as they keep supporting me, I am happy with that</p>

  <p><b>[Beth England is ready to take her chance if it comes her way, too]</b> Obviously, everyone wants to play. I have to appreciate that it is still an early part of my journey. It’s going to be tough to go in ahead of the likes of Jodie for example, being such a great striker for us. If I get started, I get started, I’ll still put 100% in just as I would if I come off the bench. If I bag a goal, happy days, but I have faith in the teams he puts out</p>

  <p><b>[Bethany England sure <a href="sam-kerr.html">Sam Kerr</a> will be a big hit at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> as she tips the goals to flow]</b> She has been really easy to gel with, on and off the pitch. As you saw in the Reading game, I thought we linked up really well. It gelled well in training early on.<br /><br />She got in some good positions and we were able to put each other in good areas so I am excited to keep seeing where we go this season. I think once she gets that first goal (which Kerr has now scored against Arsenal) and settles her nerves a bit then the floodgates will open then.<br /><br />She is known for being a prolific goalscorer and I can’t wait to see how the rest of the season goes for her. I hope she scores a lot of goals for us. Her arrival doesn’t let you get complacent. It is all well and good performing on the pitch but you have to perform well in training to get better and to be in a position to be selected for the coming game. There is a lot of competition in my area. It is something that I am enjoying and I am thriving on. It just makes us all better players together because we are all fighting for our position in the team so it stops complacency. We keep pushing forward<br /><br />First comes <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I want to have a good season for them and myself individually. I think if I am able to perform for my club, then it will put me in good stead for the Olympics. That’s something that I am really keeping an eye on.<br /><br />I would love to be on that plane to Tokyo more than anything so as long as I am fit, in form and scoring goals then I am giving Phil <b>[Neville]</b> a headache on who he is picking. It is really good being at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because they keep us in good condition and make sure we are always ready.<br /><br />I have spoken with Emma about being ready for the games coming up and what I can do to put myself in the best position to be on that plane. There’s certain attributes that I have that the other forwards don’t have as much. It is not only strengthening those but also working on other areas where I am not as good as the others. So there’s a lot of things that we discuss and work on to improve and then you try to implement them at the weekend so they become second nature.<br /><br />The competition is high. You look at the calibre of players in the list and it will be a tough decision for Phil on whoever he picks. I am sure whoever he takes will rightly be there for a reason and do the job. They don’t take anyone but the best. It is healthy competition and it just keeps driving everyone forward to improve. It will be exciting to see what happens by the business end of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea’s Continental Cup winner England eyeing SheBelieves Cup glory]</b> I’m really excited, <b>[my]</b> first proper tournament out there for the national team. I’d be buzzing if we could bring the trophy back because I think the performances at the back end of last season weren’t a credit to how well I know this England team can play. Fingers crossed we go out there as a team and absolutely smash it and bring the trophy back home again<br /><br />I’m over the moon and finally bringing home that trophy that we haven’t won yet is a big statement for the club. It’s funny because after <b>[Arsenal equalised]</b>, Erin <b>[Cuthbert]</b> literally pulled me and said, ‘Just bring it, I know you have got something else in you’. She keeps saying it in the shower then, she knew something was coming. I think the girls, even at such a late equaliser, we had that belief and we couldn’t have lasted probably another 30 minutes with all the pressure <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were putting on us. We knew it was now or never and, again, Maren <b>[Mjelde]</b> being the hero rocking up and putting the ball across the front of goal for me and thankfully I was there to prod it home<br /><br />A lot of people that know me know my confidence was always <b>[something]</b> I did battle with. I have had a lot of people help to try and boost that and thankfully I am in a position now where I am much more grown up, I would say mentally as well as physically. I’m used to the game and how it is changing and just the faith Emma is putting in me to lead that frontline is a testament to that in itself. I am thankful to be at this club and play for this team. I’ve said numerous times everyone’s journey is different. I can’t say mine has neither been easy … or it has just been a long old roll. Just putting myself out there, trying to prove myself I have always been a grafter. My parents brought me up to never give up and be a worker and thankfully I am getting results for that</p>

  <p><b>[Eni Aluko has incited a Twitter spat with former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team-mate Bethany England with comments made about the UK’s coronavirus furlough scheme]</b> May I remind people to look in the mirror and appreciate the fortunate position they are in before blaming and shaming those who work their back sides off daily and are now left in a position where they just want to keep themselves and family safe.

  <p><b>[Beth England picks up Player of the Season award]</b> It is greatly appreciated and means a lot to me. I would like to dedicate the award to my team-mates, without them I wouldn’t have been able to have the season I have had. So a big thank you to them, this is for all the team, all the staff and all the fans who went through everything with us this year</p>
