  <p><b>[Pep Guardiola: Another Way of Winning. The Biography]</b> <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> introduced some passing drills into <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a>’s ‘arterial’ system. And since then, the rondos have been not just a method but a symbol of the club’s playing style: of dominating and never losing the ball. <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> blended several ideas and concepts and converted them into a philosophy - the seeds of which were planted throughout a club in urgent need of a footballing identity. Until then, the first team of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> had been comfortably living in a world of excuses and enemies, content with their role as victims when faced with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, an institution seen from Catalonia as the club of the Establishmen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Pep Guardiola feels incomplete because he did not go to university and it was Johan Cruyff who helped spark his curiosity]</b> Pep always felt that Johan Cryuff was the guy who taught him the most. It wasn’t so much about techniques. He made him think differently as a player. So from the moment he had him as a coach, they would meet very often. I’ve always thought Pep Guardiola feels a little incomplete because he hasn’t been to university to get a degree. Because of that, he feels the absolute need and obsession to learn from everybody and to ask questions. So if he meets you now, he’d ask: ‘What do you think? What do you think of our team? What do you think of Leroy Sane?’ You’re not going to add anything to him. Johan Cruyff was the guy who he always went back to when he didn’t know where to go. And he still does this exercise in his mind in the middle of the game when he asks himself: ‘What would Johan Cruyff do?’ All he’s actually saying to himself there is: ‘How can I think differently about what’s happening here?’</p>
