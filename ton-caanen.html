<blockquote>
  <p>[Former Real Madrid and Arsenal striker Nicolas Anelka has joined Roda JC as a consultant] When I was I met Nicolas in Dubai and had conversations with him about football, I immediately had the idea that I was not just dealing with a former football player, but also someone who has a very interesting idea about football in general. We are proud that we can add someone of his caliber to our organisation. We will now discuss with Aleksei Korotaev how we are going to give precise details on his role.</p>

  <p>[Nicolas Anelka’s appointment as a consultant to Roda JC has not been taken to kindly by the Jewish community] We listened to what Nicolas had to say about football and co-owner Korotaev wants to have him here. That’s what counts for us. I don’t comment about criticism from other people.</p>
