  <p><b>[Coronavirus: Union Berlin squad &amp; backroom staff waive salaries amid global pandemic]</b> These are exceptional circumstances we have to deal with. Our club’s purpose is football. If it ceases to exist, then it will touch the core of our existence. The management, our staff, the squad and backroom staff have worked hard in recent months to ensure success in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. Now they are giving up a lot of money to get through this crisis together. This willingness cannot be credited highly enough to everyone involved. On behalf of the club’s entire management, I would like to thank them for their support. As a club, we’ll conquer the challenges ahead and this will best happen, if we work together as the Union family</p>

  <p><b>[Union Berlin forward Sebastian Polter has been told he will not play for the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> side again as he does not adhere to the ‘fundamental values’ of the club]</b> It is one of the fundamental values of 1. FC Union Berlin that we, as Unioners, form a solid, tight-knit community in which we stand up for each other and for our club. Sebastian is the only player in the first-team squad, coaching and backroom team not to do this, unfortunately. This is not understandable for us and extremely disappointing. It is my immediate task, during difficult times, to protect the cohesion of the club’s employees and squad, so we do not jeopardise our goals on the pitch. We have therefore decided that Sebastian will no longer be part of our matchday squad with immediate effect.</p>
