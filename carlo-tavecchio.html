  <p><b>[Italy ready to renew Antonio Conte contract]</b> Conte is one of the best coaches I’ve ever seen. f he asks about it, I am ready to renew his contract, assuming it meets the conditions and the course of our technical sponsors Puma. We live in a country with a justice system. An indictment is not a conviction</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte can hold onto his job as Italy coach beyond Euro 2016 if he wants to]</b> I’m sure that he will renew, he is like a son to me. However, if he decides to look elsewhere, then we will find a capable replacement. The fact that he has been studying English for a year is not a shock. Today it’s only right to know the language.</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte’s replacement as Italy coach will not be announced until after the Coppa Italia final on May 21]</b> I will not be dealing with this issue until May 21. Because between then and now a series of elements could move to make us change or take decisions. After the Coppa Italia final all the waters will be still and we’ll see if there are any boats or ships in the area.</p>

  <p><b>[The dealings of agents such as Mino Raiola have been blasted by Italian Football Federation <b>[FIGC]</b> president Carlo Tavecchio]</b> The Donarumma story? We are out of situations we consider unedifying in a country that has dramatic economic problems. Certain figures come across as offensive. Which ones? Certain fees received by agents. I decided to implement the Agent’s Commission to see something new in that regard. We’re talking about anachronistic situations in a country like ours and we have to think hard about it. We have to figure out whether the situation is right or not.</p>

  <p><b>[Xenophobic views are shared by the organistion’s current president, Carlo Tavecchio]</b> In England, the non-European Union players must prove they’re worthy of playing in the Premier League. Here, in Italy, we have ‘Opti Poba’, who was eating bananas yesterday but is now a regular at Lazio.</p>
