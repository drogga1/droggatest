  <p><b>[Former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> defender Jan Kirchhoff says football is almost easy when you have <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> as coach]</b> It was crazy because you thought: Before, I didn’t understand anything. The way Pep simplifies the game and shows how you stand to the ball or in the field is outstanding. There are dozens of little details that you might have known before, but after two months of training under him, so many things made more sense and were so much easier for us players to implement. It makes an incredible difference when you have a good coach. It simplifies a lot of things enormously, so playing football becomes almost easy. In addition, the quality of the players and the level of training were important. I partly felt as if I was an Under-19 player training with the first team again<br /><br />When I signed for Bayern, the last half-year before was not so easy, not even in the club and not in the team. I made a lot of mistakes back then. I was very selfish and not a very good team-mate, because in my head it was just about me and everything else was behind me. I was over-ambitious, too impatient and also obsessed with my goal of achieving certain things. I couldn’t understand that it’s good to come from Mainz to Munich as a 22-year-old and play 12 matches in the first six months<br /><br />Pep thought I should stay because I would get my games towards the end of the season and learn something in every training session, but I wanted to play every weekend and show how good I am. At that time I was by far the best footballer I was ever in my career. At Schalke I was knocked down by an opponent in the second training session and was injured for a long time. It went very unluckily, maybe the time at Schalke would have been different then. But if I could really turn one thing back, then I should have stayed longer in Munich and shown more humility<br /><br /><b>[The Germany U-21 international left Bayern in 2016 to spend a year at Sunderland before he ended up at Bolton]</b> England was the greatest experience I had in football. It was really nice to come to another country, perfect the language and get new cultural input. I really enjoyed it. I also have to say that the sometimes high expectations in Germany or the search for the famous hair in the soup weighed on me a bit. The English are more relaxed, cheerful and respect the athlete much more. I enjoyed the first half year at AFC Sunderland very much, after that the injuries came back</p>

  <p><b>[Jan Kirchhoff says <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> is a complete striker]</b> Pep wanted the number nine to fall back into midfield and play a lot. The striker should always ask central defenders whether they push forward or stay on the line. And in this regard - if we would be talking about my toughest opponent in terms of pure quality - <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a> is just one number better <b>[than Mario Mandzukic]</b>. Robert is fast, agile, physically and technically good, can drop and has a great finish. You simply have no advantage against him. Robert is simply complete and therefore unpredictable<br /><br /><b>[Kirchhoff went on to describe Mario Mandzukic]</b> Training against Mario meant pain. He was always looking for physical contact and tried to block every long ball. Mario often ran into the back of the defenders and sometimes jumped into the back of the defenders when the balls were in the air. Even in training, he couldn’t stand losing. As a direct opponent of Mario, it was incredibly difficult to train well. He physically punished you. I had a lot of respect for him and his aggressiveness and quality as a young player at the time. I always tried to stand up to it, but I didn’t want to get involved in a duel. I still remember that <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> also said to Mario: ‘Maybe you can shift down a gear and play less aggressively’</p>
