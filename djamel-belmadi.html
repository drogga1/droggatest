  <p><b>[Algeria midfielder Haris Belkebla has been dropped from the country’s African Cup of Nations squad after exposing his backside during a live stream]</b> The national team coach Djamel Belmadi has decided to exclude Algeria midfielder Haris Belkebla from the Africa Cup of Nations training camp. The coach’s decision was to maintain discipline within the group, which he considers paramount.</p>

  <p><b>[Ivory Coast vs Algeria. Djamel Belmadi’s side have won all four of their matches in Egypt to date, securing these wins without so much as conceding a single goal, while they have scored nine of their own]</b> We are more than satisfied. We were not really in danger, and we controlled that game<br /><br />We’re here to achieve what no-one thought was possible. We believe. It’s free. It doesn’t cost anything to be ambitious, even if the goals are very high. Even if we can’t do it, we’ll do our absolute best to achieve it. Everyone is studying everyone else. Favourites, not favourites, it’s not for us to say. I don’t want us to repeat where we’ve come from. We’re coming out of a delicate period that has lasted since 2014. We’re not hiding</p>

  <p><b>[Senegal vs Algeria. This is a repeat of a Group C clash that was won 1-0 by the North Africans back on June 27, with Youcef Belaili’s goal shortly after the break the difference between the sides]</b> The group match and this one are totally different. The first game was not decisive but this is a final. We’re trying to prepare for the final like all our matches, focussing on this game on its own. The feelings of the players and their approach are very clear<br /><br /><b>[Belmadi highlighted the importance of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s <a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Riyad Mahrez</a> to the cause, with the attacker having netted three times in the competition]</b> He’s the type of player who sends you to a final. His free kick against Nigeria showed the full extent of his talent. He’s a boy that’s in tune with his team but wants more than ever to be a leader and he is assuming this role. Even if I don’t build teams around one player, a talent like Riyad is capital</p>

  <p><b>[Algeria head coach Djamel Belmadi revelled in his side’s ‘extraordinary, historic’ Africa Cup of Nations final victory over Senegal]</b> It’s extraordinary. It’s historic. This is the first Cup of Nations we have won outside our borders. Since 1990, it has been a long, empty passage. We are a football country. We deserve it, I think. It was a very complicated match, very difficult. We knew that it was going to be decided on a small detail. And the boys held on. With the tournament we had, with better attack and better defence, what more? But without the players, I am nothing. We tend to forget that they are the main protagonists. They are the ones who play, who apply the instructions. They did it wonderfully - if not better.</p>

  <dd>When Baghdad Bounedjah’s speculative effort looped off the outstretched leg of Salif Sane and dipped into the Senegalese goal beyond Alfred Gomis, it felt immediately like the worst possible opening to a game that was always destined to be fractious. There was precedent for what was to come in the first meeting between these sides some three weeks ago, which Algeria won with a second-half Youcef Belaili strike. Here, the goal came first, and so Algeria’s physicality became a wilful perversion, in service of nothing other than simply shutting the game down. The fastest goal ever scored in an AFCON final is a nice little bit of history, but beyond that there is little for which this game will be remembered by the neutral</dd>
