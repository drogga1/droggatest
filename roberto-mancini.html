If we were to face France now, they’d beat us, but we’ll be able to have our say once Euro 2020 comes around. My idea was originally to target success in the 2022 World Cup, but now we can challenge for Euro 2020.<br /><br />We have some real young talents coming through. Moise Kean is only 19 years old, so it’s up to him, but he can become an extraordinary striker. I sometimes use him on the wing, but if he does what he needs to, then he’ll be a centre-forward.

The important thing is that we continued to improve, we did well from the first minute and put the match on the right track. The most important aspect now is: why didn’t we score a fourth goal in the second half? We should’ve pushed harder, but at times we sat back and should’ve converted some of the other chances. We risked conceding, as Greece nearly hurt us on the counter a couple of times. I said we’re ahead of schedule, but still have a lot of work to do. The Nations League didn’t go that badly either, as we were in the running until the last game.</p>

  <p><b>[Roberto Mancini says Italy can win the European Championship]</b> I don’t know how it will end. But there are more important things than Euro 2020, without a doubt. If they postpone the tournament, we can win even in a year. The important thing is the health of everyone and that we can all return to the stadium and enjoy ourselves. Seeing people die in these last few days is hurting us too much<br /><br /><b>[Mancini said he has a squad of players in mind for the finals]</b> I had a fairly safe list of players called. It was ready with only a few doubts to decide at the last minute. However, if the tournament is suspended for a year, there will be a few changes. We have to wait to Tuesday to understand if <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> will decide to postpone Euro 2020. The problems we have had in Italy in the last 15 days will now be seen in other countries</p>

We will try to win a top tournament. I can’t wait to stand in front of the bench and listen to the national anthem play out. After everything the country is going through, it’s going to be an immense sensation<br /><br /><b>[Roma’s young star <a href="nicolo-zaniolo.html">Nicolo Zaniolo</a>’s participation in the tournament was in doubt after suffering a cruciate ligament rupture, but he now has time to recover his fitness]</b> Clearly, recovering a player with unique characteristics like <a href="nicolo-zaniolo.html">Zaniolo</a> is important and the many young players we have already in the squad will be more experienced next summer. If the likes of Federico Chiesa were to move to a bigger club and play international club football, that could also speed up the maturation process. As I told his father, Federico has to play with the utmost enthusiasm. Others like Domenico Berardi ought to be a star already with his capabilities, but he’s still 25 and can grow a great deal in future</p>

  <p><b>[Balotelli is allergic to grass]</b> His face was swollen - I don’t know why. He wanted to play in the second half but he had this problem 10 seconds before coming out. I came out a minute before the players and I didn’t see Mario. He then said he could play but his face was swollen.</p>

So many people have died and football becomes secondary. Right now, we have a young squad and we can still improve. We would have had a chance this year, but there were teams who were more prepared and started earlier, or those who already imposed themselves like France. With an extra year the guys will be able to improve by playing important games, so in this sense the national team will improve. But we will have to see the games, because with matches being closer to each other we might have less time to prepare. We’ve started a project that we can still improve, this is why having more time will help us</p>

  <p><b>[Italy boss Mancini on possible <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a> recall: The doors are open]</b> If he only thinks about football and does what he has to do, the doors are open, for him as for many other players who may not have been called up. Mario is like everyone else - he has important qualities, but it depends only on him<br /><br /><b>[Mancini said of Roma’s Nicolo Zaniolo]</b> He will grow like the other younger boys. Another year will be important for him. The first time I saw him he played as a midfielder and I think that’s his position. But he has the possibility to play wide on the right, as he is playing in Rome at times. If a player with important qualities can fill multiple roles without any problems, this is an advantage for him and for us<br /><br />Bringing the championship back to Italy after so many years, since the last one was won in 1968, would be a magnificent thing we want to do. We have the qualities to do it</p>

  <p><b>[Italy manager Roberto Mancini believes <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a> is throwing his talent away but still has time to turn his career around]</b> I care for him, regardless of all the things he does. I trained him when he was still just a kid, I played him and he was extraordinary for many years. My hope is that he will do something to change all this, as he’s still only 30 years old and would be at the peak of his football maturity. I hope one day he wakes up and realises he’s still throwing his talent away. Mario is an extraordinary lad, so kind and polite. I have explained to him many times that he is throwing his talent away, because his potential is remarkable</p>
