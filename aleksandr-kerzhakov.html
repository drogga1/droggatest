  <p><b>[Few strikers in the world would be able to replicate Wissam Ben Yedder’s record in the Champions League for Sevilla]</b> He is like a joker for Sevilla in the Champions League. He has scored eight goals in this competition, and it’s not for no reason. Sevilla have always been known for their ability to find talent that is unknown on the European scene, and Ben Yedder has shown his class. Few strikers in the world could score as many goals in a European season as he has<br /><br />Can they go even further? Well, very few people believed that they would qualify against Manchester United. Realistically Bayern are stronger than Manchester United and they are also stronger than Sevilla at the moment. But I believe in Sevilla. This is the team that is closest to my heart in Europe. I will support them and I hope they will be lucky</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham target Fedor Smolov has been urged to use the World Cup to set up a move to a major European league]</b> I’ve known Fedia since his first steps into the professional world. He and Aleksandr Kokorin were just starting out at Dynamo Moscow when I landed there from Sevilla. So I saw his first goals, his first exploits at the highest level. I have always said that they are two very talented players. They do not have the same style, but they are two great attackers. Unfortunately, Kokorin will not be able to participate in this World Cup, but I believe that Fedor Smolov will succeed in showing himself. I would very much like this competition to be a kind of stepping stone for him to move to a big European league from next season.<br /><br /><b>[Kerzhakov feels Russia can perform strongly in the tournament]</b> I am naturally very concerned for our team, which I will still support a lot. But I think our team can achieve high results. Obviously, the injuries of the players are problematic, especially those who had to play in the starting line-up. But we have an experienced coach. No one is safe from injury, but I’m sure guys will face it. And they will be doubly motivated, to make happy those who have been deprived of the tournament</p>
