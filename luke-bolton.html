  <p><b>[How chat with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> changed the course of Luke Bolton’s career]</b> I spoke to City and that’s where the manager sees me, so I was hoping that I’d get a run out at right back <b>[with Luton]</b>, and I’m really enjoying it<br /><br />I played there three times last pre-season with the first team, then Pep spoke to me and thought that’s where I was going to be best, so I just took that advice on board, that’s all I can do really, listen to him. He’s obviously a very smart man, I’d say the best coach in the world. He pulled me into his office, we’re speaking, he thanked me for pre-season and then said that’s where he thinks I’m going to be best. So straight away, I said, ‘no problem, that’s where I’ll play’<br /><br />I’ll never argue and say ‘no, I think I’m a winger’, I’ll take it on board from someone like that as he’s managed a lot of top players as well<br /><br /><b>[Guardiola has changed the positions of plenty of players in his career before, turning <a href="javier-mascherano.html">Javier Mascherano</a> into a centre back at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and using <a href="philipp-lahm.html">Philipp Lahm</a> in midfield at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. Having seen Bolton play he explained to him why he felt his future lay further back down the pitch]</b> He said, with my pace, getting up and down the line, he just thinks I’m going to be more sorted to full back than as a winger. That’s all he really said, my physical attributes, he thinks I can turn into a good wing-back</p>
