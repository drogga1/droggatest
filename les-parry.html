  <p><b>[Les Parry says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> could make the decision to let <a href="angel-gomes.html">Angel Gomes</a>, <a href="tahith-chong.html">Tahith Chong</a> and <a href="reece-james.html">James</a> Garner leave on short-term loan deals in January]</b> There will be lots of hard work, as part of what <a href="nicky-butt.html">Nicky Butt</a> puts together as the plan for everybody. We’ll plan it out and we’ve identified four or five who might be going out in January. Obviously, our first-team manager has a say. Three lads could have possibly gone on loan – <a href="angel-gomes.html">Angel Gomes</a>, <a href="tahith-chong.html">Tahith Chong</a> and <a href="reece-james.html">James</a> Garner – but he wanted to keep them here and have a look at them on tour. So a decision will be made, no doubt, for January as well. Hopefully, all three will be in the first team and not going anywhere.<br /><br />As we know at this club, lads have got into the first team and a lot of it has been through circumstances they’ve got no control over. They’ve been presented with an opportunity and they’ve taken the opportunity so now a couple of them are regulars on the teamsheet each week. We’ve had opportunities that have cropped up from nowhere. That’s football. Hopefully, some of the lads out on loan now will also catch the eye as some have gone out with a perception of their ability and where they’ll end up but hopefully they’ll come back and people will say maybe we’ve got a little diamond<br /><br />We’re very pleased with the way it works. <a href="nicky-butt.html">Nicky Butt</a> identifies, with me and Neil Wood, and the manager, which players he wants to go out and we got every lad we wanted out. We got them all clubs. There are opportunities that come along and you wonder whether to take them or not, or leave them for another week or so in the hope you can get something a little bit better suited. But it is constant work, especially when people know I’m doing the job, there are a lot of phone calls all the time, asking about certain players, obviously not only ones playing for the first team. We draw up a player’s needs before we start the process. I’m not kidding that we tick every box, because we can’t, but there have been a few clubs for one or two players, that we didn’t think were suitable. On the face of it, it might look a good move, but we didn’t think it was, for one reason or another, so we looked elsewhere</p>
