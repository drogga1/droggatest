  <p><b>[Roberto Ayala gave an interview where he spoke about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>’s evolution]</b> Lio likes to be treated like anyone else. He’s a very closed person who has grown a lot in recent times. Today, he’s a leader on and off the pitch.<br /><br />When he first started, we were team mates, he practically didn’t speak. What’s more, he would go out and train because he had to. If not, he would have stayed in his room. Today, he participates in everything: He talks with his team mates, he asks them how they are. Even before the matches, he talks a lot<br /><br /><b>[On the goal scored by <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a> vs. Argentina]</b> I’ve seen that play many times and I still can’t find my mistake. In the penalty area, I didn’t make a mistake. Yes, there’s the incredible ball control by him, an incredible finish. In that play, there are many good things which <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Bergkamp</a> did that no one gives any importance to, they just see a supposed error by me. What I do admit is that I was badly positioned when the ball came because had I been properly placed, I would have fought for the ball without problems<br /><br /><b>[When ask about being part of the Argentina national team coaching staff]</b> Being back with the Argentina national team as an assist with <a href="lionel-scaloni.html">Scaloni</a> is very special for me because I’ve been there since 1993, when Alfio Basile first called me up. I feel very comfortable. You have to make an effort to be here because you leave aside many things to be able to have the prestige that can only be given to you by this shirt. There is nothing more beautiful than putting on the sky blue and white shirt</p>

  <p><b>[Roberto Ayala on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b> I hope that he gives us his footballing level, that he makes us grow as a team. Having a team with him, not of him. He wants to be treated like this, like just one more player. We told the players that he will not be treated differently by us. You all have to step up, do what you do for your clubs, and he will help you. You have to take advantage of that</p>

  <p><b>[Roberto Ayala, another of those to have seen both <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> at close quarters in his playing career]</b> I played with both of them, with Diego I was taking my first steps. They are two footballing giants, and when he retires, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> will be remembered. I don’t know if it’ll be like Diego, it doesn’t matter. They are different. Diego was pure art in all his mannerisms, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> a Speedy Gonzalez who carries the ball two centimetres from his foot</p>

  <p><b>[National team’s assistant coach Roberto Ayala says Lautaro joining <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> would benefit Argentina]</b> The more matches they play together, the more they can get to know each other, it can be an advantage <b>[for Argentina]</b>. But we will have to see if Lautaro plays for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or not because we can’t forget <b>[Luis]</b> Suarez is there. We will see. It’s an important decision Lautaro will have to make. Whatever he decides you have to respect because he’s managing his career. The more chances of them playing together, the more they’re going to understand each other. Lautaro is in a very important club at the moment and scoring goals in Italy is not easy. At Inter he’s grown a lot and learned to earn his place. Inter trust in him a lot, his coach is empowering him, he found a partnership that complements him very well</p>
