<blockquote>
  <p>[Rahmad Darmawan, head coach of T-Team, believed his team still got a lot of work to do despite collecting their first three points of the season] We didn’t play the way we wanted to. We still made a lot of mistakes especially in the first half. In the second half, I urged the team to be more compact and more organized defensively and they finally started to do that. Overall I think we were lucky and got away with the win despite the game being dominated by Pulau Pinang.<br /><br />Nor Hakim hassan changed the game and that is what he is capable of because of his experience. Even though he is stil in his ‘wedding-mode’, I had no choice but to play him. Farhoud is a good player but he is yet to reach his top form. We have to be patient with him and he needs more time to adapt with everything</p>

  <p>[Rahmad Darmawan admitted that he was dissapointed with their latest result, conceding two late goals in their 2-2 draw against PKNS FC] The result is really disappointing because we didn’t deserve a draw, but I am happy with Tadjivey and Samassa’s understanding.</p>
