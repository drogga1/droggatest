  <p><b>[Rahmad Darmawan, head coach of T-Team, believed his team still got a lot of work to do despite collecting their first three points of the season]</b> We didn’t play the way we wanted to. We still made a lot of mistakes especially in the first half. In the second half, I urged the team to be more compact and more organized defensively and they finally started to do that. Overall I think we were lucky and got away with the win despite the game being dominated by Pulau Pinang.<br /><br />Nor Hakim hassan changed the game and that is what he is capable of because of his experience. Even though he is stil in his ‘wedding-mode’, I had no choice but to play him. Farhoud is a good player but he is yet to reach his top form. We have to be patient with him and he needs more time to adapt with everything</p>

  <p><b>[Rahmad Darmawan admitted that he was dissapointed with their latest result, conceding two late goals in their 2-2 draw against PKNS FC]</b> The result is really disappointing because we didn’t deserve a draw, but I am happy with Tadjivey and Samassa’s understanding.</p>

  <p><b>[Despite only coming away with a draw against Perak, T-Team’s Rahmad Darmawan was still satisfied with the performance of his charges]</b> I must congratulate my players. The result said we got one point, but I think they gave me a three-point performance. It was a tough game but in overall, I am satisfied because we challenged Perak, who have lots of quality players and also played on their own turf. <b>[About the penalty]</b> that’s between the referee and god. For us, we accept the decision. That’s football, anything can happen so we just have to accept it.<br /><br /><b>[Rahmad added that the draw against Perak could lift the team up for a better result in the next game]</b> I hope this can be a good starting point for us to bounce back. Remember that for us, we lost five or six players and we didn’t sign new players. We only brought in players from our President’s Cup squad. We will face Kedah next Saturday at home. It is another tough game, but I hope this draw can be a catalyst for us to get good results in the future</p>

  <p><b>[The Titans’ counterattacking game paid dividends against possession football exponents Kedah]</b> Today we opted for a counter-attacking game, it was very effective. We did not create too many chances, but everytime we had a chance we were clinical with the finishing. We would not have succeeded had we played to Kedah’s possession football. In addition, I was particularly pleased with my men’s discipline, the way they waited for the opponents to come forward, press them before launching into counter-attacks. All our goals came through similar situations<br /><br />After Kedah were down to ten men, I told my men to play a more simple game, to keep more possession of the ball. As a result, we got to balance out the possession rate. And with the extra man, we were no longer under pressure from the opponents and could play better<br /><br />I don’t want to get ahead of myself, I just want to focus on our next match, against Selangor. My men cannot be too happy with the situation, we are not on the same level <b>[compared to the other teams]</b>. For now I’m just happy that we have qualified for the Malaysia Cup</p>
