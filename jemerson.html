  <p><b>[Jemerson is now looking to keep Lionel Messi quiet in Brazil’s friendly date with Argentina]</b> It was a marvellous season. Few people predicted that we could go so far, even in Ligue 1. Winning the Ligue 1 title was special, since the club had not won for so long <b>[17 years]</b> and having such a powerful opponent in PSG.<br /><br />In the Champions League, after going through all the qualifying stages, picking up a group that was called a ‘death group’ and surviving to the semi-final was magical. If we look at all of the teams behind us - Barcelona, Bayern, <b>[Manchester]</b> City and Dortmund, which we have eliminated - it’s a great achievement. This was a year that brought us a lot of learning and professional growth, both individually and as a collective, with so many players standing out. I am very happy to finish the season with this call to the Selecao, with the Ligue 1 title and also with another goal<br /><br /><b>[On being called upon by Brazil boss Tite]</b> The emotion is so big. We work every day at our club, do our best, and it’s rewards like this that we hope and wait for. It’s recognition of our work and that we’re doing the best in everything. I thought of everything I’ve been through to get here, all the sacrifice, the whole fight. Moments like this show that everything was worth it<br /><br />Messi is one of the greatest players of all time and being able to play against him will be an honour. It would be better if he was on our side, but since it is not possible, if I have the opportunity to play, I hope not to let him do much on the field!</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco centre-back Jemerson has revealed that he believes that the most talented player he has seen at the Ligue 1 champions is Thomas Lemar]</b> I like Lemar very much. He is very good tactically. He defends, he attacks and he does everything. He is very important to our team and he played very, very well last season. When I arrived in Monaco, they talked a lot about him and I was very impressed. He has an incredible ability to dribble and shoot.<br /><br />It’s normal because those who score more goals appear more, but I really like Lemar. Mbappe is a very funny guy. I joke with him that he is the Road Runner he is so fast. Nobody catches him in the race, it’s like Road Runner against the Coyote in the cartoon!<br /><br />I think he has a lot of talent and a lot of quality, but he’s very young too. I think everyone needs to be calm with him. If he maintains that level and has regularity, he’s sure to be among the best players in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City must give Bernardo Silva time to settle but Tiemoue Bakayoko is perfect for Chelsea]</b> I wish all the best for them. Of course it takes time to adapt to a new team, a new league and a new country, because it changes a lot and it’s a different championship. Bernardo, I think, a little bit more than Bakayoko, because Bakayoko is very strong, tall and has the style of the Premier League.<br /><br />Bernardo has an impressive technique, an incredible quality to shoot the ball and dribble, and will be very successful, but needs a little longer time to adapt. But he will do very well and have a lot of success for sure, because he has a huge quality and will be trained by <b>[Pep]</b> Guardiola, who likes his style very much<br /><br /><b>[On Benjamin Mendy]</b> It did not influence <b>[the dressing room]</b>. We were sad because he is a very good and talented player. We miss him too because everybody likes him very much. I wish him all the best for him in Manchester City. But we also have Jorge who replaces him on the same level<br /><br />I think the market was a good one. We saw in the Super Cup, in the friendlies and now in Ligue 1, that our team maintained the style of play and the quality, even with the changes in the squad, arrivals and departures of players. Now we need to maintain our level of the last season in which we were champions, to fight again for the title and to do well in the Champions League<br /><br />It’s nice for everyone and for the league to have Neymar at PSG. It calls more attention and more world class players to enter Ligue 1. I wish him good luck in Paris, but against us I hope he does not have much luck like that. In the last year, <b>[Leonardo]</b> Jardim always talked with us about focusing on our team and worrying about us. We did this and we were champions. This year we are thinking and working in this same way. We need to focus on playing well and concentrate. If we think about other teams, we forget what we have to do. We were the champions doing this and now we will do it again. We are going to work hard to be the champions again</p>

  <p><b>[When asked to name the opponents to have given him the toughest time]</b> Cavani and Lacazette. Besides their quality with the ball, they are very intelligent without the ball, they move a lot, they know how to get away from the defenders, they open spaces. They make life very difficult for the defenders.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed to identify the best talent he has played alongside]</b> That’s an easy question. <b>[Ronaldinho]</b> Gaucho! What he did in games and training at Atletico was incredible, no doubt he is the best player I ever played with. The control he has with the ball is awesome. He can control any pass. His passes are amazing too. He gave passes that we couldn’t believe. Me and the others defenders were looking at each other and thinking: ‘how did he give that pass and find the forward there?’. He is amazing<br /><br /><b>[He helped Monaco to reach the semi-finals of last season’s Champions League before falling to Juventus]</b> It was a dream come true. I always had the dream to play in the Champions League. To reach the semi-finals, it’s inexplicable. When you’re listening to the music, no, before, when you’re going upstairs from the locker room to the field, there’s a movie in your head. You remember watching the games on TV when you were a kid and dreaming of being there someday. When you go on the field, you think: ‘I did it. I’m here’.<br /><br />The comeback against Manchester City was the most outstanding moment. After the game in England <b>[5-3 to City]</b>, a lot of people said that City had already got to the next phase, but we came back at home <b>[winning by 3-1]</b>. The two games against Tottenham <b>[2-1 wins home and away in the group stage]</b> also marked me a lot</p>
