  <p><b>[Jemerson is now looking to keep Lionel Messi quiet in Brazil’s friendly date with Argentina]</b> It was a marvellous season. Few people predicted that we could go so far, even in Ligue 1. Winning the Ligue 1 title was special, since the club had not won for so long <b>[17 years]</b> and having such a powerful opponent in PSG.<br /><br />In the Champions League, after going through all the qualifying stages, picking up a group that was called a ‘death group’ and surviving to the semi-final was magical. If we look at all of the teams behind us - Barcelona, Bayern, <b>[Manchester]</b> City and Dortmund, which we have eliminated - it’s a great achievement. This was a year that brought us a lot of learning and professional growth, both individually and as a collective, with so many players standing out. I am very happy to finish the season with this call to the Selecao, with the Ligue 1 title and also with another goal<br /><br /><b>[On being called upon by Brazil boss Tite]</b> The emotion is so big. We work every day at our club, do our best, and it’s rewards like this that we hope and wait for. It’s recognition of our work and that we’re doing the best in everything. I thought of everything I’ve been through to get here, all the sacrifice, the whole fight. Moments like this show that everything was worth it<br /><br />Messi is one of the greatest players of all time and being able to play against him will be an honour. It would be better if he was on our side, but since it is not possible, if I have the opportunity to play, I hope not to let him do much on the field!</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> team-mate Jemerson says Thomas Lemar superior then <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a>]</b> I like Lemar very much. He is very good tactically. He defends, he attacks and he does everything. He is very important to our team and he played very, very well last season. When I arrived in <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a>, they talked a lot about him and I was very impressed. He has an incredible ability to dribble and shoot. It’s normal <b>[<a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> gets more coverage]</b> because those who score more goals always do, but I really like Lemar</p>
