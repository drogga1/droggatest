  <p><b>[Erick Torres credited Wilmer Cabrera’s faith in him as one of the reasons he has been able to regain the form that helped him score 15 goals in the 2014 season]</b> I think that any player that feels backed by coach and entire team will play with confidence and will always give a great performance. Today I feel confident, happy and backed by the team, which helps me give my best and contribute to the team, which is the most important. If one player does well, the entire team benefits from it, which always the most important objective.</p>

  <p><b>[Erick Torres has seen quite a bit for a player so young]</b> When you are not doing what makes you happy, when you are working hard but can’t see any results, it’s hard to go to the office or to work. It was hard to go to practice knowing that even though I was doing the right things, when the weekend arrived I would stay on the bench or only play five to 10 minutes, just to start all over the following week.<br /><br />Wilmer Cabrera is a coach that understands the player. He talks with me, I know what he wants on and off the field. Yet, what allows him to get the best out of me is that he has confidence in me. He’s one of the few coaches that has trusted me, that understands me and <b>[whom]</b> I understand. That’s what makes him so good. When someone makes you feel that you are good at your job, makes you feel valued, that makes you want to give your best<br /><br />This year the team has something that maybe we were lacking in previous years. The team responds well to their identity and knows the style of play we have. Before we had great players but we would lose and didn’t make the playoffs because the team didn’t work as a unit. Everyone was trying to do their own thing<br /><br />I have learned that you always have to keep moving forward. I think it’s part of life to have hard times in order to learn and to value when you are back up. That’s what I have learned, to be a professional, to train every day at the same intensity. Sooner or later you will have the reward</p>

  <p><b>[Alan Pulido injury a painful blow for Mexico’s Gold Cup team]</b> I’m sad to hear the news, I wasn’t aware of that. We’ll hope that it’s nothing serious. He’s a good friend of mine. I know that I’m on the list, that I can be considered and if the coaching staff of Juan Carlos Osorio and Pompilio Paez decide that I’m an element that’s able to help the national team, I’m obviously going to do it very happily and how one should represent the country. The most important thing is that I’m ready, I’m in good physical shape, I’m mentally prepared. You have to wait, to be patient and I hope Alan Pulido is OK.</p>

  <p><b>[Cubo Torres added to Mexico’s Gold Cup roster]</b> These will always be tough matches. These competitions and these tournaments are very intense. There is not a weak team anymore, there is not a team that you can beat easily. I think it will be a hard game, a game in which Mexico has to start on the right foot. If I get to be there, I will enjoy it, I will do the things the best way possible. If I don’t get to be in the game, I will support the national team and give my support. Let’s hope it’s a good tournament for Mexico.</p>

  <p><b>[Erick Torres hadn’t represented the senior side since April 2015 but was given a start in the game against Jamaica]</b> I’m happy that I was able to participate. I tried to find the goal, tried to create danger in their area. I wasn’t able to finish a goal, but it’s important that we created chances, played well, pushed the whole game. Now we look to the game against Curacao.<br /><br /><b>[Despite his late addition to the roster, Torres said his adaptation to the squad is coming along well]</b> I feel really good. I think I know more than half of the group. They’ve brought me in well, treated me well. I’m happy on this side. They’re great teammates and we have a really good team. I feel good on the field, comfortable</p>

  <p><b>[Pumas sign Erick Torres from Houston Dynamo]</b> I’m happy to return to Mexican soccer, to return with an important team like Pumas. I’m coming here to work, to train very hard, that’s something that I’m known for, the desire I have and I think Pumas also is known for that, for having players who have desire. There’s a fan base that supports the team well, it’s always there for the players, supporting them 100 percent. I’m here for that, to give everything, to enjoy this experience at this club that’s one of the grandes. I’m very happy to be here.<br /><br />It’s the best moment of my career, the best time of my personal life as well. I just turned 25, I have experience, experience with the national team, with the youth national teams, with experience at important clubs and I think I come at a good age to do big things. I’m going to take advantage of this opportunity and do things well with hard work</p>
