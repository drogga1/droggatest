  <p><b>[Sol Campbell says he is one of the greatest minds in football]</b> I did go <b>[for the Oxford job]</b> and they didn’t accept me. Maybe it was a lack of experience, things like that, but it’s a full circle. Experience? How do I get experience? Well, I need a job to get experience. I don’t want to go too low that it’s a struggle, and I don’t want to go too low that I’m under someone and thinking ‘what am I doing here?’ I would rather be managing a club myself.<br /><br />I’m confident and it’s not like it’s rocket science to run a football club, especially when you get to that level. If you’re intelligent enough and a quick learner you will learn pretty soon, within two or three games, what the team needs, training-wise, to survive in that league, get better in that league, to get in the play-offs or even win the league.<br /><br />I’m intelligent enough, it’s not like I played on a fox and dog pitch all my life. I can’t believe some people, I’m one of the greatest minds in football and I’m being wasted because of a lack of experience or ‘maybe he talks his mind too much’. Go to Germany, they love people who speak their minds. They got the jobs. I’m sorry that I’ve got a mind, but don’t be scared of that. That should be something you want at your club, but obviously not.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal star Sol Campbell has backed Jack Wilshere for inclusion in England’s World Cup squad]</b> He’s a wonderful player. The only thing that has held him back is injuries and that’s such a shame, because he’s got great tenacity, great footwork and speed and knowledge. He’s got great drive and he’s got a good goal in him too. I’m pleased for him. England need that type of player who can play in tight areas and make thing happen<br /><br />Jack needs games. He needs regular games, he needs to build up that stamina and he needs to get that rhythm going. If he stays fit all the way until the end of the season he should be in that squad, for sure</p>

  <p><b>[Toby Alderweireld may be stuck in contract stalemate with Tottenham]</b> I think my situation was different. I was much younger. If a team wants you bad enough they’ll make it happen and come to a compromise and either he’ll stay at Tottenham or he’ll move on. I don’t think Tottenham will allow him to drift on for 18 months, a deal will be struck either way.<br /><br />I don’t know what he’s demanding wage wise. Is he happy there? I don’t know. Sometimes big deals need a bit of a conversation and people start at a certain level and then reality kicks in. He’s a top player, the fans love him. I think they’ve got to try their best to keep him. He likes Tottenham but then something could kick in and the whole situation shifts because the forces have shifted and opinions have shifted and that happens in these big deals. The slightest thing can shift and put it off course</p>

  <p><b>[Sol Campbell agrees that whoever takes charge of the Gunners needs to make defensive additions]</b> Arsenal needs a really big tackler. I think they’re desperate for someone who can head, tackle … a good passer, who can really bring the back four voice. They lack voice. They need someone who’s very vocal, who can start ordering people around the backline</p>

  <p><b>[Unai Emery is implementing a Barcelona-esque philosophy at Arsenal]</b> I think it’s all about a new rhetoric, new system. Players finding out how the manager wants to play and training-wise it’s great. But then you have to implement that into a game and that takes time. It’s not going to happen <b>[straight away]</b>. If it happens straight away, fantastic, but there are still teething problems and things like that. The players have to get used to that, especially the defenders. They’re so deep, almost like the Barcelona kind of starting the play. That’s very unusual for Arsenal to start so deep and receive the ball. But, they can do it, they’re quality players, but it just takes a little bit of time to get used to for everyone to get into sync, what to do when you’re being put under pressure. When you train it’s great and it could be high intensity, but you can’t replace that other than in the game. So it’s only a few games in and it’s going to take time.</p>

This has been conducted in the most amicable of ways and there has been total transparency between the club and Sol regarding the challenges which face lower league clubs such as <a href="macclesfield-town-fc.html">Macclesfield Town</a>. We have a very competitive squad in place, as demonstrated by our opening games of the new season and this certainly bodes well for the future.<br /><br />Sol’s passion, drive and football knowledge will always be remembered at the Moss Rose with fondness and he has issued the following statement in light of the above. We will be making a further announcement on the appointment of a new coach as soon as possible. Finally, we would like to thank Sol for his time at the club - not only in helping us retain our League Two status, but also for installing a winning mentality which we now hope to build on</p>

  <p><b>[Sol Campbell says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are in need of a <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> or <a href="ray-parlour.html">Ray Parlour</a>]</b> You look at someone like Milner, the attitude. The <a href="ray-parlour.html">Ray Parlour</a> attitude. That’s the kind of attitude that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> need. The love of football and desire to keep going, I think they’re lacking that. I look at Milner and think we need a little bit of that at Arsenal<br /><br /><b>[Campbell, who formed part of the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> ‘Invincibles’ squad in 2003-04]</b> For me, it’s the controlling of the game. The middle of the park is where they’re lacking. The steeliness and the balance just isn’t there. It’s the middle of the park, you win or lose a lot of games there. You can have a strong back or a strong front, but if you haven’t got a middle that’s really solid, then you have forwards dropping too deep because they’re not getting fed and defenders doing too much. You get less attacks against you <b>[with a stronger midfield]</b>, because you control the game more and you have the ball more. You win second balls and you don’t give silly fouls away. Yes, you’ve got to sort out the back. But in the middle of the park, they’ve got to get someone solid. They’ve got to realise the ingredients they need to win in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. At the moment, the ingredients aren’t right<br /><br /><b>[He added when quizzed on the approach that he would take if handed the reins]</b> For me, personally, I’d mix it up. Some long, some short, I’d do both. If you’re always going to start playing short, unless you’ve got absolutely word-class guys and you’re well drilled, there’s a million permutations that can happen. The teams you’re playing against have been working on the fact that you’re going to play short all week. So they know where you’re going to be.<br /><br />All of a sudden, if you play long, they start moving backwards, and then you play short. You want your players to feel the moment. I don’t want robots. I want guys who feel the game and say, ‘You know what, it’s too tight, let’s go long’ or, ‘There’s a bit more space, let’s play short’. I want guys who think outside the box, that’s what you need. Guys outside the box say, ‘You haven’t got me, because I’m going to do something else’. I’d give my players the freedom to go long and short</p>

  <p><b>[Sol Campbell leaves Southend by mutual consent]</b> I have really enjoyed my time at Southend, and whilst it was a difficult time fighting relegation, I still enjoyed the experience. We still managed to put together positive results, whilst also giving debuts to a number of the club’s talented young players. Southend have a great group of young players coming through from the academy, which was evident in our 3-1 home win against Bristol Rovers in our last game before lockdown<br /><br />There are obviously frustrations with how the season ended abruptly, and with what points we feel could have been amassed. However, the club have an exciting future with the plans for the new stadium in place, but with the current global COVID situation having a profound effect on businesses, I am keen not to be a financial burden to the club. I also want to thank the fans for their support throughout my time at Southend and wish the club and all the support staff the very best for the future.</p>
