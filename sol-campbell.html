  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger made a fundamental mistake in straying from the philosophies which brought him success at Arsenal]</b> He’s almost gone away from what made him great. He used to have a fantastic balance between really good English and foreign players. A lot of teams copied that and used that and moved on. But he went a little bit away from that and I think he’s suffered from that. With the youngsters coming in, paying off the stadium, saying that he can’t buy bigger players, that kind of held them back as well. The fundamental thing is he had a lovely balance between really good top class British players and a mixture of foreign players playing together, cohesively, making a really strong group. And I think he’s gone away from that.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal should be looking to bring in the likes of Antoine Griezmann, Kylian Mbappe and Karim Benzema this summer]</b> There’s been talk of Benzema to Arsenal for a while. The manager, Arsene, knows him pretty well. I think he would definitely make a fantastic addition. His movement, his strength, his experience in big games for European and domestic would be vital for them. I think they need someone who’s got a bit of nous and scoring prowess in front of goal.<br /><br />Up front, Griezmann is definitely someone who could make a huge difference with his scoring prowess and his movement. He’s done fantastic for his country and nearly won the European Championship. I think the big price-tag might be a hurdle, but if he <b>[Wenger]</b> can sell a couple of players and push the boat out to £85million, he will definitely make a huge difference<br /><br />And also going back up-front, I think the new guy on the block in Monaco, Kylian Mbappe. Bags of confidence, he reminds me … he could even be the next <b>[Thierry]</b> Henry. OK, he has got a long way to go for that but he’s showing potential that maybe if you wait two, three years he might cost just a bit too much as time goes on. So for me, the art of deal-making in players is catch them young and have that nous to think this guy is going to be the next best thing. You wait too long and it’s costing too much money</p>

You can’t always look in the same places. Yes, they want to keep it local and they want to keep as much in USA with the players and the staff, but sometimes you’ve got to open up. I think there’s guys around the world who could contribute.<br /><br />Maybe not on their hit list, maybe not on the paper list, maybe not on the agent’s list, but guys who probably could help them in different ways on the field.

  <p><b>[Sol Campbell says he is one of the greatest minds in football]</b> I did go <b>[for the Oxford job]</b> and they didn’t accept me. Maybe it was a lack of experience, things like that, but it’s a full circle. Experience? How do I get experience? Well, I need a job to get experience. I don’t want to go too low that it’s a struggle, and I don’t want to go too low that I’m under someone and thinking ‘what am I doing here?’ I would rather be managing a club myself.<br /><br />I’m confident and it’s not like it’s rocket science to run a football club, especially when you get to that level. If you’re intelligent enough and a quick learner you will learn pretty soon, within two or three games, what the team needs, training-wise, to survive in that league, get better in that league, to get in the play-offs or even win the league.<br /><br />I’m intelligent enough, it’s not like I played on a fox and dog pitch all my life. I can’t believe some people, I’m one of the greatest minds in football and I’m being wasted because of a lack of experience or ‘maybe he talks his mind too much’. Go to Germany, they love people who speak their minds. They got the jobs. I’m sorry that I’ve got a mind, but don’t be scared of that.

If a team wants you bad enough they’ll make it happen and come to a compromise and either he’ll stay at Tottenham or he’ll move on. I don’t think Tottenham will allow him to drift on for 18 months, a deal will be struck either way.<br /><br />I don’t know what he’s demanding wage wise. Is he happy there? I don’t know. Sometimes big deals need a bit of a conversation and people start at a certain level and then reality kicks in. He’s a top player, the fans love him. I think they’ve got to try their best to keep him. He likes Tottenham but then something could kick in and the whole situation shifts because the forces have shifted and opinions have shifted and that happens in these big deals. The slightest thing can shift and put it off course</p>

Players finding out how the manager wants to play and training-wise it’s great. But then you have to implement that into a game and that takes time. It’s not going to happen <b>[straight away]</b>. If it happens straight away, fantastic, but there are still teething problems and things like that. The players have to get used to that, especially the defenders. They’re so deep, almost like the Barcelona kind of starting the play. That’s very unusual for Arsenal to start so deep and receive the ball. But, they can do it, they’re quality players, but it just takes a little bit of time to get used to for everyone to get into sync, what to do when you’re being put under pressure. When you train it’s great and it could be high intensity, but you can’t replace that other than in the game. So it’s only a few games in and it’s going to take time.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal star Sol Campbell has defended his coaching credentials]</b> People talk about entitlement but I’ve done the hard yards. I’ve done it the correct way with the coaching badges. I have done watching the games, I have done listening to managers, I have done travelling around Europe watching other managers train, I have done a bit of TV work to help with analysis. I’ve done all that.<br /><br />If you put a microscope on what I’ve been doing, you start saying: ‘Wow, he has done all that?’ That’s part of the trouble: I don’t think people know half the things I’ve done. I’ve done a lot of stuff behind the scenes. You would have seen me at games, talking to managers and agents. It’s like an iceberg with me - they don’t know half the stuff below the surface.<br /><br />I was well prepared coming into this job. I’m adaptable. This was a fantastic opportunity for me to take and I took it. I could have been still waiting six months down the line. So now I’ve taken it, be happy. I could be still waiting. I could have turned it down. But I’m a different mentality. As a player and a human being, as I structured my life, it was totally about football. And the passion is still there<br /><br />The only thing I can show people is how I conduct myself in the job as the manager of Macclesfield. That’s the only evidence I have. I’m starting again. Every manager had to start somewhere, so why can’t I start here? I have been waiting for this a long time. I may look cool and calm but, underneath, I’m boiling inside with passion and ideas. Yes, it’s my first job but I’m up for it, pumped up, ready, focused, adaptable. You’ve got to be social as well. I’m ready for all that.<br /><br />I can understand people have their idea about me because they don’t know me. Once you work with me, you see very quickly what kind of guy I am. You can’t get to where I got to and sustain it if I didn’t have something. You have to be solid and proper. I know where I’m going<br /><br />I have got to climb a mountain. But I look at it another way. I have the tools to climb the mountain so I don’t mind climbing mountains. I have climbed mountains since I was growing up in east London in Plaistow. I’m not scared of climbing mountains. When you get to the top, the view’s great. That’s what it’s all about</p>

The middle of the park is where they’re lacking. The steeliness and the balance just isn’t there. It’s the middle of the park, you win or lose a lot of games there. You can have a strong back or a strong front, but if you haven’t got a middle that’s really solid, then you have forwards dropping too deep because they’re not getting fed and defenders doing too much. You get less attacks against you <b>[with a stronger midfield]</b>, because you control the game more and you have the ball more. You win second balls and you don’t give silly fouls away. Yes, you’ve got to sort out the back. But in the middle of the park, they’ve got to get someone solid. They’ve got to realise the ingredients they need to win in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. At the moment, the ingredients aren’t right<br /><br /><b>[He added when quizzed on the approach that he would take if handed the reins]</b> For me, personally, I’d mix it up. Some long, some short, I’d do both. If you’re always going to start playing short, unless you’ve got absolutely word-class guys and you’re well drilled, there’s a million permutations that can happen. The teams you’re playing against have been working on the fact that you’re going to play short all week. So they know where you’re going to be.<br /><br />All of a sudden, if you play long, they start moving backwards, and then you play short. You want your players to feel the moment. I don’t want robots. I want guys who feel the game and say, ‘You know what, it’s too tight, let’s go long’ or, ‘There’s a bit more space, let’s play short’. I want guys who think outside the box, that’s what you need. Guys outside the box say, ‘You haven’t got me, because I’m going to do something else’. I’d give my players the freedom to go long and short</p>

Southend have a great group of young players coming through from the academy, which was evident in our 3-1 home win against Bristol Rovers in our last game before lockdown<br /><br />There are obviously frustrations with how the season ended abruptly, and with what points we feel could have been amassed. However, the club have an exciting future with the plans for the new stadium in place, but with the current global COVID situation having a profound effect on businesses, I am keen not to be a financial burden to the club.

  <p><b>[Former England defender Sol Campbell saluted the mechanisms in place for people to be tracked down when they post online abuse]</b> Sometimes these incidences happen and it’s tough because do you want to speak out? Do you want to rock the boat? These things are hurting people. <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> doesn’t want to wake up to these images on his Instagram but it’s good that authorities are there and mechanisms in place that you can track people down. If you give all the information away, to the right authorities they can track you down very easily. The conversation is out there, everybody is talking about it and that’s key really. The main thing now is that people are listening now. And there are mechanisms, ways of finding and tracking people down now who are the perpetrators of these images or abuse online - keyboard warriors</p>
