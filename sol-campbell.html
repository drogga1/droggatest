  <p><b>[on David Beckham]</b> I used to train with him when he was around 13 at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> but he always knew where he wanted to go because he used to come in in his <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> training kit. It was his dream to play for United. What a player! He had his free-kicks but he was hard-working and had brilliant vision. He deserves everything he has got.

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend Campbell leaves Macclesfield after just eight months]</b> Macclesfield Town can confirm that after eight months with the club and successfully leading us to League Two safety last season, we have mutually agreed to part ways with manager Sol Campbell. This has been conducted in the most amicable of ways and there has been total transparency between the club and Sol regarding the challenges which face lower league clubs such as Macclesfield Town. We have a very competitive squad in place, as demonstrated by our opening games of the new season and this certainly bodes well for the future.<br /><br />Sol’s passion, drive and football knowledge will always be remembered at the Moss Rose with fondness and he has issued the following statement in light of the above. We will be making a further announcement on the appointment of a new coach as soon as possible. Finally, we would like to thank Sol for his time at the club - not only in helping us retain our League Two status, but also for installing a winning mentality which we now hope to build on</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend Sol Campbell has severed ties with League Two outfit Macclesfield after just eight months in a first managerial post]</b> Macclesfield Town provided me with a great beginning in the managerial side of the game, as well as a fantastic learning curve which I am truly grateful for. I would like to thank all the players and staff for their support during my time at the Moss Rose and also all the loyal fans, whose belief at the end of last season ultimately played a tangible role in our success</p>

  <p><b>[Sol Campbell says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are in need of a <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> or Ray Parlour]</b> You look at someone like Milner, the attitude. The <a href="ray-parlour.html">Ray Parlour</a> attitude. That’s the kind of attitude that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> need. The love of football and desire to keep going, I think they’re lacking that. I look at Milner and think we need a little bit of that at Arsenal<br /><br /><b>[Campbell, who formed part of the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> ‘Invincibles’ squad in 2003-04]</b> For me, it’s the controlling of the game. The middle of the park is where they’re lacking. The steeliness and the balance just isn’t there. It’s the middle of the park, you win or lose a lot of games there. You can have a strong back or a strong front, but if you haven’t got a middle that’s really solid, then you have forwards dropping too deep because they’re not getting fed and defenders doing too much. You get less attacks against you <b>[with a stronger midfield]</b>, because you control the game more and you have the ball more. You win second balls and you don’t give silly fouls away. Yes, you’ve got to sort out the back. But in the middle of the park, they’ve got to get someone solid. They’ve got to realise the ingredients they need to win in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. At the moment, the ingredients aren’t right<br /><br /><b>[He added when quizzed on the approach that he would take if handed the reins]</b> For me, personally, I’d mix it up. Some long, some short, I’d do both. If you’re always going to start playing short, unless you’ve got absolutely word-class guys and you’re well drilled, there’s a million permutations that can happen. The teams you’re playing against have been working on the fact that you’re going to play short all week. So they know where you’re going to be.<br /><br />All of a sudden, if you play long, they start moving backwards, and then you play short. You want your players to feel the moment. I don’t want robots. I want guys who feel the game and say, ‘You know what, it’s too tight, let’s go long’ or, ‘There’s a bit more space, let’s play short’. I want guys who think outside the box, that’s what you need. Guys outside the box say, ‘You haven’t got me, because I’m going to do something else’. I’d give my players the freedom to go long and short</p>

  <p><b>[Sol Campbell speaks with The Guardian about life as Southend manager, a job he took in October 2019]</b> Does <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> need to work?

I love the day-to-day religion of football. So why would I go somewhere else?</p>

  <p><b>[Sol Campbell leaves Southend by mutual consent]</b> I have really enjoyed my time at Southend, and whilst it was a difficult time fighting relegation, I still enjoyed the experience. We still managed to put together positive results, whilst also giving debuts to a number of the club’s talented young players. Southend have a great group of young players coming through from the academy, which was evident in our 3-1 home win against Bristol Rovers in our last game before lockdown<br /><br />There are obviously frustrations with how the season ended abruptly, and with what points we feel could have been amassed. However, the club have an exciting future with the plans for the new stadium in place, but with the current global COVID situation having a profound effect on businesses, I am keen not to be a financial burden to the club. I also want to thank the fans for their support throughout my time at Southend and wish the club and all the support staff the very best for the future.</p>

Big time. It’s a massive confidence boost. The games before weren’t good; no shots on target against Bournemouth doesn’t go down too well but he’s redeemed himself with that.

  <p><b>[Former England defender Sol Campbell saluted the mechanisms in place for people to be tracked down when they post online abuse]</b> Sometimes these incidences happen and it’s tough because do you want to speak out? Do you want to rock the boat? These things are hurting people. <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> doesn’t want to wake up to these images on his Instagram but it’s good that authorities are there and mechanisms in place that you can track people down. If you give all the information away, to the right authorities they can track you down very easily. The conversation is out there, everybody is talking about it and that’s key really. The main thing now is that people are listening now. And there are mechanisms, ways of finding and tracking people down now who are the perpetrators of these images or abuse online - keyboard warriors</p>
