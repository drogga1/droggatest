Hopefully, the pressure makes me better, as I am learning so many things. But many players from South Korea need to be better to make the team more successful. I am one of those players</p>

This is my attitude<br /><br /><b>[The fact that young soccer players across Asia are dreaming of emulating his career gives him goose bumps]</b> At <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, we can share the pressure, but on the South Korea team, some of the players have more pressure than others. How many people have pressure like this? I’m such a lucky guy<br /><br /><b>[The North did not qualify for the 2018 World Cup, but that does not mean Son hasn’t considered playing for a unified team some day]</b> I dream of it. Of course people would be happy to see us playing together because we are one country<br /><br /><b>[Son’s first priority, though, is helping South Korea get through a tough World Cup group that includes defending champions Germany and well-regarded Mexico and Sweden]</b> We are the weakest team in the group, so we need to work more than them. We need to run more than them - then we can surprise people<br /><br />Four days ago, we played against Honduras and won 2-0. The press, everyone, was talking about we are doing well. Four days later we lost, and they’re being negative. But that’s football. And we just need to focus on our football<br /><br /><b>[He’s made less visible sacrifices too: his agent says that when he goes out in Seoul, he wears a cap and a surgical mask-commonly worn here when people are sick-to avoid being mobbed by fans.

I did not get any more games and wanted to go back to Germany because I felt very comfortable there. But the coach has always encouraged me.

He gave me new self-confidence. The talks went so well that at some point I pushed aside my thoughts of change. What counts for people are titles. We have been close to winning a title so often.

  <p><b>[Son Heungmin on his military service in Korea Republic]</b> I couldn’t say everything that I’ve done but I enjoyed it. The three weeks were tough. On the first days no one knew each other so it was a bit weird, but soon we got to know each other. You have to spend every day together, there were ten people in one room so we got very close. We were working together, helping each other. In the first days the other guys couldn’t even speak to me but by the end we were joking and enjoying together</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> condemn fan for racist slur against Heung-Min Son]</b> We are aware of a video on social media in which an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> supporter uses a racist slur towards <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a>’s <a href="son-heungmin.html">Son Heung-min</a> during Sunday’s match. We operate a zero-tolerance approach to any form of discrimination and we unreservedly condemn this unacceptable racist behaviour. Our records show that the individual involved is not an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> season-ticket holder and does not hold any form of ticket membership. The platform in question has no official association with Arsenal</p>
