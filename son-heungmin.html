  <p><b>[Tottenham forward Heung-Min Son has picked up his second Player of the Month award this season]</b> It’s an unbelievable feeling - I’m very thankful for my team-mates, for the staff, and for the fans who voted for me. My goal was 10 Premier League goals, but I have three games more and I just want to score more goals, make more assists, and get more points. This is not my finish line. I want to keep working hard and win it a third time. I’m still hungry.</p>

  <p><b>[Son hails hot-shot Kane after yet another record]</b> I am really enjoying playing with Harry. Harry scores goals. Three defenders block Harry but he still scores, that’s why he’s so important. The most important thing is our partnership works really good. When I play with him, he beats every record and we are part of this. I want to be like this of course but I am happy to help him. I am not selfish, just thinking about myself. I am really happy for Harry. I want Harry to break every record for England and in the Premier League.<br /><br />Form is important but the most important thing is team-mates. Without team-mates it’s difficult to play well. They help me a lot, it’s why I play good. I’m working hard, just try to help my team-mates if I play. If I’m on the pitch I want to just try to give my best performance every game. If I’m on the bench I want to be ready. The coaching staff help me really, really a lot and I’m really thankful for that.<br /><br />We have all quality players. We take care of the ball when we get the ball. It’s not just about me or Harry or Dele or Eriksen</p>

It was unlucky they got out at the round of 16, but I’m really thankful for the Mexico fans.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he wanted to send a message to Mexican fans]</b> <b>[Laugh]</b> What should I say?

I’m sure my teammates will be able to fill the void sufficiently, but I still feel sorry about having to leave the team during the season. So it’s obviously important for me to prepare myself to sacrifice for the team as soon as I return <b>[from the Asian Games]</b>.<br /><br />I’m extremely grateful to the club. Tottenham are the club that gave me the opportunity to take my first step into the Premier League. I’m thankful to them for creating a great environment for me. They made a good offer to me, so I was able to sign the extension. The club expressed that they really respect me, so I signed the contract extension without having to put too much thought into it. Fans have congratulated me for signing the contract extension, but it’s actually me who should thank the club, our manager and my teammates</p>

I intend to return to the club with a gold medal. We know the final will not be easy. The manager and I keep reminding the team that we have to play in the final as well as we did in our first match. I know I have to lead by example. Most of the team are younger than I am, but I am willing to do what it takes for the sake of the team</p>

When I am playing for my country, there is not a single match that I can take lightly. I am a professional athlete.

This is my attitude<br /><br /><b>[The fact that young soccer players across Asia are dreaming of emulating his career gives him goose bumps]</b> At <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, we can share the pressure, but on the South Korea team, some of the players have more pressure than others. How many people have pressure like this? I’m such a lucky guy<br /><br /><b>[The North did not qualify for the 2018 World Cup, but that does not mean Son hasn’t considered playing for a unified team some day]</b> I dream of it. Of course people would be happy to see us playing together because we are one country<br /><br /><b>[Son’s first priority, though, is helping South Korea get through a tough World Cup group that includes defending champions Germany and well-regarded Mexico and Sweden]</b> We are the weakest team in the group, so we need to work more than them. We need to run more than them - then we can surprise people<br /><br />Four days ago, we played against Honduras and won 2-0. The press, everyone, was talking about we are doing well. Four days later we lost, and they’re being negative. But that’s football. And we just need to focus on our football<br /><br /><b>[He’s made less visible sacrifices too: his agent says that when he goes out in Seoul, he wears a cap and a surgical mask-commonly worn here when people are sick-to avoid being mobbed by fans.

I am very happy for him, he deserved it. One goal and an assist! The timing of the first goal was very important, the cross was unreal, I didn’t have to do anything, just touch the ball. It’s not finished, we have to focus on the second game too. Harry or Dele are very important for us, but we have players who can come in and do well. We showed that, Fernando came on too and scored an important goal</p>

It is just amazing<br /><br /><b>[A north London derby date with Arsenal]</b> The last two games weren’t what we expect but it has passed. Arsenal is important because, after two losses, we need to show our character. For our fans as well, we have to make them happy and show how good we are.

It’s the things you are doing extra.<br /><br /><b>[Son has been freed after helping his country to gold medal glory at the 2018 Asian Games]</b> It was a massive tournament - not because of me - and, when it was such a big thing, I was very happy and proud to win it; proud of my country, proud of my teammates. As I’ve said before, it was not my aim to avoid military service. My aim is simply to be great as a footballer - all the time. This is one part of that<br /><br />Mid-November was 100% a big period for me. I’d been travelling a lot. I didn’t feel great. I had so many things in my head. It was just a bit rough. The gaffer made the choice and it was perfect for me - some hard training at Spurs and a bit of rest. As I said before, you have to have the luck to meet a great manager.

I believe if we can do what we always do, we can make a good result.<br /><br />I really like Tottenham a lot. I just wanted to win, this is the crucial part!
