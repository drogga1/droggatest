  <p><b>[Agent suggests <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> target <a href="franck-kessie.html">Franck Kessie</a> set to stay at Milan]</b> I remember that we joined Milan when they were a gamble, we did it because this is a club that has always meant a lot to us. Now there is a project under development and for this reason, the present leads me to think that the future can also be red and black. We are in one of the most important clubs in the world, which certainly does not experience the moment of greatest splendour, but which intends to revive itself<br /><br /><b>[But Atangana confirmed <a href="franck-kessie.html">Kessie</a> is stuck in Ivory Coast for the moment due to the country closing its borders in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19]</b> Ivory Coast has closed its borders and for this reason it is not easy to bring him back, but I know Franck trains every day to be ensure he is ready, and he tries to make himself useful also from a social point of view. He sent food for families in difficulty and gave masks and disinfectants. In a situation like this, whoever can help must do so</p>
