  <p><b>[On Franck Kessi]</b> There are at least 20 clubs following the lads, including the best in Europe.<br /><br />We haven’t spoken to <b>[president]</b> Aurelio De Laurentiis yet. We’ll talk about the transfer market in June. Napoli is an attractive club, they have a great coach in Maurizio Sarri. His price? Whoever wants him will have to invest a lot</p>

  <p><b>[The agent of Franck Kessie, George Atangana, admits that Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal are among the Premier League clubs still chasing his client]</b> There are many overseas clubs interested in him. Manchester City, where his friend Yaya Toure plays in the same role. Liverpool, where their manager Jurgen Klopp knows how to help young players develop. Then there’s Arsenal, whose manager is very close to French-speaking players. I have to say they are not the only Premier League clubs who are after him, as there are many more too.<br /><br />Franck is close to many clubs and close to none. I must admit that Roma have the advantage for Kessie, but we haven’t closed a deal yet because there are other top clubs interested who continue calling me. There are very few clubs who can afford him, though. I can confirm he’s a good lad, honest and humble. He was brought up well. I can’t say how much he is worth, because that is down to Atalanta. I can only say he is a complete player and everywhere you put him, he can do that role</p>

  <p><b>[Agent suggests <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> target <a href="franck-kessie.html">Franck Kessie</a> set to stay at Milan]</b> I remember that we joined Milan when they were a gamble, we did it because this is a club that has always meant a lot to us. Now there is a project under development and for this reason, the present leads me to think that the future can also be red and black. We are in one of the most important clubs in the world, which certainly does not experience the moment of greatest splendour, but which intends to revive itself<br /><br /><b>[But Atangana confirmed <a href="franck-kessie.html">Kessie</a> is stuck in Ivory Coast for the moment due to the country closing its borders in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19]</b> Ivory Coast has closed its borders and for this reason it is not easy to bring him back, but I know Franck trains every day to be ensure he is ready, and he tries to make himself useful also from a social point of view. He sent food for families in difficulty and gave masks and disinfectants. In a situation like this, whoever can help must do so</p>
