  <p><b>[Pardew will be assisted by Chris Powell and ADO general manager Mohammed Hamdi is excited at the pair’s arrival]</b> We are very happy with the appointment of <a href="alan-pardew.html">Alan Pardew</a>, who has earned his spurs in English football. He has a lot of experience and that is important in the current situation. During the conversations we were impressed by Alan’s football vision. Chris also brings a lot of experience, as a player and as a coach. We warmly welcome Alan and Chris</p>

  <p><b>[Alan Pardew’s ADO Den Haag were seven points adrift of safety in the Eredivisie]</b> Of course this outcome leads to clarity and relief. It is an exceptional outcome to a hard season. Everybody knows we were having trouble, but we still had faith that we would get clear in the remaining eight matches. Obviously it is easy to say that, but we believed in our chances. In the coming months, we will work on our future. It is obvious that we are still facing big challenges in these times of the coronavirus crisis, which is the case for all football clubs</p>

  <p><b>[Alan Pardew departs ADO Den Haag after four months in charge]</b> Alan stuck his neck out four months ago by taking the job at ADO Den Haag in a very difficult season for the club. We have a lot of respect for that, which also applies to his track record in football. Due to the coronavirus situation, football could only be played until March 7, but we thank Alan, Chris and Paul for their efforts. We wish them the best of luck and have informed them that they will always be welcome at our club</p>
