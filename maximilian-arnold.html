  <p><b>[Germany Under-21s lifted the 2017 UEFA European U-21 Championship thanks to a 1-0 victory over Spain]</b> In Germany, we always work as a team. We play together and no person is any higher than another one. And that was our key to victory today, too. We knew about individual quality of players like <b>[Marco]</b> Asensio, Saul <b>[Niguez]</b> or <b>[Sandro]</b> Ramirez, and many others, but now we showed everyone in the world that Germany are also a good team.<br /><br />We have played five games in 12 days and we just grew closer and closer, and triumphed in the end. It was not a matter of individual quality of our players, of some skills of, for example, Max Meyer or Serge Gnabry. And that’s really important to get any success: to work together as a collective.<br /><br />It is very difficult for us. We have a national team with unbelievable quality. You just could have seen that at Confederations Cup: they went there in fact with a B-team and they are now in the final. And that’s amazing. That’s a reason why it will be very difficult for us to break through. However, we will see what happens in the future</p>
