  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain sporting director Patrick Kluivert has poured cold water on head coach Unai Emery’s desire to sign Swansea attacker Fernando Llorente this January]</b> We have a great forward in Cavani, but I think we need another attacker.<br /><br />The winter market is really difficult. We will not buy for the sake of buying. It’s important to bring quality to improve our squad<br /><br />It’s a difficult market and we’re looking for a player to improve the squad. The club is working to find the right profile. I’m happy with the team I have, but after the first half of the season, we need competition in certain areas</p>

I have great respect for Leo. He does everything really well - free kicks, dribbling, whatever he tries. Every single player and manager is impressed about what he is doing and he’s been doing that for a long time already<br /><br />I hope that he becomes the best player in football history.<br /><br />If you had asked me two years ago <b>[if <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> was in the form of his life]</b>, I would have said yes. But now he is impressive, being 30 years old and playing better than anyone else.<br /><br />It’s a pleasure to see him as he is a great player.</p>

  <p><b>[Patrick Kluivert has said that Real Madrid will have had a better season than Barcelona if they can clinch a third successive Champions League]</b> The Champions League is the biggest award any club can win but it is very hard, wining a double is good as well but winning the Champions League is better. I would prefer to play a UCL final and win it because if you lose it and you don’t have a double, it is not good either. Real Madrid are playing well and they always do what they have to do. The Champions League is the most important title, but if Real Madrid don’t win it, it will be much harder next season.<br /><br />I don’t understand why Real Madrid won’t do the ‘pasillo’, they probably have their reasons but for a respect fact they should do it even if we must respect their reasons.<br /><br />First of all, Messi is the best for me but he can’t do it all alone; let me think about it because I don’t want to say anything I could regret! Barcelona is Barcelona and Madrid is Madrid, one can win UCL and the other has a double, all of them play for victories. Messi and Ronaldo are different players, both in the highest level and each one deserves good words from everyone. But Messi was born with an impressive talent; Ronaldo did too, but he had to work harder to reach that level</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi ‘powers everything’ for Argentina]</b> Messi is an important player, both for Barcelona and Argentina. I think he’s 50 per cent of the national team. I do not think it depends only on him, but on a good day he powers everything. Of course, he is human and one day you can wake up not quite right. Then things can be complicated for Argentina. In qualifying, when he was not there, the team suffered. They did not have the brilliance and could not win the games that with Messi they would surely have won.<br /><br />He <b>[Messi]</b> is the best in the world, I have no doubts. He and Cristiano Ronaldo are far above the rest. They are one and two without question. The Golden Ball will continue to be handed out between them. Messi, for example, is the only player capable of changing the course of a match. I have seen it in Spain and also with Argentina, against Ecuador for example</p>

He is just in his second year in the Netherlands and moving to a club of the magnitude of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> should not be the first choice. For now, go step by step, calmly and calmly, but as a father I will support him in anything he decides<br /><br />I try, I tell him, he is 19 years old and thinks he can play with <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>, <b>[Sergio]</b> <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a>, <b>[Philippe]</b> <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> … But he has to do more yards.

  <p><b>[Justin Kluivert made the right choice in joining Roma instead of making the switch to Manchester United or Barcelona this year]</b> I’m very satisfied with what he is doing. He doesn’t speak much, but he is someone who knows how to listen and is motivated, I would have liked to stay in Ajax for another year, but he chose for himself. I think Roma is a good solution. A jump to the Premier League would have been difficult… I think United would have been too big a jump. Roma is an important club, but the pressures are lower. Roma must not win by force and it is a club that is used to good football. It is the ideal place for Justin right now. Then, who doesn’t dream of Barcelona? But Italian football is catching up and Justin can take advantage of it.<br /><br />I hope he can win the Scudetto. Juve are the strongest, but you never know. I would like to go to Italy soon. I’m busy with the new job, but for Justin I always have time. I want to see him win with Roma. And I want to see him happy</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona have enough quality at their disposal to counter the loss of Lionel Messi against Real Madrid]</b> It gives Madrid a bit more chance. Of course Lionel Messi is the star player of the world and without him in the team Barcelona has a little bit more difficulty to win games. He is such a player that he can decide games by himself and play a game by himself. Now it’s the time for the team to show that they can play without Messi. It will be difficult because he has such a weight on his shoulders in every game, and he proves it in every game that he is so important for the team. But with big games coming up, it is a big pressure for Barcelona without Messi in the team. They have to play differently. It’s a big blow that he’s not there because of his weight in the team. I don’t think they will change a lot. Barcelona is a team who can play very good football even without Messi. It will be strange but they have a lot of quality to solve this problem.<br /><br /><b>[On Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt]</b> They are two young players who currently play at Ajax, two bright young players who play very good with Ajax. It is of course different pressure. Everybody needs to know that if you are playing for Barcelona, the pressure is always very high. I think they are two very good players who could fit very well into the team at Barcelona. The style of play and the qualities they have are connected very strongly to the type of player Barcelona has and will have in the future. You have to know the identity of the way of playing<br /><br /><b>[On Justin Kluivert]</b> Of course he would love to play for Barcelona one day. His goal is to play for Barcelona. Roma is very good for him at the moment. He needs to play a lot more matches and I hope at the end of day that he can sign for Barcelona</p>

He has got the skills, the attitude, he’s quick, he’s fast, he can score goals. He is not always in the first XI at Manchester United and maybe he wants to change club. So, why not?</p>

Even then you could already see his strengths, his way of handling the ball. When he receives the ball, he already knows where to play it, he always looks for vertical passes towards other central midfielders or strikers. When he’s got the ball at his feet and he has some space he is very quick with vertical runs<br /><br />I think he is a great signing for Barcelona and he will let the Barcelona fans enjoy the way Barcelona loves to play and he is the perfect player for them</p>

  <p><b>[Former Barcelona forward Patrick Kluivert believes El Clasico is the game that changes the world]</b> I’ve played in quite a few leagues, but El Clasico is the game that changes the world. I played Inter Milan-AC Milan, Feyenoord-Ajax … you name it. But El Clasico, everyone knows it. If you say it here, or at the other end of the world, it’s a game that everybody knows. When you play that game, the media is already boiling it up weeks in advance. It’s fantastic to take part. If you ask any fans in Spain if they want to go to El Clasico, they’d die for a chance to go to that game.<br /><br />Winning and scoring at the Bernabeu, it’s the best thing. I think I scored two or three goals at the Bernabeu, it’s something quite amazing. The rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona is enormous, but also with respect. If you see both teams playing each other, of course, there’s a rivalry but at the end, you shake hands. A lot of the international players play in the same team, they’re Barcelona or Madrid but they have to come together. But that day … they’re enemies</p>
