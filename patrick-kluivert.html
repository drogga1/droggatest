He’s now a first XI player. If he’s playing like this in the long-term, he could be one important player in the future.<br /><br />Of course, I prefer that he goes to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> but in football everything can happen. He’s an adult, he can make his own decisions but he’s already said it’s a dream for him to play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. But you never know in football.<br /><br /><b>[Patrick Kluivert’s fondness of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> also makes him believe <a href="ernesto-valverde.html">Ernesto Valverde</a>’s side can win the Champions League this season]</b> There are some good teams capable of winning it <b>[the Champions League]</b>. It’s important to be in the quarter-finals. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are one of those teams. They are playing really well in <a href="laliga.html">LaLiga</a> and now will face Roma. But there is also <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, many teams.

  <p><b>[Kluivert hoping to see <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> star become best of all time]</b> <b>[Messi]</b> is special because over all the years he has kept playing at this level. I have great respect for Leo. He does everything really well - free kicks, dribbling, whatever he tries. Every single player and manager is impressed about what he is doing and he’s been doing that for a long time already<br /><br />I hope that he becomes the best player in football history.<br /><br />If you had asked me two years ago <b>[if <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> was in the form of his life]</b>, I would have said yes. But now he is impressive, being 30 years old and playing better than anyone else.<br /><br />It’s a pleasure to see him as he is a great player.</p>

  <p><b>[Justin Kluivert warned off <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> move by his own father]</b> The truth is that now is not the time. He is just in his second year in the Netherlands and moving to a club of the magnitude of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> should not be the first choice. For now, go step by step, calmly and calmly, but as a father I will support him in anything he decides<br /><br />I try, I tell him, he is 19 years old and thinks he can play with <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>, <b>[Sergio]</b> <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a>, <b>[Philippe]</b> <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> … But he has to do more yards.

  <p><b>[Justin Kluivert, Roma’s flying NxGn winger who could outshine his illustrious father]</b> I’m very satisfied with what he is doing. A job would have been difficult. I think <b>[Manchester]</b> United would have been too big a jump. Roma is an important club, but the pressures are lower.<br /><br />He doesn’t speak much, but he is someone who knows how to listen and is motivated, I would have liked to stay in <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> for another year, but he chose for himself. I think Roma is a good solution.<br /><br />Roma must not win by force and it is a club that is used to good football. It is the ideal place for Justin right now. Then, who doesn’t dream of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>? But Italian football is catching up and Justin can take advantage of it</p>

I don’t see a lot of players who can play in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>, perhaps he can play. There is not a lot.

We’re communicating well with each other. If all the first-team players are at 100 per cent, I have the feeling that he will have to play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> B to get some minutes in his legs.

For two reasons: Qatar, and also the fact that if you bring in <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, you slow down some players that are already at the club. This is a decision that must be made internally. If you bring him in, he’s a great player. But <a href="ansu-fati.html">Ansu Fati</a>, who plays the same role, you put the brakes on him, or other players. What do we want to do? That’s what we have to ask ourselves. Do we want <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, do we want young players to come through, or do we want both?</p>
