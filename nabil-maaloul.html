  <p><b>[Nabil Maaloul speaks about his squad and facing England at Russia 2018]</b> The key to qualification is going to be the first match, on 18 June, against England. England have got a lot better this year, especially after appointing a new coach and fielding young talent. <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> and <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> are exceptional players. For me, <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> is one of the greatest forwards in the world right now. We have a great chance. We have talented players - players who are at the summit of their form and young players too. The average age of this Tunisian squad is 26 and despite meeting England, we have a great chance of reaching the second round</p>
