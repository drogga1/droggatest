  <p><b>[How Tunisia are plotting to ruin England’s World Cup]</b> All matches will be very important, but it is sure that the one against England will be very difficult. Against them, we will try to impose our game and impose our style. We will try to counter this English team, which has players with a lot of quality. And inshallah (God wills it), it’s going to be okay. Can Tunisia make it past the first round? Inshallah. We will do everything to make it happen. It’s our aim, not only a dream. Even if we know that it will be very difficult because we will play against very big nations. A team like Belgium is one of the best in the world right now. The English too, they have grown enormously in football. They have changed their mentality. We know for a fact that it will be difficult. But it’s possible, in any case.
<br /><br />We started analysing our opponents just after the end of the draw on December 2. Once we knew their identity, we began to study them and we are ready. But the season is not over yet. There can be unforeseen events, injuries that see other players called up for these three nations. But, overall, I think we are ready. The two games in March, they are important for many reasons. First, we will play against two good football nations. First will be Iran, who are the first Asian country to have qualified for the World Cup. They played very good qualifying matches, conceding only three goals. And then there will also be Costa Rica. A team that looks a lot like Panama. We tried to get as close as possible to our opponents in the first round. With the approach of the World Cup, we will then have other matches against Portugal, Turkey and Spain. The two games in March will also be important because we will have new players who are playing abroad for the first time, namely <b>[Mouez]</b> Hassan, <b>[Siefeddine]</b> Khaoui, <b>[Elyes]</b> Skhiri and <b>[Yohan]</b> Benalouane. It will be their first match and we will try to integrate them little by little with us. Is the World Cup coming too fast or too slowly? Not too fast, not too slowly. We are well prepared and we must do everything possible to be able to succeed in this World Cup. We know we are in a very difficult group, with England, Belgium and Panama. We will try to get closer to their level and for that we must leave nothing to chance</p>

  <p><b>[Nabil Maaloul speaks about his squad and facing England at Russia 2018]</b> The key to qualification is going to be the first match, on 18 June, against England. England have got a lot better this year, especially after appointing a new coach and fielding young talent. <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> and <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> are exceptional players. For me, <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> is one of the greatest forwards in the world right now. We have a great chance. We have talented players - players who are at the summit of their form and young players too. The average age of this Tunisian squad is 26 and despite meeting England, we have a great chance of reaching the second round</p>
