<blockquote>
  <p>It was 14 years ago, in my first week in Japan, at the welcoming party by the language school I came to work for. I was given some local sake. It was an epiphany. I just went looking for more of that amazing drink I’d discovered - first in shops and izakaya <b>[taverns]</b> and then by visiting sake breweries. It happened very organically. Before I knew it, sake had become my life
 <br /><br />Sake isn’t just a drink, it’s a culture<br /><br /><b>[Robbie Swinnerton: Who have been your biggest influences?]</b> First, all the brewers in Japan. They’re my ultimate inspiration and motivation, in particular those at Aramasa in Akita Prefecture and Juyondai in Yamagata Prefecture. Second, my boss <a href="hidetoshi-nakata.html">Hidetoshi Nakata</a> <b>[CEO of Japan Craft Sake Company and former soccer star]</b><br /><br /><b>[Robbie Swinnerton: Is it important for people to take a course on sake to appreciate it properly?]</b> If you just want to enjoy sake, you don’t need to study anything. All you need to ‘understand’ sake is simply to follow your instinct and go with what you like<br /><br /><b>[Robbie Swinnerton: What are the best foods to eat with sake?]</b> You can pair anything with sake, literally any cuisine. But for me, cheese with sake is the bomb - preferably a whole cheese board, so I can see which kinds go best with the sake<br /><br /><b>[Robbie Swinnerton: Tell us about ‘Kanpai! Sake Sisters,’ a recent documentary that you were featured in]</b> It underscores that women are emerging as leaders in the sake world. It’s an industry that’s been going through a difficult time and needs a rebuild. Women are, I believe, natural communicators and community builders<br /><br /><b>[Robbie Swinnerton: As a woman, have you found any resistance within the industry?]</b> Very occasionally. But as much because I’m a foreigner, not just a woman. In fact, 99.9 percent of the time, I’ve been welcomed<br /><br /><b>[Robbie Swinnerton: Where is your oasis in Tokyo?]</b> The terrace of Bricolage Bread &amp; Co. <b>[in Roppongi]</b>, with a freshly baked loaf and a lovely cup of Fuglen coffee<br /><br /><b>[Robbie Swinnerton: Can you recommend some Tokyo bars or izakaya for enjoying sake?]</b> Akaoni <b>[in Sangenjaya]</b> offers a great old-school experience. For a modern take on sake culture, Gem by Moto in Ebisu. And for really elegant pairings of sake, Sokyu in Kagurazaka<br /><br /><b>[Robbie Swinnerton: How about three favorite restaurants?]</b> Top of the list is L’Effervescence in Nishi-Azabu. I also love Eiraku Shokudo in Akita Prefecture for its simple, yummy home-style food. And Tokuyamazushi in Shiga Prefecture is a lovely lodge with amazing local food and sake<br /><br /><b>[Robbie Swinnerton: Any tips for preventing or curing a hangover?]</b> Don’t mix fermented beverages with distilled spirits. And always have food while drinking. For hangovers, I swear by sweetened Earl Grey tea, Marmite on toasted sourdough bread and a chaser of OS1 <b>[an electrolyte replacement drink]</b><br /><br /><b>[Robbie Swinnerton: What aspects of Japan do you find totally awesome?]</b> I love the juxtaposition of modern and traditional, that collision of so many different eras in the present moment. I also love how Japan is becoming more international and inclusive<br /><br /><b>[Robbie Swinnerton: What’s your favorite place to visit outside of Japan?]</b> Taiwan. I love the people, the food and the environment. I feel it gives me a great big hug each time I return!</p>
