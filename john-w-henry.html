  <p><b>[Fenway Sports Group (then New England Sports Ventures) acquired <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and from the beginning, principal owner John W Henry vowed to seek a fresh solution to the stadium conundrum]</b> Why would we ever move from here? It’s remarkable that it’s come together given all the challenges we faced coming in. We knew that there had been lesser plans that had been scrapped, so I’m proud that we have moved forward and I’m humble about it because we’re part of a great group of people that put this together. It marks a new chapter for this great football club</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool owner John Henry has said the club’s attention will be firmly on winning the Premier League next season]</b> To me winning in Europe is bigger than winning in England but I think it’s true the fans want it. I know we’re going to be focused on winning the Premier League next year. We need to get healthy. We need AOC <b>[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain]</b> back, we need a healthy Adam Lallana. It’s not up to me, but I would guess we’ll see more of Divock Origi next year. I think he brings something special, he comes with power and speed and brings in scoring. I feel really good about next year<br /><br /><b>[Henry was fulsome in his praise of Jurgen Klopp’s men for their 2018-19 efforts]</b> Our guys gave their all from the first day of the season to the last. It’s a long season, they played up to their capabilities and just gave it so much effort. It didn’t matter who the opponent was, they out-ran every opponent and I felt they deserved to walk away with a trophy. We walked away with the biggest one so I’m very happy</p>

  <p><b>[New <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> contract thrills FSG]</b> As we are sure our supporters would agree, it is truly wonderful news and we are all extremely thrilled, not only professionally, but personally too. We feel this represents one of the big moments of our stewardship of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club so far as we believe there is no better manager than Jurgen. The decision also keeps with the club’s overall strategy of building from a position of strength. It means Jurgen will oversee the ongoing transition from Melwood to the new Kirkby training base as the club continues to pursue a vision of being elite in all facets of the industry<br /><br />It also provides us with continuity with the existing football operations management structure, overseen by sporting director Michael Edwards, whose input into the project cannot be overestimated. He has been - and will continue to be - as indispensably important as anyone else to the direction of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club. In Jurgen and Michael we are blessed with world-class leadership.<br /><br />This is a collective partnership that has seen the club reach and then re-establish itself as an elite performer at home and abroad. Back in 2015 we used the phrase ‘ideal fit’ when we appointed Jürgen. This continues to apply today and, if anything, the circumstances make it more pertinent. We consider him to be the best there is. If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club were looking to appoint the most outstanding, elite manager for our current status today, Jürgen would be the first choice - no question. We believe this deal cements a relationship built on trust and mutual benefit: Jürgen has delivered for LFC and LFC has delivered for Jürgen. Both parties have come to the conclusion that by continuing to work together and build on the work of the last four years, the opportunity exists to maximise each other’s potential</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool owner John W Henry claims the club’s record-breaking <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title triumph in 2019-20 has seen the Reds make ‘the beautiful game more beautiful than ever’]</b> This was a season for the ages and for the faithful of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club. It has been an incredible year of magnificent achievement culminating tonight in capturing <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title. This in addition to winning a European championship, a Super Cup and a world championship - the totality of this accomplishment has brought respite and joy to so many in a year filled with so much tragedy. LFC has made the beautiful game more beautiful than ever<br /><br /><b>[Henry also had a message for the club’s loyal fan base]</b> It is said, ‘We are Liverpool’. You, the supporters are <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in every sense and you continue to drive the club forward - a historic club making history once again.</p>
