<blockquote>
  <p>It will be the second time in the space of six months that these two fighters will meet each other inside the Octagon after the two fought back at UFC 212 in June earlier this year. Max Holloway won on that night via TKO in the third round and subsequently won the UFC Featherweight title off Aldo.<br /><br />While this looks like it could be the start of a great rivalry between these two, it will struggle to eclipse the rivalry the Brazilian already has with the current UFC Lightweight Champion, <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a>, who knocked him out in just 13 seconds in their Featherweight title fight at UFC 194 almost two years ago<br /><br />In preparation of his upcoming fight, Aldo spoke to reporters during a media day in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil about a number of different topics including the current state of the 155-pound division and their champion <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>. Scarface said, according to MMA Fighting, that he’s glad he’s not in the same division as <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">The Notorious</a> anymore as he’s holding up the lightweight division and stopping other fighters from progressing their careers<br /><br />It’s highly unlikely that <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> steps inside an Octagon again before the end of the year, but when he does fight for UFC again, many believe it will be against interim UFC Lightweight Champion Tony Ferguson</p>
