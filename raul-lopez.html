  <p><b>[Why right back Raul Lopez could hit it big with Mexico in Vegas]</b> You always hope for a call but I didn’t know. I was surprised by the call. I was working well, but I didn’t think I was going to be selected this time. It’s a dream. The truth is it’s what I want. I have to work hard to win a spot, day-by-day, game-by-game here in Pachuca and with the national team try to do as well as I can</p>

  <p><b>[CCL foes Pachuca and FC Dallas thrive on youthful philosophies]</b> It’s good that in Mexico as well as in the United States we’re seeing teams play young players, giving them an opportunity. It’s going to show up in the game, because, like us, they have been playing really well lately and it creates more dynamic games.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mexico wasn’t surprised that Curacao gave it a challenge Sunday]</b> My natural position is a bit deeper, I’ve been playing there for about three years now, but going forward I’m really comfortable on the wing. I’m happy whether I’m farther forward or in the back.<br /><br />For me, the instructions were to send in a lot of crosses, which I really like, look into the area to find the two forwards, Martin Barragan and Angel Sepulveda, which is what they like</p>
