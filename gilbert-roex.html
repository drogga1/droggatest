<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Thibaut Courtois]</b> Thibaut had come to our club as an outfield player. He mostly played in the Under-9s and Under-10s as a defender but, when he trained, he also liked to be a goalkeeper. So, we saw that he had the talent to become a goalkeeper, he had a naturally good position, had very good co-ordination and had no fear about attacking the ball, and also very good timing. I think this is one of the things he learned when he was playing volleyball at home with his family and friends.<br /><br />However, Thibaut also had this partnership with Koen, who is now at Wolfsburg in Germany, and I really think that was one of the most important parts in Thibaut’s development because they started working together at 14 and they made each other better in training. Then, when Thibaut was 16, he got a chance to show his talent as the two experienced goalkeepers from the first team couldn’t play in a game against Gent. The first-choice goalkeeper, Davino Verhulst, was suspended and the second-choice one, Sem Franssen, suffered an injury just three days before the game!<br /><br />So, Thibaut made his debut in the first team and played very well. He then started training with the Under-21s and playing with the Under-19s for a while, but we also let him train once or twice a week with the goalkeepers from the first team. At 17, we let him train with the first team on a full-time basis and play his games with the Under-19s and Under-21s. At that moment, he became the senior squad’s third goalkeeper, after Laslo Koteles and Casteels.<br /><br />At the beginning of that season, he had just turned 18 but the coach, Franky Vercauteren, chose Thibaut as his No.1. So, Thibaut got the chance to make his real debut in the first team, he showed his extreme talent and stayed in the first team. He showed that year that he was mentally very strong. The first team had a very good season and became champions of Belgium. Thibaut also received the award for being the best goalkeeper in the Belgian league</p>
