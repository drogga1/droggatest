<blockquote>
  <p><b>[UEFA’s managing director of integrity Emilio Garcia said]</b> Mamadou Sakho was a clear use of this type of substance. It was a problem but in the end the player was acquitted by UEFA’s disciplinary committees. It was a problem that was started with supplements.<br /><br />The Macedonian player <b>[Arijan]</b> Ademi was playing UEFA competitions and we imposed a two-year ban. It was more or less the same problem; use of supplements. Right now it’s a big problem.<br /><br />The clubs are very well aware it’s a big problem. And they need to be extremely careful with these external advisors and doctors. We don’t have competence over third parties. We have competence over clubs, football players, team doctors but when it comes to third parties or advisors we need to collaborate with the police<br /><br />This is a global phenomenon. It would be a good idea if the states go ahead with something about supplements. But even if the states go ahead with this policy then you can buy supplements via the internet with one click. The problem is really, really difficult<br /><br />The problem is limited. We are dealing with between three to five cases a year in UEFA competitions. Most of these cases are linked with recreational drugs. We conduct around 3,000 doping tests a year. One third of these tests are out-of-competition tests. In principle the problem is more on the side of recreational drugs. We are doing everything. Biological passport, blood and urine not only in competition but also out of competition. Looking at the figures we are comfortable but we cannot underestimate the problem<br /><br /><b>[Garcia is also keen to change the perception that a test revealing a banned substance means a player is guilty]</b> Another problem is the lack of respect towards the players. When we have a doping case everybody thinks the player is guilty. This is something we are trying to change. We have just introduced public hearings for doping cases. We don’t need to hide anything. We have just implemented pro bono counsels and also the process will be free for the players. We need to guarantee doping cases are fair not only for UEFA but also for the players. We need to demonstrate the player is cheating. For the moment we have a positive report from the lab and now the UEFA inspector needs to prove he’s in breach of the regulations. When you impose a two-year ban or a four-year ban you need to be absolutely sure. It’s the life of the individual</p>
