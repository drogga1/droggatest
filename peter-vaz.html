<blockquote>
  <p><b>[All India Football Federation’s chief Praful Patel, is in the firing line of Goa’s football clubs yet again]</b> I don’t understand what ‘bandwidth’ means according to Praful <b>[Patel]</b>. If he means that we don’t have the necessary requirements to participate in the I-League then I would like to make it clear that the initial entry to participate in the league was dropped from Rs 100 crore to 1 crore. This shows that any level clubs can join the I-League and that the Goan clubs have high standard and are overgrown with youth grassroot development programme.<br /><br />Leaving aside Mohun Bagan and East Bengal there are no other experienced clubs in the league at present. Praful should realize that football is not a game of politics. It is a ball game. He is totally unfit to run the Federation. Wherever Praful has been associated with that particular association or industry has not been successful. Praful is an ignorant person and his statement has no value. He doesn’t know what is important for AIFF and he keeps on changing his statement every year. Earlier Praful had said that I-league was important and later changed his view saying that the league has to be merged with ISL</p>
