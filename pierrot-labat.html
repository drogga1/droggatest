<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Zinedine Zidane: the No10 overcomes his doubts to step into <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> cauldron]</b> I spent four years telling him he was a good header of the ball and every time he replied: ‘No, I’m not’. On his first appearance for France, which was here in Bordeaux, he scored with a header and when he scored another two in the World Cup final I was in the stands again, crying my eyes out. You see, with him my work was always more psychological than technical because, like many exceptionally gifted people, he doubts a lot. He needs to prove things to himself. But when he talked for the first time about his ambitions to become a manager, back in 2012, I told him straight away that he had the qualities to be a very successful one. I think he is going to become the <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a> of Real Madrid<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> he really wanted to learn how to help others to express his vision of the game<br /><br />I always told <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zizou</a> that without the people around him, especially his wife, Véronique, he would not have achieved all the feats that he has. That support is crucial for him. I remember talking to <a href="bixente-lizarazu.html">Bixente Lizarazu</a> about the headbutt at the 2006 World Cup and Liza said that if he had spoken to <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zizou</a> before the final, as he had done before the <b>[last-16]</b> match against Spain, he could have helped remove the tension that caused it. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zizou</a> puts so much pressure on himself to do his maximum that he needs a circuit breaker to ensure there is no explosion and that is what the people close to him do for him</p>
