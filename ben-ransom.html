  <p><b>[Ben Ransom assessed whether United could challenge the likes of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title next season]</b> I think they still need a couple more players. At some point, a big player will get injured. At some point, <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> would have to have a slight dip in form, so they will need players to take the pressure off them particularly if they are playing in the Champions League again<br /><br />I think they probably still need one central defender to take the pressure off <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> and <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Victor Lindelof</a>, and I know there is talk of <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a> coming in maybe, but if they can add a <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>, or someone who gives them another option in that final third, potentially a <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a>, someone to come in, be rotated, find their feet in that unit, and add goals, they will become dangerous<br /><br />Then it’s about consistency. One criticism you could have of <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s tenure so far is that he has these tremendous runs, go unbeaten for long period, and then they have a few sticky results. We’ve see what <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have done in recent years; you have to win almost every single game. That’s how tough this league is now!<br /><br />I’m not sure United are quite at that level yet, but a caveat to all of that: they are much, much closer to where they were a year ago!</p>
