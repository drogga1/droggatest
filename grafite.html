<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Grafite: Brazil ready for Germany and the world - with or without Neymar]</b> Wolfsburg was a special chapter in my career. 2009 was the year I reached my physical, technical and mental peak. We won the title and I was the top scorer and won the player of the year award. It was everything I’ve always dreamed of.<br /><br /><b>[Brasil Global Tour lands at Berlin’s Olympiastadion]</b> It’s just another match, even though the Brazilian press has been talking a lot about Brazil’s reunion with Germany. I don’t see a tense atmosphere, nor should it be faced with any sense of rivalry. Tite is preparing this side and the players very well. Of course, it will be tough, hotly disputed, but it will be no rematch<br /><br />Today, Brazil are ready for the World Cup. Since Tite took over a year-and-a-half ago, the team have really grown, both technically and tactically. Neymar is our star, but the team is now a collective and can make up for his absence. Of course, he will be important for our chances of winning a sixth World Cup, but the team now looks ready. The Selecao are set for a great World Cup. I don’t know if they will be champions, but they are going to compete for the title. It’s just that in Brazil only winning matters - finishing second or third means nothing. I think they have a great chance of reaching the final<br /><br /><b>[On Dani Alves]</b> Dani has a great history with the Selecao. He’s always been an extrovert, playful. I did not know him personally before World Cup 2010, but I met him during our preparations for the tournament and he always treated me very well. He was always very fun, he had his group, but he was always good, playing with us. I hope he can lift the title for us<br /><br />Look, for today’s game, I think Brazil will win. They’re motivated, well-prepared, and Germany will not have all their strongest players. I think Brazil will win 2-1, 1-0 or 3-0.</p>
