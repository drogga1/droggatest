  <p><b>[Transformative <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> has galvanised the squad]</b> He has been absolutely transformative, I do not think we can underestimate or overstate just the effect he has had on the psychology of the squad, the confidence, he has become their reference point so easily. I remember <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> saying in his first training session that he just walked in there and took responsibility and he knew from then that he was a natural leader. In terms of the numbers and his influence in the final third, that has been staggering. But more so, just how he has galvanised that squad. It is not an underestimation to say that in the last few years, he has probably been the biggest and most promising thing to happen to United. And the other element to him is that while he is so individualistic, he has made his team-mates better. But also, every time he speaks, it is all about the collective and in terms of everything, he is looking like the perfect fit and I think he walked into a club that really suited his stylistic attributes and also, they needed someone to come in and really be the main man, to be that lighthouse. And he has done that</p>
