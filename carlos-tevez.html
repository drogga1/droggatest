I never condoned drugs or murder, and luckily I was able to make a choice. Everyone decides for themselves what they’re going to do. He had everything he needed to be just as successful, but he chose a different path - criminality and drugs - and that ultimately meant that he is no longer with us. I truly believe that everyone chooses their own route through life, and he - and this has nothing to do with luck - chose the easier option</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Tevez has admitted he does not know what he will do at the end of the Chinese Super League season]</b> I left not to hurt Boca. Honestly, I do not know what I’m going to do at the end of the year. If I’m not hungry for glory, it’s very difficult to stay in the club. I have to find myself to go back, I know I gave then everything.&lt;br&gt;<br />When I left, my silence bothered journalists more than people. The press wanted me to say goodbye with a note, they are difficult. For me it was not easy either. Boca fan always wants to see me with that shirt. First - when the millionaire offer came from China - I said no, I had Boca in my head. The final decision was in the last game, with <b>[partner]</b> Vane. I did not want to hurt the club. Flor, my eldest daughter, went down to the dressing room asking me not to leave. It was easy to stay, the fans love me, but I did the difficult thing.<br /><br /><b>[Tevez revealed that he speaks to Boca’s owner Daniel Angelici every week]</b> He always advised me as a son and I speak once or twice a week with him. I am grateful. Unfortunately for him, he had to advise me as a friend and told me to think about the family</p>

When Leo was starting out, he didn’t touch a gym. But Cristiano was there in the morning, afternoon and evening, all the time. Cristiano had to work and prepare himself to be the best, while for Leo it comes naturally. Those are the greatest differences that I see between the two best players on the planet.

  <p><b>[Carlos Tevez believes a five-time Ballon d’Or Lionel Messi will be looking to add to his haul of 128 caps]</b> I think Leo has to think about himself. He has to think that, if there is not a project that makes him happy and in which he feels comfortable, it is very difficult to take the responsibility of leading Argentina to become champions by himself. We are wasting a lot of time not having him happy and not being able to give him a hand to achieve that target. I think we are wrong in not being able to help him feel comfortable. As a player and as an Argentine I tell him that we need him, that he must try to rest, that he keeps a cool head and that we need him. We need him because he is the soul of Argentina and, as long as he continues playing football, it has to be that way because he is Argentina’s biggest idol and he has to take that responsibility. Now <b>[I tell him]</b> to rest, keep a cool head and try to be well, then we need him to take charge and on the pitch.</p>

Cristiano always stopped in the gym after training: for him it is an obsession and, being the best in everything, he always arrived at work early<br /><br />When the training was set for nine in the morning I arrived at eight and he was already there. Even if I arrived at 7:30 he was already there. I began to ask myself, ‘How can I get rid of this guy?’ So one day I arrived at six but he was already there! Sleepy, but he was there</p>

We are not in the same despair as those who live with kids every day, who have to leave their house at six in the morning and return at seven in the evening to feed the family. We are not an example in this case; yes in other things. We have to be there and help. It is easy for me to speak from home, knowing that I have food for my children. But desperate people, who cannot move and cannot leave the house. That is worrying<br /><br /><b>[Tevez also insisted clubs must do everything to support their communities]</b> The clubs have to get involved. Instead of going to train in the morning, they <b>[should]</b> demand that you do things for the people. For example, go to the dining rooms in La Boca. I would be delighted to go. I know that my family is fine. That’s where the great example begins. You can make videos, like me at home from my living room, but the great example would be that we all go out and help<br /><br /><b>[Tevez hopes one positive impact of the pandemic will be people becoming more supportive of each other, regardless of wealth]</b> There are no shirts here.

It came to me and obviously bothers me, but it should be discussed privately. Nothing happens, I understand the situation. If we have any difference with the subject of the contract we cannot make it public. It would be nice to fix it behind closed doors. There is not much that we have to fix, as I always said. In a negotiation, one has his position and the other has his and both are valid. I want to go well with Boca, not fighting with anyone but I’m also not going to let you disrespect me<br /><br />There are some changes, the contract will be until December instead of one year. But I’m going to continue, obviously, I want another chance at Libertadores. The contract that Boca offered me, I will donate everything to a non-profit organisation. Contract and bonus, so you’re going to have to lend me some money for gasoline. It will be for people who need vaccines, for soup kitchens. I don’t want to see any silver</p>
