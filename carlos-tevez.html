  <p><b>[Carlos Tevez on his former <a href="boca-juniors.html">Boca Juniors</a> strike partner]</b> I can say about Martin Palermo that I have never felt so secure with any other player. I didn’t happen with <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. He gave me a confidence that nobody else has given me. He is a phenomenon - he has his own God watching out for just him. That is why the fans love him so much</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Tevez on the death of his best friend and former team-mate Dario Coronel]</b> Drugs and murder were part of everyday life. I never condoned drugs or murder, and luckily I was able to make a choice. Everyone decides for themselves what they’re going to do. He had everything he needed to be just as successful, but he chose a different path - criminality and drugs - and that ultimately meant that he is no longer with us. I truly believe that everyone chooses their own route through life, and he - and this has nothing to do with luck - chose the easier option</p>

I’ve never seen him train to stop the ball or those exercises. It is all natural to him, but on penalties he trained - first he did not take them and now he shoots them all at the corner. Cristiano always stopped in the gym after training, for him it is an obsession and, being the best in everything, he always arrived at work early</p>

  <p><b>[Boca ‘Bad Boys’ Tevez and <a href="juan-roman-riquelme.html">Riquelme</a> call a truce to bring glory days back to Bombonera]</b> On the pitch <b>[Riquelme]</b> was an idol but he leaves a lot to be desired off it. When <a href="juan-roman-riquelme.html">Riquelme</a> had to leave Boca, he left. He went to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and then <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>, then he was out of contract, came back to Boca and had to win the Libertadores so Boca would buy him again. It’s easy to talk from the outside and one of the things <a href="juan-roman-riquelme.html">Riquelme</a> is criticised for is that when Boca lose and River win, he comes out talking<br /><br />I spoke to Roman, as I have always said we owed each other a chat between the two. We fixed things in five minutes, we told each other the things we had to say, something which will remain private, but stay calm, everything is good</p>

He also helped me a lot to find that Carlitos, this is the reward. Roman in the box, me making a goal. I knew I had to kiss Diego, I was lucky that way…sometimes you have to look for luck<br /><br />I was hungry for glory again. I think I felt again that I had to go back to my neighbourhood, that I had to get off a lot of things and fight like the kid who fought when I was a kid. It was two or three years of fighting against my head, against a lot of things. I always kept working, trying to get out of that well, it was very difficult for me to get out, to get back to my roots. It was as I was telling you, I needed to go back to be hungry for glory. I found myself at the right time</p>

Like a kid recently beginning. That was fundamental</p>

  <p><b>[Tevez: Footballers can live for a year without being paid]</b> A footballer can live six months or a year without receiving <b>[wages]</b>. We are not in the same despair as those who live with kids every day, who have to leave their house at six in the morning and return at seven in the evening to feed the family. We are not an example in this case; yes in other things. We have to be there and help. It is easy for me to speak from home, knowing that I have food for my children. But desperate people, who cannot move and cannot leave the house. That is worrying<br /><br /><b>[Tevez also insisted clubs must do everything to support their communities]</b> The clubs have to get involved. Instead of going to train in the morning, they <b>[should]</b> demand that you do things for the people. For example, go to the dining rooms in La Boca. I would be delighted to go. I know that my family is fine. That’s where the great example begins. You can make videos, like me at home from my living room, but the great example would be that we all go out and help<br /><br /><b>[Tevez hopes one positive impact of the pandemic will be people becoming more supportive of each other, regardless of wealth]</b> There are no shirts here. Social class does not matter. We all want to help. Hopefully the world will be more supportive. We are realising that we are all the same. Hopefully we grow as a society and tomorrow this has changed the world for good. This virus teaches us that. Hopefully it is for the good and that we are all one and come out of this together</p>

  <p><b>[Tevez wants Boca stay but open to <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> return]</b> If I had to go back to Europe I would go to <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> for six months to be applauded. Or spend six months at Corinthians. I won’t rule anything out because I don’t want to be a slave to my words.<br /><br />I hadn’t heard or seen anything. It came to me and obviously bothers me, but it should be discussed privately. Nothing happens, I understand the situation. If we have any difference with the subject of the contract we cannot make it public. It would be nice to fix it behind closed doors. There is not much that we have to fix, as I always said. In a negotiation, one has his position and the other has his and both are valid. I want to go well with Boca, not fighting with anyone but I’m also not going to let you disrespect me<br /><br />There are some changes, the contract will be until December instead of one year. But I’m going to continue, obviously, I want another chance at Libertadores. The contract that Boca offered me, I will donate everything to a non-profit organisation. Contract and bonus, so you’re going to have to lend me some money for gasoline. It will be for people who need vaccines, for soup kitchens. I don’t want to see any silver</p>
