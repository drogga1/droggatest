  <p><b>[Swedish journalist Alexandra Jonson on <a href="alexander-isak.html">Alexander Isak</a>]</b> It’s a comparison we’ve heard in Sweden as well, as there are a few similarities. The way <a href="alexander-isak.html">Isak</a> broke through from nowhere so quickly as a teenager in the Swedish league - it hasn’t been seen since <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a>. Then, he became the first player to break <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a>’s transfer record in the Swedish league when AIK sold him; simply put he is the biggest talent we’ve seen since <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a>. But personally I think the comparisons should end there. It’s more of a lazy thing to compare him to <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> just because he’s Swedish. There are some similarities but I believe <a href="alexander-isak.html">Isak</a> is a very different player to <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> and definitely a completely different type of personality. But I don’t think the comparisons affect him. He is a very down-to-earth guy, very calm and none of this is new to him. I talked to him at the Bernabeu and asked him how he handled the spotlight, the whole of Spain talking about him, fans singing his name - the kid’s only just turned 20, and he shrugged his shoulders and said ‘I’m used to it; it’s my normal.’ It doesn’t bother him at all<br /><br />There’s definitely a lot of excitement (in Sweden). This is what people have been expecting from <a href="alexander-isak.html">Isak</a> to come with time, but maybe not this quick. Anyone who’s seen him play knows he’s a special talent. While I don’t think anyone is surprised, it’s impossible to not be shocked with what he is doing right now; we are watching Swedish football history. And don’t think any Swede can get enough of this. They had a question on one of the biggest Swedish newspapers website the other day: ‘Who is the best Swedish striker right now?’ <a href="alexander-isak.html">Isak</a> beat <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> by a landslide. This is something special in the making and I think we are all aware of that</p>
