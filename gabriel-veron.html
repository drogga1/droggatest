  <p><b>[Gabriel Veron: Brazil’s teenage star named after an Argentina legend]</b> It was our neighbour’s idea. He’d always wanted a son but ended up with three daughters. So, when my parents couldn’t decide on a second name for me, our neighbour said: ‘Why not call him <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Veron</a>?’<br /><br /><b>[on Juan Sebastian Veron]</b> He’s an idol for me. I promise I’ll keep honouring our name on the pitch</p>
