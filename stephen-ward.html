<blockquote>
  <p>[Burnley defender Stephen Ward says that he does not expect Michael Keane to leave the club amid rumours the defender is set for a return to Manchester United] I haven’t heard anything yet, but I wouldn’t expect him to,. If Michael goes, we’re going to have to sign someone because we’ll only have three centre-halves.<br /><br />[On Kevin Long] Kevin will have a chance. He’s shown he’s a good player and it’s great for him to come in here and it’s given him a lot of confidence. It’ll be a good battle for him next year. He’s done great. He’s had to wait his chance at club level with the two centre-halves doing so well. As I say, injuries happen in football unfortunately, and he’s gotten his chance in the last few games and done really well. It’s great for him to get a couple of caps here. I’m sure he’ll be delighted with that and hopefully a big season ahead for him as well<br /><br />[Ward also discussed the possibility of Burnley boss Sean Dyche leaving the club] I think you’d have to ask him to be honest. Obviously he’s done a great job at our place, so we wouldn’t want to lose him. He’s going to get linked here and there because he’s done a good job. It’s difficult for us to know, so you’ll have to ask him</p>
