  <p>[Leicester land £13m Filip Benkovic from Dinamo Zagreb amid Harry Maguire to Man Utd rumours] The feeling is amazing to come to such a big club. It’s a big honour to wear this jersey [for the] club. I will give all my heart to this club, to all the fans, to everybody. Hopefully we’ll have a very good result this season. The ambitions of Leicester City are so big. I like the club very much and I think it’s a very good step for me to the next level. I’m very happy to be here. On the pitch, I do my best. I fight for the club and that’s all I can promise to do. The fans will see what I have and fully hope I will do a good job<br /><br />I’ve watched a lot [of Premier League games]. This is the league I like the most. I like this kind of football and I’ve followed Leicester a lot. I’ve seen so many top games. They’re very good and they have such a good team. I have very [big] ambitions and I think the Club have very big ambitions. I think that we can do well together. As a team, we can do some big things</p>

  <p>[Filip Benkovic has revealed that he decided to join Celtic in search of regular minutes] I was in Leicester for three weeks, everything was great, I really have no objections to anything. Everyone worried about me, let me know how much they valued me, but, for me, the most important thing was to play. I didn’t want to be at Leicester to be on the bench. I talked to the coach, told him how much I respect the club, but I want to go forward day-by-day, and that can only be with games. I’m young, I need minutes and the coach agrees with my decision.<br /><br />I’m sure I’ve done well, I just want to play as much as possible, so a one-year loan has been agreed and Leicester has the option of me coming back in the winter. There were other options for a loan, one Italian, one Spanish and one German club, but I just wanted to be at Celtic. That is why I think this will be the best preparation for my return to England and the Premier League, I’m so happy with this option. My great career goal is to play as many games at the highest level, and that is for sure the English league. I’m aware of how much work I have to put into my game to make progress. I want to return to Leicester as soon as possible, but to return with the Premier League standard</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Leicester City loanee Filip Benkovic has dedicated his goal for Celtic against Hearts to the late Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha] The past few days were very heavy for Leicester. It is still hard to accept, the man was great. I met him while I was in Leicester and I saw what kind of a man he was: so modest and honest, despite all the millions he had. I don’t have words to express my sadness after this tragedy. The least I could do was to dedicate my goal [in the 5-0 win over Hearts] to him.</p>
