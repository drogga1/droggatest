  <p><b>[Stephane Guivarc’h says France need to be starting with <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a> as a central strikerwith <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a> and <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> moved into wider posts]</b> His entry against Australia made the second goal possible. I think that without him we would have failed to break down the opposing defence. He is a focal point. He knows how to make himself available. He can allow his team to move up the field quickly and help the midfielders to win time and space. There are often two opposing defenders on his back and the others can take advantage of that situation. Even if they know how to finish the moves, I think that others like <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> or <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> must play as wingers so that the attack is more coherent</p>
