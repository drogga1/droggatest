  <p><b>[Former Bolton Wanderers striker and Croatia international Ivan Klasnic is praying for a happy ending to his kidney hell as he waits for a third transplant that could save his life]</b> I thought I’d have a shorter life or something. I have to accept the fate of it is, go on dialysis, but maybe it’ll come and there’ll be a happy ending. And that would be that successful third transplantation and me no longer having to go on dialysis. The hardest part is that my mother lost a kidney, and I am grateful to my parents a lot.<br /><br />I’m no expert, or doctor, but I could see that something was wrong <b>[with their therapy]</b>. They have to see too. My mother’s kidney was installed, but something was wrong<br /><br />I’m a football player, and football players are superstitious. So I did not want a new operation carried out in Bremen, even on the same day. We did it on Friday in Hanover instead. I wish for the new kidney and life without difficulty</p>

  <p><b>[On Thomas Tuchel]</b> He’s a tough guy and I’m definitely not alone with that opinion. He has 11 players he works with intensively. He does not like players who question things or give their opinions. He has his favorite players, who adapted well. That’s how it appears to me anyway.</p>
