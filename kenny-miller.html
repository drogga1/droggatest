  <p><b>[Former Scotland striker Kenny Miller believes that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> youngster <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> should be fast-tracked into the senior national team set-up]</b> I know him really well and I know what the boy’s about, I know his abilities. <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> will be one of the best players in the national team once he gets there, there’s no doubt about it. In days gone by, people said you had to go through the proper steps before becoming a full international. But look at England and what they have done in the last few years. <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a> started an England game before he had started a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> match. I think we could be getting <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> in now and there’s probably a few others. I know he’s been away with a few camps training and it is a huge step - and especially without first-team football - but we need to get these guys in to progress. England can do it. Wales have done it. Can we fast-track him? I also believe you have to have earned that right, but there are exceptions</p>

  <p><b>[Former Rangers striker Kenny Miller says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> starlet <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> has been billed as a special talent]</b> He is special. A special talent. He was 14 or 15 at the time and floating about Murray Park you’d see him playing and your eyes are just immediately drawn to him because he demands and his abilities are there to be seen. He’s in the right positions, he makes the right passes and that’s the thing that sets the top players apart from good players, and then good players from not so good players - decision making. His decision making is just…<br /><br />I genuinely say, and I don’t mean any disrespect to anyone in the dressing room, but see when he came into training with the first team, his decision making was better than some players in our team. And that’s not a slight on anyone, that’s how good he is, at that age, at that level. The kid has got it. They won 7-0 one day and they had a decent team with Dapo (Mebude) and those two were the exceptional performers and probably a lot better than that level. They are sitting in the indoor hall as we are walking out that way to go on the bus so I pop my head in and ask the score.<br /><br />Wee Billy says, ‘Seven nil’. I said, ‘Oh right, decent game’. and he replies, ‘Easy’. I said, ‘Okay, brilliant. Who scored?’ and he says, ‘I scored’. ‘You didn’t score, you don’t get in the box’. ‘Aye I did, it was a penalty!’ I walked out and thought, ‘He’s got character and personality. He’s got a bit of baws about him’. And that is the huge, huge difference about him.</p>
