  <p><b>[Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov believes England have ‘bigger’ racism issues than his own nation]</b> What I can say is that I don’t think we have a problem. In the Bulgarian championship, we have a lot of players of different ethnicities and skin colour. I don’t think that we have this big problem like, for example, England do<br /><br />What I meant was that in the Bulgarian championship we’ve not had such problems while there have been incidents in various levels of English football involving racism, which I consider something normal because it’s a big country with a very diverse population. But we don’t have this problem in Bulgaria, I can assure you of that</p>

  <p><b>[Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov questions racism incidents against England]</b> I personally did not hear the chanting that you are most probably referring to. I saw that the referee stopped the game. But I also have to say that the unacceptable behaviour was not only on behalf of the Bulgaria fans but also the English fans, who were whistling and shouting during the Bulgarian national anthem. During the second half they used words against our fans, which I find unacceptable<br /><br /><b>[Balakov said he felt an increased focus upon the potential of racist incidents]</b> We’ve had this problem ever since England were about to come to Bulgaria. All I’ve heard for three weeks is people talking about anything else but football. I don’t think this was the proper manner to prepare and to play a football game. For three weeks, everyone was talking about one thing. If this turns out to be true, we are truly sorry and we as the Bulgarian national team and the <a href="bfu.html">Bulgarian Football Union</a> are working very hard. Nobody wants to see this but let me tell you that this really has not happened in our games up until now. This happened now in the England game. If something can be proven then we are sorry but we cannot speak on behalf of some fans here<br /><br /><b>[Popov’s move was widely interpreted as a call for discriminatory chants to stop but Balakov told a post-match news conference he felt the Rostov midfielder was responding to complaints over a poor performance]</b> I have no idea about this. If our captain spoke to the fans it is probably because they were unhappy about the way in which the team were performing. The whole topic in the build-up to the game – the fans are emotional. You want me to say this and I have to say this, if something happened I’m sure it really was a small group of people who really were out of their minds because this is unacceptable … if it happened, of course</p>

  <p><b>[With the match halted twice in the first half after England players complained about a spectrum of abuse including monkey chants and Nazi salutes]</b> If our captain, Ivelin Popov, spoke to the fans, it was probably because of the way the team was performing, and the whole topic in the build-up to the game<br /><br />I didn’t hear anything. If something happened, I’m sure it was a small group of people who were really were out of their minds because it was unacceptable, if it happened of course. I also have to say the unacceptable behaviour was not only on the behalf of Bulgarian fans but also the English fans, who were whistling and chanting during the national anthem and used words against our fans in the second half which I found unacceptable</p>

  <p><b>[Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov has apologised after initially saying he did not hear the racist abuse directed at England players during Monday’s Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia]</b> I condemn all forms of racism as an unacceptable behaviour that contradicts normal human relations. I think that this form of prejudice should be buried deep in our past, and no one should ever be subjected <b>[to it]</b>. I have trained many Bulgarian teams with players of different origin and never anyone judging by the colour of their skin. In addition, I have always participated actively in all initiatives involving privileged people or those who need to be involved.<br /><br />My comments before the game against England that Bulgaria did not have problems with racism is based on the fact that the local championship did not see such a problem on a large scale. There may have been individual cases, but it’s definitely not something you see at the stadium. The majority of football fans do not participate in this kind <b>[of behaviour]</b>, and I believe that this has also been the case in the game against England.<br /><br />I would like to say very clearly: since there were cases of racial discrimination in Sofia, I would like to sincerely apologise to the English footballers and to all those who felt offended. At the same time, however, I would like to address everyone who uses hateful language on social media, that my words have been incorrectly removed from context - and if that does not stop, I will be forced to take legal action against it</p>

  <p><b>[Krasimir Balakov has resigned as head coach of Bulgaria four days on from the 6-0 Euro 2020 qualifying loss to England that was marred by racist abuse]</b> The performance of Bulgaria’s men’s national team in recent months has been described as unsatisfactory, which is why the national coach Krasimir Balakov resigned, which was accepted by the members of the <b>[executive committee</b></p>
