  <p>[Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay might be best known for his foul-mouthed rants around kitchens but the star was close to becoming a professional footballer] I did very well. I was a naturally aggressive left-back, a cut-throat tackler. You may have got past once but there was never, ever, ever a second occasion. And I was fast, I was a great 100m sprinter. If you were to compare me to anyone, I guess it could be <a href="stuart-pearce.html">Stuart Pearce</a>.<br /><br />[He played for Oxford United and was spotted by a <a href="glasglow-rangers.html">Glasglow Rangers</a> scout while playing a youth match] My dad was a Rangers fan and fantastically proud of me. But it was hard and very stressful. Never knowing if you were going to make it. I was petrified most of the time. The games were really violent, not like the football we see nowadays</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Although Gordon Ramsay had claimed to have played for the first team on three occasions, this sparked controversy as it appears the claims were inaccurate] Gordon has always down-played his footballing past and been clear about the fact that he never made it to be a professional. As detailed in Gordon’s autobiography, Humble Pie, Gordon was a promising schoolboy who was monitored by Rangers over a three-year period during his school holidays when he attended their Youth Policy. During this time he played a couple of non-league matches as a trialist. A knee injury put paid to any further hopes of being signed by <a href="glasglow-rangers.html">Glasglow Rangers</a>.</p>
