  <p><b>[On Marcus Rashford]</b> I don’t think anything was expected of him. We’ve got to be very honest here, he was chucked in at the deep end when the injury crisis up front was such that there was no one else to go with. But the way he’s addressed it is absolutely fantastic, he’s been a revelation. I think any young players, especially at Manchester United, will look at that and say ‘If I get an opportunity I’d like to take it just like him’.<br /><br />What’s Marcus, 19? He’s nowhere near the peak of his powers now, I think we all know that and appreciate that. Just to watch him improve week-in, week-out, and just to watch him learn off the other boys, I think he will get his opportunity at centre forward when the time is right, but to learn a little bit off the left and every now and then he might come off the right, I think that adds strings to your bow</p>

He’s legendary.<br /><br /><b>[The 1999 Treble winner said on the pressure of being a goal-getter at United]</b> I had to keep United at the top. Now Romelu has to get them there but that buys you a bit of time. If I didn’t cut it, I’d be on the bench. Mind you, if Romelu doesn’t, United can go out and buy a new striker<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether he is surprised at the impact made by Lukaku]</b> No. He’d done it in the Premier League for the past five seasons.

I think he will end up as a centre-forward. I just think at the moment having Lukaku in the team and obviously Zlatan <b>[Ibrahimovic]</b> coming back as well, I think it’s good. He will learn off the left because when he becomes a centre-forward he will have the full package.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on how far Rashford could go in the game]</b> That’s up to him. I get asked this all the time and I think that’s down to the individual and how far they want to go. You look at Rashford at the moment and he wants to extend himself to be as good as he can be, which is very, very good. In football, when you are young and you keep learning and you want to aspire to be the best, you never know where he can end up<br /><br />I’m hoping he <b>[Martial]</b> is going to be there a long time. If you look at the talent that kid’s got, it’s absolutely frightening. He’s got great feet, scores goals and creates goals. He’s had his ups and downs with the manager already but I think he just wants the arm around the shoulder - a bit of loving and you’ll definitely get the best out of him</p>

  <p><b>[The return of Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Manchester United will bring the best out of Romelu Lukaku]</b> I’m excited. I was fortunate to be in that position at United, having other players after your place and that competition brings the best out of you. I have no doubts it will bring the best out of Lukaku. He expected Zlatan to get fit at some stage. He started the season very well. He has found it difficult in a few games because the team didn’t create a lot of chances, and the team didn’t play as well as it could have, but I think he will be okay. I definitely think Zlatan will bring the best out of him.</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez may be trying too hard to impress as he struggles to produce his best form at Manchester United]</b> Alexis Sanchez is a superb player. I think sometimes when you try too hard to impress, to give too much, sometimes it goes against you. Arsenal play a different way to United however you look at it. You have got to consider those factors when you look at it. The lad is playing the same way he did at Arsenal even though United are playing a different way but I’m sure it will turn around for him.<br /><br />You know what, 0-0 in an away game is a very tough result. A lot of people will say that is a good result but it’s not. In that competition, in my time under Sir Alex Ferguson, he always believes in getting an away goal because it counts double. So 0-0 is a dangerous position. People will talk about Sevilla not having a goal-scorer but it doesn’t really matter, Sevilla made a substitution and they got two goals. Once you concede an away goal you’re up against it. I don’t think it’s something that Manchester United fans want to see at the moment. Hopefully come next season Mourinho will be able to turn it around, with more chances, more goals and more excitement<br /><br />Every team has got to judge themselves against Manchester City, who have been fantastic. It’s a difficult one to judge. I saw Mourinho’s quotes about City having another go in the summer and it will be even tougher to close the gap. If I’m a Man Utd fan it would be a difficult pill to swallow. Everyone has got the opportunity to improve next season and everyone wants to close the gap. If you’re saying that City are going to elevate themselves even further, then everyone else might as well just not bother!</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku’s debut campaign at Manchester United following a £75 million move has been hailed as top drawer]</b> Lukaku has had a very good season. I think it has probably been a lot tougher than he would have thought and now he appreciates that you can’t have a weekend off at Manchester United, which he could have done at his previous clubs Everton and West Bromwich Albion. Here, you can’t afford to do that. But he has played the majority of games and that says a lot about him. He has not been injured and, for his first season, I think he has been top drawer.<br /><br />It is difficult to be a lone striker and especially if you don’t get the service at times. It could be described as the graveyard shift because it is very, very tough. Sometimes people have questioned Romelu this season and said he has not done this or that, but you have to be brutally honest: if you don’t get the service as a lone man then it is very, very tough. That is why I keep saying he has done very well this season. He has already got himself 26 goals in his first season playing for United as a lone striker. I am not saying we create a million and one chances for the boy either. He has done really well and fair play to him for his goal return. You can see the development in us. But we have to brutally honest and say the other part of the city has been absolutely fantastic, with the football they’ve played, and the fact they’ve only lost one league game this season says it all. It is a gap that needs to be closed and hopefully next season we will do. If we do finish second then we can look at it as a positive, even though finishing second is not what everybody wants to see at Manchester United. But it is a positive compared to last season</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku has been fantastic for Manchester United this season]</b> I’ve watched him all season, like everybody else. I think he looks fantastic. To get the goals he’s got this season, in a team that doesn’t create loads of chances for him, he’s done brilliantly and really well considering it’s his first season at Old Trafford. It’s not nice when you’ve got that little bit of rhythm and pick up an injury. You know you’ve got a massive game coming up and are a bit touch and go or whatever. So it may be difficult for him but, hopefully, he’ll be passed fit and do the best he can. It’s not every year you’re going to get to the FA Cup final. There are no doubts that, if he’s even 90, 80 or 70 per cent fit, he’ll give it a go.</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd urged by Cole to look to Liverpool and Salah for Lukaku inspiration]</b> If he starts playing to his strengths, and taking advantage of what he has as an athlete - his strength and power - and starts running in behind and stretches teams, you’ll get even more out of him. If you look at what Salah has done at Liverpool this season, a lot goes through him. They play to his strengths. Give the ball to him early doors and he’ll crack on and do what he does and nick a goal. He’s ended up getting 44 goals this season.<br /><br />In the modern game now, all the forwards want the ball to their feet. If you look at the game closely, there could be 20 yards of space in behind, but no-one runs in behind. But I look at Lukaku and I think to myself, ‘Does anyone really want to chase him?’ I really don’t think so. So if he thinks to himself, ‘There’s 20 yards of space in behind, I could give some a yard or two and still beat them to it’. Once he starts doing that and they start doing that… phew!</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United have the same goals]</b> Manchester United still have the same goals. But we have got to be brutally honest, the league has changed again. Manchester United used to dominate, especially in the Premier League and won the FA Cup a few times. To a certain extent now it has gone away from them a little bit. Manchester City have invested heavily, changed manager, brought in a lot of good players and changed the way they play football. Last season they ran away with the league at a canter.<br /><br />It is a case of getting some stability now and finding the formula whereby they can challenge Manchester City over the next couple of years. Manchester City are only going to get better. Liverpool and Chelsea are also only going to get better so the league will become as tight as ever<br /><br />Everyone has got to fear them but you can’t fear them too much. Because if you are going to go into a match with that kind of attitude the game is going to be over before you play it. I know Manchester United will go into the game believing they can win it. A derby is a completely different game</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku lost confidence under Jose Mourinho]</b> Romelu has got to find his mojo again. He has come off the bench and scored two in two, but that mojo comes from confidence. I watched him this season under Jose and I could tell, as a former centre-forward myself, that he was low on confidence. The first thing which starts to go is your movement. Romelu wasn’t moving. You stop making the runs because you stop believing in yourself. I’ve been in that position and I’d watch him making hand gestures about where he wanted the ball to go, but psychologically you don’t really want the ball. It’s all about confidence and when his returns he’ll start scoring.<br /><br /><b>[Cole added on the pressure Lukaku finds himself under at one of the world’s biggest clubs]</b> Rom is a young man who is still improving. If you look at his goals at Everton, he used strength, power and pace to run behind people. If he came to me for advice, I’d say to him, ‘If getting the ball into your feet isn’t your biggest strength, use your pace. Use it, even if you are coming short to receive the ball. You can play one touch and then move again instead of trying to get hold of the ball and fight your touch.’ He’ll be OK<br /><br /><b>[On Marcus Rashford]</b> Marcus is doing well and he has got to keep working on the things that got him into the team in the first place. He kept wanting the ball to his feet, but when he first got into the team it was because he used his blistering pace to get behind defenders. Centre-forwards now want the ball to their feet, but Marcus should mix his game up: Get the ball short but also spin in behind into the space behind defenders</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez has not become a bad player overnight]</b> You never become a bad player overnight. When he left Arsenal for Man United, he joined a team which was totally different. You have to change as a player, which is difficult. His work ethic is the same, but while he has given the ball away too much, it has been because he’s been trying things because he wanted to produce a pass or score goals. He will improve because everyone else has improved since Ole took over. Alexis has got good pace and he never stops running or closing down. He’s like a little kid with a new football who wants to show how good he is. He was like that at Arsenal where he scored goals.<br /><br /><b>[On Anthony Martial]</b> He’s a flair player who needs to have the opportunity to express himself. He would say that <b>[Lingard]</b> is going to be like Jean Tigana. Jesse was a late developer who had many loans, but he’s said himself that he plays better for England than for Manchester United. Maybe he was getting more freedom for England, but now under Ole Gunnar he’s getting more of that. You have to play with freedom. Manchester United have always played with freedom and creativity.</p>

It’s been difficult for him to change. His work ethic, I believe, is exactly the same, yes he’ll give the ball away a little bit too much in trying to do things, to engulf the flame in himself, you know, because he wanted to do the best he could do. He’ll want to score goals, to produce the pass that would bring him to life, or the team.</p>

He was prepared to take in a lot of information and break it down and do what he thought was right with it. Looking at him, he is always speaking about Sir Alex <b>[Ferguson]</b> and what he takes from him and what he is trying to do with the players. That’s what the manager used to do with us. He was always talking to us to get the best from us. You can see Ole does that because after every game he is on the pitch with the players. A lot of the modern-day managers are doing that.<br /><br />Everyone wants to get the best from the players so you have to put your arm around them and show them that they are important to you. How do you keep your job? You have to win matches. If he continues to do that then nobody can turn around and say you shouldn’t get the job because he hasn’t done X, Y and Z. If this continues and Manchester United beat PSG <b>[in the Champions League]</b> and win midweek against Burnley then I don’t think you can look any further. He is gaining experience and winning matches and that is what everyone is asking him to do..</p>

Arsenal over the previous years, when Wenger was there, did that. You’ve got to play your best players when you need them, and Ozil is one of Arsenal’s best. If you asked Lacazette and Aubameyang: ‘Do you want Mesut to play?’ they’d say yes all day long, all day long! It’s really, really strange<br /><br />Is he injured? Is he ill?

  <p><b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> should be appointed as permanent Manchester United manager]</b> I think it’s more than changing the mood and the feel-good factor, what he’s done has galvanised not just the players but the whole football club. Man United are playing like Man United now, scoring goals, playing attractive football. Questions were asked last week when they lost to PSG but he’s put those questions to bed again with a comfortable result against Chelsea <b>[in the FA Cup]</b>. I can’t see any reason why not to give him it. I’ve been asked this question quite a few times and I keep saying managers, like <b>[Mauricio]</b> Pochettino, have been touted for getting the Manchester United job, they’ve had to learn somewhere to get to the position where they get touted for the job. Ole’s done that. Fair enough he had a difficult time when he was at Cardiff, went back to Molde, but since he’s come to Manchester United the run they have been on has been unbelievable. If you listen to all the players, the way they talk about him, they want to give him the job. Players are always happy when you are winning football matches and you’re comfortable, you’re playing well and you’re playing the way you want to play. Ole has given everyone the opportunity to do just that, especially with Paul Pogba. The way he’s playing, he’s playing like the Paul Pogba of old, what everyone was expecting from him. I think he’s got a great opportunity to get the job.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if ties to the club are important given the struggles of previous coaches]</b> I’m starting to look at it now and say ‘yeah’ because you’ve got to understand the ethos of the club. I don’t think anyone should be able to go to any football club and change what that club has been built on. It’s an institute. The three managers that have come in have all tried to tinker a little bit and they’ve all fallen short. Ole has gone in there and done everything what Manchester United are used to.

He has gone in, he has galvanised the club, they’ve got results at the right time<br /><br />His staff have had a lot to do it with as well. Bringing Mike Phelan back was essential.<br /><br />We all know this is possibly the most important appointment since Sir Alex left. When people are talking about Manchester United finishing in the top four of the Premier League and it’s time to celebrate, I am scratching my head. That’s not something to celebrate. It is Manchester United. For me you celebrate winning the league, getting to the European Cup final or winning the FA Cup, or whatever. It’s a massive appointment and if Ole does get the job, no doubt he will know just how tough it is to try and propel the club forward and be competing with Manchester City and Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United will need Champions League football if they are to stand any chance of luring Gareth Bale]</b> I think Manchester United should be going for all top players of that calibre. That’s what Manchester United is about. Do those players want to come to Manchester United? That’s the question. If Manchester United miss out on Champions League football… top players want to play Champions League football. When you are playing at that elite level, it’s not all about money. People think it’s all about money, but you speak to players at elite level. Do you want to play Champions League football or do you want a few more quid? They will say Champions League, because they want to win it - it’s a special competition. So if Manchester United miss out on Champions League football, it becomes difficult for them to attract players. It can be tough<br /><br />Manchester United should qualify for the top four season in, season out. It’s not about competing for top four, it’s about competing for the Premier League title. It is as simple as that. Sometimes we overlook that scenario when we think finishing in the top four is like winning a trophy. For Manchester United it shouldn’t be like winning a trophy. To win a trophy, you have to finish top</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United need to build around Marcus Rashford]</b> What I like about Marcus Rashford, he’s got all the ability in the world. But you could tell under the previous manager <b>[Jose Mourinho]</b> his confidence was waning lower, lower and lower. Ole’s gone in there and he’s said to him ‘we all know how good you are, just believe in yourself’ and he’s done that. When he first got in the team, you knew what he could do. He kind of went away from that a little bit, confidence and whatever. Now he’s back at what he’s good at. I think Marcus came out the other day and said he’s prepared to sign a new contract now, so he’s telling everyone he wants to stay. Not for the short haul, for the long haul. You’ve got to build your players around the local boys. I was fortunate to do just that during my time at Manchester United. He’s definitely going to be one of the mainstays of the football club.</p>

I can’t see that changing, because they’ve already spent big money on centre-forwards. Will they add another one? Most probably they will, because to win the championship, to win anything you need to score goals and you need as many goals you can get in the team.

The way a lot of teams play now, there are not many balls knocked into the channels for a forward to get hold of and try to knit things together. Everything is usually played in front of you. I get frustrated sometimes when you see a striker not prepared to make a run in behind when there is 20-25 yards of space. He wants it to his feet and I’m pulling my hair out. If you force them back, by the time you have done that they don’t want to run in there anymore so you’re going to get your space anyway. Everything is now to feet, to feet, meaning that you have got to mix it up as a centre-forward<br /><br /><b>[Cole went on to say of playing with two up top]</b> The benefit is that you play off each other. I was comfortable playing like that because whoever I played with, I was confident of playing in a partnership as two individuals. For me, growing up, that’s what I was used to - with someone else up front or someone just behind. It does make life a little bit easier for you, especially if that partnership works well</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a>’s contribution at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> leaves Andy Cole feeling ‘really pleased’]</b> I am really pleased with him. When you come to a club like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> as a centre-forward, everyone expects you to score straight away, but it takes a little bit of time. And like Odion said himself, he wasn’t fit and was just coming in from pre-season in China. I think he has done pretty well when he has been given the opportunity, he has applied himself really well in the club and has scored four good goals, four centre-forward goals, you can’t ask for much more<br /><br />I had a lot of football heroes. When I started supporting <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, <a href="dwight-yorke.html">Dwight Yorke</a> and Andy Cole were my heroes. It is a great privilege for me to play at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, where great players like <a href="dwight-yorke.html">Dwight Yorke</a> and Andy Cole have played. They were great strikers and scored a lot of goals. So I would watch their movements, the way they played, the way they created space for themselves, watching the way they met crosses behind defenders. I learned all of that and it has helped me a lot in my football career</p>

It’s like Formula 1, once one team starts to close the gap it seems another team does something to find a little bit more. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are going to win the league for the first time in 30 years, you turn around and think ‘how the hell has it taken this long’, it’s because the gap continues to grow and grow. What it will take? Four, possibly five players, then with performances the gap starts to close and the confidence grows.<br /><br />I think it’s about the winning mentality, we always had that winning mentality, training was fierce but the camaraderie was fantastic, it was unbelievable. We all had the same goal come the end of the season and that was to win. Once you have things like that it’s half the battle</p>

  <p><b>[Cole is among those to have been impressed by Fernandes]</b> Mentality, that’s massive in football. Confidence as well. Once you’ve got your confidence people start believing in each other. We can talk about Fernandes coming in, he’s done extremely well and it’s looked like he’s galvanised the rest of the players as well to start playing their A-games<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on whether one player can impact an entire squad]</b> He’s done it, he’s started to bring the best out of a few of the other players, which is important<br /><br />Ole is starting to implement his plan now, which is good. If it does get itself upright again hopefully they can finish really strongly, there’s a good possibility they can still finish in the top four and Champions League football is going to be needed for a club like Manchester United</p>

If you look at teams at the top, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, if you look what they’ve got, they’ve got more than one striker. During my time at United there was more than one striker, if you want to be a team that competes at the highest level you need more than one.<br /><br />Of course that partnership with him (Yorke) made me thrive and we were good friends which helped. But Ole made me thrive too, we want to get in the team but ultimately we want to learn off each other. You marry all these things in and that can only push you on as an individual and make you better and that would happen in the squad now if another striker was brought in<br /><br /><b>[<a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a>’s loan deal expires at the end of the month and his future remains up in the air]</b> It’s not my decision whether or not they should keep him. But I have been really pleased with him and he’s done well. He has scored when he has come in to the team and he’s doing what they ask of him but ultimately it’s going to be down to what other business United want to do in the summer and how it fits in with that</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Man Utd star Andy Cole opens up on mental and physical battle of kidney failure]</b> To say life is different now is an understatement. I was talking to some of my old team-mates the other day and I told them it’s been the toughest five years of my life. I don’t think we really consider how much our health means to us until something happens and it’s opened my eyes to a lot of things as well. You realise the people who are prepared to stay around and those who aren’t. I’ve learned a lot<br /><br />I genuinely believed I could beat it at the start. Because of my sporting background and my mentality, I thought I would be okay. My mindset was that I would take it like an injury and I’d come back stronger. I would be alright and I’d be back in six months and I shouldn’t worry about it. I was being a typical man and telling myself to man up. Once I realised I wasn’t going to beat it I had to tell myself that I was ill, very ill, but even saying that I still didn’t want to accept it<br /><br />Adapting for me was always going to be difficult, I’m used to doing things, and with no half measures, so I found it hard that I couldn’t do things the way I wanted. It was the first time my body had dictated what I could and couldn’t do, rather than the other way around, so that was tough. I had to accept my body couldn’t function the way it used to. Then there’s the mental games I was playing with myself. Coming from a sporting background you always want to push yourself to the limit. I always wanted more from myself and when I realised I couldn’t give any more I found myself getting really frustrated and questioning myself<br /><br /><b>[One of the events Cole could not play a full part in was the Treble reunion game between United’s side of 1999 and their <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> counterparts at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> in May 2019]</b> We had spoken before the game and everyone knew where I was at. Some of the boys were a bit disappointed for me because they wanted me to play a bit more, but mentally and physically I knew I couldn’t do it. It was nice for me to be able to be involved but on the flip side I’m still disappointed because I wanted to play. These are the things I have to try and accept<br /><br />I know what I want for myself and I always set myself goals of where I want to be and what I’m expecting from myself. I don’t like to accept defeat and there have been times where I have thought I’ve failed mentally. But it’s not a case of failure it’s more frustration about not being able to do what I want to do<br /><br /><b>[Cole’s experiences have pushed him into setting up a fund to help others]</b> I was inspired by the people I’ve come across and I just want to try and help anyone that’s in the position I’m in, or have been in. Naturally I want to raise as much money as possible but also to raise awareness. People don’t understand what the illness is. They think you just get better but that’s never going to be the case. All the medication messes with your system. Last year I was picking up chest infections for fun<br /><br />Covid is difficult for a lot of people, but I don’t sit around rocking thinking about it. I’ve had the possibilities of illness for the last five years, so I have to work with it. Before we had to close the season down with the pandemic we were really starting to pick up and play well and look like the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> of old. Ole <b>[Gunnar <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> has done really well. I have spoken to him a few times and he’s really enjoying it and genuinely believes he could take United forward. There was a bit of disappointment from everyone we had to call it quits at a time when everything was going well and with the way we were playing, but saying that, there are more important issues going on in the world, and that’s what we need to appreciate</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Cole says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is a top player &amp; can inspire <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>]</b> Before this season came to a halt, United were doing extremely well. They started to play some really nice football, win some games, and were cracking on in their bid to try to get fourth spot. I’m really happy to see Paul back, I think he’s a top, top player. Regardless of all the shenanigans around him, when he gets his head down, he constantly proves how good he is. Fernandes, what he’s done since joining in January is absolutely phenomenal. I’m looking forward to seeing him and Paul play together in midfield. This has been Marcus’s best season, playing in his preferred position, and hopefully he can come back fit and well and have no more problems with his back. So I’m looking forward to seeing all three of them play together.<br /><br /><a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a> didn’t want his loan to end and go back to China. For me, he brings something different to the team. He gets hold of the ball, he runs into the box, he wants to score goals, and he can get scruffy goals, which is something United haven’t had for a while</p>

I’m not gonna lie, I nearly wet myself! This is the guy I’ve watched for years. I’m talking about a baller, a straight baller.
