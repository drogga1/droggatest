  <p><b>[Speaking at an event for supporters in Singapore on Sunday night]</b> I’ve been captain for some games.

It’s my ninth season, I feel like one of the most experienced players. I need to show that on the pitch and try to help the young guys know what Manchester United means and that’s important<br /><br /><b>[De Gea was at fault for some crucial goals, letting a Lionel Messi strike past him against Barca]</b> We have to improve a lot. We are Manchester United, we need to fight for trophies. When you put on this badge, that’s what it means - fight for everything, give your best and bring the team again to the top</p>

  <p><b>[David De Gea has warned <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> that they need to be much more switched on against <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> to avoid a repeat of last season’s 3-1 defeat to the Hammers]</b> I believe they have a decent side with some good players who are important to them. They are on the up at the moment, but we still have bad memories from last season, so we have to be much more switched on right from the off than we were then. There are three very important points at stake for us to remain up there near the top, and also for the younger lads to keep gaining in confidence. We also want to show that’s what we’re here for, going away to difficult grounds and going there for the three points<br /><br /><b>[De Gea also saluted the role that the United supporters play in helping lift the team]</b> They are vitally important to us. Our fans that follow us away from home are just incredible. Sometimes it’s just like we are playing at home in those away fixtures! It’s amazing. It helps us all tremendously down there on the pitch, we can always feel the warmth from our fans and that is hugely important to us<br /><br /><b>[The Spain international could face compatriot Pablo Fornals at the London Stadium]</b> I know him from the national team, we’ve been called up together in the same squad once or twice. He’s a quality player and I think he can contribute very well for <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>. He really showed what he could do at <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> and he has a lot of talent and he’s a top player</p>

That is key, he is a good coach and we will be with him until the end<br /><br /><b>[The goalkeeper is one of the old guard at United now]</b> It is a special club, the biggest in England, and it gives me great pride and pleasure to have been at this club for so many years. I am happy, I’ve been here for a long time and I’m really happy, it’s a wonderful club with extraordinary fans. We have had some tough years but that is why we’re here, to try and help.

  <p><b>[Pointing to a horrendous first-half showing during the 3-3 draw at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> last Sunday]</b> The team is what it is, and results are what they have been recently. It’s true that the first half was horrible, probably one of the worst this year. The reaction of the team in the second half was important, but it’s not enough. We should win these type of games to be on top, we need to win four or five games in a row to be at the top, but at the moment the team is not playing so well. We’re giving it everything, we’re trying to get those big wins that can put us high up in the table, but the truth is at the moment we’re not consistent enough, there’s much to train and much to improve. I don’t think it’s through any lack of effort, the boys are leaving everything out on the field in training and games. You could point maybe to a lack of quality in certain areas, but certainly not a lack of fight<br /><br /><b>[The 29-year-old is now set to remain at the club until 2023]</b> The truth is I feel at home here. There are times when I am in Spain and I’m really looking forward to coming back here, at home in Manchester. We’ve been here for a lot of years and I feel like people appreciate me here, I’ve made a lot of friends and I’m thrilled to be part of this club. It’s been a long time that I’ve been playing here and it’s not an easy thing to keep playing at the highest level and to maintain that level. I personally hope that we can get more accolades in years to come by working hard and playing to that same high level</p>

It’s a derby game, against a top side who have a clear way of playing and like to knock the ball around. With all their pressure you have to be very good defensively. As I say, it’s always a special game and I can’t wait for the game to come around. I’m keen to try and put in a good performance so we can go away with the three points which would be really great for us<br /><br />I have lots of good memories. One or two others not quite so good, but they are always entertaining games to be a part of, full of excitement and tension, tons of commitment and there is always something special happens in these games. Let’s hope that on this occasion the three points stay with us</p>
