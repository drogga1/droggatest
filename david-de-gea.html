  <p><b>[David de Gea has starred for Manchester United over several seasons]</b> Yeah, I’m pretty pleased with my performance. It’s been a fairly complete, all round set of performances from me. I’ve felt good, felt fit and in good form physically throughout the season. Let’s hope that these last few games to go before the end of the season continue the form, then leading into the World Cup, which is an important time for Spain.<br /><br />We’ve got a great manager. He’s very experienced, he’s won everything there is to win in the game. What he is really good at is transmitting his winning mentality to the group. However, at the end of the day, it’s down to ourselves - the players on the field. It is us who make the saves, create the chances and score the goals. So, as a group, we’ve got to get that level of consistency and quality throughout the season</p>

  <p><b>[David de Gea has overtaken Cristiano Ronaldo on Manchester United’s roll of honour by landing a record-breaking fourth Player of the Year award]</b> It’s difficult for words what Manchester United means to me. It’s amazing to play for the club, the history, the fans, everything. It was hard in the beginning, but I believed in myself, I worked hard and I am proud of myself as well. I want to say thanks to everyone. I didn’t expect to win this one. I have four, it’s amazing for me and thanks again to everyone.<br /><br />I think it is special to receive this award from my team-mates, I love all of them. We are fighting for second place and we are in the <b>[FA Cup]</b> final, but we are Manchester United so it is not enough. We have to improve for next season. Of course, it’s good to finish the season with a trophy, especially with Wembley and the fans</p>

  <p><b>[David de Gea has admitted this season has not been enough for Manchester United]</b> It has not been quite enough this season. Fair enough we are battling to hang on to second place and hopefully we will fire until the final game to ensure that happens, but we have not managed to win our initial target which was to win the Premier League title. That is what we are all here for, that is what the players at the club want and also to give a good account of ourselves in the Champions League but we have also not managed to do that. Obviously the FA Cup is very important, a nice trophy to win, and we are going all out to win that. But it is not quite enough - we are Manchester United and have to aim for bigger and better things. That has always got to be our focus. We are here to try and win trophies. The fans and people at the club deserve better and that is what we have to do - fight to win big trophies. Next season is a new season and we have to improve in a number of areas. We have to fight to be involved at the end of the season. It is not just Manchester City we will be challenging next season, five or six teams fight for the Premier League. It is a case of hard work to be in there at the wire.<br /><br />I’m very happy. It’s just incredible. Initially, you don’t imagine yourself winning even one of these trophies but now to have won four is just fantastic. All I can do is thank the fans, thank my team-mates and thank them for the affection they have shown me over the years. Maybe it’s better if a striker who has scored a load of goals wins it or maybe a midfielder wins it on occasions, but that’s football. I think football is evolving and I think the role of the keeper is becoming more and more important in the game in general. That’s just the way it’s turned out this year. Maybe next year, let’s hope a striker can win it perhaps. I was a young lad <b>[when I came here]</b>, new on the block coming from a different country to a different culture. I didn’t speak the language and everything was different; the food and the culture. It was tough and there were some difficult moments, but what I never did was give up the faith I had in myself. You’ve got to trust in your own ability, back yourself and the main thing is work really, really hard and fight to improve. I think looking back and at the person I am today, I’m a better goalkeeper for it and more mature as a person. In terms of a player and person, I’m a much different David de Gea</p>

  <p><b>[David de Gea admits second place is simply not enough for a club of Manchester United’s ambition]</b> I believe that for a club like United, even second place is simply not enough. We have to be fighting hard to win something and we have that opportunity next week <b>[in the FA Cup final]</b>. You get nothing for coming second or getting close to the league leaders. In the end you always have to be fighting to win as that’s what this club and the fans really deserve, and so it’s just that: second place is not enough. This club has an obligation to get through to cup finals, go on to win them, win silverware, and continue to make this club even bigger. I believe that’s the most important thing, always being in the shake-up, fighting to win trophies and battling to keep making United exactly what it is: a massive, massive club.<br /><br />I think it’s been a very complete season for me, my best since I’ve been at the club, I reckon. It’s always good to be able to help out the team, and to try and be at your highest level of form possible to be able to earn points for the team. And that’s the most important thing, to help the team in every way you can and to maintain that level of consistency which I believe is what makes the difference</p>

The important thing is the World Cup and not to think of anything else that can divert you or upset you. You have to be focused on having a good World Cup - we are all good. Hopefully we can go far and win.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether or not De Gea had told his representatives to keep transfer matters away from him during the build up to the World Cup]</b> Football is football and a thousand things can happen. But I’m always calm. Come what may, I’ll be the same. It is important to be focused and be 100%<br /><br />I was more or less hidden ahead the media because there was a time that I have not been treated as I should. Many people have been very unfair to me. Many who have criticised me, but then later knew that they were wrong, and have not given the face and rectified. There are many people who do not deserve to do interviews for them. Nothing else<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether or not the allegations marred the experience of the European Championship]</b> I’m a very calm kid, so it didn’t affect me a lot. But obviously, I have family and people that are close to you who are more affected than me. It’s the past and in the end it turned out that everything was a lie. And there is no more. I knew I had not done anything, that’s why I was calm. The press conference I gave already said that it was all a lie, but everyone followed talking about if I should not be in the national team, what if … In the end, things are shown, it turned out that everything was a lie. I was already calm, but then you remain calmer still<br /><br />It’s a World Cup, you always go with the same desire. It’s the same feeling of doing things well and helping the team, of becoming strong. We are very excited, there is a good team, a good group. We are going with hope. Will I be first-choice? I’m always calm, really. But when you have the confidence of the coach and colleagues, you always go to the field with more confidence and try to help the team as much as possible</p>

  <p><b>[David de Gea claims to be well studied ahead of a World Cup clash with one of the best in the world Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> The first match is always important, and more so when it is against a rival as hard and complicated as Portugal. We have to face the game as we did in the qualifying phase, that is, playing our own game. Cristiano Ronaldo is well studied, and everyone knows he’s one of the best in the world. He also has a great team behind him, they’re European champions and it will be a tough game.<br /><br /><b>[On the criticism he faced]</b> You have to know how to take it and live with it. We’re used to it and we accept it, because criticism is always there. The mistakes of a goalkeeper are very striking, as was shown against Switzerland, but better to fail in a friendly than in the World Cup. I am still young and it’s clear that I can improve. In these matches you get more experience and that’s good</p>

  <p><b>[David de Gea has said that his focus remains on his on-field performances]</b> What matters is the team and all of us being focused on what we need to focus on, which is winning games, rather than contracts or any topics that can be a distraction. What matters is focusing on football. We have an important game against Everton and we have some big fixtures over the coming months. I think that’s what matters, rather than thinking about anything else. I’ve been here for many seasons, as we’ve said. I’ve been at the club for eight seasons now. I’m very happy here. I always feel that warmth from the fans and everyone who works at the club.<br /><br />I think it’s very easy to be focused on what you have to focus on, partly because we have lots of training sessions and play every three or four days. You have to be focused on what’s important, which is the team, winning, doing well in training and being in good shape to give your all. You don’t have time to think about things that aren’t as important as football and the points that are at stake in the games that we have to win and do well in</p>

  <p><b>[David de Gea admits that Manchester United are not enjoying their finest season]</b> I don’t think it’s been our finest season. We have to be realistic. The team has produced some good performances, while others haven’t been so good. I think at times we’ve been relying on moments of brilliance from our attacking players. We haven’t been 100 per cent solid defensively. We are improving, but I think we have to improve in all areas. It’s true that it seems we need to concede for the team to react, attack and create chances. I don’t know the reason why. We have to control games, create chances and improve from the start. We have to improve in every area. We have to look up, get some victories, put together four or five wins on the bounce and get ourselves up the table.<br /><br />I don’t think it’s the time to look into the future. I think we have to take it game by game. As I said, we’re trying to get on a winning run, move up the table as soon as possible and battle to finish as high as we can. I think the key lies in controlling the game, not giving our opponents any chances and being solid defensively. We have to start when the referee’s whistle goes and all be 100 percent focused, particularly in the opening few minutes. We will work well as a team if we do that. We have good players up front. We’ll do what we’ve worked on in training and know how to do. We’ll try to create chances, score goals and ensure the fans enjoy it</p>

  <p><b>[Pointing to a horrendous first-half showing during the 3-3 draw at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> last Sunday]</b> The team is what it is, and results are what they have been recently. It’s true that the first half was horrible, probably one of the worst this year. The reaction of the team in the second half was important, but it’s not enough. We should win these type of games to be on top, we need to win four or five games in a row to be at the top, but at the moment the team is not playing so well. We’re giving it everything, we’re trying to get those big wins that can put us high up in the table, but the truth is at the moment we’re not consistent enough, there’s much to train and much to improve. I don’t think it’s through any lack of effort, the boys are leaving everything out on the field in training and games. You could point maybe to a lack of quality in certain areas, but certainly not a lack of fight<br /><br /><b>[The 29-year-old is now set to remain at the club until 2023]</b> The truth is I feel at home here. There are times when I am in Spain and I’m really looking forward to coming back here, at home in Manchester. We’ve been here for a lot of years and I feel like people appreciate me here, I’ve made a lot of friends and I’m thrilled to be part of this club. It’s been a long time that I’ve been playing here and it’s not an easy thing to keep playing at the highest level and to maintain that level. I personally hope that we can get more accolades in years to come by working hard and playing to that same high level</p>

He is a great finisher. He scored two and could have scored even more goals. We are happy that he is scoring goals for us and playing as he is doing. He is a great player<br /><br /><b>[De Gea added on a welcome victory over <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>]</b> We needed the three points. We played against a very good team with good players and we showed we are capable of winning against a good opponent. We showed that we can play well, that we can score goals, create chances and play offensively. It was a great game for us<br /><br />It’s a massive win for us and let’s see if we can keep this level and keep winning. It’s a special game against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, the derby. Let’s see if we can win there. It’s a tough game but if we show the same as we did tonight, we will have chances to win</p>

  <p><b>[David de Gea admits he committed to a new contract at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> because he wants to help the club land more trophies]</b> It’s a real pleasure to be able to keep playing for more seasons with this club and here’s hoping it’s not just more derbies and more games to come, but also more trophies, because that’s what we are all fighting for<br /><br /><b>[De Gea said of that trip to the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Etihad Stadium</a>]</b> It’s always a special fixture. It’s a derby game, against a top side who have a clear way of playing and like to knock the ball around. With all their pressure you have to be very good defensively. As I say, it’s always a special game and I can’t wait for the game to come around. I’m keen to try and put in a good performance so we can go away with the three points which would be really great for us<br /><br />I have lots of good memories. One or two others not quite so good, but they are always entertaining games to be a part of, full of excitement and tension, tons of commitment and there is always something special happens in these games. Let’s hope that on this occasion the three points stay with us</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> goalkeeper David de Gea has outlined his intention to stay at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> for many years to come]</b> Just to be a part of this club is amazing. So imagine, 10 years, it’s like a dream. It’s great to play games with this club, so I hope I can be here more years, many years<br /><br />I think the whole team improved a lot. We were in a good moment. I think we were in very good, top form. We didn’t concede many goals and, of course, with Bruno he brings a lot of quality. He’s a clever player, a top midfielder. The team improved with him and it was a pity that everything stopped because we were in a good moment, but hopefully with some players that were injured will be fit when it all starts again, so it will be a good challenge for everyone</p>
