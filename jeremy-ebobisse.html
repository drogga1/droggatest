<blockquote>
  <p><b>[MLS must back up anti-racism message]</b> The same people I’ve sat across from in class and in locker rooms complaining that I always make things about race, that I’m too serious all the time or, worse, that I’m being dramatic, are the ones all of a sudden posting about how awful or surprising this is. It’s hard to take when I’ve spent countless hours defending Trayvon’s humanity, as if my own, or reminding people that Tamir Rice was a twelve-year-old boy caricatured into a man, as if that somehow justified his killing. I’ve seen the same people posting tributes to George Floyd changing their tune from when they were denouncing or ignoring Sandra Bland, <a href="michael-brown.html">Michael Brown</a> and Philando Castile, while some were also concurrently voting to uphold a system that perpetuates the climate responsible for their deaths. But even scarier, as Malcolm X warned us of the South being anywhere south of Canada, I’ve seen our ‘allies’ turn their backs on us the second that dismantling systems of oppression meant changing their lives to instil the lasting change we are talking about. I’ve seen too many people, too many times, leverage these tragedies into social capital that they can wear as a badge of honor to assuage their own internalized racism<br /><br />I wait for the day – along with my black brothers and sisters and the allies that have already made the commitment to us, themselves and society – that fighting for racial justice becomes about more than a sporadic tweet that is contradicted by action. In the timeless fight against state-sanctioned violence and discrimination, black people have tirelessly believed in the promise of this nation and pushed it to live up to its ideals. It’s time for more people to join this fight – because this fight needs to be about much more than George Floyd</p>
