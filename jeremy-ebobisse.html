<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ebobisse breaking out at just the right time for Timbers]</b> There were a lot of things last year that made me grow up, but I realized if I didn’t grow up as quickly as I did off the field I’d be jeopardizing my own career. Even now I don’t feel like I’m in a position where I’m super secure at all. The next game could be my last game if I don’t have a good game. I think that drive is something that’s been instilled in me in the last 12 to 18 months.<br /><br />Obviously as a youth player you’re usually one of the best players on your team if you’re going to make it to the pro level, and there’s not as much of a threat of losing your spot. Coming in and sitting on the bench is a new experience for a lot of us. Some of us don’t react well. I definitely had some rough days where maybe my attitude wasn’t as good off the field, because when I get to training I put all that aside, but everything that’s happened has made me become a better pro<br /><br />Mentally it was a lot last year and even at the beginning of this year. Anyone who’s not playing, whether you’re on a first-team deal playing with the second team, or just on the bench, it’s a lot to deal with. We’ve got a good group of young guys here that are always pushing each other to be ready. It’s a cliche. You never want to hear it when you’re not playing because you feel like it’s never going to come. But we’d be doing ourselves a disservice if we’re not pushing ourselves every day to get ready, because if that chance does come and we blow it it could be our final chance. You never know when it’s going to come again<br /><br />I acknowledge that sometimes subconsciously maybe I didn’t put in my best games with T2 and that’s one thing that I had to look at myself in the mirror and say that’s not good enough. If I was going to get chances with the first team I knew I had to find a run of form with T2 and that’s what I started to do toward mid-to-late September. The most important part of T2 was that I was able to keep match fitness and sharpness. For young MLS players, we don’t always see the opportunity to go down to USL. We’re frustrated because we feel we should be playing with the first team, but it’s important to find a way to get whatever you can out of it. You have to find a way to enjoy it. I definitely had some rough moments with T2, even this year, that made people wonder if I’m up to the level to train with the first team<br /><br /><b>[One person keeping close tabs on Ebobisse was Timbers boss Giovanni Savarese]</b> Even when I was out of the picture, he still took interest in my development, in how I was playing with T2 and how I was training. Even if we’re doing a small-sided game he’ll be watching, always on top of things. Even when you think he’s not looking at something going down in training, or missed something that you did in training, he’s there and he’ll bring it up at some point. His awareness of the players and different personalities and what goes on in training is teaching us a lot<br /><br /><b>[Ebobisse has found a strong connection with Valeri and Sebastian Blanco]</b> They make the game very easy. It’s just about finding ways to make sure I’m in a position to help them. If they’re content with my positioning on the field chances are I’m going to reap the rewards. These guys will find you with the ball, it’s just about being smart enough to be in their minds and go where they expect me to be<br /><br />Coming into last year, being behind a guy like Adi and seeing how vital his hold-up play was to our attack, I realized that that was something that would be expected out of me. I’m not a big, imposing figure like him, so I knew that I was going to have to put a lot more work in and the coaching staff last year helped me a lot with that, just bumping me with dummies and making sure I was strong holding onto the ball. Slowly, but surely it’s become a little bit more natural. It’s not anywhere near where I want it to be, but I’m becoming more and more comfortable and I’m giving myself more things to get better in game situations<br /><br />There’s more to soccer players than the product on the field. Once I take off the shirt I am who I am, unapologetically. I put a lot of thought into what is put out on my social media, but I do think there are messages that do need to be spoken about. There’s stuff that means a lot to me and at different points in my life have had a different effect on my development. I wasn’t always like that, but when I went to college there were a couple of incidents that made me hyper-aware of some things I had been shielded from. It just made me think that if I had been shielded from it, then how many other people <b>[are there]</b> like me who don’t know what’s going on. No matter how far I go in my career, I always want to stay true to myself and speak my mind. I don’t think players are required to do anything like that, but I would appreciate if more players spoke about that kind of stuff. Representation is important and we need leaders in these social issues. And if young kids see a professional who they admire talking about these issues then chance is he’s going to think about it a little bit more than if it were his teacher, for whatever reason<br /><br />People put their mind and opinion in everything. Everything is so intertwined, it always has been in this country, so I think ‘stick to sports’ is really irrelevant. The ‘stick to sports’ crowd is pretty particular. The kind of people they want sticking to sports is very selective<br /><br />It’s mostly about staying grounded mentally, knowing that I need to take everything step by step. Knowing there’d be ups and downs, but that I was obviously out there for a reason. I just need to keep believing in myself and find ways to complement the other guys around me. I think that’s also been super important. Finding a way to link up with Valeri as much as I can, get on the end of Blanco’s crosses, and then defensively do all the things they ask me and then the rest will take care of itself</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="mls.html">MLS</a> must back up anti-racism message]</b> The same people I’ve sat across from in class and in locker rooms complaining that I always make things about race, that I’m too serious all the time or, worse, that I’m being dramatic, are the ones all of a sudden posting about how awful or surprising this is. It’s hard to take when I’ve spent countless hours defending Trayvon’s humanity, as if my own, or reminding people that Tamir Rice was a twelve-year-old boy caricatured into a man, as if that somehow justified his killing. I’ve seen the same people posting tributes to George Floyd changing their tune from when they were denouncing or ignoring Sandra Bland, <a href="michael-brown.html">Michael Brown</a> and Philando Castile, while some were also concurrently voting to uphold a system that perpetuates the climate responsible for their deaths. But even scarier, as Malcolm X warned us of the South being anywhere south of Canada, I’ve seen our ‘allies’ turn their backs on us the second that dismantling systems of oppression meant changing their lives to instil the lasting change we are talking about. I’ve seen too many people, too many times, leverage these tragedies into social capital that they can wear as a badge of honor to assuage their own internalized racism<br /><br />I wait for the day - along with my black brothers and sisters and the allies that have already made the commitment to us, themselves and society - that fighting for racial justice becomes about more than a sporadic tweet that is contradicted by action. In the timeless fight against state-sanctioned violence and discrimination, black people have tirelessly believed in the promise of this nation and pushed it to live up to its ideals. It’s time for more people to join this fight - because this fight needs to be about much more than George Floyd</p>
