  <p><b>[<a href="giovani-dos-santos.html">Giovani dos Santos</a> wants to stay at <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a>]</b> Gio wants to stay here. He knows that this year was a complicated year. He had the misfortune and bad luck of not being able to play a lot of games<br /><br />We always talk about it; we want make history with this club. God willing next year will be good for the both of us. We want to lift the Galaxy from where it’s at now<br /><br /><b>[Giovani’s contract runs out at the end of 2019, while Jonathan still has three years on his. If Giovani leaves, it wouldn’t necessarily mean the midfielder follows]</b> I think Giovani has to be here, he’s a great player, he’s an important player for us. I missed him and the whole team missed him a lot this past season. I would not depend on that decision on whether the team no longer wants Giovani in the Galaxy, I do not think that would happen.<br /><br />For me, Giovani is a player who has to be here. He has to be the best player on the team next season and show the great player he is</p>

  <p><b>[Liga MX, MLS announce Leagues Cup tournament featuring teams from both leagues]</b> I think it will be a one-of-a-kind experience for me just like for the club, the league. I think it is important for the growth. I think it is important to be seen worldwide. Liga MX is growing, too. I think it was a good decision to put this together</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="gregg-berhalter.html">Gregg Berhalter</a> watched his team attack Mexico’s defense relentlessly in the first half. Managing tempo was something the Mexican team did very well, and that played out in the second half, when El Tri alternated between patient stretches of possession along with the targeted attacking forays of <a href="rodolfo-pizarro.html">Rodolfo Pizarro</a>, Jonathan Dos Santos and Andres Guardado]</b> In the first half they pressured us a lot, and fouled us a lot, the game was very even. In the second half they didn’t have as much, we dominated the entire second half, created chances and we deserved the victory</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan dos Santos believe Mexico can do better after the 4-0 loss to Argentina]</b> The errors were on us, in getting the ball out of the back. The whole game they were in our half, and they took advantage of any mistake to go on the counter-attack. They had attitude until the end of the 90 minutes</p>

But it is true, he has that offer on the table <b>[from Barcelona]</b>. I don’t know what he’s going to do. He’s very happy in Los Angeles, he had a spectacular season, but <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> looking for you is a very nice opportunity. I’m happy for him. As a Mexican, I hope this possibility can be given<br /><br /><b>[Vela admits that he would be open to a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> switch]</b> Who could say no to playing with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> for four months and then coming back to LA? Enjoy, learn and then come back home</p>
