  <p><b>[After Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid replaced Giovani dos Santos with Servando Carrasco at halftime and shifted Jonathan dos Santos into his brother’s playmaking role]</b> I felt real good. I’ve always been accustomed to playing a bit more advanced than the positions I normally play. I like playing there a lot. Certainly, when I’m playing deeper, I like playing more alone, and I like to have control of the game. In the end, I’m very comfortable playing with Perry <b>[Kitchen]</b>, with Servando, and with Gio, who plays well up front when I’m behind him.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico fans in particular are worried about Javier Hernandez]</b> Like <b>[Osorio]</b> has said, it’s every player’s job to look after ourselves. Everything counts for professional players, and I believe that now the work done off the field is very important, if not one of the most important things.</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan dos Santos confident Giovani will make World Cup ‘at 100 percent’ despite injury worries]</b> We’re very hopeful to get this ticket to Russia. We’ve been dreaming about it for a long time. The most important thing is we’re recovering from our injuries. Giovani was able to get some minutes today, I’m recovering my level and there are still, I think, 20 days until the World Cup. I think we’re going to arrive at 100 percent.<br /><br />Honestly, I don’t think about it much. I think our hope, our dream is still intact. We think this can be a great tournament for us as well as the national team. We have great players. But it’s true that anything can happen. I could be left off the list or Vela is left off the list. Everything can happen in this life. You never know. But, our mentality, hope and dream is to go, have a great tournament and make our dream come true</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan Dos Santos puzzled by Osorio critics]</b> Every squad he’s had, he’s had for a reason. He knows a lot about football, he knows what he’s doing, he knows why he puts every player in the position he does. I think the criticisms they’re just, well as they say, they’re f*cking up. So, I think that showed today. The only bad thing I see is now they want to get on the bus, the people who were criticizing this whole time. But he’s calm, he’s good, he’s happy and he’s already thinking in the next training session that we’re about to have in 10 minutes. After the game, he was panning what we could train on. We’re happy for him, because this victory is more than deserved.</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan dos Santos says it was difficult to wait for his World Cup debut]</b> It was tough to take because a player likes to play and enjoy football. Those are the decisions that get made, though. The manager tries to put out the best XI and I was training at 100 percent at all times to get this opportunity. The opportunity came, but we weren’t able to get to the fifth game.<br /><br />I didn’t play many minutes. I was hoping to play more, but at the end of the day it was a beautiful experience. It was my first World Cup and I’m happy to have been with great teammates with a great manager and I hope to play in another World Cup with more participation<br /><br /><b>[Osorio rejected the Mexican federation’s attempts to convince him to stay on for another cycle]</b> I don’t know if it’ll be a Mexican or not, but I hope he feels the colors and loves Mexico. I think there are really good candidates. You hear about Piojo, Almeyda who are really high-level managers and have done really important things with their teams. No matter who it is, I think they have to be very committed to the national team</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="giovani-dos-santos.html">Giovani dos Santos</a> wants to stay at <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a>]</b> Gio wants to stay here. He knows that this year was a complicated year. He had the misfortune and bad luck of not being able to play a lot of games<br /><br />We always talk about it; we want make history with this club. God willing next year will be good for the both of us. We want to lift the Galaxy from where it’s at now<br /><br /><b>[Giovani’s contract runs out at the end of 2019, while Jonathan still has three years on his. If Giovani leaves, it wouldn’t necessarily mean the midfielder follows]</b> I think Giovani has to be here, he’s a great player, he’s an important player for us. I missed him and the whole team missed him a lot this past season. I would not depend on that decision on whether the team no longer wants Giovani in the Galaxy, I do not think that would happen.<br /><br />For me, Giovani is a player who has to be here. He has to be the best player on the team next season and show the great player he is</p>

I have to keep working, keep working in my club which is what is going to get me selected for the Gold Cup and allow me to keep doing my small part for the team.<br /><br />I was hoping to play more, but at the end of the day it was a beautiful experience. It was my first World Cup and I’m happy to have been with great teammates, with a great manager and I hope to play in another World Cup with more participation</p>
