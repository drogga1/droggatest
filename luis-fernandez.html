In Spain, they love these players who have gone down in history, who show an affinity with their club. As a player, he won the European Cup. Then he became a coach, and he won them another European Cup. Imagine what the name <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> means in Madrid! He’s a Real legend</p>

  <p><b>[BeIN Sports pundit Luis Fernandez agrees <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a>, the anti <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> antidote]</b> He loves his players. He is exchanging, talking, seducing and showing affection to the players. And for them that is essential. On the other hand, we see that they love their gaffer as well<br /><br />I really value Emery, he is a hard worker but never succeeded in imposing his style. At <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>, he played with a 4-2-3-1, and in Paris he stayed with the classical 4-3-3. He never managed to get out of it because he never established this connection with the players. Unlike <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a>, who convinced them to follow his ways<br /><br /><b>[Even if changes are sometimes guided by circumstances (injuries, suspensions, absence of a holding midfielder), it is first and foremost, a basic principle with <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a>]</b> He is always looking for switches, even during the game. He never stays with his arms crossed. Players can feel when a coach has an impact on the game or, at least, tries everything to control or reverse a difficult situation</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Fernandez talks about <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>. Football too often getting in the way of his party lifestyle.

We will see whether the trauma from that match can be overcome against <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. The club’s bosses expect to reach the final.
