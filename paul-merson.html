This is a four-year project now, a four-year project and about £500m to get anywhere near back to where they were.<br /><br />You’re going to get a Man United situation when Sir Alex Ferguson left. The next manager will come in, it won’t work out, they’ll get rid of him within a year. Then another manager will come in. Things can’t get any worse to be honest. They’re sixth and that’s where they’re going to be. Surely it couldn’t get worse than that. I look at the other teams and no one is going to catch them, I don’t see anybody else coming above Arsenal in sixth. But this is Arsenal Football Club and they’re becoming an also-run, an also-run. They’re Everton, they’re Everton. We’ve had this with Everton for the last 15 years. They’re the next best team out of the top six, they’re not going to get any better, and this is what’s happening with Arsenal</p>

The nearest Liverpool have ever come to winning the league for a long, long time is when Brendan Rodgers was in charge. He’s done nothing wrong at Celtic. To do what they’ve done, people can say it’s Scottish football and Celtic are head and shoulders above, but every team they played on that run treated it like a cup final, which is difficult sometimes - especially when you’re Celtic and know you’re better than everybody else. But I think he now needs a change and needs to come back down <b>[to England]</b>. I’ll be shocked if he didn’t get a good job. I’d be quite shocked if he didn’t get the Arsenal job.</p>

Antonio Conte is on his way out, but I can’t see the owner spending bundles of money in the summer. I can see Eden Hazard and Thibaut Courtois leaving. These are worrying times for Chelsea. I don’t see any way back for them. I think they’re going to be also-rans again next season. Other teams have come flying past them and will only get stronger. Tottenham and Liverpool are already ahead of them. Manchester United will spend big again. I don’t see City dropping out of the top four either, so Chelsea could be out of the Champions League for years to come in my opinion - just like Arsenal.<br /><br />Allegri might help. He’s a good manager. But he comes from a league which is nothing like ours and there are no guarantees he will be a big success. It’s not the manager you have to worry about though. It’s the owner. He doesn’t seem to want to back his team in the transfer market. It’s a big worry because that Chelsea team isn’t good enough and whoever takes over from Conte in the summer is going to realise that pretty quick</p>

  <p><b>[Rafa Benitez is the latest candidate to be mooted as a possible successor to Arsene Wenger]</b> I like Benitez - he is one of the top managers. I just think Arsenal <b>[fans]</b> want to see entertaining football, and I know this might sound a bit silly, but they want to see teams who go out to win football matches. Benitez sort of sets his teams up - even at Liverpool - not to get beaten, and you go from there. Arsenal fans are staying away at the moment because it’s not entertaining enough, and I think they will need someone with a little bit more flair. They need someone with longevity - someone who will get a four or five year contract and stay there - because you don’t want a Manchester United situation, where they change the manager many times quickly after Sir Alex Ferguson<br /><br />I think he’ll be a manager somewhere else. He’ll get a job in two minutes when he leaves Arsenal. He’ll want to manage again. I look at Arsene Wenger and football is his life. He will manage again. That is the problem for Arsenal. When he does go, he could come and haunt them, because wherever he goes he could go and do something special like he did at Arsenal</p>

Liverpool nearly won the league under him which they hadn’t done for some time before and haven’t since. People say he had Luis Suarez but you’ve still got to get a tune out of him. He’s got experience of managing big sides as well. There’s a lot of pressure at Celtic and he knows the Premier League well.</p>

  <p><b>[Mikel Arteta and Massimiliano Allegri may be the wrong choices to succeed Arsene Wenger at Arsenal]</b> Personally, I think Arsenal would like Mikel Arteta to get the job but I’m not sure the fans would have that. He has never managed before and doesn’t have much experience. I still think Brendan Rodgers is the ideal candidate. He plays the right kind of football and has proved he can handle the pressure of a big job<br /><br />They are obviously looking at Juventus boss Max Allegri, and there are plenty of Arsenal fans who would love him to take over, I’m sure. But that’s George Graham football. Keep it tight and nick a goal. The Italian way. It won’t be free-flowing. It won’t be the sort of football Arsenal fans are used to<br /><br />Wenger will carry on. It’s all he knows. He doesn’t have anything else in his life apart from football. He won’t be able to say no to another job. Everton? It wouldn’t surprise me if he ends up there because he will think: ‘I’ll show you, Arsenal’. It might appeal to him to take another Premier League job and stick it to his old club. If he went to Everton and things went well he could end up finishing above them! That would be a nice way of showing them they were wrong to push him out the door before he was ready. But I think two years at Paris St-Germain trying to win the Champions League before he retires would suit him better. One last big challenge like that and then he could probably move upstairs and put his feet up. I’m sure they would let him, they love him there</p>

  <p><b>[England have a clear path to the World Cup semi-finals and should not be afraid of Colombia]</b> I watched Colombia the other day and there’s nothing to be scared of there for England. They are dangerous at set plays but we are as good as anybody at set plays. I was sat there watching the Belgium game saying please don’t score! If we don’t get to the last four I’d be shocked. At the start of the tournament, we were saying that if we’d get past the quarter-finals it’d be great but if we don’t get to a semi-final now it won’t have been a very good tournament<br /><br />I’ve always said we’ve had a chance but at the moment I can’t see past Brazil. However, from here if we don’t reach the semi-finals you have to class it as disappointing. The route we’ve got now is Colombia, who have been poor and had James Rodriguez limp out of the Senegal game. Then it’s Sweden or Switzerland. No disrespect to the two countries but if you can’t beat them you are not winning World Cups</p>

  <p><b>[England got found out at World Cup 2018]</b> I’ll be shocked if England end up winning the next Euros. It’s even harder to win than the World Cup because there is more quality in that tournament. In the cold light of day, we only played three games against teams who are any good and we lost all of them. England got found out really and you could see it in the play-off game against Belgium. They’ve just got better individual players than us. People say it’s a young team and it will get better but so will everyone else. Belgium’s front three will be in their prime at the Euros and they will have more chance of winning it than we do. That’s why this tournament should ultimately go down as a missed opportunity for England. We came so close to reaching the final and may not ever get as good a chance of doing it again.<br /><br />Kieran Trippier has done his reputation a whole lot of good. He was one of the players of the tournament for me. Harry Maguire grew into the tournament as well and has made a name for himself now. But he looked tired at the end. And Jordan Pickford has done well. People were asking questions about him before the tournament but he’s answered every one. I think he’s only going to get better and should be the No.1 for years to come. But apart from those three no one has really stood out.</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil and Arsenal showed during their 2-0 defeat to Manchester City that they still lack mental strength]</b> If you want to keep on coming along making money and finishing fifth or sixth, nothing has to change. But if you want to break in, get to that level, it’s going to need a better mentality of player; I don’t think the players are mentally strong enough. I don’t see it - when it went 2-0 and the picture panned away and Bernardo Silva ran to the crowd, it was like Laurel and Hardy with Mesut Ozil, ‘that’s the end of that game’. They just seem like a lovely bunch of lads, not even Granit Xhaka is getting them to come on - you never see it with Arsenal.<br /><br />I don’t consider it a re-build, the new manager has taken over a club in almost a perfect environment. The players have a good attitude. I expected a little more on Saturday, they had a big change, and after 22 years it’s different if something is new, of course. It could have been my grandmother in charge, or whoever, but it’s still new. I don’t agree that after 22 years it takes a while to improve - the 22 years were great, and Arsene has invented the best football in the country, probably across Europe. Pep Guardiola took him as a role model in his best years, maybe 10 years ago. In this 22 years, it was a period of success. Not the ultimate success, and in recent years not the biggest success with missing out on the Champions League, but it has been a great time altogether</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil and Henrikh Mkhitaryan no longer fit the Arsenal mould]</b> He <b>[Emery]</b> hasn’t got the players to have a 20-yard gap between defence and attack, working hard. Ozil and Mkhitaryan are not those type of players. If you were building a team tomorrow, you’d want to play a high pressing game, work as a team, not to have gaps between the lines, and you’re not buying Ozil and Mkhitaryan. If you go the Arsene Wenger way, wanting to play entertaining, free-flowing, great football, then Ozil and Mkhitaryan will walk in any team in the world. But they will not get in teams that want to press! I don’t know if the current crop have gone past being able to learn that way of playing. That’s my concern. I don’t mean regarding their age, but in the way they play the game. Ozil’s future? I don’t know. I’m a big fan of him, he’s a quality player, but sometimes you watch him and the game passes him by<br /><br />Let’s be honest, if Arsenal had put the chances away against Chelsea - and it’s easy to say: ‘Oh that’s a half chance’ - but they had five unbelievable chances at Stamford Bridge. If they put those away, they come away from the Bridge winning 7-3, and everyone would be saying: ‘Wow’. I thought Emery took a bit of unfair stick from the first game against Man City. Who expected them to beat Man City? But on Saturday, you can’t legislate for misses like that, you just can’t. You could have Mourinho, Sir Alex, Wenger, Klopp and Pep on the bench; if you’re missing chances like that you won’t be winning too many games</p>

I think he’s struggling at Man Utd.<br /><br />I think Ozil made him look very good last year. Ozil didn’t run around and Sanchez did. The first thing people would say about Sanchez was, ‘He doesn’t half work hard’. You should work hard anyway<br /><br />When he was at Arsenal, he was the top man. Everything went through him. Plus, you could try things at Arsenal. That’s not the case at Old Trafford. You saw Mourinho at Chelsea with Hazard, if you’re not following the full-back or you’re not defending, you’re coming off or you’re not playing next week.

Ramsey’s going to keep playing where he can because he’s a good player. Unai Emery is not going to chop his nose off to spite his face, which I like. I know Ramsey hasn’t been playing from the start but Emery does turn to him a lot. He turns to him almost straight away when he needs him like against Tottenham and Ramsey delivers.

He gets around people, closes players down, gets everybody fighting. He’s not a natural passer, but he sets the tempo. I’ve said all along, for years and years; Arsenal are one of the best teams in the world with the ball. But for the last four or five years they’ve been one of the worst in the world without the ball. He has changed that. When Torreira gets around people, it’s a domino effect, and everybody else rallies and gets around the opposition players. And his attitude is great; he leaves nothing on the pitch and gets stuck in. He gets people going. He’s done absolutely outstandingly well, and came up with two massive goals in the last couple weeks.<br /><br />Liverpool wouldn’t buy him tomorrow morning, I wouldn’t have thought any of the top four would. He can and will get better, but he’s done great. They needed it, we all knew that, Arsene Wenger knew it but he was too stubborn to go and get someone. He could be playing at Southampton and wouldn’t get a mention, or Burnley. No-one would mention it. It’s just that Arsenal needed it so badly</p>

So many midfielders start off well, winning the ball and playing it simple, and then they get carried away and start trying to spray Hollywood passes everywhere. Jordan Henderson does it all the time. But not Declan Rice. He just kept getting it and giving it. He always found the right pass. That shows massive maturity for someone so young. It was really impressive. It might sound simple, being able to do that. But people don’t realise how much discipline it takes. Fernandinho is brilliant at it for Manchester City. He never over-elaborates. For a kid of his age to play like that on his England debut is outstanding. I thought <b>[Rice]</b> was man of the match against Montenegro.

For all his faults, he is still a match-winner. He’s not going to score you a goal but he could make you one for somebody else, probably Alex Lacazette. Arsenal can’t afford to be too gung-ho, but they could leave <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> on the bench just in case they need a goal late in the game.<br /><br />They probably could have won that game 7-2 they had so many chances and a week later it could be the same game the other way around.

But if you can’t defend a two-goal lead away from home you don’t deserve to be in the semi-finals anyway, so I think they will go through. I think they have to get through the first 20 minutes and quiet the crowd and they should be okay, but this is an Arsenal team that has hardly kept a clean sheet away all season.

Make a decision! When you start worrying about what your players think, you’re in trouble. And why does he need five captains anyway? <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are one of the biggest clubs in the world but I don’t think he’s got a clue what his best team is. <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a> started off captain but he’s not a foregone conclusion to start every week. So I’ll tell you someone who should be - <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a>. And that’s why he should be captain. Not as one of five either, but on his own. People look at his mistakes when they should be looking at what he’s won.<br /><br />The guy is a serial winner. Yes, he’s either a nine out of 10 or a four out of 10 every week, but he never hides, whatever happens. I like that. That’s leading by example. Why not make him captain? He always comes across well and he was always a good influence on the young players at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He was a leader there. It’s a big deal being captain of a big club. To have a ‘leadership group’ of five players just devalues it. It’s like you don’t trust anyone enough to do it on their own. And asking players to vote is asking for trouble. What if they don’t take it seriously? It becomes a farce.<br /><br />It wouldn’t happen in a Sunday league team. I’m surprised he doesn’t give the fans a vote as well! <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have had some legendary captains in the past, but it’s also a sign of how the game has changed that he’s chosen to do this. It’s quicker, more technical. But there aren’t as many leaders any more. When you look at the Invincibles, there were leaders everywhere in that team.

In terms of ability and talent he’s the best player at the club.<br /><br />He’s a luxury player, and the manager has obviously decided he can’t carry a player like that in a team that’s already one of the worst around without the ball.

If you’re a football manager and you arrive at a club, the team must improve, and the results have to improve. If they don’t then you won’t be in the job for long.

But there are also massive question marks over his credentials, massive questions.<br /><br />One of the major factors with <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> being linked with the job is that he’s worked closely under <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>, and he used to play at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> legend Merson opens up on depression &amp; addiction]</b> On Monday I’ll have been sober for a year. But this time last year, I wanted to kill myself. One night I seriously thought about ending it all. I was on my own, which is not the best place when you’re down. Isolating yourself, that’s where the illness wants you. It was only because of the kids really, and my wife, and a little bit of consciousness, that I didn’t. Fear probably as well. I was scared to do it. When you’re in that place, you don’t see how it’s ever going to pass. But I have the tools now. If I get into a real down situation, I know it will pass. So when I see this weekend’s FA Cup games kicking off a minute later to raise awareness for mental health I will remember that time when things got dark and think: ‘Thank god that’s not how I feel any more.’<br /><br />It’s only now I know. I have an illness. I have a mental illness. I’ve accepted that now. Before, I used to beat myself up all the time. But the more you talk about it, the more it takes the power out of it. I ring people up and tell them if I don’t feel good. Before, I sat indoors, pulled the curtains, and I’d watch the phone ring. I thought it was me. But as soon as you find out it’s an illness it opens up your eyes to understand you are not a bad person. You are an ill person trying to get well. That’s what I’ve taken out of it - and my life is 100 times better. Don’t get me wrong, I have bad days. But the bad days are better than they were before.<br /><br />If I have one piece of advice to give to people - talk. Nothing ever gets better if you don’t talk. Once you talk to people you start seeing the light. Some people get depressed and don’t even realise it. They just think they’re a bit tired or lonely. They don’t really understand about depression. It does pass - but you have to talk to people. You’re not a bad person. You’re ill and you need to get better. You just have to reach out and talk.</p>

It’s not just the fee, but with players in that price bracket comes a pay packet of around £300,000 a week and that’s just not going to be happening. The landscape has changed not just for everyone on the planet but for football as well. Really big-money moves may be off the table for quite some time.

Teams are going to have to stick with what they’ve got so <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> keeping hold of <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> and bringing him back into the fold would come as no surprise. The other options would be to go and find a replacement and they would have to spend £60m or £70m to do it. I just don’t think clubs are going to do that anymore, and actually, I don’t think people care.<br /><br />The clubs can’t ask the government to pay the wages of their staff and then once this has passed, and hopefully it will, go and spend £60m, £70m and even £80m on players. That’s taking the mick at the highest level! For that reason, I can understand Sanchez coming back to play a part at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> because, on his day, he is a great player. After this, people are going to appreciate things a lot more now - and that includes some of the footballers who get bundles of money and think they can just stroll through.

It all depends how much he is asking for. If he wants £100,000-a-week he won’t get that anywhere. Not in this day and age<br /><br />What happened against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> is not going to help him. His concentration levels are bad anyway but when you play with no crowd it’s even harder. It’s 100 per cent a big issue for him. The fans keep you honest. They keep your concentration levels up. When there’s no crowd your concentration levels dip a little and that happened with Luiz. He made mistakes and got sent off. He’s never going to cut those mistakes out, but if you’re looking at the all-round package, it could work at the right wages. He never hides. He makes a mistake and comes right back again. He came out and said it was his fault. He’s honest, and he’s never out injured. I have a lot of respect for him in that way. I like players who keep demanding the ball even when you’re losing<br /><br />He’s a leader and he would be great with the younger players. The manager obviously likes him. But you don’t want to get on the wrong side of him if you’re the manager, and that’s a problem. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> got rid of him when he was playing well at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. You’d have to sit down with him and tell him he’s not going to play every week because they have some good young players coming in like <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a>. You’d have to make sure he’d accept that because you don’t want a bad apple in the dressing room splitting the squad. If he’s willing to do that then for me it’s a no-brainer to keep him. He makes mistakes but so will young kids coming into the team. I think he will help them. He could start doing his coaches badges there. This lad has got something. You don’t win all those league titles and trophies by making mistakes all the time</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s decision to extend <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a>’s contract is understandable]</b> On his day, he is a proper player and there’s no grey areas, he’s black or white. You’ve seen it at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> where he’s absolutely outstanding and we’ve seen him at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> where he’s been atrocious. But for me, on his day, I think he’s top drawer. If he can help the centre-halves coming through and the youngsters there with his experience, because he’s won everything in the game, I don’t think it’s a bad year. I hear people saying ‘oh get rid of him, he makes mistakes’ - of course he makes mistakes, but he might be able to help other players while he’s there. The one thing I like about him is that he never goes hiding, he always keeps getting on the ball, he’s always in the thick of it and sometimes, that’s probably why he makes too many mistakes. But I can understand where <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> is coming from</p>

  <p><b>[What is going on with <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a>?]</b> I think <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> is a prime example of a player who has to play in a proper team, that is going to be right up there, dominating football matches. He’s got to play in a majorly successful team<br /><br />He can’t play in this <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team, here’s why: he’s not going to change his game now in his 30s, and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> aren’t going to change their game for him. He isn’t tracking back, chasing players, and you need him in a team where you’re getting 70 per cent of the ball each week, and he’ll play. You get players around him, let him play<br /><br />We all know how <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> plays, you give him the ball and he’ll find you. If you don’t have the ball, he won’t win it back for you for love nor money. He’s not interested when they don’t have the ball. How can you give someone £350k-a-week when we all knew that was his style of play?<br /><br />If he hasn’t got the ball he’s one of the worst players in the world! I would say that. Name me a worse player in the world when their team doesn’t have the ball? I’ve never seen somebody so disinterested when they don’t have the ball, but he hurts you at the other end!<br /><br />Can <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> form a team around him? At the moment, it’s at the stage where you can’t do that. They’re not going to change the team for him. He’ll pick up his £350,000-a-week and everything is rosy for him<br /><br />They have to come to a deal with him; maybe he’ll take £200k a week somewhere else. I don’t know how this gets resolved though. Does he want to play football? If he loves football, he has to come to a deal with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, but it’s easy to say that. Nobody wants to lose £150k a week, no matter how much you earn! Who is mad enough to throw that money away, no matter who you are?</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Merson says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> will make <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> winners if they embrace his playing style]</b> I think they’re slowly changing the way they play. When (Mauricio) <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> was there it was different. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s come in and he plays a different way. But if he’d have won that game <b>[against <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>]</b> 1-0, he would have been happy as Larry. He doesn’t want to be involved in 5-2s and 6-3s. He talks exactly the same as (Mikel) <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>. If you’re good defensively, you’ve got much more chance of winning football matches<br /><br />I think he’s just starting to put his footprint on this team and I think they are going to be very hard to beat. They’re not going to be the entertaining team, but that’s the way it is. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has won everything in the game. You don’t go into <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and change your way of playing for players who have never won anything. You make sure that they play your way and you win them trophies. People go, ‘you can’t win like that anymore, winning 1-0 and 2-0’. You can, believe me. No one ever wins anything with a bad defence.<br /><br /><b>[Merson admits <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has not yet reversed the decline that set in at the end of <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>’s reign]</b> They were going for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> titles and Champions Leagues for the last two or three years, so of course they are still in decline at the moment. But with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> there, he will turn it around. He will, but they have to play his way. Totenham aren’t going to be a free-flowing side. But they’ve got to trust <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and have faith, because this man has won everything and they’ve won nothing</p>
