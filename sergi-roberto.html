  <p><b>[Sergi Roberto describes his last-minute, match-winning goal against <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> that sealed the Catalan giants’ remarkable comeback in the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League]</b> When I woke up, I wasn’t sure if it hadn’t all been a dream. I didn’t see a thing until the ball went in. I could see that <a href="gerard-pique.html">Gerard Pique</a> hadn’t reached it and I threw everything at it. It went in and we all went crazy. We could feel that the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> was buzzing. We could really feel the fans’ support… I simply have no words to explain how it felt. I had always dreamed of scoring a goal like that and being a lad from La Masia made it all the more special. I’ve worked so long to do something incredible like this for my club. We gave it everything. Our attitude was spectacular. It’s a night that will always be remembered, like the one at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> when <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a> scored. We made the impossible possible. This comeback has given us new life to deal with what we have left of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Osasuna (2) vs (2) <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. Sergi Roberto was left p<strong>**d off as <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> fought back against Osasuna only to draw]&lt;/b&gt; We’re p</strong>**d off, we’re angry. We did the most difficult thing, we equalised and then went ahead, and then we couldn’t control the game. It was difficult for us to have control in the first half, to get to their goal. They closed up a lot, they had their fans, and we couldn’t get control. We know there are pitches like this where they press a lot and if you don’t get really stuck in, it can cost you. It’s what happened to us<br /><br /><b>[Referee Juan Martinez Munuera appeared unwilling to give the penalty but pointed to the spot after advice from his assistant. Roberto is not sure whether the decision was correct or not]</b> I haven’t seen the penalty clearly. I don’t know if <a href="gerard-pique.html">Pique</a> had time to move away. The good thing is there is a long way to go, but this is a message for us not to relax, and to get stuck in from the first minute</b></p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona defender Sergi Roberto claimed his side’s 1-0 victory over <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> on Sunday could prove a pivotal moment in the <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> title race]</b> We knew that their fans were going to pressure us and it was the case. Matches like these are where the league can be decided, and we have had to suffer to win. But there is a long way to go, and many teams will pose a threat<br /><br /><b>[Barcelona were indebted to Ter Stegen’s heroics in goal as he pulled off two incredible saves to deny Mario Hermoso and Alvaro Morata]</b> Marc Ter Stegen has made two good saves and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has decided the game. It is a victory for the group. Atletico have pressurised us a lot. They created a couple of very clear chances</p>
