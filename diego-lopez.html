  <p><b>[Brescia head coach Diego Lopez has hit out at <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a> for failing to report to training following the coronavirus crisis]</b> In life, facts count, not words. We are what we do, not what we say or write. There’s only one truth here: the team have followed one path, Mario has followed another. I thought he could give so much, playing in the city of his birthplace. He had a lot to give but he had to do more, much more. These are the facts. Therefore, it’s normal that there’s disappointment. I spent a lot of time on him. He trained alone because his team-mates chose to follow another path. It was optional, fair enough, but the group followed one path and he followed another. He didn’t even show up on Zoom during quarantine. Even if he says he’s feeling fit, he’s not at the level of his team-mates.<br /><br />I do a lot for my team, but I want a lot back from them. I gave him the captain’s armband to feel the satisfaction of leading a group of young players. I’ve three children and away from the pitch, I have to follow them, not boys who are already grown up and who should know what to do. He was, however, more complimentary of youngster <a href="sandro-tonali.html">Sandro Tonali</a>. He’s in love with the ball and is doing very well. He should stay focused on this season and what’s going on here. We have a common goal and individual goals. He’s very concentrated, like his team-mates, and I’m sure we can improve our standing in the table</p>

  <p><b>[Brescia coach Diego Lopez believes <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and Inter target <a href="sandro-tonali.html">Tonali</a> has ‘no limits’]</b> There’s a lot of talk about him, and rightly so, but he’s just a young lad who is in love with the ball. I can’t give him advice on what to do off the pitch. As a player, I’d say he can still improve. He has it all, but he can get even better. He has no limits. I really like him in front of the defence. I see him versatile like <b>[Radja]</b> Nainggolan in the middle of the field</p>
