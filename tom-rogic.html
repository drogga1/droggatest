  <p>[Tom Rogic returned to the field for Celtic on Wednesday night and says he’s rested and ready to go for the remainder of the season] It’s nice to be back. It’s not been easy being out, but you have to deal with it. I’ve been working as hard as I can every day to get back as soon as possible, so it was great to get back out on the pitch.<br /><br />The manager’s been fantastic throughout my injury. He always spoke to me and gave that motivation to keep working hard. The good thing about this team is that it’s a collective group of players and staff who work well together<br /><br />It’s been a fantastic season, and it’s been great to be part of it. I’ve had my rest, there’s still a lot to play for this season and there’s no let up. We’ll keep pushing until there are no more games</p>

  <p>[Celtic attacking midfielder Tom Rogic has described what an amazing moment it was to score the late Scottish Cup winner against Aberdeen] It’s an amazing feeling to score the winner. It’s hard to describe what it feels like to score a goal like that and then go and jump into the crowd. It’s impossible to put it into words, but it’s probably the best feeling you can have on the football pitch to score the winner in the last minute. It’s not about me. It’s about the whole squad. That’s the way it’s been all season.<br /><br />Everyone has to be ready. The manager is calm in the decisions he makes. I didn’t expect to come on so quickly and it wasn’t good to see KT [Kieran Tierney] go off. He’s a massive part of what we have done and we didn’t expect that. It maybe rocked us a bit. But in the second half we showed our quality and had a number of chances to put it to bed.</p>
