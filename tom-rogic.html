<blockquote>
  <p>[Tom Rogic returned to the field for Celtic on Wednesday night and says he’s rested and ready to go for the remainder of the season] It’s nice to be back. It’s not been easy being out, but you have to deal with it. I’ve been working as hard as I can every day to get back as soon as possible, so it was great to get back out on the pitch.<br /><br />The manager’s been fantastic throughout my injury. He always spoke to me and gave that motivation to keep working hard. The good thing about this team is that it’s a collective group of players and staff who work well together<br /><br />It’s been a fantastic season, and it’s been great to be part of it. I’ve had my rest, there’s still a lot to play for this season and there’s no let up. We’ll keep pushing until there are no more games</p>
