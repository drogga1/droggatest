  <p>[The 38-year-old goalkeeper Nick Rimando has inked a new contract with Real Salt Lake that will keep him with the team for a 12th MLS season] I couldn’t be happier continuing my career with Real. This is home and I couldn’t fathom leaving this club that means so much to me. I was here in the glory days and want to help bring this club back where it belongs. I’m excited to get the season started. We have the coaches, players and potential to do big things.</p>

  <p>[Veteran goalkeeper Nick Rimando has announced he will retire at the end of the 2019 Major League Soccer season] My 20th season will be my last. It’s time for me to step away and start my next adventure. This game has given me so much that it’s hard to put into words what this announcement means to me as I reflect on all the people and that have helped me reach this point. I’m truly grateful for how long I’ve played. Thank you to my family, my kids, Jett and Benny, my rock Randi, friends, teammates, coaches, staff, fans, UCLA, US Soccer, Nike, Major League Soccer, Miami Fusion, D.C. United and Real Salt Lake. As always, I look forward to competing and giving all I can to the club and RSL’s supporters, let’s make this final go around the most memorable.</p>
