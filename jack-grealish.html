  <p><b>[Jack Grealish says the season turned out perfectly after captaining <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> to a Championship play-off final win]</b> I’m speechless, I really am. I can’t even explain to you how happy I am. It means the world, we all know where this club belongs. I thought I was going, 10 months later I’m here now and I’ve led my boyhood club back to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> as captain and scored against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">the Blues</a> twice - perfect season</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> star Jack Grealish has admitted that he’s always wanted to play at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> That was my favourite goal ever. Scoring at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, I’ve always wanted to play at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>. I’ve played there before in a reserve cup final but it’s not the same when it’s like that. That’s obviously my favourite ground in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It was one of them, as soon as I shot I knew it was going into the top corner and I couldn’t have hit it any better<br /><br />I just want to go into the year, go off the back of 2019 with goals and assists, and fingers crossed get an England call-up. That’s the main thing, and keep Villa up</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Grealish is taking the transfer talk that he continues to generate with a pinch of salt]</b> Of course it’s nice. Who doesn’t like to be talked about in a nice way? But, to be honest, I try and take everything with a pinch of salt. I had it all five years ago when I broke through and I was getting talked about a lot. I was 19 years old, going online reading about myself and I couldn’t believe it. I was in the papers all the time and they were asking: ‘Is this the new big thing?’ Then just one thing goes wrong and it all comes down on you like a ton of bricks. It is nice to read and nice to listen to, but I don’t let it get to me too much, because I know how quickly it can change<br /><br />I can’t help but think of playing for England because that is what I want to do. I hope I have done enough but I also think I can perform better and that is the God’s honest truth. People on the outside might say I am doing well, but I know for a fact I can do better and score more goals and get more assists<br /><br />What will be hard at the moment is with the position I am playing in at the moment, people would probably say I am playing as a winger. If you look at England’s wingers, I doubt I would have much of a chance of starting in front of <b>[Raheem]</b> Sterling, <b>[Jadon]</b> <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> and <b>[Marcus]</b> <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>, who are all unbelievable players! I’ve always said my favourite position would be playing in midfield. That is where I would love to play for England. It is where I would want to play for Villa, but it just so happens at the moment I am playing well in the position I am in and it is better for the team. If I was fortunate enough to get a call-up, the position I would want to play is in midfield</p>

  <p><b>[Grealish more focused than ever as <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> links rage on]</b> I’m a lot different. Everything that’s happened in my life, good or bad, football-wise has set me up to be the person I am today. I wouldn’t change anything. Everyone knows I’ve had a bit of bad press when I was younger but I wouldn’t change it. That’s made me who I am today. I think I’ve already started a new chapter. In the past year, you have certain stuff happen and I was out injured - I got two bad injuries a couple of years ago, a kidney injury and then I did my shins. I was out for three to four months and when you’re out everything kicks in, really. You start to think about what you really want to achieve. When I was young I might have been a bit immature, but now I know what I want to do in my career: play for <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, play for England and win trophies. That’s the aim<br /><br />We’re not performing as well as we can. We’ve come off the back of three defeats in the league, so I feel like we’re not where we want to be at the moment. But I’ve always said during this season that we’re confident we’ll stay up. You never know what’ll happen in the future<br /><br />I’ve always known what I can do and how good I can be. I’ve never really had any doubts coming into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> that I wouldn’t be able to perform the way I am. I’m scoring and creating a lot and that’s the main thing I need to be doing for the team. Long may it continue</p>

  <p><b>[Grealish left fuming over <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>’s Carabao Cup winner]</b> I’m devastated, but we took one of the best sides in Europe all the way to the end. They had their fair share of chances, as we knew they would, but we hit the post late on. The winner is a goal that should never have been a goal - it was not a corner. The referee said <b>[<a href="ilkay-gundogan.html">Gundogan</a>]</b> was off the pitch when it hit him. We wanted an explanation at half-time but he didn’t want to give one. A club like us who haven’t won anything in a while and we lose by a goal that shouldn’t have stood. We’re proud of each other. City are in the top two or three teams in Europe. We always knew it was going to be tough and now we focus on the league</p>

I know it’s a tough time for everyone at the moment, being locked indoors for so long, and I obviously just got a call off a friend asking to go around to his and I stupidly agreed to do so. I don’t want anyone to make the same mistake that I did, so I urge everybody to stay at home and follow the rules and the guidelines of what we have been asked to do. I know as a fact that I will be doing that in the near future now and I urge everybody to do the same. I hope everybody can accept my apology and we can move on from this. Hopefully in the near future we can all be out and enjoying ourselves again once this has all boiled over</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> star Grealish admits regret at breaking lockdown]</b> I knew straight away that I had to come out and apologise myself, which I wanted to do; I didn’t want to hide behind a club statement. I am old enough now and mature enough to know that I’d done wrong. I know I am a footballer but I’m still human and we all make mistakes and straight away I knew I’d made a mistake. I’m also a role model as well to a lot of people out there, especially young children who might look up to me. So I try to act in a respectable manner but since then I have tried to keep my head down, work hard and do as much charitable work as possible.<br /><br />My season has been very good, though I probably didn’t start as I wanted to. I got an assist in the second game but apart from that I don’t think I got a goal or an assist for six weeks and that’s what I base my game on, what I do to help the team since then I have just thrived and enjoyed every single moment. Without sounding arrogant or big-headed I had no doubts I would come into this league and perform the way I have done<br /><br />I would probably say it is a disadvantage, if I am honest, only because of how much we have thrived on the home games this year. We have won a lot more at home than we have away. We had six games remaining at home. We still have a game in hand and if we win the game in hand we are out of the relegation zone. It is not something we are going to sit back and moan about. It is still in our hands. We can’t moan about the fact we might have had the fans there. We will just take it as it is because we are just delighted to be getting back</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Grealish says he is eager to emulate Kevin De Bruyne]</b> De Bruyne! I just love him. I think he’s unbelievable, and I probably try to base my game on him a little bit, especially when I play at No.8. I think De Bruyne has absolutely everything. He has that much stuff, he doesn’t get enough credit. He’s probably the best player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and is up there with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> at the moment<br /><br /><b>[With Villa facing <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> in their first fixture of the restart]</b> I think obviously everyone is going to be watching these games on TV, and I feel I thrive off that, the big games everyone is watching. We have 10 very important games, and I think the first will be most important - if we end up winning that, it instantly takes us out of the bottom three. Everyone knows our tough run-in, but we are all confident and have come back as fit as ever. I don’t want to say this in an arrogant way, but I embrace <b>[the pressure]</b>. I love the fact it’s like that, if I’m honest. Being the local lad and captain of the club, I absolutely love it and try to take it in my stride which I think I have done this season. We’re going straight into a relegation battle, but we’re all focused on that and we’re all ready. We’ve been having Zoom calls twice a week, both about tactical things and the mental side of things</p>
