  <p><b>[The son of former Bolton legend Jussi Jaaskelainen - Will is plying his trade at League Two side Crewe, and hopes to emulate <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> stopper <a href="kasper-schmeichel.html">Kasper Schmeichel</a> by stepping out of his father’s shadow]</b> With a surname like mine, everyone knows who I am - or at least who my dad is. It’s a pretty obvious connection. But I’m proud to follow him into the same trade. He didn’t tell me to be a goalkeeper. He’s always let me make my own decisions. I decided, at a young age, that I wanted to play football like him, and he never saw any reason to stop me<br /><br /><b>[At 21, Will is still nearer sapling than mighty oak, but his role models are, unsurprisingly, fellow Scandinavians]</b> I look up to <a href="kasper-schmeichel.html">Kasper Schmeichel</a>, and what he’s achieved by following in his father’s footsteps, and dream of doing as well as him. Now he’s not just the son of a famous father. He’s one of the best goalkeepers in the world in his own right. And Kasper didn’t start at the top - he gained experience in the lower leagues before he won the title at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> , which stood him in good stead. Going out on loan, and playing 60-odd games over two years in non-League football (with Loughborough Dynamos, Nantwich, Buxton and Chester) helped me a lot. You can hear every comment from behind the goal. You don’t just improve as a keeper - it probably sharpens your mind, and maybe you develop a thicker skin. I don’t think hanging around and playing Under-23 games develops you as much as competitive non-League football… the best way to learn from your mistakes is in front of a crowd. It toughens you up</p>
