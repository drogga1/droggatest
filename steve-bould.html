  <p><b>[Steve Bould claims <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s hunger and will to win is stronger than ever despite continued scrutiny over the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> manager’s future]</b> I admire him immensely. He’s taken an unbelievable amount of stick off everyone. He is one of the great managers. I understand that he’s doing a great job as far as I’m concerned<br /><br /><b>[Questioned on whether or not <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> has retained the hunger that saw him guide <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to three league titles, including the famous ‘Invincibles’ season in 2003-04]</b> Behind closed doors, I’ve never met anybody who is as hungry and determined to win football games. The hunger is as big as I’ve ever seen, for sure<br /><br /><b>[Asked if Bould could offer an exclusive that <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> will remain at the club next season, he jokingly replied]</b> Yes of course, I’d love to. I’d love to. Not that I’m aware of. I’m not sure where the reports are coming from. Jack had a bit of a knee problem, he’s come back and is fine<br /><br /><b>[Bould also declined to offer an update on the future of <a href="jack-wilshere.html">Wilshere</a>, whose contract is due to expire at the end of the season]</b> I’m not here to answer those questions. I’m sitting in for Arsene to talk about the Stoke game, I’d much prefer you talk about football<br /><br /><b>[Bould also claimed <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are not prioritising the Europa League as their most likely route back into <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s elite club competition, despite the first leg of a winnable quarter-final against CSKA Moscow looming next week]</b> We’re concentrating on Sunday. It’s a big game for us, we need a result. We’re not stupid. You never know. To win games now is better for us, you never know if you’re going to win a Europa League final</p>

  <p><b>[Lacazette at 10 for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>? Steve Bould backs striker to overcome recent struggles]</b> He’s actually a very, very, very good football player. He could play at number 10 - he’s really good. He’s not just a goalscorer, he’s not an out-and-out striker, he can play. The physical element has surprised him and caught up with him, which it does to many players who come from abroad. We’re hoping he comes back sharp<br /><br /><b>[Bould formed part of an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> side back in the 1990s which included the iconic figure of <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Bergkamp</a>, and he sees similarities between the struggles the Dutch maestro endured after arriving in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and those currently troubling a marquee signing]</b> This little break might have done him the world of good actually. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is absolutely different compared to the French league. I think he’s found it physically tougher. It might be a blessing in disguise having that month off and coming back fighting. <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a> went through <b>[struggles]</b>. Lots of the great players go through these times. It’s not a worry<br /><br /><b>[Bould formed part of an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> side back in the 1990s which included the iconic figure of <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Bergkamp</a>, and he sees similarities between the struggles the Dutch maestro endured after arriving in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and those currently troubling a marquee signing]</b> This little break might have done him the world of good actually.

  <p><b>[Pablo Mari impressed in his start for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s U-23s on Monday, although the newly-signed Spaniard couldn’t quite guide the team to victory]</b> It’s fabulous for the young players to play alongside them. It’s a learning programme and we don’t very often get older boys and men playing with us, and that’s how I learned my game when I was a kid so it’s something we miss out on lots of times. It was actually a very good game for them to come in to. I think Chelsea’s striker is a good player and they have good players all over the park so it was a good test for them and a good 45 minutes. I’m sure they will go on and use that for first-team value<br /><br />I thought the performance was really really good, especially in the second half. I think they edged the first half they had a bit more of the ball and we struggled a little bit to retain it. In the second half, the boys have done everything that we’ve asked of them and I couldn’t ask of any more from them apart from scoring another goal.</p>
