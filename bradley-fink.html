  <p><b>[Fink’s father on when explaining the reasons for choosing <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> as a destination]</b> We had inquiries from 16 other clubs that also came to us directly through or our consultant. Luzern explained to us the plan that Bradley would be training with the first team from June 17, when the decision to join <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> had already been made. We preferred Bradley be able to fine-tune and work on the details of his game for at least two years in the youth teams. We wanted a club that relies on the young players, if not to say, depends on successful youngsters. We also wanted his club to present a ‘Bradley Fink Project’ rather than signing four or five talents in his position, one of whom will make it and the rest will more or less be left behind</p>

  <p><b>[Bradley Fink: <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s latest teenage goal machine]</b> During the first three-to-four training sessions I was a bit scared, but then I got used to it very quickly. My development plan is medium to long-term, which usually means two-and-a-half years of fine-tuning in the youth sector. It was my big dream to run out at the Swisspor Arena <b>[Luzern’s home stadium]</b>. But I think my chances of becoming a professional are higher at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> than they were at Luzern. My dream has now changed. My goal is to play for <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> in front of 80,000 spectators</p>
