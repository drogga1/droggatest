  <p><b>[Kamal Shalorus vs <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> booked for Jan. 20 in Nashville]</b> The UFC on FX fight card continues to take shape with a recent lightweight addition that pits Kamal Shalorus against promotion newcomer <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> on Jan. 20, 2012, from the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee<br /><br />Shalorus (7-1-2) is looking to rebound from the first loss of his career, a technical knockout stoppage to top-ranked lightweight Jim Miller at UFC 128 earlier this year<br /><br />‘The Prince of Persia’ is a decorated International wrestler and former WEC title contender.<br /><br />Standing in his way is Nurmagomedov, who knows a thing or two about fighting overseas. He’s currently undefeated at 16-0 after competing under the M-1 Global and ProFC banners, among others.<br /><br />UFC on FX, which will mark the promotion’s inaugural effort on the FOX-owned network, will be headlined by two top lightweight contenders, Jim Miller vs. Melvin Guillard, who both had their 155-pound title-challenging aspirations dashed with disappointing losses in their most recent performances<br /><br />Also penciled in for the FX fight card is a heavyweight battle between Pat Barry vs. Christian Morecraft, as well as a welterweight slugfest that pits Josh Neer vs. Duane Ludwig.</p>

  <p>Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) women’s strawweight champion, Joanna Jedrzejczyk, insists her win over Michelle Waterson in the UFC Tampa main event last weekend on ESPN+ was enough to secure her the next 115-pound title shot<br /><br /><a href="weili-zhang.html">Weili Zhang</a> also expressed interest in moving up a division to challenge current women’s flyweight champion, Valentina Shevchenko, which is probably not a realistic goal until she has at least one or two title defenses at her current weight.<br /><br />Despite her win over ‘Karate Hottie,’ Joanna Jedrzejczyk remains ranked No. 4 in the division, behind the undefeated Tatiana Suarez (No. 3), the aforementioned Rosa Namajunas (No. 2), and ex-champion Jessica Andrade (No. 1), who was crushed by Zhang at UFC Shenzhen</p>

  <p>Anyone who remembers <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>’s drubbing of Michael Johnson at UFC 205 back in late 2016 will know ‘The Eagle’ routinely tells his opponents to give up before finishing them off, to avoid any unnecessary damage<br /><br />That’s because the Dagestani grappler gets no pleasure from hurting his fellow combatants, with the lone exception being former UFC lightweight champion <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a>, who fell to Nurmagomedov at UFC 229 back in October 2018<br /><br />How much pleasure he gets from his next title defense remains to be seen. While Nurmagomedov continues to tease a <a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> super fight, it’s more realistic to plan for a <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> showdown, just as soon as ‘The Eagle’ is prepared to land in New York</p>
