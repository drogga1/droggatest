  <p><b>[Nedum Onuoha says the alleged racist abuse that Raheem Sterling was subjected to during Manchester City’s loss to Chelsea was a terrible incident]</b> I think the incident with Raheem <b>[Sterling]</b> is terrible, but I don’t think it’s the only incident. I think it’s the biggest one for a while because it involves a British player. This stuff goes on all the time. When you look at it and think of where we are in society, it seems so wrong. On the flip side, though, I think things are still being said but more people know now it’s wrong. Yet they still have those views and they’re more than willing to share it in an open forum, whether it’s in a stadium, online or face-to-face. That’s the biggest problem.<br /><br />I think one thing that a lot of people don’t realise is that when stuff like this goes on for people like Raheem, he is going to lose more than those fans are going to lose if he reacts to it. Even though the things that are being said to him are unfair, not right, some of it is allegedly discrimination. It’s horrible. If he were to say anything back, he’d be getting charged by the FA, the PFA would be speaking to him, Supporters Trusts and stuff like that would be getting at him. His reputation would be far worse, so he has to just accept it. That’s one of the downsides about playing the game - you can never really defend yourself<br /><br />Being raised in Manchester in the 1990s, I did experience a few things - my whole family did. We came from Nigeria and we were, at the time, one of the few - if not the only - black family in Miles Platting at that time. Time passed and I joined Man City’s academy when I was 10. We played in a few international tournaments and some of the places we went and some of the teams we’d play, some of them couldn’t speak a word of English except for being able to swear at you or say a ‘n-word’ to me. It was strange. I just thought to myself, ‘What is this? Is this what I am? Is this what the world is?’. In fairness, it got better over time and I think a lot of that was because people’s voices started to be heard</p>

  <p><b>[Onuoha refuses to accept Ibrahimovic apology after LA Galaxy star’s trash talk]</b> He came here to apologise after the game because from 60 minutes in, he’s saying to me he’s going to do me, he’s going to hurt me for that game - and this is the guy who’s the face of the MLS as he calls himself, but this is the way he plays on the field. So I don’t care. You don’t say that on the field. I’m not going to accept his apologies. It’s unacceptable.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake defender Nedum Onuoha says Zlatan Ibrahimovic acted like a complete thug]</b> He fouled me, grabbed me round by the neck and threw me to the floor. I was on the floor with my hands by my sides and thinking ‘what’s going on?’, and looking at him as if to say such a thing. He got really angry at me and started telling me to stop waving my hands around and to get up. I was confused and in a non-PG way I started to say a few things like ‘what’s your problem?’. He started to get more and more and more angry to the point where it was actually threatening so I stood up, started to defend myself and say to him ‘what do you think you are actually going to do?’. He just became really angry for some reason and he started to become hostile from that point. Ten minutes later, a similar challenge happened and he hit me on the top of the head. I was looking at the referee saying ‘what is going on?’. For me as a player, as much as people may like me or don’t like me, I’m not a dirty player. I will be physical and I will compete but there is never any malice in it. But now a guy is saying to me that he is essentially going to break my legs before this game is finished.<br /><br />He didn’t affect the way that I played, it just motivated me more really. But after the 60th minute, he got booked and he started saying ‘right that’s it then, keep watching that clock, I’m going to do you, just you wait’. These are words I’ve probably heard twice or three times in all my career, usually by people who are complete thugs. It’s one thing to be competitive but it’s another thing to be threatening harm against another professional. So I was playing with that over my head, thinking every time I came close to him ‘is this going to be the time?’. That’s not the way you’re supposed to play the game<br /><br />The biggest regret for is that the striker will always have the last word. They don’t have to play well. And this was against a guy who has had the last word 500 times before, which is really frustrating. Because if he didn’t score the goal, he would have been seen as a laughing stock because he had such a bad game<br /><br />He’s not going to get anything done to him. It will get spun into a story about how he’s really competitive and this is what gets him going, this is why he’s one of the best of all time. That’s just the way that it works. I’m not the type of person to say that the better MLS players get preferential treatment but from what I’ve seen so far, it’s a lot easier to be Zlatan than it is to be the striker for Real Salt Lake.</p>

  <p><b>[Nedum Onuoha says <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> is likely to stay at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and try to knock <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> from their perch]</b> I think with Pep, firstly he doesn’t seem the type of manager who will ever get sacked. Secondly, if he was to move to somewhere else, where would he move to in this instance? Which clubs are available? Which clubs are looking for a manager? Which clubs are looking for that style of coaching? I don’t really know any at the moment unless it was for a national team or something like that<br /><br />I could see him possibly staying as I don’t think he’s happy with how this season has finished. Even though <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are going to win it and might break the record, I don’t think Pep will be happy to leave England and not be able to have that record or prove that he can be as good or even better than that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team next year. So I think he will stay</p>

  <p><b>[Nedum Onuoha says <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> is quality &amp; just having a bad patch]</b> You know, I don’t think he <b>[Stones]</b> is a bad player. I just think at the moment he’s being punished every time - so it’s like if you could fall over and the ball could go out of play and nothing happens, but instead he falls over and a great cross comes in and a great header and it’s 2-1 and it gives Aston Vila the hope. It’s just it seems like he’s just in a bad patch at the moment, but he’s a quality player. And I think if he wasn’t, you wouldn’t see him playing in the cup final. Pep would not pick him. He could have picked whoever he wanted to pick, you know, he could have put two midfielders there if he wanted to<br /><br />But this is a player who he has trusted in on the biggest occasion. So yeah, I think he’s a good player, he just needs to cut out some of the mistakes he’s going through at the minute or just find some luck where the mistakes don’t lead to big talking points, because you know there are lots of players making more mistakes than him in the league, but we just don’t speak about it as much because it tends to not lead to a highlight</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> defender Nedum Onuoha admits that he never feels 100 per cent safe going out in the USA and has thrown his full backing behind the ongoing protests against police brutality in the country]</b> I’m always very wary of how I behave and how it could be viewed by people who have power. For me personally, overall I don’t like to say it but I have a fear and distrust towards police. I have loved living in this country but there is <b>[another]</b> side of it. In the UK, I am more comfortable because if something happens it probably will not be deadly - but over here because of their rights it is more common that altercations become deadly. I am always very aware of that whenever I go around anywhere. I’m comfortable but when it comes to any kind of brutality, if it’s from the police, if they read me the wrong way then my life could be taken. I feel that every single day. It is not just me but everybody else as well. I am not trying to be overly critical of the police, there are plenty of good police officers out there, but sometimes I feel like people put police on a pedestal and make them seem superhuman. But the fact is over here they are just people from society with a badge and a gun and a lot more power. If you worry about the man next door, why would you not worry about the person patrolling the streets who now has more power, more guns but the same views? I never go out and feel 100% safe.<br /><br />It’s emotional. It’s something that is overdue to be honest. There has been a big wave of energy towards this, there has been a lot of talk about George Floyd - these issues have been around for decades. People have been trying to make noise. I have been trying to say things but it gets pushed away for too long. Enough is enough; what gives me strength is that it’s not just black people who are protesting now. The change will come but within that, there are so many nuanced things within the protest - for example, a lot of black people are scared to do what some of the white people are doing to the police. It’s crazy to see but it is very necessary. I am not going to say to them that they shouldn’t do anything because they haven’t been heard for this long so let them be heard now</p>
