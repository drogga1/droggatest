  <p><b>[Nedum Onuoha says <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> is likely to stay at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and try to knock <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> from their perch]</b> I think with Pep, firstly he doesn’t seem the type of manager who will ever get sacked. Secondly, if he was to move to somewhere else, where would he move to in this instance? Which clubs are available? Which clubs are looking for a manager? Which clubs are looking for that style of coaching? I don’t really know any at the moment unless it was for a national team or something like that<br /><br />I could see him possibly staying as I don’t think he’s happy with how this season has finished. Even though <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are going to win it and might break the record, I don’t think Pep will be happy to leave England and not be able to have that record or prove that he can be as good or even better than that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team next year. So I think he will stay</p>

  <p><b>[Nedum Onuoha says <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> is quality &amp; just having a bad patch]</b> You know, I don’t think he <b>[Stones]</b> is a bad player. I just think at the moment he’s being punished every time - so it’s like if you could fall over and the ball could go out of play and nothing happens, but instead he falls over and a great cross comes in and a great header and it’s 2-1 and it gives Aston Vila the hope. It’s just it seems like he’s just in a bad patch at the moment, but he’s a quality player. And I think if he wasn’t, you wouldn’t see him playing in the cup final. Pep would not pick him. He could have picked whoever he wanted to pick, you know, he could have put two midfielders there if he wanted to<br /><br />But this is a player who he has trusted in on the biggest occasion. So yeah, I think he’s a good player, he just needs to cut out some of the mistakes he’s going through at the minute or just find some luck where the mistakes don’t lead to big talking points, because you know there are lots of players making more mistakes than him in the league, but we just don’t speak about it as much because it tends to not lead to a highlight</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> defender Nedum Onuoha admits that he never feels 100 per cent safe going out in the USA and has thrown his full backing behind the ongoing protests against police brutality in the country]</b> I’m always very wary of how I behave and how it could be viewed by people who have power. For me personally, overall I don’t like to say it but I have a fear and distrust towards police. I have loved living in this country but there is <b>[another]</b> side of it. In the UK, I am more comfortable because if something happens it probably will not be deadly - but over here because of their rights it is more common that altercations become deadly. I am always very aware of that whenever I go around anywhere. I’m comfortable but when it comes to any kind of brutality, if it’s from the police, if they read me the wrong way then my life could be taken. I feel that every single day. It is not just me but everybody else as well. I am not trying to be overly critical of the police, there are plenty of good police officers out there, but sometimes I feel like people put police on a pedestal and make them seem superhuman. But the fact is over here they are just people from society with a badge and a gun and a lot more power. If you worry about the man next door, why would you not worry about the person patrolling the streets who now has more power, more guns but the same views? I never go out and feel 100% safe.<br /><br />It’s emotional. It’s something that is overdue to be honest. There has been a big wave of energy towards this, there has been a lot of talk about George Floyd - these issues have been around for decades. People have been trying to make noise. I have been trying to say things but it gets pushed away for too long. Enough is enough; what gives me strength is that it’s not just black people who are protesting now. The change will come but within that, there are so many nuanced things within the protest - for example, a lot of black people are scared to do what some of the white people are doing to the police. It’s crazy to see but it is very necessary. I am not going to say to them that they shouldn’t do anything because they haven’t been heard for this long so let them be heard now</p>
