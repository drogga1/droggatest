  <p><b>[Ben Sheaf’s desire to make it at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is as strong now as it was when he first arrived at the club from <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> as a 16-year-old]</b> I want to play for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. That is the dream. It’s easy to say injuries have stopped me, which I think they partly have. But I wouldn’t have the journey I’ve had any other way. That sounds a bit cringe, but I wouldn’t. I’ve had some dark times but I know that I’m good enough and if given the opportunity I will prove myself as good enough. It’s just whether that opportunity comes up or not<br /><br />Of course that’s what I want. I want to go back there next season and get in the first-team. It’s as simple as that really, but I know the reality of it. I am 22 now and injuries haven’t done me the world of good. But I would love to go back and prove myself because I’ve never really had that injury-free spell when I’ve been there<br /><br />He’s always ahead of the game and his anticipation quality is absolutely huge. There is something in him that I believe will allow him to progress. He analyses what’s happening to him, he assesses well what is going on and that’s why I believe he will have a good career<br /><br />It was crazy over at Red Star, so passionate and hostile. Even the tunnel was crazy. It was so enclosed and you go down this long corridor which was lined by these security guards and then you come up and you’re getting whistled at and are having things thrown at you. It was so eye-opening. Then it was good to get on at the Emirates against <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>. I remember winning a header against <a href="andy-carroll.html">Andy Carroll</a> and thinking ‘blimey, what’s going on here?’<br /><br />It was the second day of pre-season. It was a problem at the back of my knee, a cyst. It was really tough mentally because I would always do everything perfectly with my rehab and then I would come back and it would go again<br /><br /><b>[When Doncaster came calling in the summer, he jumped at the chance of a season-long loan]</b> At the start of the season I set myself a target of 35 games, so to have that number of games under my belt already is really positive. I’ve learned so much. That rhythm of playing, that continuity is so key, especially for young footballers who are learning the game. I’ve been in central midfield all season. I’d not played regularly there for a while as my last two or three seasons at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> was mostly at centre-back, but now I don’t know if I could see myself at centre-back again<br /><br />I remember playing in a few Under-23s games with Mikel. There was one game, I think it was <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> at the training ground, when I was shifted to right-back actually just so he could be in the team. The boys have got nothing but good things to say about him. They are buying into his philosophy and I think you can see that with the performances. Just hearing about him really does make me want to go and work under him</p>
