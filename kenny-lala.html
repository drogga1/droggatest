  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> target Kenny Lala has poured cold water on a possible move from Strasbourg]</b> If you have to go higher, it is to play at a club that play in Europe. I am happy at Strasbourg. It is a beautiful city and I have quickly adapted. I feel good here</p>

  <p><b>[Kenny Lala has admitted that he is flattered by rumours linking him with a move to <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>]</b> From the beginning, everything is transparent with the president <b>[Marc Keller]</b>. If it is possible to go to see higher, <b>[I am]</b> open. There have been proposals. Afterwards, I question myself. Maybe I’m not good enough? Maybe I have to do more to go higher? I do not want to say the names <b>[of the clubs that have approached me]</b> but there have been two good clubs and they had ambition. <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>? I would have liked <b>[to go there]</b>. It’s nice to hear that and I do not see who would refuse to go<br /><br /><b>[Despite the defender’s clear desire to move on, no deal has yet been reached to sell him and Kenny Lala insists that is down to Strasbourg demanding a fee they feel is fair for his services]</b> It is not me <b>[that has stalled negotiations]</b>. The agreement between the clubs was not made. All that is numbers, it is not me who manages. To be clear, <b>[I’m not sure if I will stay]</b>. I’m here, I’m waiting. Since the beginning of the prep, I’m doing my matches. I am professional and I see what is happening. In 10 days everything is possible. I do not exclude a departure<br /><br /><b>[It has been suggested that the fact that Lala is 28 years old has been a deterrent for potential suitors, who may be discouraged by the lack of resale value he has]</b> When I see people talking about my age, it makes me laugh. I’m 28 but it’s not my fault! I fought to get here. When I look at my career today, I’m happy. My last four seasons, I’m constantly growing</p>
