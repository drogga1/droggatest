<blockquote>
  <p>[Barcelona target Frenkie de Jong has been described as a mixture of Deco and Xavi] It cannot be compared, De Jong can be a mixture of Deco and Xavi, but he is De Jong. It is always difficult to compare players. Both Xavi and Deco were from another planet, De Jong has the talent, but he must still prove it and that his injuries are respected.<br /><br />[on Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt] They are two very talented players, although talent alone does not decide anything. Both have talent and a good head, and that is very important. The logical thing is that they leave Ajax this season and I think it’s the best decision for their careers. Here the league is too easy and they need a more competitive competition. I think that with their age they are players who need to play every week and the chances of playing at Barca are not so great. When someone arrives at Barca they have to be ready. My opinion is that Barça will sign them but transfer them to another club so that they can get experience at the highest level, but not at Barca. They are players with a lot of quality but to grow they need to play, not be on the bench</p>
