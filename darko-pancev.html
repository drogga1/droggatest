<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former European Golden Boot winner Darko Pancev has confessed that his biggest career regret is joining Inter in 1992]</b> My biggest mistake was joining Inter. Because I went to a team that had a bad atmosphere, a team that played defensively and as a stranger – they looked at me differently, and I think that they weren’t supportive enough for me to adapt easily. But the mistake is mine, because I could have gone to teams like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, which were looking at me during that period<br /><br />Yes, absolutely. Not nice at all, but, I will repeat again, looking back nowadays it is clear for me that their journalists will firstly protect Inter instead of me. And I was a victim to that whole game<br /><br /><a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is a bigger scorer than <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, and on the other hand, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is more creative, with a bigger sense in a game. Everyone who has followed football in the last 20 to 30 years can clearly recognize the difference, and notice that in my time until 2005 I would say, the players were not as protected, they were put to the test. Nowadays, playing in front is a great satisfaction, because the way of defending has changed. The duels are less rough, the penalty area is more watched and it is easier to score goals</p>
