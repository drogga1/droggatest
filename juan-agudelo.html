  <p><b>[Agudelo concurred with importance of not having one attacker marked by two defenders]</b> I believe it gave players a little more freedom to roam. We were occupying the center backs and making their jobs a lot harder. With one striker, sometimes, we made it easy for two defenders to mark one striker.</p>

  <p><b>[New England Revolution striker Juan Agudelo acknowledges he was surprised by how professional U.S. national team coach Bruce Arena was during the January camp]</b> I thought it went really well. I got some really positive feedback. I showed I’m a hardworking forward with technical ability, from what they said. They’re definitely going keep an eye on me to become a part of the national team for more than just the January camp.<br /><br />He’s very a good coach that is going to put the players he feels are capable of doing the job he wants <b>[done]</b> on the field. He surprised me with how well of a coach he was professionally. The way he speaks, the way he talks to the players. It was more like, ‘You respect and you understand.’ It’s clear what’s expected of you from the coaching staff on what you have to do to be playing or a part of the national team<br /><br />Keep working hard club-wise. Definitely be a guy who stands out with my club, whether it’s with assists, whether it’s with hard defensive work, creating chances and scoring goals. Whatever <b>[is necessary]</b> over the next coming games</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Agudelo reveals he nearly joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> before ill-fated Stoke move]</b> I thought for sure I was going to go to <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. It was tough. I don’t know if I would have went to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and got loaned out, but I definitely wanted to go to <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. It was a place I was probably going to play. I was offered a contract at Utrecht as my loan ended, but it was a rough time for me. I was frustrated that I couldn’t play (for Stoke) because of work-permit and political issues. I wish I was stronger, but I was a kid. I was like, ‘Man, I just want to go home’<br /><br />I wish it worked out differently. I wouldn’t have wanted to change clubs. I don’t even know if I would have entertained going to Europe. I did always want to go, but if things went well with the Red Bulls I would have loved to be that full career, franchise player there. First of all, I needed the trade because of what I felt what I needed for my development, I wasn’t getting any love, to be honest, from the coach and GM. But I do wish it worked out differently. Coming out of the academy at a club I was wearing their crest since I was 14 years old. I represented them when I was at the U-17 World Cup, people knew I was from the Red Bulls academy. Local club. I don’t really think about <b>[the past]</b> too much, I just try to focus on what I’m doing now. I like the experiences I’ve had with all the clubs. Especially now with Miami</p>
