  <p><b>[Juan Agudelo reveals he nearly joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> before ill-fated Stoke move]</b> I thought for sure I was going to go to <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. It was tough. I don’t know if I would have went to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and got loaned out, but I definitely wanted to go to <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. It was a place I was probably going to play. I was offered a contract at Utrecht as my loan ended, but it was a rough time for me. I was frustrated that I couldn’t play (for Stoke) because of work-permit and political issues. I wish I was stronger, but I was a kid. I was like, ‘Man, I just want to go home’<br /><br />I wish it worked out differently. I wouldn’t have wanted to change clubs. I don’t even know if I would have entertained going to Europe. I did always want to go, but if things went well with the Red Bulls I would have loved to be that full career, franchise player there. First of all, I needed the trade because of what I felt what I needed for my development, I wasn’t getting any love, to be honest, from the coach and GM. But I do wish it worked out differently. Coming out of the academy at a club I was wearing their crest since I was 14 years old. I represented them when I was at the U-17 World Cup, people knew I was from the Red Bulls academy. Local club. I don’t really think about <b>[the past]</b> too much, I just try to focus on what I’m doing now. I like the experiences I’ve had with all the clubs. Especially now with Miami</p>
