<blockquote>
  <p>[One of Tite’s great dependables, Renato Augusto has played a major role in Brazil’s rebirth under the current coach] I know my importance within the group, so the important thing is to be physically fit, to keep training well, and to play well if Tite needs to be ready to help the team. I have to work for that, to be in the squad for the World Cup and then turn up and fight for a place for a place in the team. We have players of great quality, some really great names, but I will always fight for my space<br /><br />[Renato believes the Selecao’s 1-0 victory over Germany in Berlin was another important step] We have to use it as a training for the World Cup. We have not won anything yet. It’s no good to think that it’s all over, that anything has been resolved, because it’s not like that. It was just one more step, one that we had to go through and now we have the team that feels strong going into the World Cup</p>
