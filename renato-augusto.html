  <p><b>[Renato Augusto has backed Paulinho to make a success of his recent transfer to Spanish giants Barcelona]</b> When he came back into the national team, Paulinho took a fair bit of punishment, but he is playing at an extremely high level and I have no doubt that it will work out at Barcelona.<br /><br />We are always looking for the best we can be. Regardless of qualification, you have to play at a high level</p>

  <p><b>[On his position]</b> Central midfield is the position that I like to play the most and where I feel more at ease, it’s the position where you end up seeing a lot the ball. There is also a lot of defensive responsibility and I adapted well to that aspect of the game, both at Corinthians and here with Brazil.<br /><br />It’s a very good life in China, the city is great and my wife and I adapted very well. It’s a place where I feel happy. But, of course, if something very good comes from Europe, as was the case with Paulinho <b>[who joined Barcelona]</b>, then I’d have to sit down and consider it. You never know what could happen</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil midfielder Renato Augusto has stressed the importance of Brazil arriving at next year’s World Cup on a high]</b> They are all difficult opponents. We have not yet talked to Tite about them, but we are aware of the qualities of each opponent. Switzerland are very strong defensively, so we need to be well prepared and stay calm. I always say that the most important thing is to continue with this excellent work being done by Tite and the technical committee, and to stay focused on having a great tournament regardless of the opponents we face.<br /><br />In the next few days I will start a new schedule of physical preparation hat was discussed with Bruno <b>[Mazziotti, Brazil physio]</b> and Fabio <b>[Mahseredjian, physical trainer]</b> in order to reach the Cup at a the highest possible level. I want to arrive in Russia in peak condition</p>

  <p><b>[One of Tite’s great dependables, Renato Augusto has played a major role in Brazil’s rebirth under the current coach]</b> I know my importance within the group, so the important thing is to be physically fit, to keep training well, and to play well if Tite needs to be ready to help the team. I have to work for that, to be in the squad for the World Cup and then turn up and fight for a place for a place in the team. We have players of great quality, some really great names, but I will always fight for my space<br /><br /><b>[Renato believes the Selecao’s 1-0 victory over Germany in Berlin was another important step]</b> We have to use it as a training for the World Cup. We have not won anything yet. It’s no good to think that it’s all over, that anything has been resolved, because it’s not like that. It was just one more step, one that we had to go through and now we have the team that feels strong going into the World Cup</p>
