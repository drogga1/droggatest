<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Chris Richards]</b> Right off the bat I could tell this kid’s got something really, really good. But he hadn’t grown into his body much. He was sort of gangly. The body type that I could see some people not thinking he could play.<br /><br />His ability to see the field and break lines with his passing - he’s a high-level passer from the back - and he’s just an athletic freak. He can jump through the roof. He’s just a kid you could see a real high ceiling with<br /><br />Them coming back to <b>[the Texans]</b> would have been fine, but if they were going to really go somewhere in the game then time was of the essence and I wanted them to move on. I told FC Dallas, ‘I’ve got these two players who are going to be pros at the highest level. I think you guys should take a look at them<br /><br />This kid’s going to be the starting center back for the national team in the next World Cup. I completely believe that. He’s got more. He’s getting better and better and better. His ceiling is so high. He’s different than anything we’ve ever had as a center back because I think his range of passing is better than any center back we’ve ever seen in the United States</p>
