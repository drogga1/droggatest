<blockquote>
  <p>[NorthEast United FC owner John Abraham believes that his franchise will be the first in the Indian Super League to break even] NEUFC will be the first team in ISL to break-even. This is the fourth season of ISL and we will break-even in fifth or sixth season. So, it is just one or two more seasons. Within the ISL, when someone talks about template, then they say look at NEUFC. We are working on economy of scale. We are working at the grass root and with local boys. We also prefer local sponsors.<br /><br />[Abraham pointed that the club has entered a partnership with Neroca FC and Shillong United with a long term vision in place] We have a long-term vision. We are here for very long term. We have already tied up with two clubs in Shillong and in Manipur. We have shortlisted kids and will house them in a residential academy at Shillong, where all their needs, including education will be taken care of. I am also the brand ambassador of Arunachal Pradesh. Very soon something very very exciting coming up there. It is about football. NEUFC is not just a club. It is a platform to reiterate the voice of North East<br /><br />[Summarizing his thoughts on Indian football at large] Indian football still has to develop. Foreign players are coming up and it is exciting for Indian players. Infrastructure has to be developed. If you ask me, football is not cricket yet, but it will be new cricket in a period of time</p>
