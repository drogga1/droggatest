I respect <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> as a person and a manager. I respect him a lot but friendship is a lot, its another thing<br /><br /><b>[Although the pair may not be close friends, Mazzarri insists there is now no tension between the two]</b> Of course we will shake hands tomorrow. We even shook hands at the meeting of the managers at the start of the season. There is no problem but again for me friendship is very important. I have just a few friends</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> 1-3 <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> The second half we were good and should have scored more. <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a> played incredible for them, saved a goal two or three times but I am very happy with how our team played. A lot of players are new so we have to prepare later. The organisational things are still missing and two starting players were out last minute and this really didn’t help</p>

  <p><b>[Walter Mazzarri says <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> must become more consistent]</b> Until now, it has been like this (overcoming a loss), and I really hope it happens again now. But, this also means that we still need to grow, especially to avoid these ups and downs that the team has had throughout the season. We want to continue having the positive results without having to go through an up and a down.<br /><br /><b>[Eighth-placed <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> have 18 points from 13 games, a point and place behind West Bromwich Albion, who they face on Saturday]</b> West Bromwich is a club that is doing very well and the results speak for themselves. Because of the way that they play, it’s very difficult for every team that plays against them to perform well</p>

  <p><b>[Walter Mazzarri wins over Everton]</b> I’m very happy because even though they managed to score with their first chance, we showed great character as a team and managed to beat a very good team like Everton. We have worked a lot on set-pieces. This is another thing we’re happy about. It was extremely important, because we came from two games we didn’t deserve to lose. This gives us a lot of conviction and helps us be concentrated for the upcoming games.<br /><br /><b>[On the performance of Stefano Okaka]</b> He had to wait mainly because of his injury, but knows he showed how important he is to the team. If we would have had him before maybe we would have some more points at the moment, but we are very happy for him.</p>

  <p><b>[Walter Mazzarri has no fresh injury setbacks to worry about and will do late fitness checks on Valon Behrami and Craig Cathcart]</b> It doesn’t look so good. We will not get 20 opportunities there. We have to defend seriously and then make sure we take our chances when we get it.</p>

  <p><b>[At Inter, Mazzarri created another reputation: for producing increasingly far-fetched excuses for his team’s failures, most notoriously blaming a draw with Verona on some rain.

  <p><b>[Walter Mazzarri says <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> are not sure of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> safety yet as they prepare for West Brom test]</b> I try to instil in every player that we need to fight in every game. We saw West Brom’s quality in the last game against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. They have many points in the league this season and we must do our best to face them.

They’ve scored 19 goals from set-pieces.

Maybe out for the season, we do not know yets<br /><br />When we play three games, after the first game I look who is the most fit and I mostly concentrate on that. I might well decide who is going to play on Tuesday after the last session on Tuesday morning. I will speak to various people about who is going to play</p>
