<blockquote>
  <p>[Roller-coaster week ends on a high for Red Bulls playmaker Kaku] I think the coach had a good reason to have me come off the bench. In that game I was going to make more of a difference coming off the bench and the coach’s thinking was justified because of how things went.<br /><br />[On team’s inability to find a goal] A bit of both. I’m someone who fights for everything I play for. I felt like we played a great game, the ball just didn’t want to go in. We wanted to win that game, but I feel like the best is yet to come</p>

  <p>[Red Bulls dominate midfield battle in Hudson River Derby demolition] We knew the first minutes were very important and that’s why we started by pressing right away. That was the key to winning the game. By the 25th minute, we felt it after pressuring so much so we had to drop our line a bit to manage the ball better. We were all pressuring and all running and that’s what made the difference.<br /><br />It just makes things easier when you see everyone doing the work to run and press. If I see them running for me, to help me, I’m going to do the same for them</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Sloppy finishing dooms Red Bulls in CCL once again] The first goal would have been important if [<a href="bradley-wright-phillips.html">Wright-Phillips</a>] had converted. I think it would have changed the whole series because we would have jumped on them early and it would have complicated things for them. I think we played a good first half, good pressure, created chances, which was very important. That’s how games are though, if you don’t finish chances then the first goal is against you it can hurt you.<br /><br />I think we have a chance. We had to play in Tijuana and we played a great game and scored a bunch of goals. I think we have faith in ourselves and believe we can turn this around and win this series</p>
