  <p><b>[NFF president Melvin Amaju Pinnick remains hopeful that <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> will still switch countries while he is allowed to do so]</b> We will not relent in our quest for good players to play for the country and win laurels. We will keep talking to good players of Nigerian descent to play for their fatherland. But like you know, these kids are very independent-minded. In fact, we have been told to wait until April 2020, when he hopes to make a final decision on the matter. I told him that he stood a better chance of playing regularly for Nigeria than with England, which has a galaxy of strikers of the English stock</p>

  <p><b>[Will <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> switch country allegiances?]</b> I was pretty set on England really. It was flattering <b>[Nigeria wanted me]</b>, but for me my main focus was here. <b>[Nigeria]</b> tried to <b>[persuade me]</b>. I see myself as being a long-term England player - I am 100 per cent focused here to try and get into that team</p>

  <p><b>[President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Amaju Pinnick has stated the body is preparing <a href="joseph-yobo.html">Joseph Yobo</a> as a future Super Eagles manager]</b> When <a href="joseph-yobo.html">Yobo</a> was captain of the Super Eagles before he retired, I saw inborn leadership character in him. His charisma and the way he carried other players in the team was exceptional. <a href="joseph-yobo.html">Yobo</a> is a born leader. This is why the federation decided to appoint him as one of the assistants in the Super Eagles team. We are looking up to <a href="joseph-yobo.html">Yobo</a> to manage the Super Eagles in future and being part of the team’s technical crew will give him that opportunity to coach the Super Eagles in the nearest future. The late Stephen Keshi was also an exceptional leader when he was the captain of the Super Eagles. He later grew in the coaching job to handle the Super Eagles. <a href="joseph-yobo.html">Yobo</a> needs to be encouraged. This is not the first time a Nigerian retired player would be given this type of opportunity. Yobo’s presence in the Eagles will help the team</p>

  <p><b>[NFF claim ex-Spurs boss was never a candidate to replace Rohr]</b> I’m happy to announce the NFF and coach <a href="gernot-rohr.html">Gernot Rohr</a> have concluded all contractual discussions and he will stay on as coach of the Super Eagles. We have always had confidence in his abilities and we are confident that the national team can only go higher from here</p>
