  <p><b>[Roberto Soldado says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s iconic defender <a href="carles-puyol.html">Carles Puyol</a> is his toughest opponent]</b> I would say <a href="carles-puyol.html">Puyol</a> is the one who has made me suffer the most. I think it was like war with <a href="carles-puyol.html">Puyol</a>. He was the most aggressive defender there was, the most heavy-handed. Then he was the one who complained the most. But, yes, there was a nice rivalry there and maybe he’s the one who has given me the toughest battles<br /><br />With the passing of the years, my spell in England changed the way I played. Before maybe I was a player who waited a lot in the box, who didn’t get involved so much and now maybe, after going to England, you change that a little. I got more involved. But I know <b>[Granada]</b> have signed me to score goals and I’m going to do everything I can to score as many as possible. I’m delighted to be back in the best league, especially after two years in an inferior league to this one. The first two weeks I was here I did find it a little hard to keep up with the pace of training. The pace of training is higher here than in Turkey. But I think I’ve adapted well, I think I’m going to perform at a high level and I’m going to give everything I’ve got for my team<br /><br /><b>[Soldado also revealed some strict pre-match superstitions]</b> I always start to get change with my right side, I step onto the pitch with my right foot, I jump twice before going on. They’re habits or obsessions that make you feel confident when you do them, even if they don’t make a difference</p>

  <p><b>[Roberto Soldado says <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> has no limits to what he can do and is yet to reach his peak]</b> I always say that if there is one period of my career I’m not happy with, it’s my time at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. I also had <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>’s boom to contend with, I understood perfectly because you could see it from the start. I saw his level in training and it was amazing. I don’t think there’s a limit to what he can do; we still haven’t seen the best of <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>. When we did shooting drills … pfff. With both feet, he was prolific. He plays so well back to goal, gives assists, is intelligent, thinks quicker than before. Maybe he had struggled this season because the team wasn’t having the best time, but he’s continually improving<br /><br /><b>[Soldado confident <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> will get them competing]</b> I don’t know <b>[what went wrong for <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>]</b>. I still talk to <a href="danny-rose.html">Danny Rose</a> and <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Jan Vertonghen</a>, but about personal stuff. You could see it wasn’t working. <b>[Mauricio]</b> <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> had a very clear idea; he worked us very hard tactically and physically, which I think we needed after <a href="tim-sherwood.html">Tim Sherwood</a>. From the start, he connected with the dressing room and every year it got better. The level <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> got from the players was higher than anyone could have expected. <b>[But]</b> they lost consistency and maybe <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> needed a change. Now one of the best coaches has arrived and he’ll get them competing. Kane will always be grateful to <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>, I’m sure: his big change came with him. But he’ll trust <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> because he’s a great coach</p>
