  <p><b>[Oli McBurnie explains why he wears the smallest size of shin pads in matches]</b> They’re toddlers’ ones. They’re the smallest I can find. We never wear shin pads in training, and then you go into a game and wear them, so that feels alien to me</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a> has been challenged to become a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> superstar]</b> DJ actually rang me the other day when I was sat on a plane and said: ‘I can’t believe it, Oli, I couldn’t get a game <b>[on loan]</b> at Shrewsbury last season and now I’m at Man United. I can’t believe the mad way football works’. He thoroughly deserves everything he gets. I can’t wait to see him do it on the biggest stage and show what he can do. He knows exactly what he wants and how to get there. The way he’s developed and improved over the last six months has been unbelievable. You don’t have teams like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> after you if you’re not a top, top player. Everyone knows about his speed - he’s easily the quickest player I’ve ever played with - but all the other parts of his game have improved so much in the last six months, since he’s been introduced to first-team football. He’s been playing against experienced full-backs in the Championship and making them look like little kids.<br /><br /><b>[McBurnie once represented <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> in the 2013 Milk Cup]</b> He was asking me what United is like and a lot of things as I know some of the boys there and I am still in contact with them. He was asking me what I thought but his mind was already made up - 100 per cent he wanted to go there. The advice I gave him, anyway, was ‘United? You can never turn down that club. Go there and make yourself a superstar’. That is what he’s got to do and I’m sure United fans will see what he’s all about. He’s electric and the sort of boy who gets fans on their feet and a player all fans want to go to watch. He played a lot on the left but played on the right as well and up front at times. He’s by far the quickest player I’ve played with, with his press and his one-versus-one abilities, getting in behind. He’s a nightmare for defenders to try to pick up. The more he plays, with better coaching and quality of players to play with, he will only go from strength to strength<br /><br /><b>[<a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a>’s arrival is considered to signal a fresh approach from <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a>, with more emphasis being placed on acquiring home-grown talent]</b> It’s brilliant - 100 per cent. I think it just shows the talent, young British talent, we have at the minute. Clubs don’t always need to go abroad. It’s been a tough season or two for them but the way Ole <b>[Gunnar <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> apparently wants to go, with young, hungry players to go there, who really want to play for United is exactly what they’re getting with DJ. I think it’s a perfect route for them to go down</p>
