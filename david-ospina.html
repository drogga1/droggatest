  <p><b>[David Ospina has hinted at a summer exit at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, with the Colombia international goalkeeper admitting that he is open to everything]</b> I am open to everything. Today I give everything for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I like to be successful here, but you start to contemplate every alternative depending on each situation. I still have a contract, but as I say, I always like to have more opportunities, to have more continuity in the squad as every goalkeeper needs.<br /><br />Today, I am sharing my position with an excellent goalkeeper in Petr, but he knows that I like to play and I know he likes to keep playing, we have this competition between us, I just like to have continuity, I will think about the future at another moment.<br /><br />Today I live day by day, I don’t like to say anything about the future but i will make the most of every each training session and every moment at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. The manager has his reasons for deciding who does or does not get to play..Our position as goalkeepers is a very complicated one because you have less opportunities, in the team there is just one player who plays in that role, and who gets the support. I always try to do my best.<br /><br />Mistakes can happen but those mistakes (that the goalkeeper makes) are more visible to everybody, but I keep working, making the most of every opportunity that I have.<br /><br />When I speak to <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> he always tells me that he trusts me. I will keep demonstrating my skills each time I get to play, in every training session, and I will keep waiting for my opportunity that I have been waiting for, and I will make the most of it, as I did in my first year at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.<br /><br />As I always say; for me to be part of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> was and is a dream come true. When I used to think about it, it seemed so far away. I was able to materialise it and that’s why I like to do my best, to be outstanding at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s David Ospina is relishing the experience of playing in another cup final at Wembley. Serving as deputy to <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a> in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, Ospina has largely been restricted to appearances in the Carabao Cup, FA Cup and Europa League]</b> We were delighted. We talked about it a lot. It was great he did it at Wembley, too. For us Colombians Higuita is a really important figure. He did so much for the national team and the country. I have always had great respect for him, and it’s nice that he is remembered here for something special</p>

  <p><b>[David Ospina says Colombia and their immense band of supporters in Russia are not frightened by the prospect of facing England in the World Cup last 16]</b> We are a better team than four years ago. We are together, more experienced and a stronger squad of players than we were in Brazil. We have experience and good quality. Our players play in the best clubs, the best leagues, and are used to playing in matches of this size, so nothing will frighten us. England are a good team, but we did not mind who it was we would face. We just know we will give everything for our country and take strength from the support. We always give everything for our country. It’s such an honour to play for Colombia.<br /><br /><b>[One of the most notable aspects of Colombia’s campaign thus far has been their raucous fans and Ospina is certainly aware, with each match feeling like a home game]</b> The support has been incredible. It’s been our inspiration. There are Colombians all over the world but the support here, in Russia, has meant everything to us. It shows the passion and belief that we have in our country. It’s just amazing how many people have come here to support us. It has felt like a home game in every game for us. They make more noise, have more colour and we always have more supporters than the rest. It shows how much football means to our country. It’s not pressure, it’s strength for us.</p>

  <p><b>[Goalkeeper David Ospina believes Colombia can walk away from Russia with their heads held high after their elimination from the World Cup]</b> We’re going <b>[home]</b> sad, but now is the time to raise your head. <b>[The team]</b> left every ounce of sweat. We are running out of the adventure at the World Cup, but we are leaving with a clear conscience that we gave it everything on the field. As it is said, it is a lottery, there was fortune <b>[saving Henderson’s penalty]</b> at first, but then two failed and that’s how it is</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal keeper Ospina eyes South America return as <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> switch turns sour]</b> I knew this might happen. My current situation is that I am on loan for this season and there’s a clause based on the number of games, so if I play regularly, it’ll become an automatic purchase.<br /><br />When the situation doesn’t depend on me, all I can do is wait for the decisions to be made by <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. The club had just spent a lot of money on Meret, a young goalkeeper with a great future ahead of him, so I knew that when he came back from injury, this might happen. He’s a great keeper, a lovely guy and he’ll make a real name for himself in future<br /><br /><b>[At the age of 30, Ospina indicated he is open to a move that will bring him regular first-team football and expressed an interest in a return to his home continent]</b> I want to continue playing in Europe, although a return to South American football is always a possibility. I am open for a move closer to home</p>
