  <p><b>[Moment after Foe’s death]</b> We won the match 1-0 and the players were dancing in the changing rooms afterwards. Then <b>[captain]</b> Rigobert Song came in and cried and said ‘Marco, Marco’ and told us he was dead.</p>

  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen winger Leon Bailey may be lining out on British soil in the coming months]</b> I really wanted to make him a national player. I invited him several times, including to the Gold Cup in America and to international matches. I also tried to call him up when he was at Genk. But his step-father blocked everything.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Cameroon coach Winfried Schafer reveals how he got the best out of <a href="samuel-eto-o.html">Samuel Eto’o</a>]</b> Samuel was incredibly quick and a goal scoring threat. His problem was that he was early to the opinion that he was a great player. He did not always train full throttle when he was with us. So before a match at the 2002 AFCON I had a talk with him. I said: ‘Samuel, imagine someone saying in three years from now: ‘Eto’o, that was a talented player. What does he do now?’ Do you really want people talking about you like that?’ He shook his head and finally started to work. Today he is still thankful for these clear words<br /><br /><b>[Rows over bonuses got so bad, says Schafer, that the players were threatening not to play a November 2004 friendly against Germany]</b> It was a very tumultuous time. I remember that we flew to the 2002 World Cup in Japan and Korea five days late because the Secretary of Sport did not want to pay the players their bonuses they had earned with the qualification for that tournament. It was a joke, and the Germans benefited the most, because they came out top of our group. We did so well before the tournament, but these influences from outside are a real obstacle in countries like these. I never experienced as many strikes as I did in Cameroon. The game against Germany in November 2004 in Leipzig remains sadly unforgotten in that sense. At 5pm, three and a half hours before kick-off, there was the team meeting at the hotel. The players entered the room and said: ‘Coach, we won’t play’. I thought it was a bad joke, but they had not been paid again. ‘We will have a nice evening’, they said and headed back to their rooms. I contacted the <a href="dfb.html">German Football Association</a> to reach the president of Cameroon’s FA, because they had dinner. But he was not able to help me, because the Secretary of Sport was somewhere in Cameroon and did not answer his phone. In the end a guy from main sponsor Puma assured us that the players would get their money. It would have been a disgrace, if I had not made those calls that night. In the end, the players got dressed for the match in the team bus. Crazy</p>
