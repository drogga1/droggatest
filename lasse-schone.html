  <p><b>[PSV put up little struggle as their 13-game unbeaten run came to an end]</b> The way we won was great, we were lord and master. There was only one team that deserved to win.</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax midfielder Lasse Schone was also happy with the way his side limited the threat of Mauricio Pochettino’s team]</b> We didn’t play great after the break, but we didn’t give away much to a good team. The team deserves compliments for this. We fought for every metre. They didn’t get any really big chances in the second half either, they were mostly crosses. Moussa Sissoko did provide some dynamic, we had a hard time with that. At times we played very well. There was a lot of movement and that is how we created chances</p>
