  <p><b>[Tony Yeboah on his wonder goal for <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> It was live on *Sky, so no-one was watching anything else. On a Saturday you had games everywhere but on Monday, <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Nothing else. I wasn’t happy at first, not because I didn’t like <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> but because English football, the kick and rush, didn’t come naturally to me. I didn’t feel like I belonged there. But I played for the first time as a substitute against QPR, just a few minutes before the end of the game. There was no time to do anything but the crowd. I don’t know how much they knew about me or if they liked me but the way they treated me, the reception I got, was fantastic. It gave me strength. I was motivated. I thought, ‘You know what? I’ll make this happen.’</p>

  <p><b>[Former Ghana striker Tony Yeboah believes the Black Stars failed to win the 1992 Africa Cup of Nations title due to poor decisions ahead of the final against Cote d’Ivoire]</b> Nothing went wrong among the players during the 1992 tournament. It was the officials who were not honest to the players and that affected our performance on the pitch. However, just before the match, our coach Otto Pfister told us in the dressing room that he had just been given a letter from Accra, indicating that the captain’s band should rather be given to Tony Baffoe. Everybody was shocked to hear that news, so some of the key players were very disturbed and came to console me that I should not worry. But I told them not to worry about the treatment meted out to me but rather focus on the match and put up their best. There was no transparency and honesty among our officials, and this eventually affected our play on the pitch. In football, any trivial thing can affect a team’s performance, and I can say that the action of officials in 1992 was the main cause of our failure to win the trophy for Ghana</p>
