Now at the moment there are a lot of young players that the Swedish big players probably would not see too much or hear too much of.<br /><br />Certainly it’s a lot to ask of a young squad to come in. It probably takes a little bit of time but the problem is we don’t have that - we only have six games left. We have to be right on it.<br /><br /><b>[Keane says that he will not be retiring any time soon]</b> I want to become a coach, a manager but I want to play as long as I can. I see someone like <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a> retiring from football, and the two of us came through at the same time. I dread the day I have to finish playing because this is my life, and what I love doing.

  <p><b>[Defeat would have seen <a href="adam-nawalka.html">Adam Nawalka</a>’s side open up a gap of six points between the teams, which would have put a significant dent in Ireland’s Euro 2016 qualification hopes]</b> Defeat would have seen <a href="adam-nawalka.html">Adam Nawalka</a>’s side open up a gap of six points between the teams, which would have put a significant dent in Ireland’s Euro 2016 qualification hopes. When you go behind against anybody it’s difficult and when you’re chasing the game you feel like it’s not going to come, so to get that goal at the end it was certainly a relief and it was certainly deserved<br /><br />When you go behind and you equalize in the last minute of the game, it’s certainly a point gained. If we had scored earlier maybe <b>[it could be seen as two points dropped]</b> but when you score in the last minute, it’s a point gained. It’ll give us confidence going into the next game as well, knowing that we can keep going, fighting until the very end and get something out of the game<br /><br /><a href="james-mcclean.html">James McClean</a>, I thought he was brilliant when he came on. He put some tremendous crosses in. He put them on the back foot. When we’ve got players like that running at defenses, naturally they drop off and it pushes the whole team further up the field. Full credit to them, they pushed us to the very end and we got our rewards in the end. It would have been a dour atmosphere had we gone and lost that game, because we certainly didn’t deserve <b>[to lose]</b>. We’re still in it</p>

We’re very fortunate that we have a group of players in there who are desperate to play for their country and turn up when given the nod. I think the future is certainly bright</p>

I’m not a clown. I’m not here to entertain people. What’s that got to do with me being a coach? I like a laugh and a joke. We don’t want people coming in here as miserable f</em>cks. We want them to be happy, but for it to be done properly. It’s a serious job we’re doing<br /><br /><b>[The former Inter, Spurs and Liverpool striker was no happier when asked about rumours he took his Tottenham team-mates for a Christmas party without manager Harry Redknapp’s knowledge or permission]</b> I’m not answering these stupid questions. If you want to talk about me being here, no problem, but I’m not getting into cr*p questions like that. I’m not interested. Why talk about that. This isn’t about that. It’s about me being at Middlesbrough.<br /><br /><b>[True to his word, Keane was less combative when the subject turned to how he sees himself helping the players at his club]</b> You’ll have to ask the players <b>[if I’ll be a good coach]</b>. I know the game. I can help strikers and defenders because I’ve played against defenders for 21 years. I will demand the very best from players, it’s all about high standards. I want players to express themselves, like I did. We want players to have no fear, don’t be frightened to try things. We don’t want them to be robots. Use your imagination, be clever and cheeky around the box. Those are the players who win games. We will encourage that freedom. Then, it’s up to them</p>
