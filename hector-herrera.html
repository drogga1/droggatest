  <p><b>[Mexico stars vital to Porto’s hopes of beating Liverpool in Champions League]</b> The manager’s work has been very important for the season we’re having in the league as well as in the Champions League. His methods are simple but effective. I really like the personality and character he has. I think it’s something really important and something the club had been missing.<br /><br />I think it’s a great game, everyone wants to play this type of game and more than anything play against this type of opponent. We have to go for everything. We can’t speculate and see what happens. We’ve got to go out there and play our game and try to hurt them, not wait for them to come at us. We’re confident we can get out of this tie. We know it’s going to be very, very difficult, we’ll have to study the opponent really well and see how we can plan the match in a way that benefits us</p>

  <p><b>[Hector Herrera also acknowledged El Tri made serious mistakes that could have been costly]</b> The mistakes we made during the match cost us the result. I think we were superior for many parts of the match, we had the position, but like I said earlier we can’t make these kind of mistakes because we know at the World Cup you have the best teams and they don’t forgive you. We have to be conscious of the errors and hopefully they serve to make sure we don’t make them in the future so we can show our best. We should be happy to qualify, but with the understanding we didn’t have our best day, we made mistakes, and it cost us the result. In a World Cup if you want to aspire to the title you can’t do that. We have to take this loss well and get stronger as a group, so it can make us stronger for the next rival.</p>

  <p><b>[Midfielder Hector Herrera also labeled Brazil the best team in the world]</b> We believe in our work, in our quality and in the group of human beings we have. I think it’s excellent. The union, the happiness, everything that brings this group together, it makes us think that we can conquer important things together, transcending as a country, as players, as people, I think this is something that makes us really strong. Like I said the confidence there is in the group and every player, the coach, and every part of the coaching staff and staff is really important. It’s something that is going to take us through</p>

  <p><b>[Hector Herrera says he’s happy at Porto as transfer rumors swirl]</b> People often ask me if I’m leaving FC Porto, and, like I’ve told the directors and the coach, my head is here. I have also been saying that, when the day to leave comes, it will be because the chairman doesn’t want me anymore or because the coach or directors decided to sell me. Then, it will be time to think about something, but for now I’m here and I’m happy to be back with my teammates, my coaching staff, and to return to the Estadio do Dragao. It’s always a joy to play here. Now we need to keep a strong mentality and think of titles.</p>

  <p><b>[Hector Herrera lamented the lack of El Tri stars in Europe]</b> I respect their decisions and the ways they negotiate. I think that if the directors or the people in charge of that weren’t so egotistical … if they tried to see the future of the player, of the Mexican national team, because it involves a lot of things, if they did that there would be triple the number of Mexicans in Europe. Mexican soccer has really talented players and they could be in Europe.<br /><br /><b>[Mexico missed out on the opportunity to win its group and avoid a Round of 16 matchup against Brazil]</b> We started really well. The expectations were really high. Game by game, we lowered our collective level and at the end you saw that in the results. Against Sweden, it was a game in which they surprised us a lot. We didn’t react. Against Brazil I think we were up to the opponents. We were really good, but after came the distractions that come with this kind of opponent. There’s a thing that makes the difference: individuals. They have players who change matches<br /><br />Talking about that is an honor. To be able to be part of the national team, to defend your country’s color. You can be a key player, whether you’re captain or not, but it’s not something that is going through my mind. I give my best to get to the national team, to dream, to grow, to make history with the things we’re going to face together. Whether I’m the captain or not, we all have to do our part. We all have this mentality to want to be key players, protagonists. I don’t think one player can be more than another. There are players who are more known, that’s true, but everyone has to play their part. Imagine wearing the armband! Knowing who has worn it, it would be a double honor and double sacrifice. It would be the best thing that could happen to me as a player</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico midfielder Hector Herrera explains reasons for Gold Cup absence]</b> Through this release, I want to inform my motives for my absence for the 2019 Gold Cup. I find myself in need of recovering my peak fitness after the physical and mental toll of a season in which I have played more than 50 official matches with my current club - and additionally to have the chance to define my professional future. Thank you to all the directors of the Mexican national team and Mexican fans for their understanding. Thank you for your time and success to my national team!</p>

Herrera is expected to be unveiled as a Rojiblanco player on Thursday after the former <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> man put pen-to-paper on a three-year contract]</b> With this incorporation we strengthen our link with Mexico. After signing an agreement with Atlético de San Luis, our sister club in 2017, one of the most talented players in the country arrives, narrowing the affective link between Atletico de Madrid and Mexico even more. For all this, we welcome Hector Herrera to the family and wish him all the luck in his new home. With the arrival of Herrera, we incorporate a strong, skillful midfielder with quality. He is also a player with great experience in the Champions League. In his six seasons at Do Dragao he has played a total of 41 duels in the top European competition</p>
