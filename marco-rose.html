  <p><b>[Despite the success at every step of his managerial career, Marco Rose also shares <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s humility]</b> I’ll take this discussion seriously if I’m still asked the question after three losses in a row. We’re trying to work through everything objectively. If we had lost 4-0, I don’t think that anyone would have asked be about the German championship. The next day, we would have to read that never before had a league leader stood so little chance against the German champions.<br /><br /><b>[His pre-match press conference channelled his inner Klopp even more and made a statement both can hopefully continue to live by this season]</b> I think it’s cool to be top and we want to stay there</p>

  <p><b>[Marco Rose explain his football’s philosphy with his narrow 4-1-3-2 diamond midfield formation]</b> Maybe there are a few parallels with <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, but I’ve also found my own style. He shaped all of us. We picked up a few things in terms of football, but above all it was the way he was with people</p>

  <p><b>[Marco Rose says he is proud of Marcus Thuram for taking a knee in celebration after scoring against Union Berlin]</b> Marcus has made the point. He has set an example against racism that we all support<br /><br /><b>[Reflecting on a fine display from his side, which saw the Foals move up to third place]</b> Union Berlin fought back and kept going. With the ball we exuded a certain dominance, even if we may have made one or two simple mistakes. Nevertheless, we scored four beautiful goals and so I am very happy with the performance and of course with the result</p>

We’ll have to see how it develops. He will definitely be out tomorrow<br /><br />In addition, <a href="alassane-plea.html">Alassane Plea</a> has suffered an adductor muscle strain in training and will miss out on the game as well. Tobias Strobl, Denis Zakaria, Raffael and Fabian Johnson are unavailable, too</p>
