<blockquote>
  <p><b>[If Mourinho were to change things around to placate the player he could be seen to be favouring one player without it necessarily being for the wider benefit of the team]</b> As a leader you want to get the best out of them without pandering to them in ways that would actually result in allegations of favouritism or selective management styles by other players. Managers have a very difficult balancing act.<br /><br />The most talented individuals are most often the highest-maintenance items because they know they can dictate terms with far greater deftness than lesser-able individuals. There is a real danger sometimes of managers pandering to egos, and when we’re talking about team performance you just have to get the job done but we’ve also got to recognise there will be key players who may have particular needs that they want sensitivity to if they’re going to be part of that process<br /><br />Football managers are leaders like anyone else, but they are leaders in an industry which has eye-watering amounts of cash. These are businesses on a gargantuan scale, yet there is often conspicuous little management and leadership development going on. When something goes wrong it is quite the natural defence mechanism of the psyche to have a projective figure on which one can hang the blame, and in modern football that is increasingly becoming the manager. Not the board, not the chairman, not the chief-executive and not the star players. I suspect modern football managers have a far greater challenge than they had before, which means they’ve got to improve their management skills. It’s not just about being a great team coach, it’s about understanding and constantly developing the true nature of leadership while at the same time understanding the fact that one needs to get the best out of these expensive acquisitions. So there has to be a bit of give-and-take going on</p>
