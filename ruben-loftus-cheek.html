It is what my dad used to say to me as well, that I need to boss the midfield too. Ballack was a player that ran the game, while Lampard kind of worked off him.

But I need to see what happens this summer and right now I’m focused on staying fit and finishing the season well.<br /><br />I heard it a lot that I was going to be the one to break through <b>[from the academy]</b> but I wish I’d let that go earlier than I did. I realised to keep improving I needed to play more. It wasn’t easy not getting many chances but I knew I just had to keep working hard in training and take the opportunities when they came.<br /><br />I like to use the power I have. I had problems growing up. I had a sudden growth spurt at 15 or 16 and I got a lot of injuries as a result. I gained all this muscle and my bones couldn’t cope. I used to get so tired. But my body’s caught up with itself now, and I’m feeling good. And I’d obviously love to be involved this summer. We’ll see</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Loftus-Cheek has condemned the lack of faith shown in him by Chelsea and Antonio Conte]</b> It’s been so difficult to go from playing every game then get to the seniors and not be given a chance. It’s really difficult mentally, there’s only so long you just enjoy training with top players. From a year ago, I’ve improved so much from playing. A game situation is so, so, different. It’s hard to compare the faith of Gareth Southgate and Roy Hodgson and lack of Antonio Conte faith because Chelsea is a big club and managers are under pressure and maybe don’t want to take a chance on a young player. I don’t understand what’s going on behind the scenes fully<br /><br />That’s the key for me next season regarding where I end up. I want to play. I want to play as much as I can. Even this past season I didn’t play as much as I would have liked to because of the injuries. So I still feel I need a proper season of playing. I do understand Chelsea is a big club and there is always pressure on managers to win games and trophies. We’ll see what happens. I’m confident in my ability and that I can do well, wherever it is</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Loftus-Cheek has outlined his aim to remain at Chelsea]</b> At the moment, I am at Chelsea, my mind is on playing well here and improving here. I will always do my best, whoever is the manager. I will play well for myself and improve myself. Whoever the manager is, it doesn’t change how I want to play. I will always do my best and that’s just my mindset to improve myself. However that comes across to the manager is what it is. I look to play well for myself first. I think that the young boys have been doing really well. I don’t think the young boys will be handed chances just like that, you have to do well in training, you have to keep pushing so we will do that and see where we get to this season. There is still a lot for me to work on, there’s a lot of room for improvement so I will carry on working and hopefully I can do well this season. I have been back for just four or five days now, it was tough but I needed that so onwards and upwards. Let’s keep working hard and getting fitter.<br /><br />No, it’s not that difficult <b>[to perform at the World Cup]</b>. It’s the same, it’s still football. Obviously it was a successful summer with the England team and it was a fantastic moment for the squad. We have got to come back to club football, put that behind us and concentrate on the Premier League<br /><br />All the games are three points so we take that as a must win, all the games are hard in the Premier League so we have to be on it. We go back on to the training pitch and work at tactics and try to master the way that the boss wants to play. So we go back to it and get ready for Huddersfield</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Loftus-Cheek believes that if England can fulfil their potential they can challenge for top honours]</b> think we definitely have that potential. We have to have that belief to try and change things around. We are in this transition phase at the moment where we want to become one of the best teams in the world - up there with Spain, France and Germany. We want to compete with them and dominate football. We are in this transition phase where we want to have it mentally in our heads that we are one of the best teams in the world. It is that belief to have the courage to play in tight areas and try and play football rather than just going long. It takes time but we are working towards it.<br /><br />His frame doesn’t look like a frame of a footballer; he is tall and gangly, but he’s so sharp in his mind. He knows what he wants to do next, his technique - he looks like he has so much time on the ball. He takes two touches or one touch and he makes it look so easy. If a fast and strong player had that as well, you could dominate</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Loftus-Cheek is not thinking about a move away from Chelsea]</b> Possibly, but it is still far away, there are still a lot of games to play and I just have to see what happens. Right now, I am at Chelsea and my focus is at Chelsea and learning at Chelsea. That is in the future and we will deal with that when it comes. I’m not sure when I am going to play. It is just down to me working hard in training, I don’t know whether I am going to play or not play but for me it stays the same, I still train well and do everything the right way in case I do play.<br /><br />There are a lot of games coming up so I think there will be more opportunities coming for players that are not playing every week. We have to be ready and do our best when we get the chance. We had a lot of talks in the past couple of weeks and Sarri said to me that I need to learn tactically so a lot of my focus and effort is learning his tactics and his ways in training. I think the quicker I get then the more opportunities I will get to play. He is helping me and <b>[assistant manager]</b> Gianfranco Zola is helping me every day to learn it as quickly as possible and that is great for me<br /><br />I didn’t play as well as I want to but that was my first start of the season so I’m not too down on it. You know, it is the first start of the season and I will build on that, I’m a player where a lot of my game is based on physicality and I obviously didn’t feel my fittest but I will build on that today</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been urged to make a move away from Chelsea]</b> Any player will tell you it’s nice to score a hat-trick. It feels good. Hopefully there’ll be many more to come. The first thing in my head is to keep training well, even though I’m playing well it’s really important to train as hard as I can to keep fitness up and keep sharp for when times like this do come when I get an opportunity to start or come on. So first things first, I need to keep up the good habits - eating well, sleeping well and training well and if I keep doing that then good things will come.</p>

  <p><b>[Loftus-Cheek happy to keep learning from Sarri after hat-trick heroics]</b> He is asking me to improve defensively and positionally. We are working on it every day in training and he is very demanding with the team. He is so demanding on shape, but also wants you to play freely as well, which is why we can play such free flowing football. For a manager who has been in the game for a long time, it would be daft for me not to take on what he is telling me. He is a top manager. For me to learn from him is great for my development. I will keep on doing that. I will keep on listening and learning whenever I’m on the pitch or in training. As a player-manager relationship it works - we both have respect for each other. This is a good relationship.Yes, when you play it is different from training. You get to see the game, feel the game and it is easier to learn in that sense. Training is close to it but you still have to work in training, see it, to take it onto the pitch. You can see it more clearly on the pitch. In both training and games is where you get the feel for tactics and the smell of the game. I have never doubted my ability. It’s just hard sometimes to perform at your best when you are not playing regularly. So it is important to train well, keep your good habits - eat well and sleep well - so that when games like this come along you can be as close to your best physical shape as possible. I will keep trying to do that and it’s all I can do right now. There is still a long way to go. I want to keep being ambitious, keep improving and see how far I can go..<br /><br />I think my debut was still more special, just because you dream of that as a kid. The first time I stepped on the pitch for Chelsea at Stanford Bridge was in the Champions League and that was a special night. But this is close. I think it <b>[his last hat-trick]</b> was in the Under-13s. It might have been against Charlton. I remember scoring a hat-trick against them when I was young. But this was different. A European night under the lights, it is hard to describe the feeling. It’s a dream</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Loftus-Cheek says he is fully focused on earning his place in the Chelsea squad under Maurizio Sarri]</b> I see what’s in the media and I try not to look at it at all. I’m here right now at Chelsea and I want to focus on helping the team. When I’m on the pitch or in and around the team I can’t have any negative thoughts because it will affect the squad. So my head right now is focused on playing for Chelsea and learning Sarri’s way. Individually and as a team that’s all I can do at the moment, I can only think about what’s happening right now. There’s a difficult period coming up and we all have to be fully focused. There’s load of games so there’ll be plenty of rotation, we all need to be ready physically and mentally for that. I talk with the manager and it’s clear what he wants from me. We’ve talked a lot - you’ve heard him say to the press that I need to learn tactically. That’s what I’m trying to improve on day in, day out on the training pitch and the more I do that the more opportunities I’ll get to play. That’s the main focus right now. I have a good family and friends who help me when times are tough which is always good for me. I’m also strong individually to know what I want in the future. I will always believe I’ll get to where I want to be if I keep my head down. I try not to think too much about the future, especially not at a time like where you’re not playing so much, but that’s life. You have to deal with it. Every footballer goes through tough times. From playing a lot to not playing a lot is tough. It’s life, it’s football. These things happen and you have to be strong mentally as a player, especially nowadays. I try to take it in my stride. It’s all a learning curve so I’m just really focused and aware of what I need to learn.<br /><br />I’m trying to improve my all round game. Me scoring goals is looking good at the moment but I’ll look to improve on that. I always try to see myself as a goal-scoring midfielder. Hopefully I can build on this run. My mindset when I get the opportunity to play, whether that’s in the Europa League or in the Premier League, is that I have to do my best and try to make stuff happen, but also do what the manager asks of me defensively. So that’s my mindset and I want to carry on like that<br /><br />No <b>[I never thought about becoming a striker]</b>, I played up front for Antonio Conte in pre-season when we played two up front but that was only a few games in pre-season. That’s the only time I have ever played up front. I have played wide left and wide right so it is not something I would be scared of playing. I wouldn’t turn it down, I would play anywhere but I don’t see myself as a striker, no</p>

  <p><b>[Loftus-Cheek reveals how yoga and physio are helping his fight for Chelsea starts]</b> I was doing well at that point, playing every game, even if it was 90 minutes in a Europa League game and then 30 in the Premier League. I was doing that for a few weeks, I was doing well, and I wanted to carry on that momentum. But the back problem came again. I tried to push through it and manage it, to keep going, but it was one of those where if I’d carried on, I would have done more damage. I was distraught going down the tunnel <b>[against Nottingham Forest]</b>. I knew I just had to wait to get it right.<br /><br />I can’t force anything now. I will just do my best to get fit by training and pushing hard and show what I can do with my fitness to the boss. I’ve said that before (it’s behind him) because it has felt really good and then it has come back. I do have problems with my back, but I feel like now I am working with the physios, I think we have nailed it. Fingers crossed because I have had it since I was 17 and I have been trying to figure it out, trying to figure my body out.<br /><br />It’s been a tough couple of years with it, coming at the wrong time. Hopefully, we have got a routine to manage it now. It’s a muscular problem. I have a big curve in my lower back, and I’m a big powerful guy.<br /><br />I’ve been doing yoga. I’m not very good at it, but I have to start somewhere! Working with the physios, they know the best things. We have been working over the past year since I have been in the first team. As I’d get a niggle, you’d rule out a problem. It was just about ruling out all the problems to figure it out. When I thought it was right to return to training, I did, and I have had a few cameos now. It’s just about getting that confidence, that fitness, so the manager feels like he can start me in games. As a footballer, you want to be free in your mind, you want to feel physically good before you go on the pitch so you can focus on what you want to do. That’s when I had to decide with the physios. I knew I couldn’t play with it anymore<br /><br /><b>[Speaking after Thursday’s Europa League first-leg win over Dynamo Kiev]</b> We said that before the game how, as we were playing at home first, we wanted to get some advantage for when we go away because these away games are tough. We came out to start strong and could have had a lot more goals in the first half. But we got a nice win to take to Kiev. If we can win the Europa League - it is definitely our target - that would be great. Finishing in the top four is another target, so we have to be focused from now on and treat every game massively.<br /><br />Yes, we have had some ups and downs, but one thing we have done is stuck together. After the big loss against Bournemouth and Manchester City, things could have fallen apart. But we kept it together in the changing room, stayed tight, stayed as a group, stayed as one. We lost together and won together. We have come through it now. We are feeling strong as a group and have bounced back from those times. We are doing well at the minute and want to keep that momentum going</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Loftus-Cheek is hoping Callum Hudson-Odoi will make at Chelsea]</b> The fans have been great with me and Callum. Hopefully, that happens, but we’ll see. I know what he is going through, having been at that age in the first team as well. If I can help him do well, I’d love to do that. He is such a good kid and seeing him do so well I’m really happy for him. To give him that assist felt good. I think he is doing so well now, he wants to play. He is young, fresh, has that momentum. He is scoring so, when he doesn’t start and feels he should, it’s part of the game. I’ve told him ‘you’re at a big club, you’re young, just keep your head focused and keep doing what you’re doing’, as he did against Dynamo. He came on and did well. If he’s good enough, he’s good enough. I think the manager knows him well. He sees him in training every day, and he will make the decision. But Callum is doing well at the minute, and that’s all you can do.<br /><br /><b>[Loftus-Cheek was frustrated not to add another after he missed a second-half chance in his 30-minute cameo against Dynamo]</b> I’m still mad about it. I don’t know what happened. I was thinking ‘this is a goal’ and then it went over. It was a good run, but I’m still mad, that’s all I can say. It would have been way better if I’d scored. We know teams are going to be threatened by our attacking play and it is our job to break them down and find ways to get through on goal. Sometimes you play short. Sometimes you see David <b>[Luiz]</b> hitting the long balls to mix it up. He (Luiz) has really improved on that. It’s a good weapon for us to use. He played Pedro in a few times</p>

It’s difficult when you’re not playing as much as you’d like and you’re not playing 90 regularly.

Long term, though, I see myself as a box-to-box midfielder<br /><br />The Europa League is certainly where I’ve got my opportunities since the start of the season. It’s a good competition - European football is a test and something we want to do well in. I’ve got more chances to play in the Premier League off the back of it as well. We want to go all the way and lift the trophy in May<br /><br />To be honest, it’s not too different - it’s still a high level of football and playing under the lights at Stamford Bridge is always a great feeling. The one thing I’d say about playing in the Europa League is you have to be mentally strong. Travelling to grounds with hostile atmospheres and trying to win, grinding it out on pitches which may not be the best, is tough, so you have to be switched on<br /><br />It’s obviously not the Champions League, but it’s still a big competition and I think we’re good enough to win it. Playing European football is something you look forward to every season</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Loftus-Cheek has admitted to being one of those forced to alter his game in order to meet the demands of Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri]</b> He <b>[Sarri]</b> told me I needed to improve on my positioning and develop my defensive awareness if I wanted to play in midfield for him. But I worked hard on the things he had talked to me about and I think I’ve improved a lot on that aspect of my game, and he seemed to see the improvement and I think he sees me as a midfielder now too. I completely respect the honesty of that and it gave me something to work towards. I’ve improved off the back of it and now I’m playing in midfield, so he’s an honest guy.<br /><br />There are a few options in midfield and it’s all healthy competition for us, especially in training, pushing you to improve and do the best you can, to give you a chance of playing on the weekend. It definitely gives you that hunger and drive to be the best you can be in training, so it’s good for you personally and good for the team</p>

  <p><b>[Cesar Azpilicueta and Ruben Loftus-Cheek hailed the importance of midfielder Jorginho]</b> Jorginho dictated the play. He sucks players in which gives me space to turn and run at players. Second half we had most of the play, we were in control apart from a few counter-attacks.</p>

  <p><b>[Loftus-Cheek defends Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri from Blues fans’ boos]</b> I’ve played a lot in these last few weeks, more than I’ve done in my career. So I think I have to pay attention to my body and take care of myself because I don’t want another injury. When I feel that I’m a liability to the team, because I was getting cramp in my hamstrings just before I came off, and the minute I feel if I sprint it could go or I won’t be able to spring as fast as I can, then it’s just the right decision to put some fresh legs on. The fans didn’t like it but I tried to lift them because we didn’t need that atmosphere here. But it’s all for a good reason. Gianfranco <b>[Zola]</b> asked me five minutes before and I said I was good. But then I felt the cramp on a sprint and thought ‘let’s not risk it’. Obviously, Ross coming on and putting that penalty away - it’s all that matters<br /><br /><b>[Loftus-Cheek sees the clash in Baku on May 29 as the biggest match of his career to date]</b> It feels amazing to be in a European final. This is why we love football; it’s amazing. I was so nervous on the sideline. But it just felt amazing when Eden <b>[Hazard]</b> put that last penalty away, knowing we’re going to Baku for the final. I’ve been watching the <b>[Champions League]</b> games and I couldn’t believe it. It’s great for English football. It would feel amazing to be a main player in the team, with goals and assists, to then lift that trophy. I don’t know what that feeling would be like as I’ve never done it. But it would be amazing. So we’re looking forward to it. It will be a tough one. Firstly, it will just be amazing to be a part of a European final. It will be the biggest game of my career if I do play. But I look forward to it with all the excitement and fun that comes with it. And I think we have to do that, you know, coming into a big game like that we’ve got to be focused but also enjoy it. It’s such a big occasion that sometimes you can let it get to you but I think we just have to be relaxed and enjoy it and play our best football. Against Arsenal, another English side will be fun</p>

  <p><b>[Loftus-Cheek picks out his best position as he closes on <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> return]</b> It’s going well! It’s been a long time and I’ve had a few setbacks as well. It’s never been just a straight path but I’m close now … I’ve been running and moving, I feel I’m right on the edge. I’m close and I can’t wait.<br /><br /><b>[Loftus-Cheek, who made his <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> debut back in 2014, added on being one of the first academy stars to make a senior breakthrough]</b> It feels good to be the one who led the way for the boys coming through. It’s good to know that the boys look up to you as you have done it before them <b>[…]</b> and those boys who look up to me will soon have younger boys who will look up to them so it all goes hand-in-hand. The more academy graduates in the team, the better.<br /><br />I’m most effective as a box-to-box midfielder. Getting up and down, creating and also defending. I’ve played in a number of positions because I’m versatile so it’s easy for managers to move me around. I played left and right midfield at Palace but I managed to do well. That’s cool when you’re coming up but as I’m maturing I kind of want to nail down one position and hopefully that position is box-to-box<br /><br />I remember when I was at Palace and the World Cup was in the summer, I fractured my ankle and I was only back for six games before the squad was selected. That was a short amount of time but even then it was a target for me, so hopefully now I can get half a season of playing well and stake my claim. Obviously going to the World Cup and playing a little bit there helps - and hopefully playing regularly in the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team is the start I need to get back with the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Loftus-Cheek wants to emulate John Terry and become a Chelsea leader]</b> He was the best leader I’ve seen, not just on the pitch but off it. He was always organising and sorting stuff out to make it easier for us. On the pitch he was very vocal and was that character you have at the back who would organise and make you feel safe.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he can become a player others look to for inspiration]</b> Yeah definitely, but I think that comes with a lot of experience. I don’t think Chelsea can ever replace John. I’ve observed that and felt that feeling, and that’s something that comes with experience. The more experience I get, then hopefully I can be that person. We look up to the senior guys in the squad, observe them and see how they act and see how they lead - especially Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta. They’re two of the most professional footballers I’ve seen. David <b>[Luiz]</b> as well<br /><br /><b>[Loftus-Cheek believes he and team-mate Andreas Christensen - who is the same age - are ready to contribute more]</b> I think it’s time for us.

He’s such a talent and a player who has contributed to the club massively over the last seven years, the titles he has helped the club win. Everyone has enjoyed watching him play over the past seven years. I’m sure the club thanked him for what he’s done and if he does decide to move on then I wish him all the best.</p>

  <p><b>[Loftus-Cheek reveals extent of Achilles injury suffered last season]</b> I’ve had to learn to walk again. As soon as I came out of my cast, I could barely lift my heel off the ground in a sitting position. When it happened I turned and pushed off and I heard a clap, it was really loud and I thought someone had smashed me from behind. The referee gave a free kick, he blew the whistle so he must have been close to me, but watching the tape back nobody was near me. To lift my leg up took maximum effort. With a big injury it’s really hard, you don’t see a difference every day, you don’t wake up and think it’s a lot better every morning, it’s over a period of time. It’s more exciting the closer I get to making my comeback, the more I keep pushing. I will be there soon<br /><br /><b>[Unsurprisingly, given the new youthful look to this <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> side, Loftus-Cheek is looking forward to returning to the team, but he admitted the mental aspect of recovering from a long-term injury can be especially tough]</b> The big side of injuries is the mental side of it, so I had to stay positive and keep the right mindset. Even a tweet or a message from a fan makes a big difference to me. To be honest I didn’t leave my house much, especially as I’ve been on crutches. I’ve just been playing on my Xbox. I’ve been on holiday once, it wasn’t great as my leg was in the cast so I couldn’t swim and it was really warm. I’ve been at home with my mum, two brothers and my sister, they needed to look after me a lot. It was hard getting around in my cast. It was quite fun getting my sister to make me food all the time.<br /><br />My family have been fantastic through that period. When you have a good day you get excited, getting that much closer to getting back on the pitch again playing football, getting back in the gym and pushing it, so we will see how it goes. I’ve actually had a few setbacks that have put me behind which has been quite frustrating to be honest. Before I got injured I was playing my best football. I’ve missed feeling tired from running, from hard work, that feeling of being in a game again. I’ve only just got pain free but for sure I’m going to come back stronger, sharper and do whatever I can to be in better shape</p>

  <p><b>[Loftus-Cheek expects <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> title challenge as he prepares to end injury nightmare]</b> I was back training before lockdown but only just so I’ve been doing a lot of what the other boys have been doing, general fitness stuff, but I’ve also had some individual responsibilities to keep my Achilles in check, just to stop any further injuries. It’s been calf workouts and stuff like that, just keeping my body strong for whenever we go back<br /><br />It was frustrating for sure. I’ve put a lot of hard work into getting fit and had just finished what was kind of like my pre-season. I was training with the group and then doing my own stuff afterwards with the fitness coaches, which was really hard trying to get fit to play as quickly as possible. I’d been doing that for weeks and weeks and started to feel like I was very close but then lockdown came. It was frustrating but that’s life - I’ve just had to carry on keeping fit by myself. At the start of the season, I was still injured and at the start of my rehab but I didn’t know it would go on for so long. I thought it would be quicker so I had in my head if I can get back around midway through the season then I can hopefully build up my fitness and be sharp to be in contention for the Euros. Obviously it didn’t happen like that and it took me a long while to feel good in my body after my injury and have the confidence. Having the tournament next summer now is a good opportunity for me to stay injury-free, stay healthy and try to play my best football for when the time comes<br /><br />The young boys have done really well so credit to them. They’ve shown that they can play at this level and help the team win. The gaffer always said he would play academy players but they have to be doing well to play. That’s really encouraging for the youngsters coming through the academy in the future that they have a gaffer who’s willing to play them if they show they can play at the level. The whole squad have done really well this season, especially having no new players coming in and the team being very young. Considering those things and a new manager with new tactics and a new way of playing, we’ve done really well to be where we are at the moment. We’ve had times on the pitch where we know ourselves that we need to improve but that’s just football and if we can improve on what we’ve talked about as a collective then we could really be a team that’s in contention for titles in the future.</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Loftus-Cheek says playing behind closed doors will prove a mental challenge for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players]</b> I’m looking forward to it. Playing in front of an empty stadium will feel really, really weird, because we’re used to loud noises and not even being able to hear the bench shout at you. Now we’re going to hear everything and it’s going to have that kind of hollow feeling, which is a good mental test for us. I’m definitely looking forward to playing football again, no matter the circumstances. I don’t think it’ll be a problem for us, because as soon as you start playing, everything else kind of zones out anyway. You’re so focused on the game when you’re playing that sometimes you don’t even notice the crowd when they are there. I think this will be the same thing once it starts - you won’t even notice because you’ll be so focused on playing football.<br /><br />You never think this kind of thing will happen, and we went into quarantine earlier than others because Callum had symptoms. We didn’t know it was going to stay like that for so long! Once everyone knew this was not going to be over in a week, the fitness guys at the club came up with a plan for us to follow to keep us ready, and keep us ticking over until we came back. We’ve done some Zoom sessions online with the whole squad, doing some strength work, which was fun. Just to keep the morale there and chat to everyone was good. We ended up doing those group sessions twice a week, and there was a lot of banter flying about, which was good - and we obviously got the work done! It was just good to talk to the boys and see them. We were all logged into a fitness app too, so we could see what everyone else was doing, running-wise, and that was good to keep the competition up and keep pushing each other</p>

I played on the wing at the weekend, but I’ve played in midfield most of my career. Wherever I play I hope to bring what I can bring, my power and my strength, and try and get as many goals as possible. That’s what I did last season, getting in the box and trying to get goals, and using physicality in the middle of the park. I can’t wait to feel that power back and get my strength and speed to where it was last season<br /><br />The mood in the dressing room is really good, really bubbly and excited for it, especially coming off the back of a win. We’re obviously coming up against a really good team, and they can pose a threat, but we can pose a threat as well. We’ve got a really good team.
