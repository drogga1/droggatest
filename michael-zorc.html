  <p><b>[<a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> led Leverkusen 3-2 going into the final 10 minutes at the BayArena, but two goals in as many minutes from Leon Bailey and Lars Bender condemned them to defeat]</b> It hurts! It’s just very disappointing because we played a good game until the 80th minute and deserved the lead. Then we were just too passive at the crucial moments and allowed Leverkusen to turn the game. It was clear that Bayer had offensive quality, too, but we simply gave up on all four goals. At home we are an absolute power, winning most games confidently. That’s a fact. Part of our problem is that we can’t do it away from home - even if we play like we normally do for long periods. We have to make sure that we stop conceding so many goals</p>
