  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic boasts the ability and typically American self-confidence to be a £58 million star for Chelsea]</b> He’s a lad who comes with that typically American self-confidence. Many of his characteristics will help him in England where everything is just little bit more intense than in the Bundesliga. He has the pace, he’s got the dribbling, he wants to get ahead at all costs. I don’t know a single reason why he wouldn’t make it there.<br /><br />We took a collective decision with Christian’s family and his agent that we would transfer him in the summer of 2019 if he didn’t want to extend his contract with us. That decision was taken, and it then came to pass over the last few months. It wasn’t a case of talks with Chelsea starting at Christmas and being concluded on New Year’s Eve - this had been going on for weeks if not to say months</p>

The deal gives Chelsea security now and they do not have to enter a bidding contest in the summer, they have clarity and can plan with the player.<br /><br />It’s clear that Christian is leaving a gap, which needs to be closed by the summer</p>

  <p><b>[English teams have overtaken German clubs when it comes to producing young players]</b> Let’s go back say five or 10 years… there was a time that English clubs signed German players. There was a lot of discussion here: ‘It’s all about money you know, it’s too early for them to go from Germany to England.’ But, in the meantime we have the feeling that, yes, the education and development of youth players in the English academies is quite good, to be honest. The teams don’t only spend much money on transfers or salaries but also on infrastructure. When you see these youth academies - for example Man City - you can’t compare it with the German standard. It’s much higher, much higher.<br /><br />It seems to me that it’s something like a business model for them because even if they don’t succeed in their own teams they sell them for higher prices. I just read a figure of Man City - I think they’ve sold young players for more than €150 million within the last three or five years. You can recognise it also in results. You know the English teams are reaching under-17, under-19 <b>[finals]</b> compared to the German ones. It seems to me that they overtook us<br /><br />At the moment we do not have this absolute top quality in the German youth. Unfortunately I have the feeling that German football is being overtaken left and right. As far as 17 to 21-year-olds are concerned, we are simply not doing well in international comparisons, as was the case a few years ago</p>

It’s just very disappointing because we played a good game until the 80th minute and deserved the lead. Then we were just too passive at the crucial moments and allowed Leverkusen to turn the game. It was clear that Bayer had offensive quality, too, but we simply gave up on all four goals. At home we are an absolute power, winning most games confidently. That’s a fact. Part of our problem is that we can’t do it away from home - even if we play like we normally do for long periods. We have to make sure that we stop conceding so many goals</p>
