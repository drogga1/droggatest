  <p><b>[Jodie Taylor tells her story]</b> Never give up. Don’t give up on your dreams, whether that’s in football or in another sport. If you want something, then you go out and get it. I think that’s something that I’ve shown. It took a long time and it took a lot of things out of my control, but I stuck at it and I was persistent and eventually it happened, because that’s how much I wanted it. Follow your dreams and don’t let anything else get in the way</p>

  <p><b>[England striker Jodie Taylor says the buzz in the United States only serves as greater motivation for her after this summer’s World Cup]</b> My first home game back they did a ‘homecoming’ for all the international players. Obviously it was all about the U.S. players and they won and <a href="megan-rapinoe.html">Megan Rapinoe</a> so that was a little bit difficult, not going to lie. But <b>[it’s]</b> great to see my club team-mates doing well. You see the upside of it. There’s been more fans coming to games, more interest, the league itself during the World Cup got an ESPN deal … so it’s nice to be on that side of things. To know that the games are on national TV, more people coming to the games to support, we had sell-outs to our games which is huge, it’s been good. It’s hard seeing it in your face every day, they want it, all of the attention and everything they’re getting so, if anything, it’s more of a motivation probably to see, ‘right this is where we need to get to.<br /><br /><b>[The performances of Taylor and her team-mates in France did more than just impress and inspire those back in England too]</b> It’s actually interesting going back because we’re disappointed we didn’t go as far as we did and not beating the U.S and not getting the bronze. Then <b>[to]</b> go back to all our team-mates from all different countries and they say, ‘you guys are amazing! You really took it to the U.S., we thought you were going to beat them’. So, in a way, it was very complimentary that, we get put down in our expectations and disappointments, whereas actually the rest of the world though that we were really good. It was just nice to hear that<br /><br /><b>[With two goals in her last two games for the club, she has helped them do exactly that]</b> It’s coming to crunch time now with the play-offs and it’s all to play for. We snuck in to the top four and we’ve got a good chance of winning, like every other team in the top four<br /><br /><b>[Before that, Taylor has two friendlies with England in preparation for next year’s Olympics – starting with Brazil in Middlesbrough this weekend]</b> I’ve never played against Brazil I know we’ve played them a few times <b>[in the]</b> last couple of years but I think I was out with an injury every time we played them, so <b>[I’m]</b> very excited to be playing them. I heard there is going to be a really big crowd so I’m excited about that. I haven’t played much in the North East either … It will be nice to get back up there</p>
