  <p><b>[Kick It Out have released a statement on Regis’s death, expressing shock at the loss of a pioneer]</b> Kick It Out is shocked and saddened to hear of the passing of former West Bromwich Albion forward Cyrille Regis at the age of 59. Cyrille was a pioneer of English football, becoming one of the first iconic Black players of the professional game, alongside former Albion team-mates Laurie Cunningham and Brendon Batson. Following his career, Cyrille was a great supporter of the organisation’s work helping to tackle racism in the sport, kindly donating his time and efforts to Kick It Out on numerous occasions</p>

  <p><b>[Twitter believe they have made significant progress to stopping racism on their platform.

The number of posts such as these since the start of the season further highlights how discriminatory abuse online is out of control. Without immediate and the strongest possible action these cowardly acts will continue to grow</p>

  <p><b>[What is Kick It Out?]</b> <b>[We aim]</b> to significantly increase the awareness of inclusion and diversity, and the consequences of inappropriate behaviour across all levels of football. We aim to actively share good practice, critical actions, and partnership working to empower and support football organisations to develop their own responsibility towards greater equity and fairness. We aim to clearly show the importance of exposing inequalities and the positive value and impact that can be made through collective preventative action<br /><br /><b>[How Kick It Out responds to and deals with incidents]</b> Last night we received reports of racist abuse at <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> on social media after Chelsea’s <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Super Cup match.

We have always maintained an open and healthy dialogue with our partners in this space but we know we need to do more to protect our users.

  <p><b>[Kick It Out says <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> have ‘failed’ to combat racism after ‘sickening’ abuse toward England in Bulgaria]</b> We are sickened by the disgusting racist abuse directed at England men’s team tonight by Bulgaria supporters - including TV footage which appeared to show Nazi salutes and monkey noises. We applaud <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>, his staff and players for the actions taken in reporting the abhorrent abuse, and offer our full support to the entire squad, their families and anyone affected by those appalling scenes<br /><br />We are encouraged that the protocol was initially enforced by the match officials, but <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> must explain why players weren’t sent to the dressing room during Step Two, as is clearly stated in the rules. TV footage also clearly shows that racist abuse continued in the second half, so it is unacceptable that Step Three was not enforced. This match should have been abandoned by the officials. It’s now time for <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> to step up and show some leadership. For far too long, they have consistently failed to take effective action.<br /><br />The fact Bulgaria are already hosting this game with a partial stadium closure for racist abuse shows that <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s sanctions are not fit for purpose. There can be no more pitiful fines or short stadium bans. If <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> care at all about tackling discrimination - and if the Equal Game campaign means anything - then points deductions and tournament expulsion must follow</p>

  <p><b>[Kick It Out has demanded an overhaul in <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s disciplinary process in response to incidents of racist abuse]</b> We are disheartened, but not surprised, to learn of <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s response to the racist abuse directed at England players. In our view, they have missed another opportunity to send an uncompromising message on racism and discrimination. The current sanctions, however ‘tough’ <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> think they may be, are clearly not working and leave victims with little faith in their ability to prevent abusive behaviour. We feel <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s entire disciplinary process in response to racial discrimination should be overhauled and urge them to explain the decision-making process behind their sanctions for incidents of discrimination</p>

Whilst we continue to collaborate with social media platforms to ensure a safer user experience for all, these cases should be investigated by law enforcement and the abusers should face criminal sanctions</p>
