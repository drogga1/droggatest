That would be a big loss for the national team. Also, a human loss - for Bastian is the captain and holds the team together. He is still an absolute role model. If he should be fit for the European Championship, it will be an important component for Joachim Low, if Bastian can bring consistent performances. If he gets match practice and, therefore physically fit, he is still a highly intelligent player</p>

But <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> will stay top of the league because overall they simply have more quality. <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> experimented a lot in the first half of the season but he’ll know his favoured formation now. I’m convinced <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> will only get better from now on<br /><br /><b>[q: ill Leipzig continue to cause a sensation?]</b> I think Leipzig are the only side that can challenge <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> this season, as the others are just too far off the pace now. I don’t think Leipzig will ‘do a Hoffenheim’ and fall away <b>[TSG were top of the table at the halfway mark in 2008/09 but ended up finishing seventh]</b> because this Leipzig team is very stable and solid. Experience plays a big part and it will be interesting to see how they react if they lose two or three games, but they have those home matches coming up so that should help them find their rhythm quickly<br /><br /><b>[q: Can <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> still finish above Leipzig?]</b> I think <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> definitely have enough to finish in the automatic Champions League qualifying places, and that has to be their aim, but they’ve not met their expectations so far this season. They’ve had injuries but the squad is big enough to compensate for that - they’ve simply lost games and dropped points unnecessarily. I think they’re the only side that can challenge Leipzig <b>[for second place]</b><br /><br /><b>[q: <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha Berlin</a>, <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> and Hoffenheim have all surprised us this season. Which team do you think has the best chance of finishing in the top four?]</b> All three of them have played to their limits this season and I don’t think they’ll all be able to play so consistently well over the second half of the season. However, if I had to pick one, I’d say <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Frankfurt</a>. They have a strong team, good variation in attack and it seems a more relaxed environment than at the other two clubs. <a href="niko-kovac.html">Niko Kovac</a> is also doing tremendous work as coach<br /><br /><b>[q: Can the traditionally bigger clubs like Bayer 04 Leverkusen, Schalke, Wolfsburg and Gladbach still qualify for the Champions League?]</b> All of those clubs are under massive pressure after a weak Hinrunde, so if they suffer any setbacks, it will be very hard to compete for the European places. They can’t really afford to lose games, and I think it will be hard for them to produce top performances. But if I were to pick one of them, it would be Leverkusen. Again, the climate there seems to be calmer and more relaxed, which isn’t always the case for Schalke, while Gladbach and Wolfsburg are too far behind now</p>

  <p><b>[Former Bayern Munich head coach Ottmar Hitzfeld has tipped Jurgen Klopp to one day manage the Bundesliga champions and the Germany national team]</b> Jurgen Klopp has done sensational things. In the Champions League, Liverpool have outgrown themselves. He pushed the team with his enthusiasm. Getting ahead of Manchester City was a bit of a sensation. They are also stronger away from home because they can then counter with Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino. Klopp has finally made the breakthrough there. I am even convinced that he will create an era in Europe with Liverpool. He has already proved in Dortmund that he can win titles.<br /><br />I still think he has the skills to be a Bayern coach - and that he will be. I also believe that he will eventually become national coach. He is still young and he would be the ideal man for both posts: he is a sympathiser, a motivator and he has contributed a lot to the German football culture. Maybe he will be first Bayern and later national team coach - after spending three or four years in Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Lewandowski has been branded an egotist]</b> I was disappointed when I saw the TV pictures. This is of course a no-go. How he behaved towards a respected person like Jupp Heynckes is wrong. When a coach substitutes a player, it is the most normal thing in the world. Then the player has to go off, clap the new player coming in and wish him good luck. It’s not just about respect for coach Heynckes, but also about respect for Wagner.<br /><br />Every striker is a bit of an egotist. He has to score goals and is measured on goals. That’s his job. But it is important that the team works. Lewandowski has shot himself in the foot with these actions because they will be criticised not only within the club, but also within the team<br /><br />Bayern do not need money, they do not have to take millions to sign a new player. Bayern Munich are very healthy and stable, a leading club which everyone has respect for. I believe that Lewandowski has a new advisor who wants to offer the player everywhere, of course, who wants to push the price up a bit and maybe even raise his own salary. But it’s ultimately about Lewandowski - and I’m very angry about his latest performance. That’s not Bayern Munich-like</p>

After all, this is what everyone longed for. Now Dortmund are in front again because they have played really well. The question will be how they deal with setbacks. I still believe that Bayern will be champions in the end. The season is long and Bayern should never be written off.<br /><br />If things are not going well, you always have to live with criticism at Bayern. And then, of course, the players have to stand up, which they are not used to. That should not be overstated. I think very highly of Niko Kovac. He is a leader and a personality and therefore definitely the right coach for Bayern Munich. But of course he also needs the quality around him to get the most out of his side.

They have played against Portugal many times and won some games, lost sometimes. They know how to beat Portugal. With the potential that Switzerland currently possesses, a victory in Portugal is also possible.<br /><br />I think you have to count England among the favourites, because they just pulled up outstanding players from the junior teams. And the young players who play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, despite the many foreigners, they are already very good. But that is also a disadvantage for the young English players, that so much money has flowed to England and you have signed only foreign top stars.

  <p><b>[former <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> and <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> boss Ottmar Hitzfeld says <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> can be like <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a>, but he’s not there yet]</b> I think <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> can become like <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a>, but he’s not ready yet. Nevertheless, it was of course a superb transfer from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> in the winter, because <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> is already a special player. He is incredibly mature for his age, has great qualities and is ice cold in front of goal because, despite his size, he is extremely quick.<br /><br /><b>[on <a href="gerd-muller.html">Gerd Muller</a>’s all-time record for a single campaign and <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a>]</b> I think he can do it. He has the necessary class and excellent team-mates at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> to help him achieve this goal. The numbers speak a clear language. <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> plays a significant role in the success of <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>.<br /><br /><a href="david-alaba.html">David Alaba</a> has convinced me as the new head of the defence, while <a href="joshua-kimmich.html">Joshua Kimmich</a> plays inconspicuously but very efficiently. And of course you have to mention <a href="thomas-muller.html">Thomas Muller</a>. He is in top shape again and extremely important for the team because he creates space and scores crucial goals<br /><br /><b>[Hitzfeld is also pleased to see <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a> impressing in a prominent coaching post]</b> I appreciate him very much because he is a meticulous worker, a very good tactician and, above all, has excellent leadership. In the first leg against <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, he got <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> back on track with the 4-0 home win. That was extremely important for him in order to gain a foothold in the new role. <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a> has changed the mood in the team and the club. As a result, he has the necessary backing that you need in Munich. I trust him that he can shape an era at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, but of course you have to win titles<br /><br /><b>[A heavyweight contest will take place behind closed doors, amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, with Hitzfeld saying of that situation]</b> That is certainly an advantage for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. You can generally see in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> that the referees are not influenced by the mood and benefit the teams that have more quality. In a cauldron, in particular, mental strength often determines the outcome of the game. That is now completely eliminated</p>
