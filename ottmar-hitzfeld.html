<blockquote>
  <p><b>[q: Ottmar Hitzfeld, do you think <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> will run away with the title or will it be a tight race at the top?]</b> Bayern play four of their next five league games away from home, while Leipzig play three of their next four at home, so I think it will still be tight for another few weeks. But Bayern will stay top of the league because overall they simply have more quality. <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> experimented a lot in the first half of the season but he’ll know his favoured formation now. I’m convinced Bayern will only get better from now on<br /><br /><b>[q: ill Leipzig continue to cause a sensation?]</b> I think Leipzig are the only side that can challenge Bayern this season, as the others are just too far off the pace now. I don’t think Leipzig will ‘do a Hoffenheim’ and fall away <b>[TSG were top of the table at the halfway mark in 2008/09 but ended up finishing seventh]</b> because this Leipzig team is very stable and solid. Experience plays a big part and it will be interesting to see how they react if they lose two or three games, but they have those home matches coming up so that should help them find their rhythm quickly<br /><br /><b>[q: Can <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> still finish above Leipzig?]</b> I think <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> definitely have enough to finish in the automatic Champions League qualifying places, and that has to be their aim, but they’ve not met their expectations so far this season. They’ve had injuries but the squad is big enough to compensate for that - they’ve simply lost games and dropped points unnecessarily. I think they’re the only side that can challenge Leipzig <b>[for second place]</b><br /><br /><b>[q: Hertha Berlin, Eintracht Frankfurt and Hoffenheim have all surprised us this season. Which team do you think has the best chance of finishing in the top four?]</b> All three of them have played to their limits this season and I don’t think they’ll all be able to play so consistently well over the second half of the season. However, if I had to pick one, I’d say Frankfurt. They have a strong team, good variation in attack and it seems a more relaxed environment than at the other two clubs. <a href="niko-kovac.html">Niko Kovac</a> is also doing tremendous work as coach<br /><br /><b>[q: Can the traditionally bigger clubs like Bayer 04 Leverkusen, Schalke, Wolfsburg and Gladbach still qualify for the Champions League?]</b> All of those clubs are under massive pressure after a weak Hinrunde, so if they suffer any setbacks, it will be very hard to compete for the European places. They can’t really afford to lose games, and I think it will be hard for them to produce top performances. But if I were to pick one of them, it would be Leverkusen. Again, the climate there seems to be calmer and more relaxed, which isn’t always the case for Schalke, while Gladbach and Wolfsburg are too far behind now</p>

  <p><b>[Ottmar Hitzfeld on replacing <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a> and Franck Ribery]</b> Bayern are already preparing for the future, but <a href="arjen-robben.html">Robben</a> and <a href="franck-ribery.html">Ribery</a> are guaranteed starters when they are fit. You cannot replace players like them from one day to the other. They are not only top players, but are also on another level<br /><br />So the strategy should be to slowly build up the players behind them. Players like <a href="douglas-costa.html">Douglas Costa</a> and <a href="kingsley-coman.html">Kingsley Coman</a> are already playing regularly. They will have to step it up a notch. They were brought in to grow at Bayern. But you cannot expect them to just be at the same level as <a href="arjen-robben.html">Robben</a> and <a href="franck-ribery.html">Ribery</a> right away. Both are world-class attackers. They always have a solution on the pitch and their desire to keep going is impressive. Talent alone is not enough to become a world-class player. Bayern should be proud to have them on their books</p>

  <p><b>[Ottmar Hitzfeld on <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>]</b> I admire <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>. I have nothing but huge respect for a coach which exposes himself to this amount of pressure at a top club for so many years on a daily basis, rebuilding the team every year. I could imagine that he will go on after this season. He’s still on fire. His biggest goal still is winning the Champions League. And I would like to see that happen to him<br /><br /><b>[Ottmar Hitzfeld on Thomas Tuchel]</b> <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> managed to win their group ahead of Champions League holders <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a>’s tactics convinced me totally of his ability during these games. The match in Madrid was beautiful, and made his mark in Europe. He has the potential to be one of world’s best coaches one day<br /><br /><b>[Bayern vs <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in the Champions League]</b> The gap is not huge anymore, but Bayern is still the favourite as they have the better substance in players, the better bench. But <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> has stabilised. Bayern must not concede in the first match at home, what will be very difficult against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s fast players. Their counter attacks are very hazardous for Bayern</p>

  <p><b>[Ottmar Hitzfeld urges <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> to stick with <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> amid mounting pressure]</b> They have had bad results and at Bayern every game is going to be analysed and reported about. <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> has kept calm. This shows his experience. He knows that we cannot be in top form on the first, second, third matchday, that would not be good, because when they then come to the important games in the Champions League, in about eight weeks’ time or next year then, it is not ideal to be in early <b>[good]</b> form<br /><br /><a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> is a practitioner. He knows what is important, and he is also a trainer who rotates a lot, giving many players a chance to gather game practice and he knows how to use the <b>[resources]</b>. So, therefore, <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> is a very good coach for me<br /><br />The most important thing is always the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and they have managed to win it with a clear lead.

And in the Champions League the hope is big, of course, to reach more than the quarter-finals. And I would say, to be in the semi-finals with Bayern, among the best four teams in the Champions League or in Europe, then the task has been fulfilled. This is a top value, <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> has always done that, and even <b>[though]</b> there was a bit of criticism about not reaching the finals… <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> is still on a good <b>[path]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Former Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld feels their ‘outstanding’ young players give them a chance of glory at the Nations League Finals]</b> Switzerland have outstanding young players. They have very good players with foreign roots who are all perfect football players. They have a good set up with Fabian Schar, Yann Sommer, Granit Xhaka, Haris Seferovic, or Xherdan Shaqiri. And Breel Embolo is on his way. They have great talents. Switzerland can do a great job in the coming years. Now, against Portugal, the chances are 50-50. They have played against Portugal many times and won some games, lost sometimes. They know how to beat Portugal. With the potential that Switzerland currently possesses, a victory in Portugal is also possible.<br /><br />I think you have to count England among the favourites, because they just pulled up outstanding players from the junior teams. And the young players who play in the Premier League, despite the many foreigners, they are already very good. But that is also a disadvantage for the young English players, that so much money has flowed to England and you have signed only foreign top stars. But if you make the step then you have a really strong team and are on your way back to the top of the world</p>

As a coach, I experienced many talents who then fell by the wayside<br /><br />Bastian was one of the best German footballers of all time. He has shaped German football with his unbelievable intelligence for more than a decade as a symbolic figure. For me as a coach, it was not difficult to shape him, because his great talent was already there. Bastian was born as a footballer, you do not have to do much, just lead.
