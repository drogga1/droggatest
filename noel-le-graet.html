  <p><b>[FFF president Noel Le Graet admits Euro 2016 concerns after Paris attacks]</b> A lot of precautions were taken, but we can see that terrorists can strike at any moment. We were already worried about the Euros; now we worry even more. But now, my thoughts are with the families.</p>

  <p><b>[FFF president Noel Le Graet has admitted his affection for Karim Benzema]</b> Those who say it has been badly managed, that is their problem. We are straight-up people in the Federation despite the fact we are often attacked. This case is disappointing and it hurts us and, yes, there is affection <b>[for Benzema]</b>. But because I love him it’s like I have become dishonest. But I manage this situation as I see fit. I’ve always been pretty close to Benzema because I knew about his childhood difficulties. Maybe I have that side of me. But I have never seen such media treatment. Never.</p>

  <p><b>[FFF president believes Karim Benzema another chance despite being carried away by stupidity in the Mathieu Valbuena case]</b> Maybe I have protected Karim excessively in this matter, but I really like him and we all make mistakes. He got carried away by stupidity in this case. He has been stupid like a donkey. But I don’t believe in lecturing people. There are good and bad people in all environments, among teachers, among businessmen, anywhere. Benzema comes from a difficult environment and he got carried away. Karim is a guy I really like. People talk to me about the way he expresses himself, but we take everyone as they are. Football is like that.</p>

  <p><b>[French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet is hopeful France coach Didier Deschamps will remain in the role beyond 2018]</b> I have talked to him about it and he doesn’t know how to spell Chelsea! More seriously, I extended his contract to avoid speculation on his future ahead of the competition. Afterwards, it will be his choice. I hope he stays until 2018, and even beyond. He has a contract. We will not throw him out of the window. I would like him to lead us at a second World Cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid attacker Karim Benzema is available for selection for the France national team]</b> He’s up for selection, he’s not suspended. If Didier wants to pick him, he can do when he wants. He has total control. There’s no problem with Benzema; if he continues to play well, one day he will return. I’ve got enormous respect for the guy on a sporting level, he’s the greatest French scorer in European football, and he’s a starter with Real Madrid, which itself isn’t easy. The quality of the player is not up for debate</p>

  <p><b>[French footballing legend Raymond Kopa has died, aged 85]</b> The death of Raymond Kopa plunges the Federation into immense sadness. His is a terrible loss for French football. He was a symbol and a front runner. His career with his clubs as well as with France was exceptional. Everyone will remember his exploits that will remain unmatched. He was a player and a man of class. I extend my deepest condolences to his family and loved ones.</p>

  <p><b>[Karim Benzema has no hope of forcing his way back into the France national team]</b> I’m not sure who wrote that, to be perfectly honest. The comments I made about him had nothing nasty about him. On the contrary. I remain the only person who has declared consistently that he’s a great player, but the France team for him is over. I’ve never said otherwise.</p>

  <p><b>[Nabil Fekir has passed his Liverpool medical and will become the Reds’ latest signing]</b> He’s in the middle of negotiations and I think it’s done. I spent 15 minutes with him this morning <b>[Saturday]</b>, and he’s worried by the France team. He’s in good spirits. He passed his medical in Clairefontaine. That’s logical, we’ve done it for other players. He was looking forward to it because the visit he had was positive.<br /><br />It’s always like that when you talk about a transfer: each tries to raise his price, to lower his price, when there’s a hiccup someone wants it reduced. It’s part of the game<br /><br /><b>[he confirmed his wish to see Fekir complete his switch to Anfield before the World Cup begins]</b> It would be better for him, but he’s not perturbed</p>

  <p><b>[On Karim Benzema]</b> The Valbuena-Benzema affair had another episode last week, but it is still not over. It’s been three or four years. It should have been judged much faster and it is rotten for us.

So I would also like to thank <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> for its trust and <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> can count on France to be disciplined in the best way possible.

  <p><b>[French Football Federation President Noel Le Graet says <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> would improve in Europe with a ‘more French’ approach]</b> <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> will win when they have a real team. When they find a formula that is maybe a little more French. I am sorry but I believe that in every country, the base of the national team is often in a big club.<br /><br /><a href="psg.html">PSG</a> have an international team, which is magnificent. Except that they don’t get beyond the quarter-finals. So we have to ask ourselves some questions. It isn’t a criticism. Myself, I would like our country to become better ranked thanks to <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. The other teams are working, but they are a long way off<br /><br /><b>[Manager <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a> was without <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> for both legs of the tie due to a foot injury, though his disbelieving pitchside reaction to <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>’s winner went viral after the game]</b> Fragile, I have the impression that he is injured quite often, despite himself. The player is fantastic. When you watch him play, it makes you happy. That said, he hasn’t been present for the big competitions; often injured, often absent, not there for the big games in the Champions League, often absent with his team in Brazil. I don’t know enough to criticise him, but maybe it is because of his lifestyle … but I put a big maybe there. I don’t want to criticise him without knowing for sure. He is an extraordinary technician, and he has helped <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> financially with his marketing, but that isn’t enough</p>

  <p><b>[Le Graet criticises referees for stopping matches, saying homophobia was a society-wide issue]</b> I would not stop the matches. It’s a mistake, totally, because I don’t want to be held hostage to homophobia. I would stop a match for racist abuse, that’s clear, or for security reasons. We’re going to make sure the banners disappear, there is security to make sure that happens, but stopping matches is something else. It’s not football but society in general that has to think about the problem, at school and in companies, everywhere<br /><br /><b>[Addressing the fans responsible, Le Graet wanted to make clear that he wanted to see all forms of discrimination stamped out, even if he doesn’t think the matches should be stopped]</b> Do not come to the stadium with banners, it’s as simple as that. You can support your team, but <b>[homophobia is]</b> absolutely wrong morally</p>
