  <dd>On 14 June 2002, Japan’s moment in the spotlight arrived. The whole world tuned in to watch them draw 2-2 with Belgium before registering a memorable 1-0 win over Russia just five days later. However, it was the final group game against Tunisia that saw a nation’s dream come true. Japan were already leading Tunisia in the Nagai Stadium, leaving them on the cusp of qualification to the knockout stages. Then, with 15 minutes remaining, the indomitable Nakata popped up with a telling goal to seal a place in the round of 16 of World Cup 2002. Nakata had reached his pinnacle.</dd>

  <p><b>[The Japanese football legend has spoken about the upcoming World Cup in South Africa]</b> The World Cup in 2002 was the biggest festival I have ever seen in my life. It was not just about football it was about different people trying to engage culturally. I have never seen anything like it. The energy of the people, all the people, was amazing. I’m looking forward to visiting South Africa again next year for the World Cup. I just want to watch some good matches and enjoy a good atmosphere. I am sure there will be good matches and good organisation next year.</p>

  <p><b>[World Cup 2010 - Mexico Will Beat South Africa 2-1]</b> The host country are always strong, especially in the opening game. This atmosphere is tougn for any visiting team to play in. South Africa have looked better recently and have got some good results. But Mexico are a good team and are looking strong. I think they will be too strong for South Africa and win 2-1.<br /><br />The atmosphere here is wonderful and I am looking forward to a great World Cup. It is going to be something special I think and one we will always remember. The vuvuzelas are the symbol of South Africa and we can really feel that we are in Africa when we hear them</p>

  <p><b>[Inspiring Others to Join the Movement]</b> I am honored to be joining the Special Olympics movement as a Global Ambassador. I decided to get involved because I know from experience, how sports can empower change on and off the field. Through unified sports, Special Olympics is breaking down barriers that exist for people with intellectual disabilities. And being able to help inspire others to join the movement, get involved and help put an end to the issues of isolation and discrimination is a remarkable feeling. I look forward to doing even more for the organization in the future, especially leading up to the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games</p>

  <p><b>[in 2006, aged 29 years old, Hidetoshi Nakata announced his retirement]</b> I played because I loved <b>[it]</b>, but I was losing a bit of passion for football. My people came to stop me but I said: ‘Please cut my contract. I don’t need any money anymore, just let me leave’. <br /><br /><b>[Nakata says he sometimes misses football but never regrets his decision]</b> I need to respect my emotion, my decision in the past. Otherwise, I just I can’t be myself, right?<br /><br /><b>[Hidetoshi Nakata left Japan for Europe aged 21 to pursue his football career]</b> All my life I just played football, basically. Every country I went … people asked me about Japan but I didn’t know anything about it. That’s a part of my life, so I need to become a better Japanese person. <b>[Returning home in his early 30s, Nakata says he jumped into a Toyota Harrier and visited all of Japan’s 47 prefectures, with the aim of getting to know his home country]</b> I thought maybe it’s going to take three to four months, but actually it took me seven years to finish <b>[the project]</b><br /><br /><b>[Of the japanese craftspeople he met, Hidetoshi Nakata says:]</b> I was fascinated <b>[by]</b> their quality of life, quality of <b>[their]</b> product. Their dedicated life was so amazing. Today, all over world, craftsmen are disappearing – not because they are losing their value but because people don’t know about them<br /><br /><b>[sake makers]</b> need to do everything because times have changed. There are so many people who want to know about Japan, Japanese culture, craftsmen but there is no connection between. So, I thought I could be a bridge between them<br /><br /><b>[But even as Hidetoshi Nakata pursues his new passion for sake, japanese culture and craftsmanship, he says he doesn’t want to be remembered for it]</b> I’d just like to disappear as clouds. It’s like the same as nature. Like wind, you can’t see it, but sometimes it makes you happy. That kind of thing, I’d like to be</p>

  <p>Chocolate, for the most part, has its own sweetness, so it’s a case of being conscious of how we can properly express the characteristics of the nihonshu, the umeshu <b>[a plum-based liquor]</b>, or the yuzushu, and each of the component parts like the plum or the yuzu <b>[japanese citrus fruit]</b> Added to which, when we then combine the two, it’s really important that this combination brings out the best of the KITKAT chocolate<br /><br />Thinking about the landscape surrounding the nihonshu industry now, it’s something that young people are getting into, and there is a lot of interest in it from overseas, too. But for these people the culture of nihonshu is actually quite new to them. More so than wine. It seems in this way there might be an affinity between nihonshu and KITKAT. I think there’s a similarity between both sets of fans. KitKit is known throughout the world. And while the nihonshu industry might be a traditional one, I think something like the KITKAT can be a platform from which to broaden its appeal</p>

  <p>When we were thinking about using umeshu <b>[a plum-based liquor]</b> for the second version, it wasn’t just about the umeshu. We wanted to highlight the connection between the plum and the production area, Wakayama Prefecture. So when it came to making the choice for this version, of course, I wanted to maintain that connection. In terms of what agricultural produce to use, well naturally, it needed to taste good as a component of sake as well as be a suitable fit for the KITKAT. I thought yuzu <b>[japanese citrus fruit]</b> would be good for this</p>
