  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz has urged young managers to implement their own style and not copy the likes of <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> or Jurgen Klopp]</b> Be yourself! Try to develop your own style and not copy others. Do not be a <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> or <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>. If you’re only imitating someone else, players see through that immediately. Develop a philosophy and stick to it. You have to learn, but you have to stay on your own path - and have fun. Without fun? Forget it!<br /><br /><b>[Bosz fulfilled a childhood dream in 2016 when he had the chance to learn from the legendary Johan Cruyff]</b> In Holland he was and is the greatest. We had never seen anyone like him in the early 1970s. After returning to Holland, my brother and I absolutely had to watch his games. My brother was crazy about <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> and <a href="marco-van-basten.html">Marco van Basten</a>. So we always bought tickets when I did not have to play myself<br /><br /><b>[It was at Maccabi Tel Aviv that Bosz had the chance to rub shoulders with <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>, due to the Netherlands icon’s son <a href="jordi-cruyff.html">Jordi Cruyff</a> being the sporting director at the club]</b> It was exciting. He would come over for every training session. Jordi said it was because his dad did not want to stay in the hotel all day with his mother! He really was there every day and we talked about football over coffee or food. In the discussions, I limited myself to listening. I wanted to know what he had to say, just let him talk and later analyse with Hendrie (Kruzen, assistant coach). In the end, it was the simple views and words that helped us. Sayings like: ‘if you want to score, you have to shoot’. Of course you have to, but it’s about not over-playing again and again. Shoot! <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> also said playing simple football is the biggest challenge</p>

It was character and mentality, especially as important players like Aranguiz had to leave the field before, and Diaby was our left-back at the end - a big compliment to the team!</p>

  <p><b>[Bosz admits Leverkusen can’t keep star player]</b> Kai is 20 years old, but this is already his fourth season in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. That says a lot. Everyone in Germany sees him as a child prodigy. He is from Aachen, has been here since he was eight. Nice boy to work with. Intelligent. He also plays the piano. We sold his buddy, <a href="julian-brandt.html">Julian Brandt</a>, to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> last summer. <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> suddenly became even more of an eye-catcher.<br /><br />A lot came to him before the winter break. We lost the derby at Koln and three days later also at home to Hertha Berlin. Suddenly the entire stadium whistled him off. He was devastated by that. ‘Why do people hate me?’ Then he’s just another 20-year-old and you explain: ‘They don’t hate you, but this is how it goes’.<br /><br />During the winter break, we showed images that he did not reach the box enough. Now he does that more often. His share of goals and assists has skyrocketed. He can’t be held on to next summer. That will be a transfer of €100 million. What am I saying? More than 100 million!</p>

I can imagine that when Hertha scores at Hoffenheim, that they want to celebrate. They must not do it this way. I know that. Next time, I don’t think they’ll do it that way. But goals are emotional moments in which they may have forgotten. You’re not allowed to do that, but I can imagine that it happens from time to time</p>

He can do much better. I’ve known him for a long time now and I know he can do much better. It has to do with the rhythm. But for every player the captain’s armband is something special. And so it will be for Kai<br /><br />We are naturally satisfied, as you have to be when you win the first game after a two-month break with 4-1 in Bremen. There were many question marks before. I think we deserved to win, although we didn’t always play very well. That has to do with the rhythm. We lost easy balls during the game, which we normally don’t lose. But like I said, if you win 4-1 here, you have to be satisfied. And I am satisfied</p>

We hope that he’s getting better und be able to play <b>[against Schalke]</b> on Sunday. We have to wait. It shows how big the importance is to win titles that we’re talking about it again at the moment. 1993 is a long time ago. Because of that the players, coaches and the whole club wants to win titles again. The DFB-Pokal is a possibility.<br /><br /><b>[Exequiel Palacios has made just four appearances since his January arrival from River Plate]</b> I won’t talk about a single player and tell you what’s missing for the starting 11.

That will include the German Cup final next month and the next Europa League game against Rangers in August. Of course, that’s all dependent on nothing happening before then</p>
