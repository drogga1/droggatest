There is a lot of discussion about Julian’s exit clause at the moment, the others have none. He’s having fun in his new position and learning a lot there, but all three are not done yet, so I hope the three stay together for at least a year. But, as a coach, you can only hope, you cannot decide<br /><br />I knew that after my time in Dortmund the next step would have to work out for me. The squad is talented, there is quality and it’s fun to work with these players. It’s fun to work with young players who want to get better, even the more seasoned players like the Bender twins are interested. You can tell if that’s real, that’s great fun</p>

He’s such a good player and you’ve got to give good players the ball as much as possible.</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Bosz believes there is a better chance of both Julian Brandt and Kai Havertz remaining at Bayer Leverkusen]</b> Yes, it’s a better chance <b>[of Leverkusen keeping both players]</b>. I don’t know. Kai will stay, for sure. And Julian, I hope he will stay. Every player wants to play at the highest level and we have the chance next season to play at the highest level. We’re looking forward to it. Not only in the Champions League but also the Bundesliga. Our goal will be to be better than this season and therefore we have to work harder than this season and be more clear about how we want to play. It’s a big achievement.<br /><br /><b>[Havertz scored 20 goals in all competitions]</b> He definitely has something special. Particularly as he is just 19 years old. It’s very unusual to see performances like that at that age. He played incredibly well in the last few games. But even Kai obviously has something to learn although he’s is very aware of where he can improve. The lad will definitely improve as he has this season in terms of posing a significantly bigger threat on goal than before. On that point, he’s mostly scored the really important opening goals. But Kai will also have to overcome lows in his career. For example, he didn’t really do very well at the beginning of the second half of the season. When we spoke about that he taught me a new German word. He said he’d been ‘schlampig’ <b>[sloppy]</b> in many situations</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Bosz viewing Matthijs de Ligt as the perfect partner for Aymeric Laporte]</b> Normally I would say to a 19-year-old boy who has had two years of professional football: Patience, it will come, take two more years of experience with Ajax. In the Eredivisie, in the Champions League. Only, I think Matthijs is the exception that confirms the rule. That he is already ready for that step. But what is the best step? In my eyes, that must be a club where you can play.<br /><br />If I were Manchester City, I would get him immediately. Vincent Kompany is leaving and I don’t think Nicolas Otamendi is good enough. It would fit perfectly with Laporte. He will play even better with Matthijs next to him, I am convinced of that. I also hear Barcelona everywhere, but there you have to deal with Gerard Pique. That would mean, if Samuel Umtiti did indeed leave, that he had to come to play centrally on the left. That doesn’t have to be a problem, because I think Matthijs can play on the left as well as the right in the centre just as easily.</p>

If you’re only imitating someone else, players see through that immediately. Develop a philosophy and stick to it. You have to learn, but you have to stay on your own path - and have fun.

We had never seen anyone like him in the early 1970s. After returning to Holland, my brother and I absolutely had to watch his games. My brother was crazy about <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>, <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> and <a href="marco-van-basten.html">Marco van Basten</a>. So we always bought tickets when I did not have to play myself<br /><br /><b>[It was at Maccabi Tel Aviv that Bosz had the chance to rub shoulders with <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>, due to the Netherlands icon’s son <a href="jordi-cruyff.html">Jordi Cruyff</a> being the sporting director at the club]</b> It was exciting. He would come over for every training session. Jordi said it was because his dad did not want to stay in the hotel all day with his mother! He really was there every day and we talked about football over coffee or food. In the discussions, I limited myself to listening. I wanted to know what he had to say, just let him talk and later analyse with Hendrie (Kruzen, assistant coach). In the end, it was the simple views and words that helped us. Sayings like: ‘if you want to score, you have to shoot’. Of course you have to, but it’s about not over-playing again and again. Shoot! <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> also said playing simple football is the biggest challenge</p>

Now he does that more often. His share of goals and assists has skyrocketed. He can’t be held on to next summer. That will be a transfer of €100 million. What am I saying? More than 100 million!</p>

I think we deserved to win, although we didn’t always play very well. That has to do with the rhythm. We lost easy balls during the game, which we normally don’t lose.
