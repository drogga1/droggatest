He has made a good impression lately. Neres has excellent technique, is a smart football guy and he picks things up quickly. He needs to learn a lot, also about how we want to play. He has a nice through ball. Even in sprints over a long distance he surprises me sometimes. That can be quite nice, huh?</p>

We were better in the second half, which shows that we have the quality to compete Bayern. The goals have nothing to do with our tactical system. It must not happen that we give Bayern so much space. We had two or three crystal clear chances where we have to make it 1-1. In the second half we tried everything, we had the chance to make it 2-1, then it gets exciting again.

We’re looking forward to it. Not only in the Champions League but also the Bundesliga. Our goal will be to be better than this season and therefore we have to work harder than this season and be more clear about how we want to play. It’s a big achievement.<br /><br /><b>[Havertz scored 20 goals in all competitions]</b> He definitely has something special. Particularly as he is just 19 years old. It’s very unusual to see performances like that at that age. He played incredibly well in the last few games. But even Kai obviously has something to learn although he’s is very aware of where he can improve. The lad will definitely improve as he has this season in terms of posing a significantly bigger threat on goal than before. On that point, he’s mostly scored the really important opening goals. But Kai will also have to overcome lows in his career. For example, he didn’t really do very well at the beginning of the second half of the season. When we spoke about that he taught me a new German word. He said he’d been ‘schlampig’ <b>[sloppy]</b> in many situations</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Bosz viewing Matthijs de Ligt as the perfect partner for Aymeric Laporte]</b> Normally I would say to a 19-year-old boy who has had two years of professional football: Patience, it will come, take two more years of experience with Ajax. In the Eredivisie, in the Champions League. Only, I think Matthijs is the exception that confirms the rule. That he is already ready for that step. But what is the best step? In my eyes, that must be a club where you can play.<br /><br />If I were Manchester City, I would get him immediately. Vincent Kompany is leaving and I don’t think Nicolas Otamendi is good enough. It would fit perfectly with Laporte. He will play even better with Matthijs next to him, I am convinced of that. I also hear Barcelona everywhere, but there you have to deal with Gerard Pique. That would mean, if Samuel Umtiti did indeed leave, that he had to come to play centrally on the left. That doesn’t have to be a problem, because I think Matthijs can play on the left as well as the right in the centre just as easily.</p>

  <p><b>[Bosz admits Leverkusen can’t keep star player]</b> Kai is 20 years old, but this is already his fourth season in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. That says a lot. Everyone in Germany sees him as a child prodigy. He is from Aachen, has been here since he was eight. Nice boy to work with. Intelligent. He also plays the piano. We sold his buddy, <a href="julian-brandt.html">Julian Brandt</a>, to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> last summer. <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> suddenly became even more of an eye-catcher.<br /><br />A lot came to him before the winter break. We lost the derby at Koln and three days later also at home to <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha Berlin</a>. Suddenly the entire stadium whistled him off. He was devastated by that. ‘Why do people hate me?’ Then he’s just another 20-year-old and you explain: ‘They don’t hate you, but this is how it goes’.<br /><br />During the winter break, we showed images that he did not reach the box enough. Now he does that more often. His share of goals and assists has skyrocketed. He can’t be held on to next summer. That will be a transfer of €100 million. What am I saying? More than 100 million!</p>

  <p><b>[Leverkusen manager Bosz warns Players must not repeat <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> celebrations amid coronavirus concerns]</b> In the beginning we talked about emotions and they are part of football. I can imagine that when <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> scores at Hoffenheim, that they want to celebrate. They must not do it this way. I know that. Next time, I don’t think they’ll do it that way. But goals are emotional moments in which they may have forgotten. You’re not allowed to do that, but I can imagine that it happens from time to time</p>

  <p><b>[Bosz insists Liverpool-linked <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> can get even better]</b> Kai <b>[<a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a>]</b> is a special player, but I don’t think he played his best game today. He can do much better. I’ve known him for a long time now and I know he can do much better. It has to do with the rhythm. But for every player the captain’s armband is something special. And so it will be for Kai<br /><br />We are naturally satisfied, as you have to be when you win the first game after a two-month break with 4-1 in Bremen. There were many question marks before. I think we deserved to win, although we didn’t always play very well. That has to do with the rhythm. We lost easy balls during the game, which we normally don’t lose. But like I said, if you win 4-1 here, you have to be satisfied. And I am satisfied</p>

He played well from the start, held onto the ball and played well going forward. It’s always something special when you make your debut, especially when you’re 17, but he wasn’t nervous. All in all, it was a good performance by him</p>

But it’s not about Kai. We at Bayer did a great job and Kai was one of them. There were 13 others who played as well as Kai</p>

  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz said <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> is ‘fine’ after the in-form star suffered a late injury in Friday’s victory over Freiburg]</b> He is fine. I don’t know how bad it is, but I think he’s going to be okay. I’m very happy for him, of course. He’s very, very talented - I think we all know that. For him to be able to be doing that gives young players a vision. Anything is possible once you work hard. I think <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> is a very hard-working player. He’s smart, and very intelligent on the pitch. I hope he continues to do this and help the team as much as possible because we need him.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> will not be risked for Bayer Leverkusen’s DFB-Pokal semi-final amid injury concerns]</b> The match is too early for him. He’s not going to be in the squad. The question was if he’s able to play. The answer is yes he would be able, but we would take a risk and we don’t want to do that. We hope that he’s getting better und be able to play <b>[against Schalke]</b> on Sunday. We have to wait. It shows how big the importance is to win titles that we’re talking about it again at the moment. 1993 is a long time ago. Because of that the players, coaches and the whole club wants to win titles again. The DFB-Pokal is a possibility.<br /><br /><b>[Exequiel Palacios has made just four appearances since his January arrival from River Plate]</b> I won’t talk about a single player and tell you what’s missing for the starting 11. Of course, I have my reasons for that. I always speak with my players about that. So I’m going to do it the same way with him. He already showed that he’s a very good player and we will see him in the future in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> again. I will always speak with my players personally about why they’re not playing at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea-linked <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> ‘not thinking too much’ about summer transfer]</b> I don’t feel that he is thinking too much about transferring. Neither are we. I certainly don’t have the impression that this will be his last game for the club. He is still under contract with us and I have to assume that he will be with us next season too. That will include the German Cup final next month and the next Europa League game against Rangers in August. Of course, that’s all dependent on nothing happening before then</p>
