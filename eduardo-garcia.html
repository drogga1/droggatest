<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Eduardo Garcia, Mexico’s roaring dragon]</b> I like the nickname. I was given it at Guadalajara, when I was eight or nine. It’s a name that makes me feel strong. It makes me feel a lot of things<br /><br />I’m so excited. I knew I could do it. I pictured it all. I’d seen some of them take kicks before and with the others I just visualised things. I was telling myself: ‘I’ve got this one. I’m going to save it’.<br /><br /><b>[Garcia’s love for goalkeeping was spotted at an early age by his father]</b> I liked football ever since I could walk but I’d always have the ball in my hands. And when I was at kindergarten my father would take me to a sand pitch near home to kick a ball around. I liked to dive around spectacularly and be the one who saved the team. I was always drawn to the player who was dressed differently to everyone else. That’s how I wanted to be<br /><br />I’ve been that way since I was a kid. There wasn’t any particular reason for it and as I’ve grown up I’ve realised what I want and what I need to achieve things. And part of what I need to achieve things is to be focused<br /><br /><b>[And what makes you think you can do it, Dragon?]</b> Because we Mexicans can do anything</p>
