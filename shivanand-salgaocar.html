<blockquote>
  <p>[All India Football Federation’s chief Praful Patel, is in the firing line of Goa’s football clubs yet again] AIFF has no clarity and vision. They keep on changing track and then blame others for the same. They change their plans and expect others to dance to their tunes.<br /><br />Top players like Arata Izumi and Thangjam Saran Singh are playing in the Second Division. It just shows the depth of I-League. After the withdrawal of Goan teams the standard of the league has dropped very much.<br /><br />As far as Salgaocar FC is concerned I will do what I feel is right. The AIFF changes its statement every other day. One day they say I-League is supreme while other day they say that the I-League and ISL should be merged. The club cannot dance on AIFF tunes<br /><br />The reason why Goan teams have stopped continuing in the I-League is that the clubs did not find the proper revenue model in place. It is only for the love of the game and Goa that the Goan clubs have continued for the last five decades. There is a limit as to how much one should go on spending. The expenditure was going up, every year the clubs were not finding revenue to that extent. This is the reason why the clubs opted out of the I-League</p>
