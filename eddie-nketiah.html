  <p><b>[Nketiah was <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> under-18’s top scorer last season with 24 goals in 28 appearances but faces tough competition with the likes of <a href="stephy-mavididi.html">Stephy Mavididi</a>, Donyell Malen and Josh Dasilva all competing for a slice of first-team action]</b> I achieved the contract through working hard and trying to keep improving, and as a professional that’s something that I’m determined to keep doing because it takes me a step closer to the first team and I know how high the standards are<br /><br />I’ve trained quite a few times with the first team now and you see how everything is faster and sharper. Playing against strong defenders like <a href="laurent-koscielny.html">Laurent Koscielny</a>, you have to be concentrated and use good movement to get away from him<br /><br />I watch our strikers a lot too and I’m working towards being as complete a player as possible. My game is mainly pace, movement and finishing, but I’ve made an effort to hold the ball up better which is something vital for the team and that <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a> does so well</p>

  <p><b>[Eddie Nketiah intends to remain at Arsenal this summer as he believes he is ‘good enough’ to compete with <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> and Alexandre Lacazette for a starting spot]</b> I’m going to go back to Arsenal and see where I stand. I’ve prepared well to go back into pre-season but I need see what plans the manager has for me and we’ll take it from there. At the moment I am returning back to Arsenal and will give it my all. Lacazette and <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> are good players but there are a lot of good players in every position at Arsenal. You have to believe in yourself and believe that you are good enough to play. I think I am good enough to play for this club</p>

  <p><b>[Nketiah ready for a bigger role after leading Arsenal past Fiorentina]</b> I feel like just getting more experience, you actually develop and get more comfortable playing. I feel like as a young player, coming into the team is always hard, but I feel like I’m at a good stage. I feel comfortable with the team and the team has always made me feel welcome and allowed me to show myself and play well. I feel like a lot of us have had chances and I think the team has done well, the younger boys have done well, and we can all be proud of ourselves. It’s nice to get chances and show what you can do because you want to be playing every week in the starting XI, and these types of games can help you make the case for that</p>

  <p><b>[Eddie Nketiah has not closed the door on a loan move away from Arsenal despite Unai Emery trying to slam it shut]</b> There was talk of <b>[going out on loan]</b> and it was close to happening in January but the club decided that I should stay and I tried to finish the season as strongly as possible. We’ll see what happens in the future but I’m just enjoying the tour and in the future decisions will be made. All I can do is do what I’m doing at the moment, work hard in training, work hard on the pitch, and scoring at the moment. I need to keep pushing, keep working and as for the season I want to be playing regularly. After the pre-season tour, it’s something that I’ll look at with my family and speak to the manager and see what’s best for me. I feel like I have a great relationship with the fans. It’s nice that they notice that and sing my name. That’s a dream come true. Even out here the fans are screaming my name. They travel all around the world to see us play and support us. I always try to give them something back and I’m so grateful that they have taken to me like that as one of the boys from the academy and I hope it can continue</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid vs Arsenal. On Saturday, they swept Fiorentina away with a clinical 3-0 success, which was spearheaded by youngster Eddie Nketiah, who scored twice. The win was sealed by Joe Willock]</b> Eddie Nketiah’s progress is impressive, we want progress with every player. He has a very good attitude and he needs experience, minutes and confidence. The young energy is very important<br /><br />At the beginning I want to take more minutes with the players thinking about our progress for the first match against Newcastle. But also, we are going to use some young players at the beginning or during the match to continue trying with this difficult capacity against Real Madrid.</p>

I hope it’s a good year that can leave me in good stead going back to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to fight for a place.

  <p><b>[Eddie Nketiah admits he is frustrated by his lack of first-team chances at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> United]</b> From my point of view, I feel like I’ve done everything I can to warrant a start and all I can do is continue to apply that pressure by putting in good performances when I come with England and when I play for <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, working hard. I went there to play matches and to develop so, hopefully, in the coming weeks I’ll get the opportunities to show why I can be in the team week in, week out. It’s been disappointing for me not to start in the league. I went there to play games and get games.<br /><br />It’s still early times. I think every time I’ve come on I’ve done well and shown why I think I should be playing. I think tonight was a good statement and a good way for me to put across a performance and, hopefully, I’ll be starting in the next run of games. I’ve enjoyed the new challenge and I think I’ve been really pleased with my performances personally when I’ve been given the chances.<br /><br />I feel like I probably haven’t been given the chances I would have liked, I would have liked to play a lot more minutes but I feel like every time I’ve come on I’ve done well and now I’m still one of the top scores, if not the top scorer in the team, with such limited time so I don’t think I could do much more than that. Obviously, I’m never going to be totally happy if I’m not playing because I’m a proud player, I believe I should be playing and I always want to be playing so I’ll never be happy with not playing<br /><br />The experience, going on loan, there’s a lot of things more than just on the pitch and I think I’ve learned a lot as a person and developed a lot. It’s still early stages and I’m really looking forward to the future. It’s a great club with great fans and I’m sure once I get the opportunity to show why I could be playing week in, week out, kick on and enjoy it even more. It’s very different. The area is one thing and the training methods are a lot different but in your career you’re always gonna have to come out of your comfort zone, and I think it’s good for me to get that so early. I’ve met a lot of nice people at the club, played with some good players. I feel like it has been a good experience for me and I’m really looking to just kick on and get more minutes and show what I can really do.<br /><br />He (Bielsa) is a good coach. I think he does a lot of one-to-one reviews and stuff about the games and clips. I’m learning, I think I will learn even more when I’m playing so I can implement what I’ve learned and just develop, you always develop by playing. I think that’s the main thing, it’s great to be at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> and I’m looking forward to the future. Hopefully, I can really get the minutes I want and kick off from there<br /><br /><b>[Nketiah also revealed that he keeps in contact with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s leading goalscorer <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> and other players back at the Emirates]</b> I’ve got a way to go to be compared to <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>! I always try to have a good impact on the game. I’m in good form I feel like for club and country. He messages me sometimes through Instagram. They are great guys at the club and I always try to stay in contact with them because they’re my friends, <a href="joe-willock.html">Joe Willock</a> and <a href="reiss-nelson.html">Reiss Nelson</a> are two of my closest friends in football, I always keep in contact with them if they do well or they message me if I do well.<br /><br />I think it’s good to have that kind of support around you. It’s important for people that you care about and that care about you. Every time I come away here is a great opportunity for me to show myself, my talents that I have. I always try to take it with both hands. The manager (England Under-21s coach Aidy Boothroyd) has shown good faith in me and given me a lot of game time. I’m delighted to be scoring and the team to be winning.<br /><br />I speak with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> a lot, I’m in contact with quite a few people in the club, they’re always texting when I’ve done well or things I can do differently but I think it’s good to have that constant feedback from the club, to know you’re still connected with them. I’m an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> player on loan at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, I feel like they have done really well to keep me involved and happy and I think they’ve been really happy with me so hopefully I can continue the form and go back and get a starting place and kick off from there<br /><br /><b>[Nketiah is proud of his long-time team-mate from youth level, with <a href="joe-willock.html">Willock</a> having made 10 appearances under <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> already this season]</b> I’m really proud of him. I try to keep an eye out for my friends and keep an eye on <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because I’m a fan of the club. He’s been doing really well, he has scored a few goals this season and he’s kicked on and is playing matches in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.

  <p><b>[Eddie Nketiah has hailed the influence of <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a> after opening his <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> account for the season]</b> Obviously he is a mature lad and a great player. He always tries to encourage me. He has been a young player in my position so he knows what it is like. There are no hostilities, he’s just always looking to help and improve and it shows the maturity he has. He has had a great career so all I can do is take the advice he gives me and try and implement it in my game and do what I do best<br /><br />It’s great. They’re really good guys off the field and obviously top strikers. I just try to focus on myself and learn from them, see the things they do well and try to take from it and improve. They’re always willing to give advice and talk to me whenever I need it. It’s great to have two great strikers to learn from. I’m just trying to improve every day and listen to the people around me, my family and coaches, really improve, take each day as it comes and get better<br /><br /><a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> was a bit 50-50 on letting me go anyway and I was 50-50 as well. I try to give my all in training and treat it as a game. He likes this mentality and obviously the quality I have, I try to showcase that. It’s just about working hard, I’m grateful he’s given me the opportunity he has and I just want to keep learning. He’s a great manager and has a real determination to help and improve young players and the senior players as well. I just want to keep learning off him, make sure my mentality is right each day and keep improving<br /><br />My <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> experience was good for me, I learned as a player. I might not have played as much as I want but I had good moments when I was there. I think I developed in that environment but obviously now it is a different situation, speaking to Mikel and the belief he showed in me I really did believe he would give me opportunities if I continued to work hard. I think all my life that is what I have done and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are obviously a top club and I support them so I always wanted to play here. It is the best thing to have this opportunity now and I just want to keep improving and hopefully take more chances</p>

It was difficult, they came out really strong in the second half, and I thought all the boys fought and worked hard. It’s really hard in the heat to keep going but i think we did that.
