  <p><b>[Fabinho has revealed the role ‘agent’ <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> played in his move to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I remember that after one of my games for Monaco, against Marseille, where I’d played well and scored, <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> sent me a message and we started to talk. He said: ‘the coach asked about you, what I thought about you, I talked you up a little bit’. We exchanged some messages for a while and I asked him some things about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and that was it for a while. Then <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> reached my agents, made them aware of the interest and set up a meeting with <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>. We talked about his ideas for the team, work routine, tactics, physical training. My interest was rising, because I had always said that if I were to leave Monaco, it would only be to a team that really wanted me. I was very happy with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> wanting to sign me and then made up my mind that it was the right thing to do. It was quick, right after the <b>[Champions League]</b> final against Real Madrid, the signing was made official.<br /><br /><b>[While delighted to have secured a transfer to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, Fabinho was made to wait for a Premier League bow]</b> I played pretty much all the pre-season games, thought that I played well, and because of that, also thought that I would start playing earlier, not wait as much I did. Others players made sure that I was relaxed, they told me: ‘don’t worry, everyone that arrives goes through that, like <b>[Andy]</b> Robertson and <b>[Alex]</b> Oxlade-Chamberlain’. I was calm, tried to learn about the team, the other players, getting used to the intensity of the league. After a while, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> gave me the chances and little by little I could show my value and that I could be important to the team</p>

  <p><b>[Fabinho says that beating <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in December helped kickstart his <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> career]</b> I knew it would be difficult and there would be times when I would be out of the team. In terms of adapting, there was a lot of preparation and a lot of hard work. The two games in particular that stood out for me was the game against Arsenal <b>[at the Emirates]</b> - that’s when I really understood the speed of the Premier League and the attention to detail that is required. And in terms of building my confidence, the stand-out game was against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. It was probably one of the best of the season. I managed to get an assist in that game and I really kept up with the rhythm and pace. I think we were much superior than <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Having watched last year’s final as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were beaten by Real Madrid in Kiev]</b> I watched it and at the time I knew I was coming here to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I didn’t really think about where I’d fit into the team or my position. I was watching it as a fan, so I wasn’t really focusing tactically. What really captured me was the passion of the fans and I wanted <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to win</p>

  <p><b>[Fabinho says <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> is a complete player &amp; makes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> tick]</b> <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> is a genuinely impressive player, he’s tireless, playing in every game with such high levels of intensity and concentration. His technical ability goes without saying, he always makes a difference for us. He’s a complete player - he gives you the option of a short pass or a long ball, he contributes to the build-up and creation of play as well. He’s a great player in amazing form, which is really important for his confidence. Off the pitch I chat with him quite a bit as we both speak French, my French is still better than my English. He’s a great lad. Sadio has been a really important player for us this season.<br /><br /><b>[He said when reflecting on his experiences since completing a big-money move from Monaco in the summer of 2018]</b> Overall I think my first season at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was good. In my first season I knew there would be a learning and settling-in period. I went through this. It didn’t last that long but I remember it wasn’t easy starting afresh, I was left out for a few matches. Even though I was telling myself that I needed to work hard and be patient, it’s not easy being out of the team. But that’s in the past now, I started playing more. The more you play, the more you can enjoy your football. I think I became an important part of the team, I gave the manager another option he could depend upon. So I think it was a really good season</p>

  <p><b>[Fabinho: <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will relish being the team to beat ahead of Champions League group stage draw]</b> The Champions League is a special competition and we’re the reigning champions. There’s always going to be a lot of expectation about who we’re going to come up against. We’re relaxed about it. We’re fully aware that when we return from this international break there will be a more intense fixture schedule with midweek games, but that’s good - we like it. As we’re the reigning champions, all the other teams are going to focus much more on us, they’ll know more about our team.

  <p><b>[Fabinho acknowledges that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are one of the favourites to claim more Champions League glory]</b> <b>[We are]</b> one of the favourites, I think. The reigning champion is always the favourite and given <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s run of form over the last two competitions we must be considered one of the main contenders. But it doesn’t put any additional pressure on us, we know how to deal with it, we know how to handle the pressure. It won’t be a problem. The Champions League is the toughest competition in Europe with all the best teams involved. We’ll do everything to qualify for the Round of 16. It’s a case of taking things step by step<br /><br />Last year we showed it was possible - normally a team with 97 points are champions. We were able to maintain the intensity and high standard in both competitions (Premier League and Champions League). It’s exhausting, it’s difficult, it demands a lot from the entire squad of players. It demands a lot of the coaching staff as well, working on recovery and preparation every two days for a high-level game. It is possible, but it’s very, very difficult, all the players have to be prepared and focused. The team has shown that it is focused, has ambition and is prepared for this challenge</p>

  <p><b>[Fabinho explains <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> lure and transition into one of the world’s best holding midfielders]</b> After five seasons at Monaco, I knew it was the right time to leave to look for a new step in my career. I wanted to sign for a big club. I had no doubt I wanted to come to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, so much so that when the transfer window opened, the deal was immediately made official. It really is a huge club, one of the biggest in the world. The club has great ambition and that is what I wanted in my career, so I’m very happy to be here.<br /><br /><b>[They have Fabinho’s former coach to thank for his progression in that role, with Monaco boss <a href="leonardo-jardim.html">Jardim</a> having helped to unlock the potential in a man who is now being showered with praise]</b> My time at Monaco was very good and I think I developed well from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. I stayed at Monaco for five years, working with <a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> <a href="leonardo-jardim.html">Jardim</a> for four. He was a coach who helped me develop a lot in my career. It was him who made me take the big step of changing positions <b>[from right-back]</b>. We always talked about it, as I liked that position and he liked seeing me in that position. So he came to speak to me and decided he wanted to change. I accepted the challenge, but it’s not just about that - I have many good memories with him. We were <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> champions at Monaco in 2017. I had a great time there and made a lot of my friends. I’ll always hold that club dear to my heart.</p>

But if we beat them then we will have a large points advantage over them, which will be important for us. But this game is always a bit more special because we have the chance to pick up points and stop a direct rival from picking up points. So we’re going to do all we can to win, but I’m not sure if this result will define the outcome of the season<br /><br /><b>[Fabinho holds an equal level of respect for what <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> have built under the Catalan]</b> We’ve played against this City team before and they’ve shown us what they’re about. They’re great with the ball and they are hard-working, they’re great in attack and all of this makes them one of the best teams in Europe today. But in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> there are so many good teams and we’ve managed to play well in these situations as well.

It’s a cool nickname but the other one that the majority of the players use, Flaco, that was started by Virgil and everybody started calling me it<br /><br />I think when the team does well an individual’s abilities shine as well. I wanted this season to be different because I had already adapted to the team and the league. I wanted to keep improving as a player and help the team out more. That’s what I’ve been aiming for. I’m happy for the praise that I’ve got but I know I still have got the scope to improve and I want to keep improving. There’s always scope to improve. I’m still young, I want to improve more, develop more. I’ve got personal objectives as well, so I’ve still got more to offer to the team</p>
