  <p><b>[Highly rated Monaco midfielder Fabinho has admitted that he has come to the end of the line at the Ligue 1 club]</b> If the right move comes up, perhaps a change in league or to a club with a bigger structure and higher ambitions, I would love that. My time at Monaco has been great, I managed to win a title, now I believe my time here might be coming to an end. I know that the club’s goal is to take second place <b>[in Ligue 1]</b> and earn a spot in the Champions League, not to sign big-name players but rather youngsters to give them their start. I believe that I have been through that, I came here as a nobody, made my name in the club, achieved things; so maybe I need something new, a new challenge.<br /><br /><b>[Fabinho also referred to compatriot Neymar’s move to Paris Saint-Germain]</b> It was a surprise to see Neymar come to France. I did not expect him to go to PSG, but it was great for the league to get one of the three best players in the world. The league has had much more attention, because he is a world-class player. It was great in that sense, because the other teams are suffering playing against him here, he is brilliant. For the television viewer it is fantastic to see a show every week. He added a lot of good things to the league and he is the guy everyone is talking about, which is normal because he is the best player. I hope, as a Brazilian, that he has a lot of sucess at PSG, although unfortunately for the rest that will mean a few more years of dominance for them!</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool have announced the signing of midfielder Fabinho from Monaco for a fee of €45 million]</b> This is something that I always wanted - this is a giant of a team. The infrastructures of the club look exceptional. A football club of this size coming after my services, I didn’t have to think that much about coming over. I will try to create my own history at this football club. Hopefully, on a personal level, I’m able to win titles with this club. I will try to grow and learn and improve myself, and to be part of the club’s history.<br /><br />I’m really happy to join Liverpool. In the last transfer window, things were a little difficult. It was almost done, but I stayed. I’ve done great things with Monaco, it was great for five seasons. At Liverpool, I hope to have the same success. It’s a big club, really ambitious, which has done great things in recent seasons. They were in the Champions League final and were still among the leaders in the Premier League. I think I can grow a lot and learn a lot at this club. It’s a league I like a lot. I hope I can continue to develop at this great club</p>

If anything happens to a player, there’s adequate cover. During pre-season I played alongside a variety of different players and we blended really well. So, overall, I think it’s a good thing for the team.<br /><br />I think my performances have been good. It’s a different playing style than at Monaco; there were two of us in midfield there and here at Liverpool there’s three. My midfield partners have given me guidance and assistance, as have the defence. I knew <b>[my role]</b> would change and I feel I’ve adapted well.

  <p><b>[Fabinho feels he has had a good start to life at Liverpool despite being yet to make a Premier League appearance]</b> My start has been good, good adaptation. The pre-season was very good, we had nine friendlies and I played nine. It was good to play against English teams to see what the rhythm, the intensity and the physique are like. The way the team played I got it right, the more experienced players helped me, the technical team as well. Me and my wife are liking the city, we already have a home. Firmino is being a great guy, his family has given good support to me and Alisson. It’s been fine <b>[settling in]</b>. Having Brazilians in the team helps. Now <b>[the next step]</b> is really to make the debut. I’m fine, training well and prepared<br /><br /><b>[On Premier League]</b> The Premier League if not the best league in the world, is among the two best. It has a much higher visibility than Ligue 1 in France. Liverpool are also a giant team, which I think helps keep me closer to the Selecao. But what’s really going to help is that I play and play very often for my club. I hope to have a sequence of games to continue in the Selecao</p>

Roberto Firmino has been helping me, as well as Alisson. I’ve been playing a little bit more and that’s important, because it’s important to adapt on the pitch by playing matches. It’s a new experience for me, because Klopp has a different way of working from the way I’m used to. But this is something I will learn. I’ve already learned a few things from him, but this is just the start. He’s a coach who demands a lot from his players, not only in matches, but on a daily basis in training.</p>

I hope that I will gradually gain a few minutes on the field. The adaptation on the pitch is good, and I’m working and calm, waiting for my moment to arrive.<br /><br />From the start he gave me a lot of peace. He said he knows my quality, the preparation was good. We did not have much time in the games, but we’re working hard during the week. It’s not a problem. Not only coach Klopp, but the whole coaching staff has helped me in the adaptation, not only on the field, but also off the field<br /><br />Before signing with Liverpool, I talked to Roberto Firmino about what the club is like and what the city is like. He spoke well of the club and the city, and other people who have already visited the city. The information only gave me more motivation to come to Liverpool<br /><br />It’s good to have someone who speaks your language in everyday life, especially for me, who does not speak English so well. It is good to have someone who can help with day-to-day life, for me and for my family. This is very important. We are always together, talking or making dinner in someone’s home</p>

When you sign for Liverpool you have these types of games in mind. With the passion of the fans, their support, we go on the field to give our best to put on a show for them. I’m not really an expert on the history of this rivalry, but I believe it is the biggest rivalry in English football. They’re the two most successful teams in England, so history shows that there’s a huge rivalry. I think the geographical closeness, with Manchester being just down the road, adds even more to it. We’re going to approach this game like all the other games and I hope it’s a night to remember, like the Everton game. Against Everton the fans left very happy with the victory and the way in which we won, and I hope against Manchester United we can put on a similar spectacle: representing the Liverpool shirt and playing with a lot of desire. I hope we’ll get the three points.</p>

  <p><b>[Fabinho tells Alisson to forget Man Utd blunder]</b> Normal game play. When we entered the locker room, we even talked, but I did not even focus on that. He came to comment, but I said ‘no, bro, let it go’. These plays will always happen. And what are we going to talk about Alisson? He was very important in our qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League, days before. Without a doubt, he is the best goalkeeper of the English League. There is a lot of confidence.<br /><br />I found it different. During the week, I gave some interviews around here, and everyone was talking about the importance of the classic. I had an idea, but I could feel it on the pitch. I had already played against Everton, but the rivalry is even bigger against United. Neighboring cities, two of the biggest English winners … And still it had the fact that Liverpool hadn’t beaten them in a long time<br /><br />It’s a thing I always try to perfect, to train. I get a lot of front ball, in a position that normally the opponent’s defense is making the move outwards, and our attackers are getting in. I saw Mane making the sign with his hand and I launched it. It was a good pass</p>

Obviously the team that we had was doing very well with great players in it, but I knew that my moment would come and I knew that I needed to be prepared for when it did. I think I have improved and my confidence has grown and my performances have been better. Right now I have been playing well and I hope to keep this up. I think there are still some things I can improve upon. Right now I feel that I have adapted to the speed, intensity and the physical speed of the Premier League. I feel that I have settled into the team well and with time I’ll keep improving so overall I think I have adapted well.<br /><br />There’s no doubt about it, I think that my versatility helps me. I haven’t played a lot as a centre-back but in those games I feel like I did well. The other players helped out in terms of guiding me and helping with my positioning and it started becoming easier. There are some things I feel that I need to improve upon like my positional play and also my focus in that role, but generally speaking I feel those two games were good for me</p>

  <p><b>[Fabinho concedes that Liverpool need to try something different in their Premier League title bid]</b> We have confidence. We enjoyed a brilliant December, which was almost perfect, but now we have had this dip. It is difficult to explain why this has happened. I believe that now teams who play against us sit very deep. We need to do things a little differently and maybe we aren’t doing this - we are unable to find the spaces. Often, we want to go through the middle and it is difficult against physically strong and defensive teams. We need to find solutions and in these past few games we haven’t<br /><br />We want to play better every day and unfortunately it is not happening. We know our quality and we know that we can give more. If we do it, with our quality, we will continue at the top. But I’m talking and talking is always a little easier, so we have to try to put it into practice. Personally, I am not worried. But we know that in the next game we have to give much more. Beating Bournemouth is important to continue with a three-point gap at the top of the table. Now we only look at the next game and that is against Bournemouth. Then there will be a run of difficult games, but we will get some players back from injury and the manager will have more options to choose for those games</p>

He’s a complete player - he gives you the option of a short pass or a long ball, he contributes to the build-up and creation of play as well. He’s a great player in amazing form, which is really important for his confidence. Off the pitch I chat with him quite a bit as we both speak French, my French is still better than my English. He’s a great lad. Sadio has been a really important player for us this season.<br /><br /><b>[He said when reflecting on his experiences since completing a big-money move from <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> in the summer of 2018]</b> Overall I think my first season at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was good. In my first season I knew there would be a learning and settling-in period. I went through this. It didn’t last that long but I remember it wasn’t easy starting afresh, I was left out for a few matches. Even though I was telling myself that I needed to work hard and be patient, it’s not easy being out of the team. But that’s in the past now, I started playing more. The more you play, the more you can enjoy your football. I think I became an important part of the team, I gave the manager another option he could depend upon. So I think it was a really good season</p>

  <p><b>[Fabinho: <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will relish being the team to beat ahead of Champions League group stage draw]</b> The Champions League is a special competition and we’re the reigning champions. There’s always going to be a lot of expectation about who we’re going to come up against. We’re relaxed about it. We’re fully aware that when we return from this international break there will be a more intense fixture schedule with midweek games, but that’s good - we like it. As we’re the reigning champions, all the other teams are going to focus much more on us, they’ll know more about our team.

  <p><b>[Fabinho acknowledges that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are one of the favourites to claim more Champions League glory]</b> <b>[We are]</b> one of the favourites, I think. The reigning champion is always the favourite and given <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s run of form over the last two competitions we must be considered one of the main contenders. But it doesn’t put any additional pressure on us, we know how to deal with it, we know how to handle the pressure. It won’t be a problem. The Champions League is the toughest competition in Europe with all the best teams involved. We’ll do everything to qualify for the Round of 16. It’s a case of taking things step by step<br /><br />Last year we showed it was possible - normally a team with 97 points are champions. We were able to maintain the intensity and high standard in both competitions (Premier League and Champions League). It’s exhausting, it’s difficult, it demands a lot from the entire squad of players. It demands a lot of the coaching staff as well, working on recovery and preparation every two days for a high-level game. It is possible, but it’s very, very difficult, all the players have to be prepared and focused. The team has shown that it is focused, has ambition and is prepared for this challenge</p>

  <p><b>[Fabinho explains <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> lure and transition into one of the world’s best holding midfielders]</b> After five seasons at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a>, I knew it was the right time to leave to look for a new step in my career. I wanted to sign for a big club. I had no doubt I wanted to come to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, so much so that when the transfer window opened, the deal was immediately made official.

He was a coach who helped me develop a lot in my career. It was him who made me take the big step of changing positions <b>[from right-back]</b>. We always talked about it, as I liked that position and he liked seeing me in that position. So he came to speak to me and decided he wanted to change. I accepted the challenge, but it’s not just about that - I have many good memories with him. We were <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> champions at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> in 2017. I had a great time there and made a lot of my friends. I’ll always hold that club dear to my heart.</p>

But if we beat them then we will have a large points advantage over them, which will be important for us. But this game is always a bit more special because we have the chance to pick up points and stop a direct rival from picking up points.

It’s a cool nickname but the other one that the majority of the players use, Flaco, that was started by Virgil and everybody started calling me it<br /><br />I think when the team does well an individual’s abilities shine as well. I wanted this season to be different because I had already adapted to the team and the league. I wanted to keep improving as a player and help the team out more. That’s what I’ve been aiming for. I’m happy for the praise that I’ve got but I know I still have got the scope to improve and I want to keep improving. There’s always scope to improve. I’m still young, I want to improve more, develop more. I’ve got personal objectives as well, so I’ve still got more to offer to the team</p>
