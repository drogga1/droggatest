  <p><b>[Beasley brings veteran presence, left back option to Bruce Arena’s second USA stint]</b> I’m enjoying the moment. Bruce and I had a conversation this week about what he expects from me, and what he’s looking for this year. I accepted that. We had a good conversation. Bruce and I go way back so we were able to speak man to man, so it was good. I’m just living in the moment. I’m enjoying being back. It’s fun to see the young guys fighting. They’re hungry and it’s great to see. They want to make a difference and be the next U.S. stars.<br /><br />I don’t know where I’m going. I would like to stay in Houston. Hopefully we can get that sorted out. We’re still in negotiations with Houston, so we’ll see<br /><br />I always want to improve, even though I’m on the other side of my career. I still feel like there’s things I can improve on, so from year to year, game to game, day to day, I’m trying to improve every aspect of my game. I want to have a strong 2017, and it starts with this camp</p>

  <p><b>[Houston Dynamo fullback DaMarcus Beasley has announced he will retire from professional soccer at the end of the 2019 Major League Soccer season]</b> Before my 37th birthday, I’d just like to say that this year will be my last. I appreciate all the love, cheers and jeers throughout the past 20 years. Being on the pitch has fulfilled every dream I could have ever imagined. Thank you and more words another day!</p>

  <p><b>[DaMarcus Beasley says he doesn’t want to be remembered for his records]</b> I’ve gotten the question a couple of times. I don’t know, to be honest. It’s hard to pinpoint one thing or a couple of things. I’ve never really been that person to, not so much hype up my own game or do any of that…One thing I can pinpoint, off the top of my head, is that I wanted it to be known that you can always count on me in big games.<br /><br />In big games, under the lights, when it really, really meant something, whether that’s in a final or in a Champions League game in Europe, a World Cup game, whatever it may be, when it came down to a big game and you needed guys to stand up and show personality and be accounted for and to be men, to be steady, to not let the atmosphere get to you, that was one thing I was pretty good at. If I want to be remembered by something, I think that will be something that would be pretty cool: to be the guy that the locker room and the coaching staff can count on and say, ‘We know what we’re gonna get from Beas’.<br /><br /><b>[I talked]</b> to different guys just to see what they kind of went through. How did they know? Everyone told me that you have to play as long as you can, as long as you have two legs and can get up and down the field, you should play. That was the advice that almost every person gave me: play as long as you can. But they also said, ‘When you know, you know’, and for me, I know. I’m 100 percent behind and confident in my decision. I’m totally fine with that<br /><br />You enjoy it more. You take into account the little things that you didn’t earlier in your career. You start thinking that this will be the last road trip to this city or the last time we have this kind of meeting with this guy or something with the team or a team function, of course that goes through your head. It goes through my mind, but I’m happy about it. I still have a whole season ahead of me. I still have a whole season to concentrate on. This isn’t my last game tomorrow. I know I’ll have a different feeling when I play my last game with the Dynamo, but I feel happy, I feel good. I’m getting back to 100 percent, and that part is great. My whole thing is to be on the field. That’s where I want to me and that’s where I’m happiest: when I’m on the field</p>

  <p><b>[Beasley on his decision to retire this fall]</b> No regrets, no second thoughts. First game I’m watching <b>[since]</b> I’m retired so this is different. But I’m excited for a new chapter<br /><br /><b>[Those seven have more than 430 international caps, 27 World Cup appearances and seven <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup titles combined]</b> It was a great run. And it really goes that quick. When I look back at my whole career it’s like, ‘man, where did it go?’ It makes you really appreciate the game you <b>[and]</b> the relationships<br /><br /><b>[Beasley would like to follow <a href="landon-donovan.html">Donovan</a>, his former teammate, into either coaching an administrative role in soccer]</b> I’m trying to stay in the game, do, you know, whatever comes to mind. I’m really intrigued about the business side of the game. Front office, sporting director, technical director, whatever you want to call it. Just to learn more, to get my feet wet. Hopefully, sooner or later, I have some opportunities to do that<br /><br /><b>[And while the national team is changing, Beasley is certain everything will be just fine]</b> I’m excited about the future. I see it as a plus we’re getting all these young guys. The results will come. As far as identity, I think they’re on the right path of finding who they really are as a group as a team. Coming together, playing for one another. They have all the tools, to be a very good team and be back to being team in this region.</p>
