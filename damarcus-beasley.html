<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Beasley on his decision to retire this fall]</b> No regrets, no second thoughts. First game I’m watching <b>[since]</b> I’m retired so this is different. But I’m excited for a new chapter<br /><br /><b>[Those seven have more than 430 international caps, 27 World Cup appearances and seven <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup titles combined]</b> It was a great run. And it really goes that quick. When I look back at my whole career it’s like, ‘man, where did it go?’ It makes you really appreciate the game you <b>[and]</b> the relationships<br /><br /><b>[Beasley would like to follow <a href="landon-donovan.html">Donovan</a>, his former teammate, into either coaching an administrative role in soccer]</b> I’m trying to stay in the game, do, you know, whatever comes to mind. I’m really intrigued about the business side of the game. Front office, sporting director, technical director, whatever you want to call it. Just to learn more, to get my feet wet. Hopefully, sooner or later, I have some opportunities to do that<br /><br /><b>[And while the national team is changing, Beasley is certain everything will be just fine]</b> I’m excited about the future. I see it as a plus we’re getting all these young guys. The results will come. As far as identity, I think they’re on the right path of finding who they really are as a group as a team. Coming together, playing for one another. They have all the tools, to be a very good team and be back to being team in this region.</p>
