  <p>[Fellow Socceroo Tomi Juric is in awe of his decorated team-mate Tim Cahill] He’s still in great shape for his age, it’s ridiculous. It’s an unbelievable thing. I learn a lot from him as well. You don’t even have to say something, you just have to watch - you can learn a lot. You see the attitude he has and you kind of take from that as well.<br /><br />[Despite his iconic status, Juric is doing all he can to keep Cahill out of the starting side] We joke around about it all the time. We have a good laugh, me and him, about that kind of stuff, but he takes it very seriously when he comes in. Obviously he’s happy to see me progress and improve and he’s happy to contribute off the bench or start. But you can see he’s still here and still fighting to play</p>

  <p>[The recent success of Aaron Mooy and Tom Rogic can’t help but have a positive flow-on effect for Australia] I was speaking to Aaron this morning and really got into him about his price tag. But he’s a really down to earth fella, who isn’t one to talk about that. I’m not surprised to be honest because you’ve seen how well he’s played this whole season. He’s been fantastic for Huddersfield in helping them win promotion to the Premier League. Tom has come back from injury and won the Scottish Cup in the dying seconds of the game. I bet they’re both full of confidence coming in with us. They’re really important players for us and we need them in this camp<br /><br />A lot of the boys have done really well this season. There have been some encouraging moves for the boys into new clubs and that’s really good for us. You can tell Australian football is moving forward<br /><br />[On A-League] It’s growing and we need to make sure we keep progressing. We can’t stop here. It’s been improving since day one and we’re bringing in some quality players</p>
