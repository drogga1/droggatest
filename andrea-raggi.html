  <p><b>[Monaco defender Andrea Raggi believes the presence of Kylian Mbappe gives Monaco a good chance of beating Juventus]</b> He is a true phenomenon. When you face him in training you have to cross yourself and hope that something goes wrong and stops him. In one-on-ones he is very fast and has great technique. He is a serene boy. He didn’t feel any pressure against Manchester City or Borussia Dortmund. I hope he sustains the pressure against Juve, so he’ll score two against them as well.<br /><br />Juve are at the top level and even stronger than they were two years ago. Having said that, so are we, and this is our chance for revenge. We never did got over the 2015 elimination and this is the right chance to make up for it, with interest, seeing as there’s a place in the final at stake. Two years ago, in Turin they were happy to draw Monaco, but I think now they’ll be slightly less pleased. We scare everyone now</p>

  <p><b>[PSG had led 3-0 but were pegged back to 3-2 when, deep in stoppage time, the 25-year-old was booked after committing a foul on Hamari Traore. Not happy with the decision, he made as if to pull his opponent up but withdrew the offer of his hand when the Rennes defender reached up to grab it]</b> I saw what he did and I think that a champion like Neymar should have a little more respect for other players.</p>

  <p><b>[On Tiemoue Bakayoko]</b> I think Tiemoue needs to be put in the best condition to express himself the way he can. He has to feel important and mustn’t have too much pressure on his shoulders, at least not at the start</p>
