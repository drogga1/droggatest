  <p><b>[Bury FC given short-term lifeline as EFL grants extension for takeover of League One club]</b> The Board has fully considered the information that has been made available by C&amp;N Sporting Risk and whilst no formal sale has been completed, despite reports to the contrary, enough credible information was presented to allow the Board to agree to work exclusively with the Club and C&amp;N Sporting Risk over this Bank Holiday weekend in an attempt to finalise the change of control and achieve a positive outcome for Bury FC.<br /><br />The League cannot be in a position whereby any more of the club’s fixtures will be suspended due to the integrity of the competition, the impact on other clubs in the League and therefore has stated that matters must be concluded by 5pm on Tuesday. If in the event a successful outcome is not achieved by this point, then Bury FC’s share in the EFL will be withdrawn and its membership in the League will come to an end</p>

  <p><b>[Bury FC on the brink after potential buyer pulls out. C&amp;N Sporting Risk have now pulled out of the deal following a period of due diligence]</b> As part of our due diligence, we set ourselves a list of key criteria regarding the CVA, the ground, and the overall financial state of the club that had to be met in order for us to be satisfied that we have enough knowledge to proceed with the takeover. The complexities involved in each of these matters escalated and continue to do so. It is therefore with regret that we will be unable to proceed with the takeover of Bury FC. This decision has not been taken lightly. We fully understand the importance of the club to the community, and it is with this in mind that we have informed the EFL of our decision at the earliest possible opportunity</p>
