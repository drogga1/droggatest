  <p><b>[Manchester United goalkeeper Sam Johnstone has completed a £6.5 million transfer to West Brom]</b> Sam is young and determined to be the best keeper he can possibly be - he’s hungry to do that with us at Albion. We’ve had him targeted from the outset and we’re all delighted to have him on board. He buys into exactly what we are trying to achieve and will hopefully represent the shape of things to come</p>

  <p><b>[When Darren Moore, now the West Bromwich Albion manager, took the FA advanced youth award back in 2015]</b> One thing I will take from this course is the thought: ‘What environment am I setting for the players?’. Chelsea delivered a great presentation on how to give players more ownership <b>[of their development]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Wycombe reached the Championship for the first time in their 133-year history after beating Oxford 2-1 at Wembley]</b> <b>[<a href="gareth-ainsworth.html">Ainsworth</a>]</b> has been at the club for more than eight years now so he knows every square foot of it, but also the community of the club. It’s instrumental that he remains there as they look towards the Championship. They need to enjoy this for now and see where it goes from there, but what a wonderful success story. Well done to them all</p>
