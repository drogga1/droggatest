  <p>[Veteran Brazilian Formiga became the first player to appear at seven editions of the Women’s World Cup and the oldest to feature in the tournament when she lined up against Jamaica on Sunday] I had no intention to carry on and play in the World Cup, but breaking barriers spurs me on</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Vadao’s re-appointment followed the sacking of the team’s first ever female coach, Emily Lima, who was relieved of her duties after just 13 games in charge. Her dismissal prompted five players to withdraw themselves from selection for the national team, while an open letter criticising the Brazilian federation was published and signed by eight players, including stars such as Cristiane and Formiga] We, the players, have invested years of our own lives and all of our energy to build this team and this sport to its strength today. Yet we, and almost all other Brazilian women, are excluded from the leadership and decision-making for our own team and our own sport</p>
