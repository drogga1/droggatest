  <p>[On Darlington Nagbe] He has really good technique. For us, it’s easy playing with him because when we have problems, we give the ball to him and he solves them. I don’t think I appreciated his talent enough, obviously only having played him once a year the past few years.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Poised Michael Parkhurst has elusive MLS Cup title within reach] [Parkhurst] helps bring a balance when it comes to the South Americans on the team. We live every play, in general, with passion and emotion, and he helps keep us grounded in those moments where we might feel like things are life and death and he can calm us down and show us that there are more important things to worry about.<br /><br />When I first met him I thought he was [Atlanta coach Gerardo “Tata” Martino’s] assistant or something. We’re always calling him the grandpa of the team, because when you look at him he looks like he works in the front office. But when it’s time to play, he teaches us every day. We learn from him because he’s a player with excellent technical quality and very good concepts about how to defend, so I learn from him every day</p>

  <p>[Atlanta United hopes to send off humble, direct Martino with MLS Cup win] He’s an excellent manager. He has a lot of good values as a person. He makes things very clear with short and direct messages. On the playing field, it’s the same. He speaks about working on tactics very clearly and knows a lot about football, so we’re going to miss him a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Atlanta United versus Portland Timbers has distinct Latin American flavor] It’s going to be like a mini-Libertadores with so many South American players, and the South American coaches.<br /><br />Finals like these are the kind of matches Argentines and South Americans live for. They play better when there’s more pressure. They revel in the pressure, so I have no doubt that will help give us a great final</p>
