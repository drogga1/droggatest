  <p><b>[Sporting Kansas City has signed 26-year-old Spanish midfielder Ilie Sanchez on a two-year]</b> Ilie is a player we have been interested in and followed for a long time. We are very fortunate to add him to our roster as we get ready for the 2017 season.</p>

  <p><b>[On Peter Vermes]</b> <b>[Vermes’]</b> philosophy of play was what convinced me, and as soon as I arrived, and saw that it was true, and I could work with total liberty, I was happy with my decision. I think we play a daring kind of soccer, and we do it well, we train for that, but I wasn’t expecting a team that is so organized, with such clear ideas.<br /><br />MLS is a good league. For those of us in Spain, we hear a lot about MLS with David Villa playing here, and the media there also discusses MLS. We know the level it’s at, and the level it can reach and the goals it has to grow. Now that I’m here, I can attest that all the teams have good players, and there are good managers, and all the teams are very similar in level. Hopefully interest in the league can continue to grow<br /><br />It’s difficult, obviously, because all you know is Spain and Europe, and the level is high and you want to play at the highest level. What happened <b>[for me]</b> is that the options I had in Spain and Europe were similar to coming to MLS, and what I was looking for was a system where I could thrive as a player, where I could help and show my ability. I’ve found that here, and at no point have I regretted my decision to leave Spain or Europe. If one day I have to go back, then I’ll go back, but right now I’m happy here<br /><br /><b>[Sanchez has already turned MLS recruiter, having consulted close friend and former Barcelona B teammate Victor Vasquez to sign with Toronto FC]</b> We’re very close friends, he’s like a brother, and before he went to Toronto he asked me about the league and how the preseason was going with Sporting. I don’t like to give players advice about where to play, because everyone’s experience can be different and I wouldn’t want to feel to blame if things don’t go well, but I told him my experience, and told him not to think twice. If he had the opportunity to come to MLS, and a team like Toronto, because everything I can say about the league is positive<br /><br />I just want to repay the confidence <b>[Vermes]</b> shows in me and gives me every game. I’ve played in Spain, I’ve played in Germany, and now I’m here and in the end when you’re 26 what you need to do is play games and keep learning, and with Peter I’m learning a lot and that’s what I value the most</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting Kansas City &amp; Atlanta United fall in CCL quarterfinal first legs]</b> This is definitely not the result we wanted, but we still have the second leg in Kansas City<br /><br />We would have liked to score another one to tie the game at least, but in the end scoring here in a very tough place with these fantastic fans, it’s important for us. But we lost the game, we are not happy and we hope to come back next <b>[Thursday]</b></p>
