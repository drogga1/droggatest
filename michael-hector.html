  <p><b>[The Blues loanee is on a football adventure in Germany as he helps Eintracht Frankfurt to compete for an unlikely Champions League spot]</b> It has been a crazy journey. I was released young, going to non-league then going to Reading. I could look back <b>[and say]</b> that I could be working in Footlocker or JD Sports and have a completely different life. I was going to go to America for studies and I helped my dad with coaching in schools. So maybe I would have done that <b>[if Reading didn’t come along]</b> or go to university. I always wanted to be a footballer, like most young boys, and before I signed for Reading I was coaching tennis. It was surreal to be signed at 16-17 at Reading and now to be playing in the Bundesliga, but there’s still a long journey to go. It helped me because there are going to be setbacks - this is football. To be perfect means you are Cristiano Ronaldo or Messi and even they get setbacks. You can’t be perfect always and I’ve understood that in my career. There are good times and low times, so focus on your goal that you want to achieve.<br /><br />I had never even been in Germany before Eintracht came along. People were surprised about me coming out here to play in Germany, but I feel if I can play in as many leagues, cultures and countries in my career, then I can get benefits and I am getting on a bit now. I went to Scotland, Ireland and now here. It makes me more of a man and it helps my game. I learn different techniques and learn how to deal with different situations. I am a professional footballer. It has been a good journey to experience all these different types of ways to play football. Danny Williams played in the Bundesliga before he came to Reading and I actually spoke to him when I was thinking about coming out here. He said to go because it’s a special club<br /><br />It has got a lot of history and he knew one of the players from America and he said ‘yes, it a special place’. Compared to lots of other cities in Germany it is really multicultural. It has a nice skyline and everything you need. <b>[Garath]</b> McCleary and <b>[Nick]</b> Blackman watch the German league anyway and they are going to come over when they can. My family watch me on TV, but they often come to the big games and I have played in them. My old kit man at Reading came to one of my games so it has been good - and I think a few of my old team-mates will come up when I have a game on a Sunday. My friends enjoy it - they said the atmosphere was surreal here and the hospitality is very good. The flights are every hour to London, so it’s good for friends and family<br /><br />I feel that I have improved my passing and defending, but I would have liked to have played a little more as I came to play. To play at this level <b>[has been useful]</b>, but ultimately, I’d like to play in the Premier League. Obviously a few people may have doubted that I could step up to the Premier League from the Championship <b>[before my move]</b>, but to play in the Bundesliga in a good team, against good teams as well, I feel now that I have proven that I can play at the top level. A few more games between now and the end of the season will stand me in good stead for next season and to kick on. Back home they analyse my games and have seen a step up since I was at Reading. The decisions are getting better and situations are improving during the game and that’s why I am on loan: to improve</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea loanee Michael Hector says high-flying Frankfurt fear no one]</b> I think that as a team, we understand that we are achieving beyond what people expect us to. But the people we are playing are human beings as well and just because they are big names, it doesn’t mean they have a right to win the game. We have proven that with the right football, we can compete with anyone on their day. That’s the mentality installed into our heads and we take it into every game. To play in front of my family in Dortmund was special and nice - and to even beat Dortmund was surreal. The players they had on the pitch at the time, they were world class players so to keep them quiet was good. I think the Berlin game was special because I have never experienced a last minute goal, so to score a last minute goal to help the team <b>[pick up points]</b> was a surreal feeling.<br /><br />It is frustrating to not play in other games and I have come to play week-in-week-out. I have spoken to him and he understands that and he is the manager who obviously picks the team. I know when I am called upon that I can do the job and I know I can help my team win the games, but it is not my decision to pick the team. All I can do is train hard and work hard for the team. It is nice to play the big games here and hopefully I can play more, both home and away. The mentality he has is very strong, he is a hard man and a perfectionist. He is tough. It is good for what the team needs. He has drilled the team very well into shape and what he wants. He is a very good manager and you can see it with his record here and he has done very well, got a new contract and he is flying. The staff around him bounce off each other very well, it is his brother. They do well together and that’s why the team is doing very well<br /><br /><b>[Hector started his side’s victory over Hannover 96]</b> The players have kept their feet on the ground. I live at a hotel and the staff at the hotel are Frankfurt fans and they are buzzing at the moment and they can’t believe our achievement and it is hard to say to a fan ‘calm down’. They have been waiting all their lives to see their team do really well, but we need to remain focused and stay on course with what we are doing now. I have made a few friends. It has been good. The keeper, Lucas <b>[Hradecky]</b>, is a very interesting guy. I go for food with him, Branna <b>[Hrgota]</b> and Taleb is my room mate so I have got on well with him because we room together. There is a few others that I share lifts with. It has only been a short space of time but we go for meals together in the evenings and they all live in Frankfurt</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea loanee Michael Hector is looking to Bayern Munich’s Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng for inspiration]</b> As a player against me, Messi was surreal to play against. But Boateng and Hummels when we played them, I watched the game back and you want to get to that type of level where you are just calm <b>[like them]</b>. Even when they are under pressure, they are calm, defending one-versus-one. It’s calm, it is never a panic. They may be panicking but they look calm and just deal with situations and that’s a world-class centre-back. That’s my position. I need to be positive and aggressive, but have the calmness to deal with situations. If you want to be a world-class centre back, that’s what you want to do, to watch world-class centre backs. You need to keep the ball, that’s the game now. World-class teams, or good teams, need to keep the ball as you will have most of the ball and start your attacks, so it is a different ball game now<br /><br />He was good <b>[Aubameyang]</b>, as were Dembele, Schurrle, Reus. Their front three were very quick. It was all a surreal experience. We just had to keep tight with him. He <b>[Aubameyang]</b> is a world-class player, if you give him the space, he is obviously going to punish you. It was good to keep him quiet. He obviously scored, but it was good to play a good game and beat a world-class team. Arsenal, when I was at Reading in the FA Cup, that was one of the toughest ones <b>[before my move]</b> because we kept them to extra-time as well, in the semi-final. Dortmund are just as good and maybe better than Arsenal on their day so it was good to play for 90 minutes <b>[against them]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea loanee Michael Hector revealed that John Terry reached out to him after a difficult start to life at Eintracht Frankfurt]</b> He has helped me quite a bit since I signed for Chelsea. During pre-season, I had to sing in front of him <b>[in an initiation]</b>. He took me to play golf with him and Carlo Cudicini. It was good for someone I respected and watched growing up to be so down to earth. He helped me through a tough time when I was training in the first team and in pre-season. Obviously when I joined I was 23 and had played a lot of games but to train with the team you support is completely different.<br /><br />It took me a week to understand that I deserve to be here and that I am a part of this. I am not a fan anymore, I’ve not just won a chance to train with the players but I had earned the right to play here and train with these players. He spoke to me well and even when I started badly at Frankfurt with the two red cards, he sent me a text saying, ‘This is football, it is part of our jobs as a defender and these things happen.’<br /><br />He said you are a good defender and you will come out from it. When I scored he sent me a text saying, ‘Well done and I am buzzing for you’. I was only around him for a month and for him to take time out to send me these messages, his messages mean a lot to me and it shows the type of person that he is. He is down to earth and he is such a nice guy. He is a football man and he has always looked after the new players that have come in. It is a pleasure for someone like that to look out for me<br /><br />It was a wake up call <b>[coming to Germany]</b> for me. I needed this. To move away from home, I am older now. I am more mature, I make better decisions than when I was younger. Training and the German mentality has been drummed into me now. Obviously, I am a laid back person off the field, but on the field I am a hard worker. I am a winner. I want to win every game in training, I want to win. The German mentality means 100 per cent every day.<br /><br />I am not used to that type of training. In England you build up during the week and then sometimes you slow down to save energy for the game. In Germany you give 100% leading up to the game and it is a different mentality. It is one my body is used to now. It will benefit me wherever I go, whether I go back to Chelsea or stay here, or go somewhere else. It will benefit me, learning to look after my body better. In Germany it has been a good decision to come here. I learned a lot from it and I will look back at the end of my career and think, ‘Yes it was a great move to come here, and learn as well.’ I am learning my position in a different culture. This is the highest league I have played in and when you make mistakes on the pitch, you get punished<br /><br /><b>[On Eddie Newton and Paulo Ferreira]</b> They have come out here quite a bit, they have watched me. They are happy with the games I have played but want me to play more games. There’s areas I need to improve on, it will help with more minutes that I get. As a centre-half, you get better with age, with the experience of playing in the big games and playing consistently. I feel I have got better as a player and they feel I have gone up to another level as a player from being out here</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Hector is not fearful of facing the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Marco Reus and Shinji Kagawa as Frankfurt gear up for the DFB Pokal final against Borussia Dortmund]</b> It is men against men, they are not superhuman. We feel that on our day, we can beat them. We beat them already this season. We are going to try and do the same thing that we did last time. We were in their faces, we won every second ball, we were positive. We attacked them, we didn’t just sit back and defend.<br /><br />We defended well, we pushed them high up the field. I think that’s what we need to do. We need to test them defensively and that’s what will win us the game. If we sit back and defend for 90 minutes, then I don’t think that’s going to work.<br /><br />We will play our game and go for it. It is a one-off game and anything can happen in the cup final. They have got Marco Reus, Ousmane Dembele, Kagawa. They have so many players that can hurt you on their day. We have to respect Aubameyang’s record at the moment because he is on fire. We have to respect the other players as well. They are world class as well. It will be a tough ask to beat them, but on the day we will be fired up and anything can happen.<br /><br />It has been a long-run, it has been tough and most of our games have been away and against tough competition. We deserve to be in the final. It will be another tough battle against Dortmund but it is a fair playing field at a neutral venue.<br /><br />I didn’t know if I was going to play the semi and then the manager showed he trusted me. It was good on him for believing in me. It was a tough time for me and I was able to prove him right and help to win that semi-final. I played well, scored a penalty which put us on our way to winning the shootout.<br /><br />We have had good chats, which were needed. When I wasn’t playing I needed to know what he felt, I needed to improve. I learned what he wanted from me and I think that’s the best thing that I have done, to talk with him and we sat down and spoke like men. We spoke about what I wanted from the loan and what he wanted from me. Since then, we both know exactly what each other wants and that’s what we have given each other. That’s why I have been playing as much of late.<br /><br />I think that’s what you need in football. Sometimes players don’t have that chat with their manager, so they don’t know what they are doing wrong. The manager wasn’t happy with something and I understood that and now we both know how we are feeling. We can move on and I have respect for him. He was an amazing footballer himself and now he wants to be the coach that he can be. He is a top-quality coach and still learning about management and his time at Frankfurt has been amazing. He wants to get to the top as well, it has been great to learn from him along the way<br /><br />Professionally, it was my first penalty. When I went up to the spot, I didn’t hear the referee’s whistle. I was standing there for quite a while and he blew it again! Everyone on the bench thought: ‘Oh god, he’s nervous. He’s not ready, he’s never taken a penalty before’. I wasn’t actually nervous, I was more nervous watching everyone else take their penalties. I absolutely hate watching penalties. Being part of the shootout isn’t a great feeling but to win it was an unbelievable experience. It is one I will remember for the rest of my career</p>
