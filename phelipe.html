<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Meet new Brazil starlet Phelipe]</b> Nobody called me. I was taken by complete surprise. I was at training and, as it was over and I was leaving the field, the youth team technical director received the call and then called me over to the coaching staff to tell me. At first, I was a bit scared - I couldn’t believe it. Right after I left the field, I went up to the physio room where they congratulated me and showed me they had said in the media, and Professor Tite on TV <b>[confirming my call-up]</b> and then it sank in<br /><br />Now a goalkeeper has to have all the tools. Modern football asks more of goalkeepers. We now have to play with our feet and be able to pass through lines and provide cover, and I think a goalkeeper now needs to be able to do all of that.<br /><br />I do not know anyone personally <b>[in the squad]</b>, so it’s all very new to me and I hope to meet and get to know everyone. This period is going to be very good for me, because it will be a great experience from which I can take things back home and share with my team-mates back here at Gremio</p>
