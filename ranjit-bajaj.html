  <p><b>[Minerva Punjab owner Ranjit Bajaj incensed with ban, set to appeal]</b> Honestly, I was shocked when I received their communication. I had earlier received a showcause notice and I made it clear that I used no abusive language towards the referee. However, they have gone ahead and banned me from the stadium for eight games along with this huge monetary fine as well!<br /><br />I wouldn’t have been as surprised had they gone with the usual sanctions they impose on similar offenses, which would have been a suspension from the bench for a couple of matches. But a stadium ban? I was up the whole of last night looking up precedents and could find none. Stadium bans are handed out for racial abuse or inciting hatred or match fixing. What is the gravity of the offense they claim I have committed as compared to these?<br /><br />I have put my all into my team and am unable to watch them play, even from the stands! I am even more concerned about my U-18 team. I mentor those kids, coach them, we are very close, and I cannot even take them out for matches!<br /><br />Definitely I will appeal this. The ban and the fine have no precedent. They say that this ban is for an accumulation of offenses, but I have already received a red card and served that suspension, giving me a clean slate. But what is the purpose of the appeal even if they reduce the ban? Today my team played East Bengal, which is one of the biggest matches in our club’s history, and I was forced to watch from the team hotel despite making the trip to Kolkata!</p>

  <p><b>[From University team to Indian National Team - Davinder Singh is a proud Punjabi living his dream]</b> He <b>[Davinder]</b> is very tough. We saw that some of the tackles he made when he was playing for India U-23 were superb. He has got all the basics right. His performances were all down to how badly he wanted it. I have never seen him play better than when he played for India and that is a great sign. They were other good players on that team but he made sure he got selected and that is also important<br /><br />We picked up two boys from Dalbir football academy in Patiala for second division campaign- Davinder and Santosh. Unfortunately, just before the second division was about to start, he <b>[Davinder]</b> got injured. He kept on practising with us and then he was okay and played and we really liked it. And then he went back to play Santosh Trophy for Punjab and he came back. He has been with us since the very beginning. Whenever he’s nearby, he trains with us</p>
