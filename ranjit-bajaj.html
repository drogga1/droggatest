  <p><b>[Minerva Punjab owner Ranjit Bajaj incensed with ban, set to appeal]</b> Honestly, I was shocked when I received their communication. I had earlier received a showcause notice and I made it clear that I used no abusive language towards the referee. However, they have gone ahead and banned me from the stadium for eight games along with this huge monetary fine as well!<br /><br />I wouldn’t have been as surprised had they gone with the usual sanctions they impose on similar offenses, which would have been a suspension from the bench for a couple of matches. But a stadium ban? I was up the whole of last night looking up precedents and could find none. Stadium bans are handed out for racial abuse or inciting hatred or match fixing. What is the gravity of the offense they claim I have committed as compared to these?<br /><br />I have put my all into my team and am unable to watch them play, even from the stands! I am even more concerned about my U-18 team. I mentor those kids, coach them, we are very close, and I cannot even take them out for matches!<br /><br />Definitely I will appeal this. The ban and the fine have no precedent. They say that this ban is for an accumulation of offenses, but I have already received a red card and served that suspension, giving me a clean slate. But what is the purpose of the appeal even if they reduce the ban? Today my team played East Bengal, which is one of the biggest matches in our club’s history, and I was forced to watch from the team hotel despite making the trip to Kolkata!</p>

  <p><b>[From University team to Indian National Team - Davinder Singh is a proud Punjabi living his dream]</b> He <b>[Davinder]</b> is very tough. We saw that some of the tackles he made when he was playing for India U-23 were superb. He has got all the basics right. His performances were all down to how badly he wanted it. I have never seen him play better than when he played for India and that is a great sign. They were other good players on that team but he made sure he got selected and that is also important<br /><br />We picked up two boys from Dalbir football academy in Patiala for second division campaign- Davinder and Santosh. Unfortunately, just before the second division was about to start, he <b>[Davinder]</b> got injured. He kept on practising with us and then he was okay and played and we really liked it. And then he went back to play Santosh Trophy for Punjab and he came back. He has been with us since the very beginning. Whenever he’s nearby, he trains with us</p>

  <p><b>[Ranjit Bajaj stated that he wants a fair trial and that the Committee also listens to the facts presented by his club]</b> We have told them that you can’t say anything unless you give us a proper trial date and hear our side of the story because right now the Federation has heard their lawyers talking. So, we have requested for a date to at least hear our side. We are being victimized here. The only thing we want is a hearing date so they can check out our side of the story.</p>

  <p><b>[Ravi Kumar controversy: Minerva Punjab owner Ranjit Bajaj defends stand]</b> Non-payment <b>[of dues]</b> has not been an issue at all. The other issue is that Ravi Kumar is facing civil and criminal courses in the court here. Their contention is that the contract has been interpreted in the wrong way. There’s nothing about forgery in this case.<br /><br />Under Economic offences wing, Ravi Kumar is facing a criminal offence and his lawyer is already been called in as a complaint has been filed against Ravi for taking the money and running off and not keeping to his contract. And if he is proved so, section 120 B of conspiracy will apply as Indian Super League <b>[ISL]</b> club <b>[NorthEast United]</b> have supported him in the contract even though they were informed that he already has a valid contract.<br /><br />Ravi Kumar cannot contact any team as per the FIFA rules because if there’s more than one year left in a contract, no player or agent can contact that player and the only way it <b>[the deal]</b> has to be done is through <b>[contacting]</b> the club. Their contention is that since Ravi Kumar has contacted the ISL himself, you <b>[Minerva]</b> have nothing to do with this so Minerva won’t get the 20 percent <b>[as included in the clause]</b> fee<br /><br />Ravi Kumar, before he went, had signed a one-year extension with Minerva and we gave him ₹1 Lakh advance as signing bonus. He signed the contract and took the advance too. There’s a buyout clause in his contract which says Minerva will get 20 percent if he is sold to any ISL club. Now, we have been told that the club will not get the 20 percent because the club didn’t contact the ISL outfit, it was Ravi who contacted them<br /><br />There is no doubt on the fact that Ravi’s contract with Minerva is a valid one. They <b>[All India Football Federation]</b> have agreed to it too. The only issue is that the club is charged with the offence of trying to stop the sale and jeopardizing Ravi’s career. I still consider Ravi Kumar to be my player<br /><br />And the forgery charge being said here is that they claim I have tried to stop the sale by misrepresenting the contract in front of everybody. We have been telling them to give us the notice to tell what according to them has been forged/fabricated/falsified. So we said please give us which documents have been forged - what are you talking about, which part do you indicate at?<br /><br />We have requested for the charges <b>[which they claim]</b> and the copy of the complaint since if we do not have those we cannot file a defence. We have still not received it despite asking for<br /><br /><b>[Bajaj also revealed that he filed a case against the AIFF and ISL after Ravi Kumar’s name was included in the Players Draft in July]</b> A legal notice was given from my lawyer to the ISL and the AIFF, mentioning that the player is mine and we do not do the business unless we issue a proper NOC <b>[No Objection Certificate]</b>.<br /><br />There was no reply and they were sold the next day <b>[in the draft]</b>. Then my team actually sent them a notice saying this is wrong so they called a Player Status Committee meeting after a month. And they told us to come in two days or else an ex parte decision would be given, so I sent my lawyer.<br /><br />When my lawyer requested to talk for 10 minutes, they said you go away, we’ll tell you our decision. Next day we got a decision that the players isn’t yours <b>[Minerva’s]</b> and belongs to the ISL side</p>
