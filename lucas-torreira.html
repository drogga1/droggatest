  <p><b>[Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira has fuelled reports of him moving to <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> after admitting that he has struggled to get used to life in England]</b> I don’t know if there’s a lot of things that I’m enjoying because I think I liked living in Italy more. London is a completely different world. England is a very big country. I had trouble with the language, communicating with my team-mates and with the people. It’s pretty rough in certain moments when you can’t have any dialogue, that’s the most important part.<br /><br /><b>[He did, though, admit that he believes he could get used to the climate]</b> The weather is also difficult. You go out in the morning and it’s cloudy and you get back after training and it’s still cloudy. I miss the sun. Mostly us South Americans are used to having sunny days. But I think I’ll get used to it as the years go by</p>

I have learned of this possibility through the press. Could a call from Giampaolo be something special for Lucas? Yes, clearly.</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Torreira claims to have no issue with the competition for places he faces at Arsenal]</b> I don’t know whether I’d say it’s frustrating. All players want to play, they obviously want to be in the starting XI - that’s completely normal. But that’s not something that depends on me. It’s down to the coach to make those decisions and really I have to respect that. Right now it’s about not giving up. You have to continue working hard and whether I’m playing in the starting XI or from the bench I want to give my all for the team. That’s the kind of player I am. I like to give 100 per cent for the shirt to help my team-mates and to give the fans something to cheer about</p>

It is one of the most important <b>[teams]</b> in South America, very passionate, so from a very young age this affection, this love for Boca was born. I had to go to the Madrid final and when the game ended I thought I wasn’t going to be so mad but I was very sad, for the defeat and for how the game had been. It was the time I got to see Boca as a fan. It is true that I have great affection for the club and hopefully it will be forever. In Fray Bentos, I have many friends who are fans of Boca</p>
