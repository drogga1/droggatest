  <p><b>[Arsenal are set to complete the signings of Sampdoria midfielder Lucas Torreira and Lorient’s Matteo Guendouzi]</b> I was very happy to leave for Uruguay with my team-mates but this is a good opportunity and I don’t want to waste.</p>

  <p><b>[The next Marco Verratti - Meet Arsenal signing &amp; emerging superstar Lucas Torreira]</b> I’ll never change. It’s true, people recognise me more now. In Uruguay I was never known as I left so young.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Lucas Torreira considers Arsenal team-mate Mesut Ozil to be a top player]</b> Ozil is a top player. He has already won a World Cup and he has a lot of experience. He is a very important player for Arsenal. We want to see him offering everything he knows and we want to see him happy on the field. He is playing very well this season and it is a great honour to share the field with him.<br /><br />I’m very happy and enjoying every moment. I made a lot of sacrifices to get here, I struggled a lot, so I try to enjoy myself every day, learn more and help the team, which now has 11 consecutive victories. I want to continue on this path and to grow more alongside the whole team, which is also growing<br /><br />It’s not easy at first. When you win it seems that everything is fine, so you have to be calm. A new life in England has been a big challenge, a different style of football, the language. I’m studying English as that is something very important. I am calm, growing slowly and learning new things. I repeat, I am very happy.</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Torreira has aired his pride at earning amazing comparisons to Arsenal legend Patrick Vieira]</b> If the fans are comparing me and my game to Patrick Vieira, that’s amazing. It makes me very proud but I need to grow a bit before I can be as tall as him! But he’s an amazing player, I remember getting up in the mornings in Uruguay to watch him. I feel very happy and am looking to help the team. I’m trying to improve as a player and do what’s best for the team. Right now we’re doing very well so it’s just about doing that.<br /><br />I really hope that we can achieve some really big goals this season. We are obviously competing in four competitions, so really it’s a case of so far so good. We’ve had a very good run so far, that has taken a lot of hard work but the team is working hard and improving with each game. Personally, I think a good objective for us would be to try and qualify for the Champions League, that would be fantastic for the club and the fans. We also want to fight until the end in the Premier League, the Europa League, Carabao Cup and when the FA Cup starts too</p>

  <p><b>[Uruguay’s Lucas Torreira can’t wait for Brazil clash]</b> It will be an awesome game. It’s a friendly but it’s still such an important game. Every time you pull on your national team’s jersey you are giving it all your strength and taking it seriously. We want the result to go our way, but the important thing is that the team looks good and it feels like we are continuing to grow. We’ve got to maintain our calm as a product of the coaching and show the growth of their team. And now, the clash with Brazil should be a great match. They didn’t do brilliantly at the World Cup but it’s a team that is always good to watch with players who know how to play nice football. They take pride in wearing the yellow jersey and it will be a good match but hopefully we can come out with the win. I haven’t had to face Neymar yet but he’s obviously a fantastic player who is great to watch and every time he has the ball you feel he is about to do something magnificent and entertain the fans. It will be a great game against Brazil and Neymar will have a big part in that. It will be up to us to be careful of him during the game because he’s so dangerous. He’s one of the best forwards in the world and we’ll have to be aware of how dangerous he is on the ball.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[How gifted Lucas Torreira became Arsenal’s most important player]</b> Granit is a player that I link up a lot with in the midfield and he covers lot of ground on the pitch. He occupies space really well and is important to the defensive balance of the team, which the manager knows. He’s an outlet for the first pass from defence and frustrates the opposition’s attackers. When he’s playing well, the team are going to win games. We’re gaining points and me and him are playing minutes together and gaining experience together, which is important.<br /><br />I am going to get to grips better with all the tactical aspects of how Arsenal play. Last year, I got used to Sampdoria’s style of play, where we had three players across the midfield, and I’m now adapting to Arsenal’s and there just being two of us. There are many things I can improve on, but that will come with time. We are going to have a much better understanding, we’ll only improve and when things are going well the team will become even better</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal may be 19 games unbeaten and buoyant after a derby win over Tottenham]</b> Today it was a great opportunity <b>[for us in the battle for the top four]</b>. We managed to win this game that was important for us as a team and for the fans. Now the game against Manchester <b>[United]</b> is coming. It will be against a direct rival because Manchester are behind us in the table. We have many goals this season. We are playing in several competitions and we are doing it in the best possible way. And the important thing is to continue growing as a team. It’s true <b>[United are eight points behind]</b> but they are still Manchester United, they are still a very strong team who have a great coach. They are going to play at home, with a lot of fans and we know that all the matches in this championship are different and very difficult.</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Torreira has attributed his good performances for Arsenal to the Uruguayan fighting spirit he has brought to Emirates Stadium]</b> That is something I carry inside of me. That is my way of playing, and I try to bring that positive energy to the team. I have the confidence of my team-mates and the coach tells me before every game to try to get forward. Obviously when we are out on the pitch we like to create chances to score. In the previous match I had hit the post, going so close. On Sunday I got lucky and I am so happy about that.<br /><br />Now the game against Manchester <b>[United]</b> is coming.

  <p><b>[Lucas Torreira admits Arsenal’s interest in him came as a welcome surprise]</b> At the end of my last season at Sampdoria there were lots of teams being talked about. I never imagined coming here to England because it was mainly Italian clubs being mentioned. Before I left for the World cup I got a call from the coach which was a massive surprise for me. I knew that I had earned it because of all my hard work and everything that I had done. That phone call made me a happy man. It allowed me to relax too because it allowed me to focus all my attention on the national team and the World Cup. I’m so proud to be part of such an important team.<br /><br />It hasn’t been easy though: there’s the language and the issue of communicating. I’m lucky because the coach is Spanish and the coaching staff are too, so that makes things easier for me because they can explain things in Spanish to me. It’s also not been easy to adapt to the football here: the intensity, the tempo and quality of games. At Sampdoria I had been used to playing in Serie A and Coppa Italia whereas now I’m involved in four competitions here as well as the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Torreira is hoping to spend a long time at Arsenal]</b> I gave my life for my country and now I have this opportunity with Arsenal. This chance is unique, every child and every footballer dreams of making it to this kind of club. At the start everything was very new for me because I came from another country, another life and another lifestyle. But I am a very normal guy, very natural. I devote my time to training and improving as a footballer. I live with my girlfriend and sometimes we go and visit all the emblematic things in town. London is one of the most important cities in the world and I feel very happy here. I am adapting to many new things and I hope I can stay in London for a long time. The weather can be a challenge, of course, and the Premier League is in my opinion the toughest tournament in the world. You have to be physically and mentally ready to play plenty of games.<br /><br />We play every three days, then there are international games too. You have to make sure you take care of your diet and rest because our bodies are our working tool, but I absolutely love the challenge. It’s also been great to be able to play alongside some truly world-class players. I sit in the dressing room between Mesut Ozil and Alex Lacazette. Mesut and Laca are fantastic players and people. They bring in that quality touch that the team needs. They dictate the tempo in every play of the game. Laca is in great scoring form, which is really important for us. When I arrived at the club they told me that my closet in the locker room was going to be in between Laca and Mesut. I would have never imagined or dreamed of something like that. I am privileged to live all this at the age of 23.<br /><br />My first target was to establish myself in the team. I feel like I’ve done that now. I wanted to understand the Premier League’s style of playing, because this is very different to Italian football. We have big targets but my biggest target is to keep on improving as a player and as a person so my team-mates get to know the kind of person I am. I want to carry on working hard. There’s no more important path than hard work.</p>

I did not think I was going to suffer so much, I experienced it with a lot of nerves. It was not as we wanted, but reaching the final is not something anyone just does. It was a nice show because I had never had the chance to see Boca.</p>
