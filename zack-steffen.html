  <p><b>[Incoming <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> goalkeeper Zack Steffen is set to move on loan to Fortuna Dusseldorf]</b> Columbus has been an amazing time and a crucial part of my career. It’s really the start of my career, and it’s been great. I’ll definitely make time to reflect when I’m settled over in Europe. They saved the Crew, they supported us through thick and thin, and they’ve been there every step of the way. Without them, we wouldn’t be where we are today. They’ve given me so much confidence and motivation and passion to strive for greatness. I’ll never ever forget my time here or the people here</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT keeper Zack Steffen says <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> is one of the best leagues in the world]</b> It’s amazing. It’s such a good and strong league, probably one of the best in the world. I’m just trying to enjoy it. I want to keep as many shots out as I can. I’m expecting to keep the team in the game. To make the saves I need to make and to do my job<br /><br /><b>[During his spell with Freiburg, Steffen trained with <a href="roman-burki.html">Roman Burki</a> who is now <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>’s No.1]</b> I like <b>[him]</b> a lot. He’s very strong, quick and athletic. I like his style of play. He’s also good with his feet<br /><br /><b>[The 24-year-old is also a fan of former USMNT goalkeeper Tim Howard]</b> When they asked me what number I wanted to pick, I saw 24 and I thought of <a href="tim-howard.html">Tim Howard</a>. He was and still is my role model. I just remember watching him as much as I could</p>

  <p><b>[Zack Stefen: USMNT lacks identity after wasted 2018]</b> We don’t have an identity right now. We’re very young and inexperienced and immature in the international soccer world right now. We’re trying to find our feet, we’re trying to find leadership, we’re trying to find our playing style<br /><br />I wasn’t happy with how we just pushed off the head coach <b>[hiring]</b> and all that stuff. I know it’s not easy, but 13 months? That’s way too long. It just makes no sense why to have that interim. For us players, we didn’t like it because we’d just go out there and have fun, work hard, compete. We didn’t really have a system. We didn’t have very many details or directions<br /><br /><b>[the U.S. is still a growing team]</b> That felt like the national team and then we went to the national team and that felt like a club team where we were way more laid back. It was more fun than business and serious like it is now.</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT enters uncharted territory as new generation takes political stand]</b> If I’m going to wear the U.S. flag, I need to know that it stands for something worth defending. I need to know that my country supports black lives. That our leaders see us. That they hear us. I am proud to defend my nation. All I ask is that my nation also defends me</p>
