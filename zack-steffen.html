  <p><b>[Change of paths has Zack Steffen shining in Columbus]</b> It was just tough not having a support system over there. You’re in your own little world over there. It was a pretty decent level. We’d play teams that were like the first teams of their cities, while most of us were 19, 20 and 21. It was a different experience.<br /><br />That’s the thing about being a goalkeeper, you make one mistake and you can be punished. You can’t dwell on something like that. We’re going to have couple of those a year. It’s going to happen. We don’t want it to happen in the first minute of an away game to give the team momentum, but it’s going to happen and I think him realizing that and sticking to the game plan is important. We want to give him the confidence that when he makes mistakes like that, he can rebound<br /><br />It’s in the back of my head, but I’m focused on the Crew and developing my game. I think about <b>[the national team]</b> very often. I definitely have all that in the back of my mind and the goal is to be back with the national team one day</p>

  <p><b>[Zack Steffen can’t repeat Atlanta penalty shootout heroics in MLS All-Star defeat]</b> It was ironic that I was back in this moment. It was crazy, but it was cool to do it against Juventus players this time, with Atlanta fans backing me up<br /><br /><b>[Steffen wearing a smile even in defeat]</b> It was amazing. It was a lot of fun and the guys were great. The game was the cherry on top.</p>

  <p><b>[Zack Steffen’s breakout year continues with MLS Goalkeeper of the Year award]</b> It means everything. Just to have that respect and the admiration from the guys in the league and the coaches in the league is amazing. It shows that hard work pays off. It’s an amazing accolade to receive.<br /><br /><b>[Steffen said of his decision to leave Freiburg]</b> There wasn’t one singular moment. I would just say it all built up. Just not having family over there, I was at a young time in my life, a weird time in my life, being 19, leaving college early, not really knowing who I was. Now I’m really keen on having a support system experience in my career along with me, and I didn’t have that over there at all. It just didn’t feel right and it wasn’t what I wanted. Fortunately enough I came back and the rest is history<br /><br />I would say it’s exceeded my expectations. I came back focusing on trying to find happiness again. Trying to see my family and be with my family, and enjoy having them around for my soccer here. Obviously I was focusing on trying to get better, and trying to get onto the team, in the starting XI. I didn’t expect for me to progress this fast<br /><br />Tim Howard was definitely number one, he was definitely my idol when I was growing up. There were others like (Iker) Casillas and (Edwin) Van Der Sar and Oliver Kahn, but Tim was at the top of the list<br /><br /><b>[MLS Goalkeeper of the Year award is Pat Onstad]</b> Pat’s been amazing. Ever since I got him back, he’s been supportive. Obviously on the field he’s a great goalkeeper coach. He has so much experience and he was a great goalkeeper. I’ve learned so much by just talking to him<br /><br />I’ve matured so much in these past three years ever since I left Germany. To have these experiences with my family on the side of the field here in Columbus and all over where they’ve traveled in cities in this league. That drives me for the next challenge. I want to be pushed. I know that if I go over there it’ll be different than in Germany</p>

  <p><b>[Columbus Crew have confirmed that goalkeeper Zack Steffen has secured a $10 million switch to Manchester City and will complete a move in July 2019]</b> Any success that I have had as a goalkeeper in MLS with Crew SC is a testament to those around me who have pushed me - team-mates, coaches, staff, family, friends and supporters. Today’s announcement regarding next summer is a special moment for me and I look forward to finishing my time with this club on a strong note. I am eager to continue to put in the work to improve and be the best teammate I can.</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Precourt intended to relocate the Crew to Austin]</b> You could tell right away the situation with them <b>[the fans]</b> - they were not happy and understandably. They felt betrayed.<br /><br />We should bring Columbus into the team more, kind of make it as one. Advertise the team around Columbus so people know when our games are and know where our games are and can keep track of them throughout the year. If we can do that, that will give us a lot of confidence and support to make the playoffs</p>

  <p><b>[Crew hoping transition from Berhalter to leads to championship result]</b> He’s not as detail-oriented as Gregg. He lets us play and gives us more freedom. You have to buy into what Caleb and his coaching staff want. It’s obviously different - every coach is different so you can’t come in here half-assed. You have to come in here with an open mind and a willingness to do what he wants</p>

It’s really the start of my career, and it’s been great. I’ll definitely make time to reflect when I’m settled over in Europe. They saved the Crew, they supported us through thick and thin, and they’ve been there every step of the way. Without them, we wouldn’t be where we are today. They’ve given me so much confidence and motivation and passion to strive for greatness. I’ll never ever forget my time here or the people here</p>

  <p><b>[Zack Stefen: USMNT lacks identity after wasted 2018]</b> We don’t have an identity right now. We’re very young and inexperienced and immature in the international soccer world right now. We’re trying to find our feet, we’re trying to find leadership, we’re trying to find our playing style<br /><br />I wasn’t happy with how we just pushed off the head coach <b>[hiring]</b> and all that stuff. I know it’s not easy, but 13 months? That’s way too long. It just makes no sense why to have that interim. For us players, we didn’t like it because we’d just go out there and have fun, work hard, compete. We didn’t really have a system. We didn’t have very many details or directions<br /><br /><b>[the U.S. is still a growing team]</b> That felt like the national team and then we went to the national team and that felt like a club team where we were way more laid back. It was more fun than business and serious like it is now.</p>
