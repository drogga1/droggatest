  <p><b>[Why Leroy Sane and Riyad Mahrez could learn from Zinchenko]</b> To be honest, I had a tough period when I was in PSV in Holland. I didn’t play there for some reasons and I was upset for a few months. After that, I did an analysis about myself and there was no point <b>[being like that]</b>, you have to be professional and you have to accept your situation and improve yourself. Only this way you can become a good player, a top player.<br /><br />I can say Vincent Kompany because a few times he has stayed with me on the pitch after training sessions to show me some details. It is good for me, he is a living legend and his advice for me is so important</p>

  <p><b>[Oleksandr Zinchenko will fulfil a long-held dream if he features for Manchester City in the FA Cup final]</b> It’s an unbelievable feeling, to be honest, to play at that stadium, in the final and to go to fight for a title. A final is always special and we can’t wait for that. For me, when I was younger, the cup was just as important as the Premier League. I don’t know how other players think about it, but for me, it’s like this. I would dream of playing at a high level <b>[when he was a kid]</b>, I didn’t realise that I would be here and getting ready for an FA Cup final. It’s a dream.<br /><br />It’s a special stadium with a special atmosphere. I’ve played there against Chelsea in the EFL Cup final and the atmosphere was incredible. The stadium is special no matter who you are playing against. Watford have very good players, especially up top. Their manager and the way they play, I like it. It’s going to be tough against them, I’m sure of that. But I think every single game, our target is to show everyone who we are.</p>

  <p><b>[Man City’s lucky charm Zinchenko eyeing new deal with treble winners]</b> It was a good record and I hope I’m a lucky charm. I hope to keep it going next season. I want to take my game further, of course, and I feel I am ready. This is why I came here, this is why I am here, and this is where I want to play in the future. I am really enjoying my time in this team and to be playing. It’s a massive pleasure to be a part of this club so hopefully we will see what happens <b>[with the contract]</b>. I hope we can get better and I want to be part of this.<br /><br />It’s been an unbelievable season, seriously, nothing more. I can’t even describe this moment and I don’t think anyone can do this again. We did an unbelievable job and we have made history, nothing can take that away from us. But I also see in this team the desire to do more. This is why we are Manchester City. We just have to show ourselves, our quality, in every single game for the future. We want to be the greatest team <b>[in English football]</b>. That’s the target and we just have to improve ourselves. Especially me, because I know I can get better. We are still learning, to be honest, and I think we can do even better</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> full-back Oleksandr Zinchenko has signed a three-year contract extension to stay with <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> champions until 2024]</b> It’s difficult to express how happy I am to sign this deal. This club offers players everything they need to improve and develop, so being here for five more years is an honour. This season shows we are built for success. It’s been amazing to be involved in such a historic campaign and it’s one I’ll never forget. But I am now completely focused on the coming years and I know more good times are around the corner</p>

  <p><b>[Oleksandr Zinchenko admits he cried when he found out <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a> would be leaving <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> I was crying because nobody was expecting that. But that’s football, nobody knows what could happen. I would like to stay in touch with him. For me he is absolutely a life legend. I am so lucky. Last season he was helping me a lot. Outside the pitch, inside the pitch, about this position. I remember a few times he took me after some training sessions, he was working with me around 40 minutes or something to try and help me<br /><br /><b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> is contracted at City until 2021 but Zinchenko sees no reason why former team-mate Kompany could not take up the coaching job some time down the line]</b> Why not? He can be that. He is the smartest guy who I know<br /><br /><b>[Zinchenko goes into the season as first-choice left back having signed a fresh long-term contract in June]</b> That’s a massive dream, to be part of the squad, to be part of this huge family. I was dreaming about that, now you just have to work a lot because hard work is important. Every single day you have to show your level in the training sessions and the games and you have to fight for your place. This is first step, to become number one, then the most important to stay there. Football is crazy, everything can change like that. You can be top today but tomorrow, again, again and again, you have to work a lot.<br /><br />In the national team I play in the middle, in <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at left-back, so I feel comfortable both sides. I think that’s good for all football players, when you can play different positions<br /><br /><b>[Zinchenko says there are still steps to take in order to improve]</b> We are still improving ourselves. We are on the right way, so we will see what happens this season but definitely we are going to work a lot on it. We were upset about the Champions League because we deserved more</p>

  <p><b>[Oleksandr Zinchenko hails <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> boss <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> as the best in the world after he became the fastest manager to 100 victories in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> history]</b> It’s unbelievable. He’s the best in the world, no doubt. For me, the most important thing is he knows the right thing to say at the right time, and the team feels these type of moments. Of course, he is unbelievable with tactics<br /><br /><b>[Zinchenko was back in the side for his first <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> appearance since September after suffering a knee injury that forced him to have surgery]</b> I didn’t expect it to be honest. It was a simple kick, I did it by myself, nobody even touched me. It was in the training session before the game against <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>. I came inside to check my knee and the scan didn’t show anything but at the end of the day it was blue and became so big. We had another scan and decided on surgery. It was not so serious, around 50 minutes or so, but now it’s fine<br /><br /><b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> has admitted that he has given up any thoughts of catching <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s side]</b> Of course it’s a massive gap. But we have to play our game every single time and show our class when we’re on the pitch and at the end of the season we will see what’s happened<br /><br /><b>[The final game of that run - the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> - falls on January 7 when most Ukrainians will be celebrating Christmas]</b> We are used to it, to be honest. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is the strongest league in the world, so we have to be ready. That’s it. I don’t celebrate Christmas in this kind of time. My Christmas is January 7, so I don’t mind it</p>

  <p><b>[Oleksandr Zinchenko jokes Carabao Cup should be renamed <a href="claudio-bravo.html">Claudio Bravo</a> Cup]</b> Someone said in the dressing room afterwards that we should now rename this as the <a href="claudio-bravo.html">Claudio Bravo</a> Cup rather than the Carabao Cup! Because Claudio did it again for us (with that save). It takes a lot to do that (the save at the end). Everyone was talking about him in the dressing room<br /><br />The game was a big battle. Villa were very well organised defensively and it was not easy but everyone understands that. It was a Cup final. It’s an unbelievable feeling to win the trophy again. It’s an incredible feeling to play at this stadium. We did it again three times in a row and it’s so important for us to win every title<br /><br /><b>[Zinchenko hoping for a positive end to the season]</b> We have an unbelievable squad and we want to fight for all the titles. Everyone is happy but now we have to think about the next games as we still have other challenges. We have to focus on our performance for every single game and then at the end of the season we will see if it has been a successful season for us. We are still fighting for other titles, we have to do our job and then we will see. We have the Champions League, we have <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and we are going to fight for these kind of titles and then we will see what happens. Everyone is focused on the next game, we don’t think too much ahead</p>
