  <p><b>[Bobby Jenks says <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> will try and talk <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> into making a move for John McGinn]</b> He’s up there with the best-performing midfielders in the division. Wait until he’s had a year at that level and then we can say more. What I do know is that <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> is wondering why <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> let a talented Scottish boy slip through. He’ll be keeping a close eye on him that’s for sure and if he continues the way he is, you can bet he’ll be telling his pals at United, too<br /><br /><b>[Jenks says it did not take him long to spot <a href="john-mcginn.html">McGinn</a>’s potential]</b> He wanted to win and knew that he had to work hard to do so. He was a typical Scottish boy with the heart of a lion. I noticed that from a young age. He was a box-to-box player who could win the ball, fire it up to the striker and support him. I felt he could add goals to his game and was dangerous around the edge of the box. He’s showing that now. He has a great engine and attitude. Yes, he got a wee bit agitated and would nip in every now and then. He picked up some bookings but that’s just his style. He wants to win the ball back and does it so well. Villa needed someone like him. They didn’t have any player quite like him. Last season he put himself about in the Championship to show what he was made of and I’m just pleased it’s worked out for him and the club now</p>
