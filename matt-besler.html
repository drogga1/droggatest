  <p><b>[USA and Sporting Kansas City centre-back Matt Besler in an open letter to Columbus Crew and Portland Timbers, offering his advice on how to best enjoy the moment at <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup]</b> Think about how much work you and your team-mates have put into this. Don’t let someone else get in the way of your ultimate goal at the last minute. Finally, enjoy the moment! It’s going to be over a lot faster than you think. You never know when you’ll make it back to the Final, if ever. I promise you won’t remember as much as you think. So make a conscious effort to take mental screenshots throughout the experience. It’s OK to smile and be excited. You should be, because I’m sitting at home typing this, and you’re still playing. Remember: Champagne stings</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto, Sporting KC take different lessons from scoreless draw]</b> I think it was a hard fought match. The weather conditions didn’t make it for an easy night to play. I think from a mentality standpoint we did a great job, I think both teams had a couple decent chances there but nobody was able to put it away. I think a draw was a fair result.</p>

  <p><b>[Gold Cup champion Matt Besler proving himself a success once again]</b> I think anytime you bring a group of guys together, there are challenges with gelling. Especially when the stakes are high and there’s added pressure to perform well because Bruce made it clear at the beginning of the tournament that this was a major opportunity for a lot of players and this was going to be the one time for some guys to show what they could do.<br /><br />I’m not a guy who will typically stand out with my characteristics of how I play, so it’s important for me, anytime I step out onto the field, for our team to play well and for our team to win</p>

  <p><b>[Matt Besler has never been big on the spotlight, but he may have to slightly adjust that perspective after his latest career move]</b> It’s not your typical sports biography. It’s going to be a collection of posts and quotes and stories <b>[not]</b> in chronological order.<br /><br />I started writing a couple blog posts, one was for The Players’ Tribune, another for MLSsoccer.com, just kind of random things throughout the years. I got some good feedback on a few of the posts that I wrote. I enjoyed the process and I enjoyed putting my voice out there<br /><br />My plan was to pull together a collection of posts, quotes, autobiographical stories, ideas, and opinions. Not only would this book potentially inspire people, I thought, this project would be therapeutic for me as I worked my way back from the concussion<br /><br />My goal isn’t to sell millions of copies and make a bunch of money. If I wanted to try and do that, I would have written a traditional biography with juicy details and controversial stories from my career<br /><br />My position is a position of mistakes. Other positions on the field, you’re encouraged to make mistakes, you want to try things. If you’re a forward and you make nine mistakes but the 10th shot goes in, you’ve done your job. Whereas as a defender, if you make nine great plays but the 10th play is a big mistake and you give up a goal then you’ve had a bad game. That’s something that I’ve learned. You almost have to change your mindset and you have to learn to be more safe until you don’t make those mistakes. That ultimately is what you’re judged on as a center defender<br /><br />You just have to choose whether you want it to affect you in a positive way or in a negative way. You have to find little things that you can contribute to turn it into a positive - that’s being ready physically just in case you are called upon, that’s accepting your role and making sure that your teammates are ready, doing what you can to get them ready and give them confidence<br /><br />At this level everybody is a good player and everybody at some point can make a good play or have a good game or have a good week, but the special players and the guys that really make a living and make a career out of it are the guys that can be consistent about it.</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT shifts focus to tricky Trinidad &amp; Tobago after emotional rout of Panama]</b> A lot of energy and a lot emotion went into that game from everybody. So now it’s on us to reset and refocus because we’re only halfway there. We have a big job to do on Tuesday.</p>

  <p><b>[MLS Talking Points: Zlatan braces for an encore, LAFC looks to rebound and more]</b> I don’t know what the exact dimensions are, or measurements of Zlatan, but I believe he’s 6-5, probably 230, and when he steps onto the field he’s probably the most skilled player. Does that ever happen? To be 6-5, 230, and to be the most skilled player on the field? Probably not, and so he’s a different player than you’ll ever go up against.</p>
