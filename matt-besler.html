  <p><b>[USA and Sporting Kansas City centre-back Matt Besler in an open letter to Columbus Crew and Portland Timbers, offering his advice on how to best enjoy the moment at <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup]</b> Think about how much work you and your team-mates have put into this. Don’t let someone else get in the way of your ultimate goal at the last minute. Finally, enjoy the moment! It’s going to be over a lot faster than you think. You never know when you’ll make it back to the Final, if ever. I promise you won’t remember as much as you think. So make a conscious effort to take mental screenshots throughout the experience. It’s OK to smile and be excited. You should be, because I’m sitting at home typing this, and you’re still playing. Remember: Champagne stings</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto, Sporting KC take different lessons from scoreless draw]</b> I think it was a hard fought match. The weather conditions didn’t make it for an easy night to play. I think from a mentality standpoint we did a great job, I think both teams had a couple decent chances there but nobody was able to put it away. I think a draw was a fair result.</p>

  <p><b>[Gold Cup champion Matt Besler proving himself a success once again]</b> I think anytime you bring a group of guys together, there are challenges with gelling. Especially when the stakes are high and there’s added pressure to perform well because Bruce made it clear at the beginning of the tournament that this was a major opportunity for a lot of players and this was going to be the one time for some guys to show what they could do.<br /><br />I’m not a guy who will typically stand out with my characteristics of how I play, so it’s important for me, anytime I step out onto the field, for our team to play well and for our team to win</p>

  <p><b>[MLS Talking Points: Zlatan braces for an encore, LAFC looks to rebound and more]</b> I don’t know what the exact dimensions are, or measurements of Zlatan, but I believe he’s 6-5, probably 230, and when he steps onto the field he’s probably the most skilled player. Does that ever happen? To be 6-5, 230, and to be the most skilled player on the field? Probably not, and so he’s a different player than you’ll ever go up against.</p>
