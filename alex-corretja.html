<blockquote>
  <p>[Pique’s plans to revamp the Davis Cup] For me, there are pros and cons, logically. It can be a spectacular format, there is no doubt about that. It is perhaps true that the magic of the Davis Cup, playing away from home, five-set matches, perhaps that will be lost with the new format. The ITF has accepted it. And in the end, the players will as well. It is just a little strange because the new format is nothing like the Davis Cup<br /><br />For me, doing a World Cup was basic. Tennis has to have a World Cup. The thing is that, if you have a World Cup, that means another week. Another week was difficult, so what they have thought is, for the world group, instead of an extra week, there is a meet-up at the end of the year<br /><br />The Davis Cup is two or three weeks a year, but with changes of surface, time changes, etc. You’ll be playing in Australia in January and four days later, you’re playing on the other side of the world, in another continent, with a change of temperature, surface, balls, time changes. It takes its toll sometimes and that is why sometimes the players decide not to play. There have been calls for change<br /><br />For the fans who travel to the tournament, it will be spectacular. An unforgettable experience. But for those who cannot travel and who used to watch their idols play close to home, they are going to miss out. Whenever there are changes, you win some things and lose others. That’s clear<br /><br />[On Gerard Pique] I know him a little and I have had the opportunity to talk about this with him. We haven’t spoken recently, though, and I would love to speak to him about it all in person. But it shows me that he is passionate about tennis; that he wants to be involved. I don’t understand why there are people saying ‘stick to your own thing’. If he has brought in a sponsor with so many millions and they want to make changes, and the ITF has accepted, I don’t think you can say anything to Pique. They should be grateful to Pique for having brought such an incredible movement to tennis and if anyone wants to know why these changes are being made, they need to ask the ITF, not Pique</p>
