  <p><b>[Manuel Neuer on whether he will win the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Ballon d’Or]</b> I’m not the sort of person who poses in their underwear. I hate the red carpet. I prefer the green grass. After the games the highlights show mostly the goals, scoring chances, assists. The spectator tends not to remember that as a goalkeeper I make difficult saves at great risk and start moves with my efforts</p>

  <p><b>[Manuel Neuer was speaking to ‘adidas’ and believes goalkeepers get the recognition though mistakes maybe highlighted]</b> I have a couple. <a href="jens-lehmann.html">Jens Lehmann</a> was always my hero, because he played for Schalke, and he was a bit of a goalkeeping revolutionary - he played the game his own way. There’s <a href="oliver-kahn.html">Oliver Kahn</a>, who as a German keeper you have to respect massively for what he achieved. And I also liked Edwin van der Saar, and the way he played, very much
<br /><br /><b>[Asked if the custodians get the recognition they deserve, Neuer was unfluttering in his answer]</b> I think they do. We have a high profile job and when we do it well, the rewards are high. It would be hard for me to say that I’m not getting recognition as a player, because of course that happens. But for me football isn’t about recognition - that is just something that comes with the game that I try not to pay too much attention to. My job is to get on with being the best goalkeeper I can be, training hard, enjoying being part of a team. Obviously though, goalkeepers are a little different to those who play outfield<br /><br /><b>[Neuer agrees with the idea that goalkeeping errors are potryaed larger than saves]</b> You might make some big saves that get shown on TV highlights, but the cameras might not notice something small but effective you did. If your team wins, it is the goalscorer that gets the recognition, sure. But that comes with the job, and if you don’t want to accept it, don’t be a goalkeeper. You save a penalty, you’re a hero, you make a mistake, you get slammed. That’s the business I’m in. Making mistakes and putting them behind you is a big part of playing in goal. They bug you, but you have to forget them</p>

Of course we will not go into the next match with the best feeling. But we know we did not play that bad against Ireland. I hope we saved the goals we did not score against Ireland and will score against Georgia.<br /><br /><b>[Neuer claimed the added responsibility of leading the team did not have an adverse effect]</b> In my role, nothing is changed by the captain’s armband. I also count on the players to take responsibility. From my position, I can see what is going on on the pitch very well and therefore I can have an influence</p>

  <p><b>[Manuel Neuer not thinking about retirement after turning 30]</b> How does a 30-year-old feel? I think at the age of 30 you still have youthful aspects, but at the same time you have gathered enough experience to know how to succeed in life. I like this mixture. I generally don’t think one’s age is all that meaningful - there are 50-year-olds who still act and think like children. Turning 30 is also not a big deal for me in terms of my football career.<br /><br />I feel fit and well - I know that I have to look after my health, but turning 30 is no reason to start considering the end of my career. I love playing football every day. I love working hard, I love training, I love the games, I love the challenge. As long as that still applies, I don’t see any reason to call time on something that makes me so happy.<br /><br />Our generation of players is very hungry for success. We are all very ambitious, and you don’t just lose this ambition by winning one trophy. I want to win the Bundesliga every year - and after winning it the first time, that feeling never went away. The same applies to the national team. Obviously it is our goal to win the European Championship, but that would also have been the case had we already won it back in 2012</p>

It doesn’t help when you’re rushing this decision. I want to improve day by day and I try to regain my fitness as fast as possible. The steps that I already made were good and positive.

We want to continue to work and learn a lot in order to bring a good team to the pitch in the summer of 2020. Of course there is always talk in football, we are a footballing country and everyone has their opinion, but that must not disturb us in our work. A healthy competition is always important.</p>

Winning can soon become normality for the people here but for us it’s hard work. I have a completely different view on what many people have regarded for decades as the legendary ‘Bayern-luck’. That for me is the unrelenting belief in being able to turn a game around right up until the final whistle - as we showed twice at the end of the first half of the season. That belief, that confidence, is ingrained in the club and its tradition<br /><br />Essentially, any year without trophies for an ambitious club like <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> would be a lost year, although there are exceptions. After finishing runners-up in all three competitions in 2012, we went into the following season hugely motivated and won the treble.

We lost a lot of the aerial duels, but we still had a good chance of deciding the game. You have to say that Leipzig also had a good chances. We played against a good team.
