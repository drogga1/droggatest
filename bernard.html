  <p><b>[Everton have completed the signing of Brazil winger Bernard on a four-year deal from Shakhtar Donetsk]</b> I chose Everton because of all the things I had heard about Marco Silva and after speaking to him I was happy with what he said to me. The manager made me feel confident about playing here. He has achieved really good things at other clubs. Everton is a club with a great structure and a lot of tradition. When I found out about this opportunity and what the manager wanted out of me, I was happy. I did not need any convincing to come here. I believe I will be able to show my best as a player here. I can promise I will try my hardest and dedicate myself to my work and to trying to make things happen for Everton</p>

  <p><b>[Everton forward Bernard says Goodison Park is the best place for him to get back to his best form]</b> Everton gives me the structure to be able to come back <b>[to my best]</b>. I’ve had five months without pre-season, but I’ve had a month here now and, slowly, I am getting the rhythm of the game and playing matches. I’m sure it’s going to get much better. To be here and to play in the Premier League, it is important for every player and I think it is important for my career. And it is easy to adapt when you have an atmosphere like we have at Everton. There are moments to have fun and moments to be serious, but it’s been a nice atmosphere.<br /><br /><b>[On Richarlison]</b> Richarlison is a great player. He is tactically very good and he is a good finisher. When inside the box, he is deadly. I have no doubt he will be able to help our squad this season and the Brazilian national team, too<br /><br /><b>[On Sam Allardyce]</b> With the manager, it is very clear the way he asks for his ideas to be implemented. Every player should be able to listen to the manager’s tactics. Each coach has a different approach, different methods, but as players we need to be able to input what the coach asks for, so individually everyone gets better</p>

  <p><b>[Bernard on <a href="richarlison.html">Richarlison</a>]</b> Richi is capable of adapting to any scenario during a match. He’s the type of player who’s really aggressive in the box. He’s fearless and not scared of putting himself about or taking a whack. Whatever is happening, the important thing for him is putting the ball in the back of the net. This makes him who he is, a player with a massive presence in the box</p>

  <p><b>[Bernard has backed his <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> team-mate and Brazilian compatriot <a href="richarlison.html">Richarlison</a> to keep improving as <a href="everton-fc.html">the Toffees</a> return from the coronavirus break]</b> Richi is capable of adapting to any scenario during a match. He’s the type of player who’s really aggressive in the box. He’s fearless and not scared of putting himself about or taking a whack. Whatever is happening, the important thing for him is putting the ball in the back of the net.This makes him who he is, a player with a massive presence in the box<br /><br />He is still developing. When you look at him, he’s still so young to be doing what he is in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I am certain he will mature and become an even better player, not just in the way he plays but also in the way he understands and reads the game.<br /><br />My objective for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s restart is to come back well and give my all, so we can get the wins and share joyful moments together. I think to play for the national team in any country you have to be doing well for your club, so for me to think about the Brazilian Selecao, I have to think about <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. It is good we can play at Goodison <b>[rather than a neutral venue]</b> but I’d be even more pleased if we were able to have our fans there. It’s a delicate situation coming back after the pandemic and two months out and going into a difficult fixture. But the game being a derby is an additional motivator for me and, I believe, all the players. We need to look after ourselves, be dedicated and as prepared as possible for a tough, intense game. It will also be a happy occasion because of this opportunity to play again at Goodison Park.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s Bernard says psychologist has helped after anxiety attack]</b> I’ve been having therapy for the past year, I see a psychologist. It’s not something I previously stigmatised, but I never thought I would require this type of treatment. I’ve never publicly spoken to anyone about this. I think it would be good for this to be seen as a way of helping people to go to see a psychologist or psychiatrist. I had an anxiety attack a year ago, the psychologist really helped with this, the other professionals involved helped me a lot as well. I sought help as I genuinely needed it. I’m stronger in all areas and have become a better person, more positive and more confident<br /><br />It’s not possible to identify exactly what happened and why but today, after one year of treatment, I can really see how much I’ve matured, how much of a better person I am. Today I feel grateful and happier for having gone through this. I’m even grateful for the difficulties and problems we face in life, as they make us better people. Now I see how much I’ve evolved as a person, as a human being, how much this has helped me in my work</p>
