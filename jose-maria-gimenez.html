<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Barcelona star has Atletico rivals questioning reality]</b> Messi is from another planet. He scored a golazo from a free kick. There is nothing to reproach our team for. What we lacked was to start the first half as we started the second. If we had done that, the game would have been different. More than anything, it was attitude - in the first half, they were all over us. I wish we had a time machine and could begin the first half like the second when the attitude was different and we went for the game.<br /><br />In the first half Barcelona dominated. We tried to press up top, but we did not get there. In the second half, just the opposite. More intense. Neither of the teams had clear chances. The difference was Messi, <b>[who]</b> decided the game with one great moment. In the second half we were better, but it did not come for us</p>

  <p><b>[Atletico’s players trained individually on Saturday, spread across various pitches to allow for social distancing]</b> More than nervous I was a little anxious to finally get here, be able to train, see my colleagues, the ball on the field… There was a lot of excitement. After so much time out you feel it in the legs, but it was very enjoyable</p>
