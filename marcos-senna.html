At that stage I was full of doubts, my wife was pregnant with our first son and our adaptation here was excellent. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> had asked me for <b>[a response in]</b> a few weeks, but we were creating a great team here: the club bought <a href="robert-pires.html">Robert Pires</a>, Nihat Kahveci and <a href="giuseppe-rossi.html">Giuseppe Rossi</a> was here, we had a great team. Personally, I would have loved to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> at that time, but I also had desires to stay here. <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> had just played a Champions League semi-final and were buying big players. To be honest, I was 50/50 until I spoke to <b>[Manuel]</b> <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Pellegrini</a> and finally I signed for three more years with <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> and at the end I spent all my European career here in Spain.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Senna was snapped up by <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> in 2002, having caught the eye for a Sao Caetano side which reached the final of the Copa Libertadores that year]</b> I have a lot of respect for Jose Manuel <b>[Llaneza, <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> vice-president]</b>. I am here because of him. He obviously didn’t have in mind to buy a holding midfielder when he want to Brazil <b>[to watch the 2002 Copa Libertadores final]</b>. It is also true that their attempt to buy <a href="gilberto-silva.html">Gilberto Silva</a> failed, he was very close to signing for <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> before something happened. <a href="emerson.html">Emerson</a>, who was the main holding midfielder of the Brazil national team, suffered an injury so Silva played instead of him and Brazil won the World Cup in 2002. Because of that, the player’s price increased and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> bought him. When that happened, Jose Manuel went to Brazil. He was looking for a forward but in the end he bought me and the forward did not come. It was a beautiful story</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> star Marcos Senna is convinced <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> legend <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is the best player in the world]</b> For me, <b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is]</b> the best in the world, individually. There’s no one better than him. He is the man. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is a complete player. He is Ballon d’Or worthy, but he needs more luck due to the injuries. Lets see what happens now, I’m cheering for <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> in this Champions because for me, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is Ballon d’Or worthy<br /><br />There’s 11 games to play and our hope is that <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> can start a good streak of victories because we still have possibilities of reaching a Europa League spot. <b>[Reaching the]</b> Champions League is more difficult but it also can happen<br /><br />Santi really had two very difficult years, but he was able to recover. There were lots of people who didn’t think he could make it, but he could after all. <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> gave him the opportunity and he took it. He was great last year, he is a <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> legend. He is not only technically gifted, but also has great charisma. I don’t know what is going to happen at the end of this season. But he’s helped us so far, always playing at the top level. I hope he can hold on physically and I hope he can stay at least one more year with us. It only depends on him and I’m sure he would love to stay</p>
