  <p><b>[Diego Costa, Thiago Alcantara and Rodrigo Moreno are at home playing for Spain]</b> Spain has been growing gradually, and those three players obviously could not be left out. They’re extremely important to the Spanish team. They’re 100% adapted to the Spanish football culture, otherwise they wouldn’t be playing for Spain. They’re completely at home.<br /><br />I’m a privileged person because I can support both! This year I’m <b>[cheering]</b> for both of them, but I was with the Spanish national team during a coaching course, I’ve been invited to see the first game and I have friends in Spain <b>[Iniesta, David Silva …]</b>. I don’t know anyone from the Brazilian national team. I don’t know if I want to see both teams playing in the final … I don’t know which would need to be eliminated first, but I don’t want to see them playing the final, because then I can relax and cheer <b>[laughs]</b><br /><br />Being a part of this winning generation was a privilege. It worked out, we had a great European Championship. I think before that, Spain used to carry a very heavy weight on its shoulders, of always being a favourite and not being able to win. We took this weight off in 2008. We played very well and, after that, the players were ‘released’, and they started to believe that the title was possible</p>

  <p><b>[Former Villarreal midfielder Marcos Senna says one ‘could write a book’ about all the hardships he had to overcome to become a champion]</b> I’ve experienced some very tough moments in my life. I’ve had to show so much mental strength since I was little, given I was from a country where a large percentage of people are poor. I was also in that group. In Brazil there is a saying that you have to ‘kill a lion every day’, and I had to kill a lion every day<br /><br />Santo Cazorla went through two years of hell. He showed incredible mental strength and is now able to play again</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Senna admits to almost joining <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> &amp; missing out on <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> move to <a href="gilberto-silva.html">Gilberto Silva</a>]</b> I did not talk to <b>[Ferguson]</b>, but my agent and <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> did, and I was very close to signing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. At that stage I was full of doubts, my wife was pregnant with our first son and our adaptation here was excellent. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> had asked me for <b>[a response in]</b> a few weeks, but we were creating a great team here: the club bought <a href="robert-pires.html">Robert Pires</a>, Nihat Kahveci and <a href="giuseppe-rossi.html">Giuseppe Rossi</a> was here, we had a great team. Personally, I would have loved to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> at that time, but I also had desires to stay here. <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> had just played a Champions League semi-final and were buying big players. To be honest, I was 50/50 until I spoke to <b>[Manuel]</b> <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Pellegrini</a> and finally I signed for three more years with <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> and at the end I spent all my European career here in Spain.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Senna was snapped up by <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> in 2002, having caught the eye for a Sao Caetano side which reached the final of the Copa Libertadores that year]</b> I have a lot of respect for Jose Manuel <b>[Llaneza, <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> vice-president]</b>. I am here because of him. He obviously didn’t have in mind to buy a holding midfielder when he want to Brazil <b>[to watch the 2002 Copa Libertadores final]</b>. It is also true that their attempt to buy <a href="gilberto-silva.html">Gilberto Silva</a> failed, he was very close to signing for <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> before something happened. <a href="emerson.html">Emerson</a>, who was the main holding midfielder of the Brazil national team, suffered an injury so Silva played instead of him and Brazil won the World Cup in 2002. Because of that, the player’s price increased and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> bought him. When that happened, Jose Manuel went to Brazil. He was looking for a forward but in the end he bought me and the forward did not come. It was a beautiful story</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> star Marcos Senna is convinced <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> legend <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is the best player in the world]</b> For me, <b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is]</b> the best in the world, individually. There’s no one better than him. He is the man. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is a complete player. He is Ballon d’Or worthy, but he needs more luck due to the injuries. Lets see what happens now, I’m cheering for <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> in this Champions because for me, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is Ballon d’Or worthy<br /><br />There’s 11 games to play and our hope is that <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> can start a good streak of victories because we still have possibilities of reaching a Europa League spot. <b>[Reaching the]</b> Champions League is more difficult but it also can happen<br /><br />Santi really had two very difficult years, but he was able to recover. There were lots of people who didn’t think he could make it, but he could after all. <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> gave him the opportunity and he took it. He was great last year, he is a <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> legend. He is not only technically gifted, but also has great charisma. I don’t know what is going to happen at the end of this season. But he’s helped us so far, always playing at the top level. I hope he can hold on physically and I hope he can stay at least one more year with us. It only depends on him and I’m sure he would love to stay</p>
