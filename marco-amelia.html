<blockquote>
  <p>[Former Italy and Chelsea goalkeeper Marco Amelia has defended Antonio Conte] The Premier League is a very competitive championship, the level of the top teams is very high. Antonio won the league in the first year, which is not easy, and to try to do that again was really a challenge because the two Manchester teams have invested a lot. The value of Conte as a coach is not in question, it is not a coincidence that he has many admirers around Europe. Chelsea are an extremely ambitious club and [owner Roman] Abramovich has always shown a lot of trust in his closest collaborators. I think it’s still too early to guess what will happen next season.<br /><br />[Amelia spent a single season at Chelsea in 2015-16] It was one of my most beautiful football experiences. It was a fantastic life experience, the stadium is incredible, the atmosphere is always festive, people get to the stadium at the last minute. Having worked with Mourinho, Hiddink and their staff has enriched me in every way. I shared the dressing room with champions like John Terry, Eden Hazard, Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas, Asmir Begovic, Pedro, Willian, Diego Costa, John Obi Mikel, Gary Cahill, all fantastic guys who immediately made me feel one of them, always showing great respect because I had played for Milan and the Italian national team. I found a club of the highest level, organised in an extraordinary way, with a beautiful stadium. English football left an important mark on me and, in the future, the experience of managing an English club would be a dream come true</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Former AC Milan goalkeeper Marco Amelia believes Gianluigi Donnarumma is a unique talent] At the beginning, he had, on his side, the carefree nature of a 16-year-old. Today, at just 19, he also has the experience and a good maturity. Let us not forget that for some time now he is living with the weight of the incredible pressure linked to his future and the rumours concerning him. None of us at that age, Buffon included, were carrying that huge boulder. So, for his age, experience and characteristics, Gigio remains a unique player. The ability to withstand and manage pressure is essential. Taking into account all that gravitates around him, he is showing maturity and balance. And if AC Milan are still in the race for top positions it is also thanks to his saves.</p>
