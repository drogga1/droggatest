  <p><b>[Alexandre Pato has admitted to receiving some offers from Serie A teams]</b> I’ve received some offers from Serie A teams and also from other European leagues. We’ll see at the end of the year. I’m very happy that Leonardo and <b>[Paolo]</b> Maldini have returned to Milan, for them and also for the fans who needed people to be the face of Milan. I’ve spoken to Leo a few times, and of course there were some jokes about my possible return to Milan. Joking aside though, I have a year on my contract here in China and we’ll see what happens. I receive so many comments every day from Milan fans on social media, from Italy and around the world. That makes me happy, and it makes me think that despite some years having passed since I left, the affection from the fans has never gone away. Who would I like to play with at Milan? That’s a question I’d ask the fans: with whom would you like to see me play in this Milan?<br /><br />Lucas Paqueta is very good, my advice is to learn Italian quickly and try in every way to do well immediately. The Milan fans are incredible and will love him,</p>

  <p><b>[Alexandre Pato has confirmed that he will be leaving China after terminating his contract with Tianjin Tianhai]</b> My dear Chinese friends, I’d like to inform you that my adventure in China has come to an end. When I arrived in Tianjin for the first time in 2017 I didn’t know the city at all. It was a surprise and also it was love at first sight for me. These two years in China were full of happy moments with my team-mates and full of new experiences. I am quite sure that China made me grow up as a man. I visited new cities and places, I learned new different culture and habits of this great country. I helped my team with my goals and my football to reach the Asian Champions League for the first time in the club’s history. I would like to thank my club, my team-mates, coaches, all the working people in the club, my fans and supporters who always sent me wishes and love and all the nice Chinese people I met during these two years in China. I am sure I will miss China and I am also sure that many Chinese people will miss me. We will keep in touch on this app in the future. Keep on following me and my life. I hope I imparted to you my big love for football and now a new adventure is about to start for me.</p>

  <p><b>[Alexandre Pato expresses desire to return to <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a>]</b> I would like to go back to Europe. Come on, I’m doing well this year, I win the Libertadores and then I’ll be back. At Milan, it would be really nice<br /><br /><b>[Pato added on why his first stint at Milan went downhill after a promising start]</b> A small injury eventually became a very big thing. I lost faith, I felt a little lonely because they blamed me<br /><br />The club must focus on <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>, he is too precious for young people and is lethal in the area. He’s the one who pulls the group, makes you give your best. And then he is very intelligent, he takes good care of himself</p>
