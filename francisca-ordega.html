  <p><b>[Francisca Ordega talks about being the first African player in the W-League]</b> That will make other teams be like, ‘OK, we have to go more into Africa to search for other players to come over’. I’ve made history; I’ve broken the yolk so it’s really cool</p>

  <p><b>[Francisca Ordega says she is focused on winning more Player of the Week awards with Washington Spirit in the National Women Super League this season]</b> The National Women Soccer League is one of the best league in the world, it’s getting better and tougher every year. It is a wonderful experience for me playing in my third season in the US. I’m getting to learn with my every moment here. I’m enjoying good support from my teammates, coaches, and fans. They are great people with very good understanding.<br /><br />It’s being so great so far this season. By the grace of God, I’m hoping to win more Player of the Week awards because I’m working so hard each and every day that passes by. There is this saying that no food for lazy man. So if you want to be the best in anything you do, then you have to work extremely hard and that’s what I’m doing. I believe there is more to come by God’s grace. For now, I can’t reveal how goals. But I hope to score more this season as I want is to help my team to reach the Championship final again.</p>

  <p><b>[Francisca Ordega is among the many Nigerian players still haunted by an 8-0 loss to France last year, and the forward said her squad wants revenge]</b> We are not scared of France. I like challenges</p>
