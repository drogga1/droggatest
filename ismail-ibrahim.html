  <p><b>[JDT counting on Thai pre-season to give them an advantage against Bangkok United]</b> We are 100% ready for Tuesday night. We had trainings and many pre season matches in Thailand. So hopefully we will show good performance in the upcoming game tomorrow<br /><br />Bangkok is a great opponent but we faced many Thai teams before and collected good experiences from them. Furthermore we still have some players from last season still playing with us this year</p>

  <p><b>[Following Johor Darul Ta’zim 3-2 defeat to Global FC in their AFC Cup match on Wednesday, JDT assistant head coach Ismail Ibrahim has promised that the Southern Tigers will bounce back]</b> We missed several goal-scoring opportunities in the first half. Our defence made a lot of mistakes, our midfielders also made mistakes. In just 10 minutes we allowed them to score three goals and that was the biggest mistake for the team.<br /><br />We will not be making the same mistakes in the next match. We need to win and cannot lose. It was a game of two halves, and had we played like how we did in the second half, we would’ve surely won</p>

  <p><b>[JDT are really hoping that their team will find their form again]</b> Our defenders made a lot of mistakes, and so did our midfielders. We will not make the same mistakes in the next match.</p>

  <p><b>[On top of their must-win AFC Cup match against the Cambodians on Wednesday, JDT will face rivals Pahang in their FA Cup encounter this Sunday]</b> Tomorrow’s <b>[Wednesday]</b> match is a vital game for us. We need three points so the mission tomorrow is we must win. Hopefully tomorrow night the boys will play 100% to get three points. The problem is we have a tough match after tomorrow’s match, in Johor Bahru, the FA Cup quarter-final match against Pahang, our rivals. We have to focus on dividing <b>[the squad]</b> into two teams from tomorrow so we can beat Pahang in the FA Cup with a strong team. We must balance <b>[it]</b>. Tomorrow also a strong team, and on Sunday also we have to prepare a strong team.</p>

  <p><b>[JDT reserves proved their mettle in Boeungket drubbing]</b> It was a meaningful win for JDT. We really needed the three points to close the gap with Global FC who also won their match. Thank you to all the players for giving their best to win the match.<br /><br />For your information, we played without strikers and those playing upfront were midfielders. The scorers were also our midfielders. Today we rested the team captain <b>[Safiq Rahim]</b> because we will have a very important match soon <b>[against Pahang]</b>. A few of our players were rested too to prepare for that game<br /><br />We gave opportunities to all our young players to play. Our new goalkeeper is only 19 years old <b>[Haziq Nadzli]</b>, so is our defender Dominic Tan. It was a good opportunity for them to play against Beoungket FC. Hopefully they will use the experience to further improve their game</p>
