  <p><b>[JDT counting on Thai pre-season to give them an advantage against Bangkok United]</b> We are 100% ready for Tuesday night. We had trainings and many pre season matches in Thailand. So hopefully we will show good performance in the upcoming game tomorrow<br /><br />Bangkok is a great opponent but we faced many Thai teams before and collected good experiences from them. Furthermore we still have some players from last season still playing with us this year</p>

  <p><b>[Following Johor Darul Ta’zim 3-2 defeat to Global FC in their AFC Cup match on Wednesday, JDT assistant head coach Ismail Ibrahim has promised that the Southern Tigers will bounce back]</b> We missed several goal-scoring opportunities in the first half. Our defence made a lot of mistakes, our midfielders also made mistakes. In just 10 minutes we allowed them to score three goals and that was the biggest mistake for the team.<br /><br />We will not be making the same mistakes in the next match. We need to win and cannot lose. It was a game of two halves, and had we played like how we did in the second half, we would’ve surely won</p>

  <p><b>[On top of their must-win AFC Cup match against the Cambodians on Wednesday, JDT will face rivals Pahang in their FA Cup encounter this Sunday]</b> Tomorrow’s <b>[Wednesday]</b> match is a vital game for us. We need three points so the mission tomorrow is we must win. Hopefully tomorrow night the boys will play 100% to get three points. The problem is we have a tough match after tomorrow’s match, in Johor Bahru, the FA Cup quarter-final match against Pahang, our rivals. We have to focus on dividing <b>[the squad]</b> into two teams from tomorrow so we can beat Pahang in the FA Cup with a strong team. We must balance <b>[it]</b>. Tomorrow also a strong team, and on Sunday also we have to prepare a strong team.</p>

  <p><b>[JDT reserves proved their mettle in Boeungket drubbing]</b> It was a meaningful win for JDT. We really needed the three points to close the gap with Global FC who also won their match. Thank you to all the players for giving their best to win the match.<br /><br />For your information, we played without strikers and those playing upfront were midfielders. The scorers were also our midfielders. Today we rested the team captain <b>[Safiq Rahim]</b> because we will have a very important match soon <b>[against Pahang]</b>. A few of our players were rested too to prepare for that game<br /><br />We gave opportunities to all our young players to play. Our new goalkeeper is only 19 years old <b>[Haziq Nadzli]</b>, so is our defender Dominic Tan. It was a good opportunity for them to play against Beoungket FC. Hopefully they will use the experience to further improve their game</p>

  <p><b>[Johor Darul Ta’zim takes on Magwe FC in the final group match of the 2017 AFC Cup looking to finally confirm a place in the knockout stage of the competition]</b> We will pick our best starting line-up for the match against Magwe FC tomorrow <b>[Wednesday]</b> night to ensure us getting three points and being in a comfortable position. However, we cannot determine who will be picked yet because it depends on this <b>[Tuesday]</b> evening’s training session.<br /><br />We will examine the condition of Cabrera and Ferreira who haven’t recovered from fever. Safawi <b>[Rasid]</b> cannot play tomorrow due to suspension, while Fadhli Shas is injured and cannot be fielded tomorrow. Despite that, we still have players who can replace them<br /><br />We are aware that the opponents’ strength lies in their long-ball tactic to put pressure on us and they will wait for us to commit mistakes. In fact, the goal they scored in the final minutes in the match in Myanmar was also due to our mistake. So, we will be on higher alert</p>

  <p><b>[Ismail Ibrahim worried about missing key defenders but puts faith in squad]</b> For the match tomorrow it’s an important one for JDT because we want to go all the way to the final. We’ll give our best and our players have recovered well, <b>[Gonzalo]</b> Cabrera will be back in the squad. We’ll make some changes in midfield. Afiq <b>[Fazail]</b> as usual will play in defensive midfield with Safiq <b>[Rahim]</b>. But we’ll decide later today between <b>[Gabriel]</b> Guerra and Cabrera who will be in the middle<br /><br />Of course there will be some impact <b>[on missing Fadhli and Aidil]</b> but we have players who can come in like Dominic, Amirul as well as Hasbullah<br /><br />In these two days, we’ve made preparations to ensure and improve our focus when we’re leading. We want to win tomorrow. We have 3 games before the break and the players are focus in these matches before we give them a break. It’s not easy because the opponent is a good team. We studied their strong and weak points but we are prepared</p>

  <p><b>[Ismail Ibrahim has strong words for Afiq Fazail and Dominic Tan over their performances against Ceres-Negros FC]</b> First of all I would like to thank the players for giving 100%. We know Ceres are a tough team and they play fast. We gave them too much space and they scored two on the counter attack. But we still came back to win. As a defensive midfielder, he has to do the dirty work. Safiq <b>[Rahim]</b> and Gabby <b>[Gabriel Guerra]</b> were more on the offensive. He has to win everything at the back. He has to win the second balls and Ceres scored because he couldn’t do that. That’s what we need to improve. Maybe we need to change in there for the second leg<br /><br />In my opinion, the opponents and pressure was too big for him <b>[Dominic]</b>. Still a lot for him to learn mentally and improve especially when there are fans getting on the back of him. We cannot say much because he <b>[referee]</b> sees what happens. But sometimes we question when their players don’t get card but our players do. When our keeper waste time, he gets carded but when the Ceres keeper do it, there’s no card</p>

  <p><b>[JDT and Ceres clash, a test of mental fortitude]</b> It’s an important game for both teams. For tomorrow’s night match all about mental and character on the field. Hopefully JDT team can prepare well and who plays the best will win the game. We have to play our normal game.It’s only one goal and we cannot defend all the way.</p>
