  <p><b>[Jordi Cruyff speaks about his father, the late <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Johan Cruyff</a>]</b> There are new anecdotes, almost every day - lots of stories I did not know. People always say how sorry they are, what he meant to them. I have been to various countries these last few months, and you see men who are 65, 70, and they are emotional. They had moments when my father touched them, in whatever way, and they want to talk about it</p>

  <p><b>[Jordi Cruyff believes Peter Bosz bears similarities to Pep Guardiola]</b> I’m proud of him. It makes me happy to see a coach of Maccabi Tel Aviv make it to the top. Peter has earned it and I am tremendously pleased that we have been part of his journey to Dortmund. Twelve months ago he was our coach. I think he and Dortmund fit together. Their current players definitely fit into his philosophy. I’m convinced he will succeed in Dortmund because he is a passionate fighter.<br /><br />He doesn’t like long balls, but the quick short game. He likes his team to put others pressure and then retrieve the ball immediately after losing it. He loves dominant football and wants to win. Bosz is a bit like Guardiola. He has a strong winning mentality and always sticks to his principles. He often told me: ‘We play to win, we play attacking football, we play pressing.’ He has the tools and the philosophy that my father had, too. With certainty Peter a coach who always gives a little time and space for developments and needs itself, so the team can adjust to what he wants. If the players have made their own, it is nice to see.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United had Pep Guardiola aligned to replace Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013]</b> I’ve always felt, not now but before Guardiola went to Bayern Munich, I always felt there was a chance that Manchester United had the chance to go for it. I think there was a moment where things were lined up, it was there, but Man United chose someone else, I’m talking many years ago, and he took a different way. I think he would have suited a club like Man Utd many years before. I’m not talking this era, not now, I’m talking like five or six years ago I think. There was a moment where things were aligned, that was the moment, and United took a different path.<br /><br />Everyone is talking about Man City, but people shouldn’t forget that Guardiola kind of came to a warm bath. The main point for him was that for him at City there was Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain, who worked with him at Barcelona in a successful period. So Guardiola came, the club knew his way of thinking, and he knew their way of thinking. Obviously they are on one line from the start. Guardiola arrived at a place where they both knew how things functioned</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have replaced Manchester United as the automatic destination for new players]</b> Not making any steps forward in the Premier League is resulting in their rivals overtaking them, and here is where the problem lies. Like other players at the time, I did not need to think twice about whether I would join United or City. Just like Barca, United were irresistible in those years. With everything that is happening and developments at City, it is no longer an automatic choice for players to choose United, and that is an even bigger concern. United was not just a beautiful football club, it also followed up the football I was used to. Home or away, United had a playing style, youth players and a winning mentality which was clear to everyone in the club. If Barcelona have one bad year, they would still not finish any lower than 3rd in La Liga. That should be the case at Man United, but sadly it is not.<br /><br />Things look even worse for United since City have taken over the football vision of Barcelona. That is not just down to Pep Guardiola. Right now, three key positions in the club are taken by former Barcelona people. Pep is the coach and responsible for the team. Txiki Begiristain has the overall technical view as director of football and Ferran Soriano keeps his eye on the business side of the club. By having a trio with such strong Barcelona ties indicates that City have gone for a clear philosophy, which is leading to trophies and success everywhere. The philosophy of what the club stands for has gone at United. I get a strong feeling there is no plan which says which way the club is going and which could guide all the people working there</p>

  <p><b>[Former Barcelona midfielder Jordi Cruyff has suggested that Matthijs De Ligt and Frenkie De Jong should snub all other offers to move to the Camp Nou in 2019]</b> Money is no longer important when clubs like PSG and Manchester City show interest. Choose what you choose, it’s always good, the key is how you finally make the right decision.<br /><br />Josep Guardiola is the perfect coach for De Jong and De Ligt, but what will happen when he leaves? Will Manchester City continue betting on the same DNA? The same can apply to PSG, what happens if the current owner tires? In that sense, Barcelona offers more security, whoever the coach or who manages the club, sports policy always is the same. As a player, you never depend on who is in charge.</p>

  <p><b>[Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has freed the bodies and minds of a Manchester United squad which had lost its way under Jose Mourinho]</b> The quality is there. They are good players. From the outside, he has touched their minds and put an arm around their shoulder. They really needed someone to stabilise things and give positive messages, outside and inside the club. When players are blocked, they cannot produce. Suddenly, there is an unblock, which probably comes more from the mind because Ole had no time to turn things around based on training. That tells you a lot about the players’ state of mind.<br /><br />After two or three days there was a huge turnaround without any training. His work has been more mental, talking to the players and pressing the right buttons to get the best out of them<br /><br />The sports director role is vital. Managers decide training schedules, tactics, line-ups. But who makes the decisions about where to scout or the structure of the academy? The manager? There is no logic to that. If a manager loses eight games, unfortunately, he is out of a job these days. Why would you give the keys to the club to the person who is most fragile?</p>

  <p><b>[Jordi Cruyff has taken a swipe at Jose Mourinho]</b> The most important thing was Ole never put his ego before the interests of the club. It doesn’t surprise me he’s become a coach. He’s a stable guy, a club man, and those kind of characters normally end up being coaches. Normally, players who have been at the club understand the DNA. <b>[Pep]</b> Guardiola was Barcelona B, came to the first team, knew what was necessary and the results are obvious. In Ole’s case, he has let the players take responsibility. He’s peaceful. He’s not making conflicts in the media, saying something to see if he can motivate the player in a provocative way.<br /><br />United’s DNA is winning, attacking, playing the same home and away, no waiting for the opponent. It’s about fitting with a club’s DNA. There are a lot of great coaches who go to one place and are fantastic, and go to another place just as big and it doesn’t work out. It’s the fit. Diego Simeone, Atletico Madrid - perfect fit</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid continue to miss Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> In the end, they are players who have ability above the others, appear at important moments, guarantee you a number of goals. When you are on the field, you always trust your options because you have that special player. Now Real Madrid rely more on being a team. And I think they still miss Cristiano. If the match goes 0-0, that marquee player is the one who unbalances.<br /><br /><b>[On 18-year-old Vinicius Junior]</b> He’s young, he’s very talented, that’s why they paid what was paid for him. But of course, asking him to carry the team is unfair. It is unfair to ask for it and also to wait for it. He is young and needs the time to learn and adapt that his age requires. He will have ups and downs, which is normal. His talent is obvious, but often it is better not to talk much about him so that he can be calm and without so much pressure on his back</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus striker Cristiano Ronaldo is an immortal of the modern game]</b> In football, there are so many mortals and very few immortals: I can say that, like my father, Cristiano will always be remembered. Along with Messi, without having to say who is the best. Many have had a great year but only they had 15 great ones.<br /><br />The stadium bears his name and the philosophy of play and life is now in the DNA of the club. This Ajax plays the football that my father would have loved. Young, happy, daring, attacking. In Amsterdam, it never changed. This generation has more talent than others and always controls the ball. It is a pleasure for the eyes to see them play<br /><br /><b>[Cruyff also assessed the challenge Juventus pose Ajax in the last eight]</b> Juventus? Italian football has changed. Now Italians score and play a lot more. The mirror is Buffon: over the years he has had to use his feet much more. Certainly, at Juve, there is always a good defensive organisation but they also know how to create</p>

  <p><b>[Jordi <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> believes he joined <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> a year too early but insists not playing regularly was nothing to be ashamed of when fighting <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a>, <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> and <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> for a place in the starting line-up]</b> When you take a step like going to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> you need to be mature enough, and I was probably one year short of that. You have to adapt. It was different, to have dinner at 5pm or 6pm - I’d never seen that. I was probably the youngest person in the village where I lived and that was tough. Now it’s a different city, a different vibe - the city is alive<br /><br /><b>[He also struggled for fitness at United which further hampered his chances of nailing down a place in <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>’s side]</b> I fell from one injury to another and I could never really get a run and show the manager he could count on me. When <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> was injured, I was always injured - and that’s my fault. As a coach, you want players who are ready when you need them. I see that now myself. Training-wise, I was always on the level that was necessary, but I didn’t play a lot and I probably didn’t bring what I could do in training to the games<br /><br />If you know you’re going to play 30 minutes every three weeks you make a decision - do I want to stand out by scoring a goal? You can see that in a few games - there was a time when I was just trying to score goals, and others when I was trying to participate in the game and enjoy it. But with the injuries, I could never catch that train and have a stable season. When I look back at that team - <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a>, <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a>, <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>, <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a>, and then the likes of <a href="dwight-yorke.html">Dwight Yorke</a>, <a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Teddy Sheringham</a> and Andrew Cole - not to have played much is nothing to be ashamed of</p>

  <p><b>[Globetrotter Jordi Cruyff embarks on new adventure with Ecuador]</b> It has not been easy. Until one day I finally understood what I had to understand and I started to enjoy myself. What did I understand? That my father was among the one per cent of immortal people and that the other 99% are mortals, myself among them. That took the pressure off and I could relax<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> It happens: look at Michel’s son, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. But look at my figures and <b>[making the first team]</b> was logical. All the years at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> I had a B team contract. ‘They’ll never be able to say you made money because of me.’ When I went to United in 96, my salary jumped from youth teamer to Premier League<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> I am ambitious and want to win everything I can. Enjoying yourself is important, but I want to compete and win. In official matches you have to go all-out from the first second. There is interesting material here and an exciting project to work with. I am pretty optimistic about the coming results, I will try and strike a good balance between youth and experienced players. It is clear that there are good footballers here. I see athletic condition, a strength which gives you an advantage and which is present more than in other countries. If we can combine that with tactical intelligence, you will see Ecuadorian players in big leagues</p>
