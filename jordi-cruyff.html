  <p><b>[Jordi Cruyff speaks about his father, the late Johan Cruyff]</b> There are new anecdotes, almost every day - lots of stories I did not know. People always say how sorry they are, what he meant to them. I have been to various countries these last few months, and you see men who are 65, 70, and they are emotional. They had moments when my father touched them, in whatever way, and they want to talk about it</p>

  <p><b>[Jordi <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> believes he joined <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> a year too early but insists not playing regularly was nothing to be ashamed of when fighting <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a>, <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> and <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> for a place in the starting line-up]</b> When you take a step like going to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> you need to be mature enough, and I was probably one year short of that. You have to adapt. It was different, to have dinner at 5pm or 6pm - I’d never seen that. I was probably the youngest person in the village where I lived and that was tough. Now it’s a different city, a different vibe - the city is alive<br /><br /><b>[He also struggled for fitness at United which further hampered his chances of nailing down a place in <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>’s side]</b> I fell from one injury to another and I could never really get a run and show the manager he could count on me. When <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> was injured, I was always injured - and that’s my fault. As a coach, you want players who are ready when you need them. I see that now myself. Training-wise, I was always on the level that was necessary, but I didn’t play a lot and I probably didn’t bring what I could do in training to the games<br /><br />If you know you’re going to play 30 minutes every three weeks you make a decision - do I want to stand out by scoring a goal? You can see that in a few games - there was a time when I was just trying to score goals, and others when I was trying to participate in the game and enjoy it. But with the injuries, I could never catch that train and have a stable season. When I look back at that team - <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a>, <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a>, <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>, <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a>, and then the likes of <a href="dwight-yorke.html">Dwight Yorke</a>, <a href="teddy-sheringham.html">Teddy Sheringham</a> and Andrew Cole - not to have played much is nothing to be ashamed of</p>

  <p><b>[Globetrotter Jordi Cruyff embarks on new adventure with Ecuador]</b> It has not been easy. Until one day I finally understood what I had to understand and I started to enjoy myself. What did I understand? That my father was among the one per cent of immortal people and that the other 99% are mortals, myself among them. That took the pressure off and I could relax<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> It happens: look at Michel’s son, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. But look at my figures and <b>[making the first team]</b> was logical. All the years at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> I had a B team contract. ‘They’ll never be able to say you made money because of me.’ When I went to United in 96, my salary jumped from youth teamer to Premier League<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> I am ambitious and want to win everything I can. Enjoying yourself is important, but I want to compete and win. In official matches you have to go all-out from the first second. There is interesting material here and an exciting project to work with. I am pretty optimistic about the coming results, I will try and strike a good balance between youth and experienced players. It is clear that there are good footballers here. I see athletic condition, a strength which gives you an advantage and which is present more than in other countries. If we can combine that with tactical intelligence, you will see Ecuadorian players in big leagues</p>
