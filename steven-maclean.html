<blockquote>
  <p>[Hearts striker Steven MacLean confessed that he hopes Celtic ‘get pumped’ by RB Leipzig in the Europa League] Hopefully Celtic get pumped [on Thursday] and lose a bit of confidence. Then we’ll see what happens on Sunday. We’ve beaten Celtic already this season so there’s no reason why we can’t do it again. Obviously they’ve picked up since then and scored ten goals in their last two games, but we’ve got belief. [A loss for Celtic] can help, especially if it goes deep on Sunday. Of course you want all Scottish teams in Europe to do well but I hope they have a hard game as that can help us.<br /><br />If we’ve got something we can hold on to and they’re pushing, we know we can go the distance. We know we can make it hard for teams. We can go toe-to-toe and fight with teams, but we can play a bit as well. Goals are coming from all over the team with different people chipping in. The boys have taken to what the gaffer wants and he has to take a lot of credit, we’ve all bought in to what he wants. Every week he just keeps telling us to do what we’re good at</p>
