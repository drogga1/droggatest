  <p><b>[David May talks about <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a>’s kung-fu kick]</b> I was stood in the middle of the pitch and there was a roar from the crowd. You look over and … I just thought ‘what the hell are you doing’? You run over to see what is going on. It is kicking off and it is a case of ‘one for all, all for one’. Everyone joined in<br /><br /><b>[With the ground in a state of heightened fervour, United go 1-0 up in the 57th minute]</b> We had a corner, I stayed up, got set up by <a href="lee-sharpe.html">Lee Sharpe</a> and scored my first United goal. I thought ‘here we go’. I was going to get a nice little bit of positivity in the papers the next day. That is all I could think of<br /><br /><b>[An equaliser from Palace defender <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> denies 10-man United victory. The away dressing room is ablaze with recriminations]</b> The manager is ripping heads off everyone… Big Pete <b>[<a href="kasper-schmeichel.html">Schmeichel</a>]</b>, Big Pally, myself, Sharpey, <a href="paul-ince.html">Paul Ince</a>. He had a go at me for their equaliser. He said, ‘who the hell was marking <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a>?’. I said ‘Eric’. He turned round and said ‘Eric, I am disappointed in you. You can’t be doing those things’. I thought ‘Is that it? Is that it?!’ Any other player would have been given the hairdryer. I just got the hairdryer off the gaffer for not marking someone I shouldn’t have been marking</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United defender David May believes that Paul Pogba’s extravagant off-field lifestyle could be to blame for his dip in form]</b> At times Pogba is a frightening player and on his day he’s unplayable. I just don’t know if the off-field stuff gets in his way, his antics of getting his hair coloured every other day. Jose <b>[Mourinho]</b> is trying to play him in his right position to get the best out of him and maybe he needs another holding midfielder to say ‘right go on then, express yourself’. I do think that playing on the left side of a three is his best position and from there came his best performance which was at Everton away. Given time the team will be built around him.<br /><br /><b>[On Alexis Sanchez]</b> Personally I think he’s trying too hard. He wants to be involved in everything but he needs to be told that standing still is a good position. He’s an absolutely fantastic player and everybody knows that after what he did with Arsenal but he needs to take a step back and enjoy it. He’s forever looking for the ball but sometimes you have to let the ball find you</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United defender David May has backed caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to be given the job on a permanent basis]</b> Personally I’d love to see Ole get the job. I’ve known him for 20 years and I know that he loves the club so much.<br /><br />He also knows what the club is all about. People go on about his record down at Cardiff but no disrespect to them but we’re talking about two very different teams and very different clubs. United is a massive job, of course it is, but if you don’t give him a chance you won’t know where he might get them to. He’s got them playing the right way and getting results so why not?<br /><br />Towards the end it was all about Jose and what he had done in the past. It was all about his records. Manchester United managers have never done that and can you even imagine Sir Alex Ferguson walking down the touchline and holding up three fingers? It should all be about Man United and getting the right results. It’s not about managers or an individual. It’s about the club and the team. But Jose has gone now. United are playing good, attacking football and everyone is enjoying themselves. It’s as if everybody’s game has risen fifteen per cent since Ole has come in. That can only be Ole’s influence and how he is. A cloud has been lifted off the stadium and people are happy and jovial. It’s great to see</p>

  <p><b>[Solskjaer told to spend £100m on Kalidou Koulibaly]</b> If you look at United over the last God knows how many years they’ve always gone out and broke transfer records if need be. They did with Rio <b>[Ferdinand]</b>, <b>[Angel]</b> Di Maria, <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba, <b>[Romelu]</b> Lukaku. They allegedly pay <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez half a million a week. If you want the best players then you have to pay top money for them. City do it. Liverpool did it with Van Dijk and just look at the transformation. They spent £70 million on a goalkeeper, which is a hell of a lot of money but what that gets you back is guaranteed Champions League football and the possibility of winning the Premier League.<br /><br />The amount of money United earn then to spend £100m on a defender … .so what? Real Madrid will spend it. Barca will. Chelsea and City will. If it guarantees you a much better defence then go ahead and spend it. If Koulibaly becomes available - and there are rumours that he is interested with a fee of £90m - then I’m sure Ole would say he’d be a great signing for Man Utd.</p>
