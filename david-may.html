  <p><b>[David May talks about <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a>’s kung-fu kick]</b> I was stood in the middle of the pitch and there was a roar from the crowd. You look over and … I just thought ‘what the hell are you doing’? You run over to see what is going on. It is kicking off and it is a case of ‘one for all, all for one’. Everyone joined in<br /><br /><b>[With the ground in a state of heightened fervour, United go 1-0 up in the 57th minute]</b> We had a corner, I stayed up, got set up by <a href="lee-sharpe.html">Lee Sharpe</a> and scored my first United goal. I thought ‘here we go’. I was going to get a nice little bit of positivity in the papers the next day. That is all I could think of<br /><br /><b>[An equaliser from Palace defender <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> denies 10-man United victory. The away dressing room is ablaze with recriminations]</b> The manager is ripping heads off everyone… Big Pete <b>[Schmeichel]</b>, Big Pally, myself, Sharpey, <a href="paul-ince.html">Paul Ince</a>. He had a go at me for their equaliser. He said, ‘who the hell was marking <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a>?’. I said ‘Eric’. He turned round and said ‘Eric, I am disappointed in you. You can’t be doing those things’. I thought ‘Is that it? Is that it?!’ Any other player would have been given the hairdryer. I just got the hairdryer off the gaffer for not marking someone I shouldn’t have been marking</p>

  <p><b>[David May has said he would take ex-Liverpool striker Luis Suarez all day at Manchester United]</b> All day. All day. All day. I don’t care about <b>[the fact he used to be a Liverpool player]</b>. Don’t care</p>

  <p><b>[David May expresses his belief that the former City academy graduate is capable of playing at the very highest level for the next decade]</b> Jadon is a very talented young lad. You know if you sign him, you’ve got 10-12 years of top football coming from him. He’s got everything so get him in!</p>
