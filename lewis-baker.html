  <p><b>[Vitesse’s key man Lewis Baker can use Ajax game to show quality to Chelsea]</b> A third year at Vitesse just doesn’t make sense. I’d like to prove myself at a higher level. It could also be just another loan. I’m under contract with Chelsea, but in football there is always somewhere else.<br /><br />It’s a tough, long road. Chelsea are full of many top quality players. But I won’t give up. It offers hope that Antonio Conte gives more playing time to talents like Nathaniel Chalobah, a boy of my age and team-mate at England Under 21</p>

  <p><b>[After helping Vitesse claim KNVB Cup glory, Chelsea loanee Lewis Baker insists he now wants to make an impact in English football]</b> Overall I think Chelsea are happy with what I did <b>[on loan]</b>. There’s still aspects of my game that I could carry on working on. I need to keep working day-in-day-out. The past two years that I have been away on loan have been fantastic. The achievements I have made have been unforgettable but we need to just carry on now and keep going as far as possible in my career. My family are just as cheerful as me. They were at all my games, they were there in the final so they come every step with me.<br /><br />Moving from playing as a kid to now, I am grateful for the people that I have around me. I had a lot of messages after the game, former coaches from Chelsea came to watch. People from the academy too, so it was something that I will never forget. It has been amazing, I will be watching Vitesse’s scores and seeing how they get on. It is amazing <b>[to win the club’s first major trophy]</b> because when you are there, you are part of it. There’s not a team that’s won anything in their history before.<br /><br />The first year <b>[away from Chelsea at Vitesse]</b> was more learning, adapting to living away, adapting to a different league. The second year was more producing and showing what I am capable of. I think it has been fantastic to move away and learn different things but I want to be back in England.<br /><br />You do miss little things about home. You do sometimes feel a little bit far away. For me, the two years away were fantastic and I am always open to suggestions to see who comes in but it would be great for me to play more in England. Chelsea have got into the Champions League again so they are going to need to get players into their squad. There are going to be a lot of games. I just want to carry on playing football as much as possible. I love playing, I want to do it as much as I can<br /><br /><b>[On John Terry]</b> He is amazing. He is a real captain. A leader on the pitch and off the pitch. He is a guy that all the players really look up to, he is a player that Chelsea can really be proud of. The stuff that he has achieved is amazing. For me, he has helped me a lot personally along the way. When he sees you around the changing room in training, he is the first person to put his arm around you and says ‘have fun, enjoy your football and keep working hard’. He is a great ambassador for the club. It will be strange not to see him around but I am sure he will come back one day</p>

  <p><b>[Lewis Baker thinks that Chelsea’s youngsters Nathaniel Chalobah and Tammy Abraham can have a big impact at the European Championships in Poland with England Under-21s]</b> It is great to play with them <b>[Chalobah and Abraham]</b> again. Nathaniel has been in Chelsea first team and others have been playing in the Premier League and Championship. The experience they have had this season will be vital for England U21s. We have some of our other players who have played in finals and played for their country before. There are others who have maybe not played in tournament football before but Nathaniel and some of the others have experience at the top level. It will be useful and we will need that experience. It’s just a shame Ruben couldn’t make it.<br /><br />It is going to be a great tournament. We have a strong squad but we are in a difficult group. With the team we have got, we should hopefully have a good tournament. For me, it is my first Euro finals. I am really excited and I am sure the other boys are as well. As soon as I came in, at this level, I thought it was fantastic. I am always proud to represent my country on any level. I will do my best while I am out there in Poland</p>
