  <p><b>[Liverpool’s title-winning side ‘one of best in their history’]</b> The combination of players is one of the best teams in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s history. I’m almost hesitant to say it because of the incredible teams they’ve had down the years but this one, you go through the whole side and the stats match up.<br /><br />It’s an incredible combination of things. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> himself is clearly one of the managers of his generation, he combines that passion, that every fan sees, that emotion, how relatable he is, the ability to inspire them. In a sense he’s an old-fashioned manager in that way, but incredibly modern. He combines all the modern techniques, the coaching techniques, but also the analytics as well<br /><br />They’re remarkable, they score goals, they don’t concede goals. That’s when you win titles. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s ability to combine all those personalities and take all those ingredients as a manager and produce what he has, is remarkable.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool have the players to dominate the next few years]</b> I do not think they do strengthen too much because football is in financial crisis and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as a club are very aware of that. They did not spend much last summer, not even £10m over the two windows, and I do not see that they need to go out and splash the money that they have not got. Over the next year, without football fans, the top five or six clubs in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> could potentially lose £100m-£150m of income that they thought was guaranteed. And they will have fixed outgoings<br /><br /><a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> realises he has a team and a squad that has a lot of good young players at the moment and it has players at their absolute peak and will be at their peak for the next two or three years. So in that sense it is difficult to see any clubs really spending absolutely huge amounts of money, which is what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would have to do if they really did want to strengthen because the side they have got, how you strengthen on that? It is very difficult, really you are talking about squad depth and not the side<br /><br />I do not think <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> needs to strengthen and I do not particularly believe he wants to. Last summer I sat down with him and I remember him saying that in his career with <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, he had never actually had the chance to keep a side that had been successful because every team he created was then cherry picked by some bigger clubs. And last summer he said he had the chance to keep all his players - (Mohamed) Salah, (Sadio) Mane and (Virgil) Van Dijk - and base the team around them. And they are all still at really good ages<br /><br /><a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> himself has a contract until 2024 and I think he realises he has a team and a squad that has a lot of good young players at the moment and it has players at their absolute peak and will be at their peak for the next two or three years. So I do not think he needs to mess with that too much, he needs to keep the mentality that they have and that is the key to whether they can have more success going forward<br /><br />But they are a perfect age, the likes of Henderson still has several years left in him as a leader. And then the front three certainly have two or three years left, there are younger players coming through - (Trent) <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a>, (Joe) Gomez, (Takumi) <a href="takumi-minamino.html">Minamino</a>, <a href="naby-keita.html">Naby Keita</a> is still a decent age. So they all have a lot still to offer and I can see them dominating for two or three years and then it is the next generation coming through, <a href="harvey-elliott.html">Harvey Elliott</a>, <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a>, <a href="neco-williams.html">Neco Williams</a> at right-back. They are younger players, teenagers still, and they are the ones that then have to provide the next level. But that is a big ask for them. But I honestly think <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has the players already to have success and keep it going</p>
