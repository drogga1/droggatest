  <p><b>[Hull City confirm both of Championship’s positive coronavirus tests are from their club]</b> Medical confidentiality means the names <b>[of the two individuals]</b> will not be disclosed, and the Club asks for this to be respected. The duo, who are both asymptomatic and feeling no ill effects, will now self-isolate for seven days – in line with the protocols set out in EFL guidelines – before being tested again at a later date. The club will continue to liaise closely with the affected personnel and will make no further comment</p>

  <p><b>[Hull City confirm both of Championship’s positive coronavirus tests are from their club]</b> Those players or club staff who have tested positive will now self-isolate in line with the guidelines provided by the EFL and only those who have tested negative will be permitted to enter training ground facilities. The EFL will continue to make regular and relevant announcements as appropriate in respect of the testing programme to support competition integrity and transparency</p>
