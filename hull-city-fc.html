  <p><b>[Hull City confirm both of Championship’s positive coronavirus tests are from their club]</b> Medical confidentiality means the names <b>[of the two individuals]</b> will not be disclosed, and the Club asks for this to be respected. The duo, who are both asymptomatic and feeling no ill effects, will now self-isolate for seven days - in line with the protocols set out in EFL guidelines - before being tested again at a later date. The club will continue to liaise closely with the affected personnel and will make no further comment</p>
