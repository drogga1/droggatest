  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> defender Younes Kaboul craves Champions League following last season’s impressive run]</b> It’s a bit hard to watch the Champions League on TV because we’re not there ourselves but it should also give us more power to get back there. If we had been in the Champions League this season, we could have done well. We have our place there. If we get back into the competition next season, we will have last year’s experiences to draw on because we learnt a lot. Mentally, we are stronger this year because of what we went through in the Champions League. Our force is the mentality in our team, which is the most important thing in football before having good feet. You have to be strong in your mind and that makes everything afterwards - it’s something a club can’t gain just by having money. We want to go back there because we know we can do something. We played some very big teams, like Inter and Milan, and not only did we learn from those teams, we scared them as well. We beat Inter at home and Milan away. Being in the Champions League also helps you when you’re competing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> because in the Champions League you have to raise your level. Of course, the level of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is very high but the Champions League is something special and you have to improve your performance again. If you can keep that level when you go back to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, it’s easier.<br /><br /><b>[The Frenchman is confident he can emulate <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> idol King and wants to evolve with football, which he perceives has changed hugely since his youth]</b> I believe in myself more now than I used to. Can I get to Ledley’s level? Of course I can. I can do more than what I’m doing now. That’s why I’m working very hard to be a top defender. When I watch a game, I don’t watch it for goals or entertainment. I look especially at defenders’ performances and try to learn from them and that helps a lot. On the pitch, I then know what I have to do. In France when I was younger, I used to watch people like <b>[current France coach]</b> <a href="laurent-blanc.html">Laurent Blanc</a> and <a href="marcel-desailly.html">Marcel Desailly</a> but now the game is different. It’s much quicker and there is a lot of pressing. In the last five years, football has changed very quickly and every year it’s changing more and more</p>

  <p><b>[Younes Kaboul on his shock Sunderland departure and how the club got under his skin]</b> Basically, it was for my family. I had the social life there everyday with the lads in the dressing room. It wasn’t a problem for me, but for my family it was difficult. They never came to me and said they weren’t settling, but I had to notice it myself. I had to make a decision. We had pre-season in Austria and <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> contacted my agent to say they wanted me. I told him to take it. I wanted to go back home for my family. I don’t really like to speak too much about this because there wasn’t a reason really to leave. The last season went so well. I was gutted. I was kind of like depressed to leave the football club. I knew I wasn’t just leaving the football club, I was leaving the city and the people. So it was really difficult for me. I made the transfer request to the club and initially they said no. I told them, ‘look, it’s nothing to do with football. It’s family reasons’. Eventually they accepted and I respect that. They understood the situation and let me go<br /><br /><b>[Kaboul was certainly a huge miss in the Black Cats’ defence, but it’s clear that he missed the club as much as the club missed him, admitting even in such a short time, it got under his skin, much like <a href="niall-quinn.html">Niall Quinn</a> famously said of the club]</b> It’s weird because I think it’s more than football. It’s the people; it’s the human beings in the city. I’d never experienced this anywhere else before. The people from the north east are just special. They are people with big values. I think it comes from their background and education. Growing up, you don’t grow up the same way as anywhere like say London or the south. Northern people are different in many ways, but positively obviously<br /><br />I think they’re stronger, they have bigger values, they appreciate more and yeah, they are by themselves. They are like everything that I am. <a href="niall-quinn.html">Niall Quinn</a> was right when he said Sunderland gets under your skin. That’s exactly what happened. I know that I left with memories that I will never experience again. I experienced something totally unique, and I will never forget it, ever</p>
