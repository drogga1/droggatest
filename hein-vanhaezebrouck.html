  <p><b>[Hein Vanhaezebrouck believes a switch to France would offer Kevin De Bruyne a better shot at Champions League glory]</b> Kevin has won two league titles and various English cups with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, and he’s been named player of the season in Germany. But he has never won anything internationally. No Europa League, no Champions League, no World Cup - and these are the things that are always taken into account. As soon as he wins one of these prizes I have no doubt that he will be in the running for the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> player of the year award and the Ballon d’Or trophy.<br /><br />He could yet do it with City - but with the defence they’ve got I am not convinced. I’m not saying that it would be easier for him to win the Champions League with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. But to my mind it would be if he played for <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>. Get De Bruyne to feed <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Edinson Cavani</a> and <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> with his pinpoint passes, and you have a team that is virtually impossible to play against. The one problem is that it may not suit him to play in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a>. At <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> he would earn even more money than he does now. But on so many weekends he’d have matches against the likes of Dijon, Amiens or Strasbourg - and he wouldn’t look forward to them</p>
