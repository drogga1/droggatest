  <p><b>[On his team’s performance in Saturday’s 4-0 Hudson River Derby]</b> We have no excuses. We tried to come here and play a little bit. We didn’t bring heart and energy, and that’s what happens. Everyone knows we can do much better. This is a game we have to forget fast. We didn’t bring our passion and the energy we’re used to bringing. We thought we can come here and play flick-ons and shit like that, and this happens. Something that is really difficult for me to accept as a coach is that the other team want it more than us. I think this is something that, at this level, you can’t accept.</p>

  <p><b>[Red-hot David Villa and full-strength squad has NYCFC looking like a contender]</b> It makes a big difference, having everybody healthy. I think you can see in the way we played the last two games that competition is high for the starting positions. The intensity in practice is at a new level, and I think everyone wants to play and give their best so it’s pushing us.</p>
