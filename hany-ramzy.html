  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah has been advised by Egypt legend Hany Ramzy that now is the right time to leave Liverpool and link up with Real Madrid]</b> I think he makes history for an Egyptian player and this is very important. Also that all the world can see that Egypt has talent. And about the question if it is better for Salah to stay at Liverpool or transfer himself to another league, I think all the media are talking about Real Madrid or Barcelona. For me, Salah is ready to make this step. For him it’s time. It’s the right time to transfer or go to Real Madrid, especially I think Real Madrid as the way they play could be a very, very good transfer for Salah, because he makes everything this season with Liverpool. He was their best player, he was the top scorer and if he waits until next year maybe he will not get the chance to move. Maybe he loses his level, maybe he has an injury, but we hope not. But I think at the moment that Salah can go to Real Madrid or Barcelona maybe but I see him in Real Madrid, being more comfortable.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah should hands down by the recipient of the 2018 FIFA Best Award]</b> The reason why I think Salah should win the award is because of the journey he has taken to achieve what he has. To come back to England after his disappointment with Chelsea and become the Premier League’s top scorer, as well as reach the Champions League final and lead his country to the World Cup for the first time in 28 years, is something unheard of. Furthermore, if FIFA were to look at the big picture and consider the hardships and culture barriers each player had to endure in the course of his career to reach this level, then Salah must win hands down. He has managed to transcend cultural divides and made a real positive impact in the relations between people of different backgrounds<br /><br />Mohamed Salah is now considered a real icon in Egypt and the whole of the Arab world. He is a true ambassador for Arabic people, a young man with huge ambition who is achieving his goals whilst winning over the hearts of so many people around the world with his exemplary behaviour on and off the pitch. I think nobody in Egypt ever imagined that we would have a player in the top three in world football or a player that would win the best player and Golden Boot of the Premier League. It really is an honour and source of pride for every Egyptian</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah is struggling]</b> The initial diagnosis, according to the team doctor, is a strong muscle strain. It is not a tear. I think it is not serious.</p>
