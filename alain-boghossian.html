  <p><b>[Alain Boghossian Admits He Is A Fan Of France Coach <a href="laurent-blanc.html">Laurent Blanc</a>]</b> <a href="laurent-blanc.html">Laurent Blanc</a> made a good transition between both matches. He said he had confidence in the players, and did not want to apply the handbrake. Laurent is not called the ‘President’ for nothing. Even when the players have their back to the wall, he knows they will apply his instructions to the letter</p>

  <p><b>[Alain Boghossian says Several clubs keen on France boss <a href="laurent-blanc.html">Laurent Blanc</a>]</b> There are several teams who would like to have him as coach. You have to have the matter resolved as quickly as possible. Every year there is the problem: coaches in March and April are approached by the clubs. We’ll have to give an answer and not wait for the result of the Euro.</p>

  <p><b>[How has football changed since 1998?]</b> It’s faster, although it was already pretty fast at the time. We also focus a lot more on individuals. There have always been players who were a cut above, but it seems to me that the team mattered more before. You always prefer to have great players in your team, but nowadays we put a lot of pressure on them as individuals. In a team, everyone is responsible for the wins, just as they are for defeats. The team with the best collective spirit wins 99 times out of 100. That’s what makes football so wonderful</p>

  <p><b>[What was it like being a substitute for France in 1998?]</b> You have to be ready when you’re chosen to go on and accept it when you’re not. Otherwise, you’re not a good team player. It’s important to understand your role. I was always honoured to be there and always gave everything when I was sent on. My goal was to put pressure on the starters so that they didn’t let up and to make the coach’s decisions as tough as possible, but always with good intentions and the aim of lifting the standard of the squad. That’s what motivated me throughout my career</p>

  <p><b>[What did <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Didier Deschamps</a> and <a href="emmanuel-petit.html">Emmanuel Petit</a>, the midfield starters, have that you did not?]</b> For a start, I didn’t have anything like Didier’s list of achievements. He was captain of <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> and France, and his experience was on another level. I felt automatically that I was on a rung below him, though I wouldn’t have had any qualms about taking over if he’d played badly. <a href="emmanuel-petit.html">Emmanuel Petit</a> was more similar to me. He was a left-footed player with real athleticism, good technique and incredible powers of recovery. Manu had a superb World Cup. I gave it my all but was always conscious of my place in the hierarchy, even if I knew I wasn’t far off a starting spot. I have zero regrets about my World Cup. Everybody wants to play more, but I was among the substitutes who got the most time on the pitch.</p>

  <p><b>[What were your own unique qualities?]</b> I had unshakeable mental strength and never gave up. I always served the team and got through a lot of work retrieving possession in midfield. <a href="aime-jacquet.html">Aime Jacquet</a> often sent me on when we were in front to help maintain our lead and close out the game. I wasn’t the kind of player who could make the difference in an attacking sense. Besides, holding midfielders often need to be replaced during the match if they give everything</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[That was the case during the Final against Brazil]</b> Yes, we were leading 2-0 when I went on and I did everything I could to contain them and move the ball forward cleanly. <a href="marcel-desailly.html">Marcel Desailly</a> had been sent off shortly after the hour mark, so that meant there was even more work to do. But none of us had any issues doing our defensive duties - least of all me, who was not a No10 or a forward.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="didier-deschamps.html">Didier Deschamps</a> lifted the Trophy in 1998, but he is the one former player least focused on the 20th anniversary]</b> Didier has a far more important objective! Today, he’s the boss, and having been assistant France coach for four years, I know how intense the pressure gets in his position. He has a mission and also the unique opportunity to join that exclusive club of people who have won the World Cup both as a player and a coach</p>

<h4 id="2018-05-15g-retrieve">2018 05 15g Retrieve</h4>

  <p><b>[Who will be the leaders of the France team in Russia?]</b> There’s <a href="blaise-matuidi.html">Blaise Matuidi</a>, <a href="hugo-lloris.html">Hugo Lloris</a> … <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> has all the qualities required to lead this team, but I think he’s playing below his best and needs to focus on his job with the ball. For me, he’s strayed from the path he was on. It’s up to him to rediscover the value of hard work and sacrifice. Meanwhile, we have players up front like <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a> and young <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a>. They’re real assets in attack who frighten everyone and can lift the whole team. It’s a well-balanced side, although, for me, the one weakness remains the full-backs. We still haven’t found clear starters either on the right or left</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="2018-05-15h-retrieve">2018 05 15h Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Do France have what it takes to come out on top?]</b> <a href="aime-jacquet.html">Aime Jacquet</a> often said: ‘People remember who came first and forget who finished second.’ We won’t be able to say we had a good World Cup in Russia if we finish third or fourth. For me, as a former player, a former coach and a fan of the France team, the only acceptable result is victory. Some people say it’s too soon, that this team is still young. I don’t agree. Didier has been in charge for five years and we have players who play for the best teams in the best leagues in Europe. Didier has all the keys he needs - it’s up to him to find the lock</p>
