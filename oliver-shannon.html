<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Atlanta United chose Oliver Shannon with the 36th pick Friday]</b> I think she was definitely watching over me and making sure that my name was called. I definitely feel my game’s improved hugely. In college you’re playing to win games. If coaches lose they get fired, it’s still important. So I’ve learned a lot, and I feel my confidence is really raised. I’ve been a leader in the team, so people have relied on me to put in performances week in, week out. With all of the substitutions - and Americans are just generally better athletes than English people - it was really intense games. There’s guys coming on in the 70th minute that are fresh and you’ve got to try to match their intensity. That was hard.<br /><br />They’ve been great for me. All of the coaches came to my mom’s funeral, and they offer for me to go in and train and use the gym. But it’s great just having that behind me, and that experience can only be a good thing. I know what a professional environment is like, I know what it takes to succeed, and I also know that there’s failure because I wanted to play there and I didn’t achieve that. I know what more I need to give for this next opportunity so I can make it here</p>
