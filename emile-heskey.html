  <p><b>[Emile Heskey has opened up on his battle with depression following his move from <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> to Liverpool]</b> It lasted six months. I had to grow up very quickly because I had kids, I had a girlfriend. I literally laid on the floor and started crying. I was like, ‘What have I done? I don’t know if I have done the right thing’. But the weirdest thing was I’d go to training <b>[and]</b> I would be all right. Then like a drop of a hat I found a barber, I found friends, a routine. Yes, it was a tough time but it was weird, I was silly and looking back you think, ‘Why didn’t you just go and sit with mates?’<br /><br /><b>[The former England striker also brushed off criticism of his strike-rate, having scored 111 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> goals from 516 appearances]</b> I play for the team; it wasn’t anything that really bothered me.

I still got to the top 1 per cent or whatever of the game.<br /><br />Your son is eight. So if I tell you by the age of 24 he would’ve represented England youth all the way through, would have made his debut at 17 and gone to three cup finals in four years for his hometown team, then been sold for a record to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - one of the biggest clubs in the world; then he’d go on to win the treble <b>[FA Cup, League Cup, <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Cup]</b> that first season, represent England at two World Cups, in the European Championships, and play in one of England’s most memorable games to date, winning God knows, six or seven trophies by the age of 24, how would you feel?</p>

A lot of young players were looking for someone to make a break for it and leave a big club to play first-team football. If he had stayed at City would he be in <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s first team? Maybe. Would he be in the England side? No. Now he’s an integral part of the national squad. He’s not far behind <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>, if he is behind him. But it’s thanks to the risk Jadon took - he went out on a limb. When it happened, people were looking at him thinking: ‘What has he done that for?’ Or: ‘He must be a trouble-maker’. He backed himself. He backed his talent and now it’s paying off for him<br /><br /><b>[The 62-cap forward is clearly now a big believer in young talent leaving the confines of England’s biggest clubs in search of game time]</b> Young players now want to go out to Germany or France because they have a chance to play. Think about the England team that won the Under-17s World Cup. How many of them are playing regular first-team football here? Phil <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a>, now and again. <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a> will play for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, but that’s about it. Jadon has given the opportunity for young lads to be looked at. They can aspire to be in the first team at the age of 20 - but they know now that they have to go and play. Take <a href="bobby-duncan.html">Bobby Duncan</a>, for instance. Look at the fuss he has kicked up at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. They are a massive club, the quality is very high. But he can’t be sat there at the age of 19 and not play. You have got to play games. At the age of 21 I’d played three-and-a-half seasons in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. They are wasting away. But Jadon has shown others the way</p>

If you take certain players out of City they’ve always got someone who can step in and do a specific job, the way the manager wants him to do it. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, if you take Salah, Mane or <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> out, it’s not quite the same, whereas City have a better blend<br /><br />I think City have a better midfield.

  <p><b>[Emile Heskey says <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> should not be given a rest by Liverpool]</b> Salah and Mane won’t want a rest and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> shouldn’t give them one. They’ve played a lot of football over the past few seasons, but as a player, you want to be playing as much as possible. When you look at the pair of them, they just love being out on the pitch and playing football - they’re a manager’s dream. In the modern game, players are complete athletes. Although they’ve played a lot of games it won’t be the physical side that catches up with them, it will be the mental side. It can sometimes be draining playing so many games without a break, so they may want to take a break for those reasons. However, they’ll both physically be as fit and ready to go as any other player<br /><br />Mane and Salah are as important as each other, but <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> is the link that makes them stronger. They both have an incredible amount of talent, but <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> really connects the two together and is pivotal to the trio working as well as they do. It’s impossible to say who <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would miss more out of the two (Salah and Mane). If one isn’t doing so well, then the other steps up and vice versa. It’s a massive help as a player to know that, if you’re having an off day, you have a team-mate that can take the pressure off you slightly, without the performance being analysed too much. You can just move on to the next game<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> could walk]</b> Winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> will just be a bi-product of what <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has implemented at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s style of management can be broken in to three sections; the first was getting <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to play his style of football, the second was consistency and the third is winning trophies. He’s already got the first two sections in place, so from there on out he’ll be aiming for trophies to complete the programme that he’s put in place</p>

  <p><b>[Emile Heskey says <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> remains a leading figure at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> even if his form has dipped slightly]</b> Players are going to up their game when coming up against Van Dijk. When you’re at the top, players are always going to want the challenge. After playing a season where he didn’t put a foot wrong, even one mistake is going to be brought to everyone’s attention. Van Dijk controls <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s defensive line and is a leading figure in the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team. He brings the best out of his team-mates and they bring the best out of him, which is why they look so much stronger when he’s in the team<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s defence will be back to their best once Alisson is back in goal. He’s obviously an excellent goalkeeper, but he has an excellent understanding with the defence which will give the back-line more confidence when he’s back. As a striker, it is a lot harder when you’re coming up against a keeper who basically plays as another defender and that’s what Alisson does. The defenders will have an understanding of when he’s going to come and when he’s going to stay, which gives them confidence<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> wouldn’t have been able to improve their squad over the summer with the players that were available. They’ve managed to avoid any major injuries, which has been a massive help, but they’ve still got depth should an injury occur. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are at a stage where only a top player would get in the team, so unless that’s available, you won’t see them enter the market. Unless there’s a long-term injury, I can’t see <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> signing anyone this season. They’ve started well and now have a good amount of time to assess if they need to make a move in January. The squad is very well balanced at the moment and every player knows their role, so <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> will be looking to keep it that way.<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s only slight worry is their midfield doesn’t chip in with enough goals. The team rely heavily on the front three to score and assist most of the goals, which is something <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> may want to address. When you look at City’s midfield three, there’s a lot of goals and assists there, which frees the top three attackers up a little. By bringing in a player of that ilk, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> could risk losing that grit that they currently have in the midfield. The three players in there work very hard to cover ground and give <b>[Trent]</b> <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a> and <b>[Andy]</b> Robertson the licence to attack</p>

They don’t need the money and I think it’s fully in Rodgers’ hands whether he leaves or not. Rodgers will want Maddison to stay and I don’t think there is any reason for Maddison to want to move elsewhere when he is getting support and lots of game-time at the club. Rodgers will be building his game plans around Maddison, which means that Maddison suits what Rodgers wants to do at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. He look confident and happy, so I doubt he’ll be having any thoughts on leaving. Clubs are always going to enquire, as they do with any top talent, but <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> have become a more attractive proposition and I’m confident he will stay<br /><br />Maguire leaving <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> was a win-win situation for both clubs, but I think <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> will be more happy with the deal. They received very good money for Maguire and <b>[Caglar]</b> <a href="caglar-soyuncu.html">Soyuncu</a> has taken over seamlessly. The fans had worries but he has quashed any concern that may have existed at the start of the season with his excellent performances. Maguire leaving <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> meant a big cash influx for the club and they had <a href="caglar-soyuncu.html">Soyuncu</a> progressing and needing games, so it was the right decision to let Maguire go to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, who were in need of him. It was important for <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> to get a player like Maguire, who wanted to be defending, winning headers and getting involved in tackles - and they have that in <a href="caglar-soyuncu.html">Soyuncu</a>.<br /><br />I think <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a> will retire at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, he won’t leave the club. He’s still got a lot of games left in him and he seems to get better with age. <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a> will be at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> for a long time yet - he looks younger and younger by the season. He’s quicker than he ever has been and is definitely one of the fastest in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He’s loved at the club and I think he’s settled there now</p>

I don’t think that Jack will be at Villa come the end of the season. I played with him when I was at Villa, he was only a young lad, he used to come and train with us - he was a phenomenal player even then and he has gone from strength to strength. He’s taken everything on his shoulders at a young age. He’s a very young captain but has been very positive with it. He’s stayed at Villa a lot longer than a lot of people would have thought he would, so full credit to him.

  <p><b>[Everything gels for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> when <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> plays]</b> I just think everything gels properly when he’s playing. He’s not necessarily worried about ‘this is my job and I need to do this’.<br /><br />You see him chasing back and tackling, you see him playing left wing and chase the guy up and down the wing. Then you’ll see him up front, getting the ball and holding it up and bringing someone in. It’s just a different variety of stuff that he does, he’s not just focused on ‘I must score goals’.<br /><br />I’m a forward, so I look at the runs he’s making, the space he’s creating. He seems to get space where nobody gets space. He creates his space, his first touch is brilliant because he takes it away from players, so he can have time to look around and assess what he’s got to do next. He’s great at that.<br /><br /><b>[Heskey was not as widely heralded back in his day as <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> is in the present, but believes he actually had it easier as his outings for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and England often saw him paired alongside the likes of <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a> and]</b> It was easier for us because we played with two strikers.

  <p><b>[Heskey on England’s golden generation, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and being underappreciated]</b> I always preferred athletics to football. When I was younger, that was what I cared about. Football was secondary. Football gradually took over. Athletics is more seasonal, isn’t it? With football, I could play all day, every day. It was easier to go down that path<br /><br /><b>[He is remembered as a selfless player]</b> It was natural. I played with Michael with the England Under-18 team, and we just struck up an understanding. We’d never met before, never played with each other before, but we clicked on the pitch. I understood what he wanted, he knew what I would do. It was the perfect match<br /><br /><b>[He had learned his trade at Leicester]</b> Those Fridays at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, oh mate! We’d play young versus old every week, and it was the most competitive game you could ever imagine! They’d have Matt Elliott, <a href="steve-walsh.html">Steve Walsh</a>, Gerry Taggart, big, tough, old-school defenders, and all they do is throw them all up front and then launch the ball into the box! So I’m 18 or 19, and we’ve got to try and defend against these big monsters coming at you. They’d batter us from pillar to post. We used to have the yellow jersey which was given to the worst player in training, the lads would vote for it. You didn’t want that yellow jersey! It got so competitive, trust me. You’d be pumped going into training because you knew it was on. It taught me a lot.<br /><br />Gerard wanted us to know football inside and out. Martin would make us focus on ourselves, and on our strengths, but <a href="gerard-houllier.html">Houllier</a> was different. We’d do whole training sessions at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> where we wouldn’t even see a football! We’d do shadow play, where to be on the pitch when the ball is in a certain area, where to move, all that. Then we’d go inside and spend 45 minutes or an hour going through video analysis! It was a rude awakening when I first got there, but looking back it made such a difference to me as a player<br /><br />It was amazing, the run we went on. I just remember playing every three days, and every game was massive. It’d be hotel, travel, play, go home and pack, travel again, play again. People talk to me about the Alaves game <b>[the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Cup final, which <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won 5-4 after extra-time]</b> but I always tell them I can’t remember it! I was so tired, I was running on adrenaline by that point!<br /><br /><b>[Heskey has fond memories of his time at Anfield]</b> Paddy and Vladi, the Czech boys! They were an absolute joke, I swear. You couldn’t put those two on the same side in training. Nobody could get near them<br /><br /><b>[He recalls <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s famous victory over <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> at Goodison Park on Easter Monday, 2001, when <a href="gary-mcallister.html">McAllister</a>’s stoppage-time free kick secured a 3-2 win]</b> Only Gary Mac could have done that. When he first kicked it we were all thinking ‘what are you doing?!’ Everybody was at the far post waiting for it to be hung up, and instead he whips it in near post. Ridiculous. I’ll never forget the emotions from that day<br /><br />The bottom line is we weren’t quite as good as <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. We didn’t have that consistency when it really mattered. We’d beat those teams on our day, but we’d go and lose against a side we should have beaten the next week. You can’t win leagues that way<br /><br /><b>[Heskey’s departure was a swift one. He was informed by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> that <a href="djibril-cisse.html">Djibril Cisse</a> was arriving from Auxerre, and that opportunities would be limited]</b> What do you do? Sit and do nothing or carry on with your career? I chose to move on, but when I look back I think I would have played games if I had stayed. <a href="djibril-cisse.html">Cisse</a> got a bad injury and there weren’t many other strikers there at the time. They won the Champions League at the end of that season<br /><br /><b>[At <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a>, he admits it took him time to adapt]</b> I went from playing with Michael, <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Stevie G</a>, Gary Mac. All I had to do was make a run! Then I’m at <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a>, and no disrespect to the players there but I was making runs and nobody was even looking at me. It was a totally different calibre of player. Mentally that was tough at first, but I got my head around it. You learn to play in a different way, you work hard and find a way to fit in with the team<br /><br /><b>[Ask him why England failed to win a major trophy]</b> Everyone talks about the golden generation, but look at France. That was the real golden generation wasn’t it? Even if you just look at my age group; we had me, Carra <b>[Jamie Carragher]</b>, Rio, Lamps, <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a>. They had <b>[Nicolas]</b> <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Anelka</a>, <b>[David]</b> <a href="david-trezeguet.html">Trezeguet</a>, <b>[Thierry]</b> Henry, <b>[Ousmane]</b> Dabo, <b>[William]</b> <a href="william-gallas.html">Gallas</a>, <b>[Mikael]</b> <a href="mikael-silvestre.html">Silvestre</a>, <b>[Willy]</b> <a href="willy-sagnol.html">Sagnol</a>.

We lost 2-1, but we had a chance there<br /><br /><b>[asks if he feels he was underappreciated during his playing career]</b> By who? Not by my team-mates or my managers, and not by the fans of the clubs I played for. If I go back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, the fans are always amazing with me. That’s what matters to me. The rest, who cares? I enjoyed every minute of my career.</p>

  <p><b>[Emile Heskey says <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> was right to use platform to stand up to racism]</b> Sports have a platform that is viewed by billions of people so it definitely has a say on what people think and how you put things out there. It’s very important that if they have a view on it, then why not? You look at <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> who got booked for it as well. He felt it was right for him to put it out there because this is something that sits very close to his heart. He’s a young black footballer who grew up in London.
