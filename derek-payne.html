  <p><b>[Former <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> midfielder Derek Payne at Vicarage Road]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are pinning <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> back now, playing excellent, patient football. <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> needs to regain a bit of possession, just to take the sting out of the game<br /><br /><b>[Watford 0-1 Arsenal]</b> The ball travelled from one end of the pitch to the other, just what <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are very good at. Slick and quick, and the ball in from <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> was disguised and was sheer quality. Did <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> switch off for a moment? Well, now they’re one behind<br /><br /><b>[Watford 0-2 Arsenal]</b> <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> at the heart of this again - what an intelligent player. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are showing their class, and they are such a different animal when they’re winning. They are so much more confident<br /><br /><b>[Watford 0-3 Arsenal]</b> Great play by <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, you must say that. It’s what we know they can do, but <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> were too open there. Much too easy for the Gunners, who have been very, very clinical with excellent movement off the ball. They are a top side<br /><br />Disappointing for <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>, who were excellent for the first hour. But there is no shame in losing to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, an excellent footballing side<br /><br /><a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> can take a lot of heart from the first 60 minutes, where they matched a Champions League team. They will be disappointed with how they reacted to falling behind - <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s second goal came very quickly. Just think if the Hornets had scored one of their first-half chances…</p>
