  <p><b>[Kylian Mbappe is a more mature player than Thierry Henry was at the same age]</b> So far he reminds me of Thierry <b>[Henry]</b>. Maybe he is more mature in his game already than Thierry was at the same time. When you consider what Thierry went on to achieve in the game it is amazing.<br /><br />The advice would be to stay focused and not to forget you have everything at the moment in Monaco to become a better player. You have time in future to choose and change everything in your football life.<br /><br />If Mbappé is playing well it’s partly because alongside him is <b>[Radamel]</b> Falcao, a very experienced player. He has a very well-balanced team around him and a good manager. Football is very fragile. We have seen gifted players have a very good start who choose not to concentrate any more on football and focus on advertising or media or choose the wrong clubs at the wrong time.<br /><br />If you can, stay concentrated only on football, please. Don’t forget you are only 18. Keep your dream of when you were a child, and try to forget everything around you when you are on the pitch. Realise what an opportunity it is to play in such a good collective team</p>

  <p><b>[Olivier Giroud is capable of partnering record signing Alexandre Lacazette at Arsenal]</b> Olivier and Alexandre are two different players that Arsene needs. The seasons are long and the aims are high for a club like Arsenal. To have these two players at his disposal is not too much, and it is possible to put them both in the same XI. The proof, at Lyon, is that Alex and <b>[former Lyon and Swansea striker]</b> Bafe <b>[Gomis]</b> played alongside each other at Lyon with me. We got the balance right by playing a diamond midfield. That is something that Arsene could do with these two players. Alex is a player who is sufficiently intelligent to adapt to that, Olivier Giroud too.</p>

  <p><b>[The Montreal Impact have signed Algeria international Saphir Taider as a designated player on loan from Serie A side Bologna]</b> It’s an excellent signing for our club because Saphir is both young and has a lot of experience on the European stage. His career thus far in some of Serie A’s biggest clubs and with the Algerian national team makes him a very important player who can help the Impact win trophies in the seasons to come. After explaining the project being put in place here in Montreal, to my great satisfaction, he chose to accept this challenge and to invest himself fully. His European track record and his position in midfield will give him many responsibilities. I am convinced that he has all the capacities to become one of the top players in MLS.</p>

  <p><b>[Montreal Impact sign Uruguay international Alejandro Silva]</b> Alejandro is an attacking player who will bring his experience to the team and increase our options in the last third. His passing qualities and his speed will contribute in improving our play. His high work rate also makes him an option as a midfielder.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal and Manchester City right back Bacary Sagna has joined MLS’s Montreal Impact]</b> I’m very happy of Bacary’s arrival. He’s a player with a great career who’s still very motivated to come and help the Impact defy its end of season challenge. His personality, experience, and overall game will be a plus for our team.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> wonderkid Bojan signs with Montreal Impact]</b> Bojan is a very talented player who, at 28 years old, chose the Impact to pursue his career, after having played for some of the biggest clubs in the world. His offensive ability to get others involved in the game and to score goals will be of precious help for the final stretch of the season. I welcome him to our club</p>

  <p><b>[The Montreal Impact have announced that head coach Remi Garde has been sacked, with former Houston Dynamo boss Wilmer Cabrera replacing him]</b> Because I <b>[<a href="kevin-gilmore.html">Kevin Gilmore</a>]</b> have so much respect for Remi as a person and as a professional, it was a very difficult decision to make and it was well thought, but our latest series of failures in the past couple of months and the way the team acts on the field led to that change. We hope to bring back confidence to this group of players for the last stretch of the season, to get a playoff spot and to perform in the Canadian Championship final</p>
