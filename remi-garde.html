  <p><b>[Former Barca wonderkid Bojan signs with Montreal Impact]</b> Bojan is a very talented player who, at 28 years old, chose the Impact to pursue his career, after having played for some of the biggest clubs in the world. His offensive ability to get others involved in the game and to score goals will be of precious help for the final stretch of the season. I welcome him to our club</p>

  <p><b>[The Montreal Impact have announced that head coach Remi Garde has been sacked, with former Houston Dynamo boss Wilmer Cabrera replacing him]</b> Because I <b>[Kevin Gilmore]</b> have so much respect for Remi as a person and as a professional, it was a very difficult decision to make and it was well thought, but our latest series of failures in the past couple of months and the way the team acts on the field led to that change. We hope to bring back confidence to this group of players for the last stretch of the season, to get a playoff spot and to perform in the Canadian Championship final</p>
