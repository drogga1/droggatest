<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Nnamdi Collins: <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s rapid defender who turned down Chelsea]</b> We had the deciding championship game against Schalke in the Under-15s. Nnamdi had an intense duel with Schalke’s Semin Kojic. When we got into the dressing room after a great win, I said to him: ‘Nnamdi, what a duel.’ Then he grinned and said: ‘I love to play against the best. It was really fun again’. At that point everyone in the club knew that he had to skip the U16s<br /><br />A few days ago, his mum and Nnamdi told me that <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> was his club and it was his dream to make it as a professional with us. That’s how I always perceived it<br /><br />I believe that Nnamdi played a maximum of 10 long balls with us in the two years. Off the ball he aims to solve problems in a creative way while he can obvously also use his speed. He loves intense, direct duels. In the air, due to his size and timing, he is hard to beat, regardless of whether it is an offensive or defensive header. The force and technique with which he hit the ball were exceptional for his age, especially in the U15s. An additional strength for us was that he was always on the front foot and would suddenly appear, with or without the ball, in the opponent’s box. I think that Nnamdi knows that his development is far from over. Nnamdi always has a grin on his face and has definitely kept his feet on the ground. His parents attach great importance to this</p>
