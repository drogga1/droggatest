  <p><b>[Closed South Korea training session infiltrated by Sweden. South Korea, who play Sweden on Monday, said they had responded by swapping players’ numbers to confuse the Swedish snooper because - in the words of their manager, Shin Tae-yong]</b> We switched them around because we didn’t want to show everything and to try to confuse them. They might know a few of our players but it is very difficult for westerners to distinguish between Asians and that’s why we did it<br /><br />All coaches probably feel their opponents are always spying on them. I think it’s perfectly natural that we all try to get as much information on each other as we can</p>
