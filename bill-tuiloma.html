<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Bill Tuiloma got a second chance to make a first impression]</b> I went around a few clubs and ended up at Marseille. I had a tremendous time and learned a lot as a player and as a person outside of football. It was a really good experience playing and training with some of the best players in the world. I wanted this. I wanted a professional career. At first it was difficult but we learn to adapt through different aspects in our lives and in our career.<br /><br /><b>[On Steve Mandanda, Benjamin Mendy and Florian Thauvin]</b> It’s good to see the players I was with a year ago win the World Cup. Congrats to them for everything they’ve done to win that<br /><br /><b>[And with his contract in the south of France expiring, Portland came calling]</b> I talked to my manager and agent about it and also my family and it all came to a conclusion. I made the move to come here to America. I was in the academy in LA and we won the Generation Adidas Cup so I kind of had a good idea of what to expect in MLS<br /><br />I got injured a couple of months ago but I’m back in form now and ready to fight for my spot back. I want the team to win games and I want to be in there. I’m glad I’m back in, I’m very healthy and I’ll be ready to get back on</p>
