  <p><b>[Liverpool have no need to sell and could end Barcelona’s interest in Philippe Coutinho by saying no]</b> It would be extremely difficult, almost impossible, to replace Coutinho with a like-for-like player in terms of skills and knowledge of the Premier League. I don’t think Liverpool can afford to sell him…but if they actually want to keep the player, I think they can say ‘no’. The <b>[financial]</b> landscape has changed massively over the last 12 or 24 months in world football. Because the Premier League has so much financial ability to resist any bid, I think if Liverpool want to say no, they say no. That’s exactly what PSG did with Barcelona and <b>[Marco]</b> Verratti. Barcelona had agreed a deal with Verratti, but they came to PSG and they said, ‘absolutely no chance, the player is staying’.<br /><br />Liverpool don’t need the money - no club in the Premier League needs the money because there’s so much coming in from the TV rights. If the player wants to go to Barcelona and they feel they have agreed a deal, it doesn’t mean much. The biggest hurdle is to agree a deal with Liverpool. It’s still very much in Liverpool’s hands. Honestly, even if the player wants to go, I think it’s very, very possible for the club to keep him.</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Edwards doesn’t do publicity. No time for it. His work happens behind the scenes, in offices and boardrooms, on telephone calls and emails.

The first is the role of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, whose charisma, personality and underrated tactical acumen make him one of the world’s premier managers. The second is the quality of the Reds’ recruitment, and the manner in which they have gone about assembling one of the world’s best squads.

  <p><b>[What is a director of football &amp; how does transfer chief role work? Damien Comolli said in a 2016 interview]</b> <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> is one of the main reasons I got sacked. The day I got sacked they <b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s owners]</b> told me I had made a big mistake on Jordan and he was a waste of money. I never said it publicly, but I was convinced he would be the future captain. People will say it is easy to say now, but I was convinced at the time that he would become the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain. Now he is and he is also the England captain</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> director delivers transfer warning says Only three <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs will be able to spend]</b> An agent was telling me the other day, that there are actually only three clubs in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> that will be able to spend money next summer in the transfer window. I don’t know if this is correct but usually when agents tell you things like this, they usually get intel. We might see very little transfer activity, we might see swaps, we might see loans and I think we are going to see a massive decrease in transfer fees and transfer activity, at least transfers involving money. The longer this crisis goes on, more clubs are going to be in a financially difficult situation. The first thing that will be impacted will be player remuneration, the second thing will be transfer fees<br /><br />There are millions of fans who cannot come into stadiums and will be happy to have something else - at night or during the day - to think about, away from the virus and all the issues they’ve got to think about. I think having football on TV would be a positive, personally. I wouldn’t be surprised if we can’t play without any fans until the end of 2020 - not just the end of this season. People say we shouldn’t be playing behind closed doors to finish this season, but what about next season?</p>

He’s somebody who has got where he’s got because his intrinsic motivation is off the charts. When I met him, that’s what came across the most. This sheer desire to succeed, to improve every day, refusing to lose, refusing to give up an inch. I was convinced at the time that he hated losing more than he liked to win. I think the way he plays now, it shows - he walks onto the pitch thinking, ‘You’re not going to beat me today.<br /><br />I think I called his agent and said, ‘What the hell are they doing here?’ I was laughing at what I was hearing, that they were trying to sell him.
