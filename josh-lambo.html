  <p><b>[Josh Lambo, who was part of a USA squad comprising <a href="mix-diskerud.html">Mix Diskerud</a> and Brek Shea at the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-20 World Cup in 2009. The 24-year-old suffered a fractured jaw while on the books of FC Dallas and, while sidelined, enrolled in Texas A&amp;M University, where he played American football for the first time. Lambo is now set to start for the San Diego Chargers against the Detroit Lions in the NFL on Sunday]</b> It’s funny, I never liked kicking when I was a soccer player - I played in the only position where you use your hands! But punting the ball upfield is part of <b>[being a goalkeeper]</b>. I had the epiphany of, well, swinging your leg is swinging your leg, so I might as well try this whole football thing. I’ve been swinging my leg back since I was four years old. It’s just minor adjustments and minor tweaks from being a soccer keeper to a football kicker, and if you’re as good of an athlete that you need to be for any sport, you should be able to make those adjustments. I hope more soccer players don’t follow my route though - I could do without more competition!</p>
