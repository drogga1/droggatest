Losing the car, however, was not the only hardship <a href="marek-hamsik.html">Hamsik</a> had to endure to see his son succeed. To make matters worse, when the family travelled the 212 kilometres to Bratislava for training, the car they had borrowed had only two seats so Marek’s mother and Marek were in the front and his father had to sit in the back</td>
