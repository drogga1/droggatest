  <p><b>[Hearts and Partick Thistle take legal action against SPFL]</b> Heart of Midlothian Football Club and Partick Thistle Football Club have today lodged a petition with the Court of Session to challenge the unfair and unjust decision of the SPFL to enforce relegations, to the extreme detriment of those clubs affected. Unfortunately, Scottish football has been unable to pull together at this time of national crisis to prevent the need for this legal challenge. We desperately hoped court action would not be necessary, but we were left with no other option<br /><br />As matters stand, we have not asked the court to grant an interim interdict which would prevent next season commencing on August 1. However, we have to reserve our right to do so in the event that becomes necessary. We would emphasise instead that we have no wish to disrupt Scottish football but rather our aim is to have the proceedings litigated to a conclusion as quickly as possible. In that regard, the court has today granted our motion to reduce the normal period within which the SPFL must answer our petition, to seven days</p>

  <p><b>[Hearts and Partick Thistle hit out at SPFL over ‘misleading’ letter]</b> Along with the other 40 SPFL clubs, Hearts and Partick Thistle have received a letter, signed by <a href="neil-doncaster.html">Neil Doncaster</a>, that relates to the forthcoming court case. It is wrong and much of its content is misleading and the timing itself questionable. We are currently awaiting legal advice on what needs to happen next.</p>

  <p><b>[Hearts, Partick relegation case to go to Scottish FA arbitration]</b> After three days of detailed and complex submissions, Heart of Midlothian and Partick Thistle today learned the outcome of our preliminary hearing in the Court of Session, presided over by Lord Clark. It is important to note that this was only to determine how to proceed<br /><br />Lord Clark found in our favour in two motions while we were unsuccessful in one. While denied the opportunity for a public hearing in Court this simply means we now pursue the same outcome in a different forum. Importantly, we were successful in the motion to get access to a number of documents that will be key to support our case in arbitration<br /><br />Both clubs are also pleased to have received a fair hearing and feel it important to point to Lord Clark’s words that: I do not blame the petitioners for not raising proceedings or seeking arbitration whilst that important and potentially crucial alternative <b>[of reconstruction]</b> was available and was actively being facilitated by the SPFL<br /><br />We promised our supporters that we would fight for them and we shall continue to do so. Neither club will be making any further comment today</p>

  <p><b>[Hearts and Partick Thistle say promoted trio risk further division by asking clubs to help with legal bills]</b> As a matter of urgency, we would like to clarify our position alongside Heart of Midlothian in relation to the role being played by Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers in our case against the SPFL. Those clubs were named in the Petition, along with Stranraer, because they are the clubs most likely to be impacted by a decision in our favour. We are not, and have never been, in direct dispute with them<br /><br />The SPFL is opposing our Petition and will do so at the forthcoming arbitration. Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers were not therefore required to litigate or arbitrate against us. However, they chose to do so. For the avoidance of doubt, we accept that was a choice they were fully entitled to make, no doubt having been fully advised of the risks and costs. We absolutely know and understand that was not a decision to be taken lightly<br /><br />This is not about two clubs, Hearts and Partick Thistle, battling against other member clubs. This is about these two clubs battling against the organisation, which is meant to look after all of our interests, and holding them accountable for their prejudicial actions. We would contend that any club in our position would be taking similar action<br /><br />However, encouraging clubs to fund anyone’s costs in this process could create further division. We consider such an approach to be at odds with the fundamental requirement of the SPFL rules that the SPFL and each club shall behave towards each other with the utmost good faith. We cannot therefore let that pass without comment</p>

  <p><b>[Scottish FA charges Hearts and Partick Thistle over legal action]</b> We are incredulous to have received a Notice of Complaint from the SFA in the circumstances. It is oppressive of them to require submissions from both clubs by 20 July when we are, in terms of their own articles of association, actively engaged in arbitration. As our focus must be squarely on that, we have already requested the SFA to review the timing to allow us to be properly prepared and represented. That is the very least we should expect from the process</p>
