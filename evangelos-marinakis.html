  <p><b>[The City Ground has not undergone a major development since 1994]</b> The City Ground has iconic history and memories for our supporters and these legacies were fundamental in our decision for us to remain on the banks of the River Trent and not relocating to an alternative site. This is our home and we will remain here forever. This investment is about our club and the city of Nottingham, and we are all committed together to deliver a place that we will all feel proud of, the new City Ground, our home forever.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> issue statement after <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> owner tests positive for coronavirus]</b> Mr Marinakis was diagnosed after showing the first symptoms on his return to Greece yesterday afternoon. During his short stay in Nottingham last week he did not show any symptoms of the virus. The club are seeking advice from medical professionals and the relevant governing bodies to ensure the correct measures are taken. Until this time the club will be making no further comment</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> Owner Evangelos Marinakis revealed he has contracted the coronavirus]</b> The recent virus has ‘visited’ me and I felt obliged to let the public know. I feel good as I take all the necessary measures and I (adhere) to the doctors’ instructions. I strongly advise all my fellow citizens to do the same. I wish all a quick recovery</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> owner Evangelos Marinakis had tested positive for the virus. <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> statement published on the club’s website read]</b> Our position is that the trip poses an unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times. Our concern is also for our opponents, whose players and staff have today been tested, and will now be expected to play their part in an important fixture, under the difficult and challenging circumstances of their owner suffering with the virus. There is also disappointment that the match will be played without home and away supporters, as that is part of what makes European competition so special, as well as the fact our fans have already contended with similar obstacles on our Europa League journey already this season. We believe that there are some things that are more important than football, and that the good health of our pack and the general public is one of them. However, we respect the decision of <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and the integrity of the competition, and we will travel tomorrow to Greece to play the fixture. We hope that our request to <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>, and our acceptance of their decision, can act as the catalyst for them to consider alternative options moving forwards, as this will not be the last fixture to be affected by coronavirus</p>
