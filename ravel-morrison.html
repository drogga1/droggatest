  <p><b>[Ravel Morrison is looking to rebuild his career in Sweden ahead of his anticipated move to Ostersund]</b> I’ve come here to rebuild myself. I want to enjoy it and enjoy football again and win everything we can. It’s exciting and I’m really looking forward to everything that’s in front of me. We have got a decent team, it’s a decent setup, I have met all of the group and it has been nice. I’m just a young, humble person from Manchester. I’m hoping to do the best I can. I have been at West Ham, Manchester United, Lazio. Obviously the English sides for me are the best. I was also in Mexico last season and loved every moment. Now I’m with you guys. This team beat my team as well, it wasn’t a great day when it happened being an Arsenal fan, because I wasn’t linked with you then, but now it is all about thinking positive and looking forward to this new chapter.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard have become talismanic figures at Manchester United]</b> I’m in touch with Paul and I speak to Jesse all the time. They’re doing great. I’m not going to turn around and think: ‘That could have been me. That should have been me’. Stuff happens. They’re happy, I’m happy for them. I’m not going to be a spiteful or negative person. Life’s too short for that.<br /><br />Steven Gerrard’s a legend in football and he was willing to sit down and have a really good conversation. Certain old-school managers wouldn’t have done that. My agent spoke to another manager, in the Championship, who just said ‘No, he won’t fit in here’. It’s just excuses. Too many managers say no because they have a bad image of me from things from 10 years ago<br /><br />It just felt like everyone at Lazio was there for themselves. I played a bit the first year. The second year was a joke. We had cup games where players who were 37/38 were getting picked ahead of me. If you’re there and you’re not playing, it’s very lonely place. It was difficult. At one stage my mum was very ill and they wouldn’t let me fly home or, if I did, I had to be back the next day. I could have understood if I was playing, but I was nowhere near the team. It upset me. I felt like giving up</p>

  <p><b>[What ever happened to Ravel Morrison?]</b> I didn’t even know what I did was so wrong. I didn’t know witness intimidation was a thing<br /><br />I didn’t need to get away from Manchester. There were times when I did something wrong, but often it was just wrong time, wrong place, wrong crowd and it wasn’t even me doing something, but because I was there, it was easy to point a finger at me<br /><br />I’ve come here to rebuild myself. I want to enjoy it and enjoy football again and win everything we can. It’s exciting and I’m really looking forward to everything that’s in front of me<br /><br />I’ve learned that football can take you places you never thought possible. You have to enjoy the ride - sometimes it’s easy, sometimes it’s hard, but I’ve decided to enjoy my time with Ostersund</p>

It’s exciting, I can’t wait to get back <b>[to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> - being in England, it’s great. It’s a great bunch of lads <b>[here]</b> and they’ve all got great ability as well. And the gaffer - he’s a great gaffer. I could tell when I went over to Portugal with the team that everyone is together. It’s a great team.

  <p><b>[Ravel Morrison has admitted he would change a lot of things about his <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> career after being praised by <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a>]</b> Obviously amazing comments. Especially for the player that he is, he’s probably one of the best to come out of England, so it’s high comments from a high player. It makes you a bit upset that I could have gone a bit further. I should have gone a bit further. I’m hoping still to go a bit further. But to the likes of <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and Jesse <b>[<a href="jesse-lingard.html">Lingard</a>]</b>; I think both great players. I think we had a great team, <b>[born]</b> around the 92s and 93s, that area of our year. I knew I had ability, but I didn’t realise and understand… obviously these are high players and I didn’t understand their thoughts at the time. I used to just go there and love playing football. I wouldn’t say I struggled with pressure because I didn’t really feel the pressure. Maybe some things in my life, when I was young, now I would sit there and not do things or go a different path and stuff like that. Going into <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> was a nice environment to go into every day, world-class players, just enjoyable. If I could go back through my life again there would be a lot of things I’d change. I grew up at United, I was there from the Under-9s. I’d skip training some days, and I would wake up and don’t know why I’d done it, but I’d skip it. And it’s hard to get me off the training field now</p>
