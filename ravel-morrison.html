Chris Wilder says Former Manchester United academy star Ravel Morrison is training with Sheffield United and could be a good fit for the newly-promoted Premier League club</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sheffield United have announced the signing of Ravel Morrison, with the former Manchester United youth player signing a one-year deal with the option to extend for a further year after having impressed during a pre-season trial]</b> It’s great to be back in England now and get my career kick-started again. It’s exciting, I can’t wait to get back <b>[to the Premier League]</b> – being in England, it’s great. It’s a great bunch of lads <b>[here]</b> and they’ve all got great ability as well. And the gaffer – he’s a great gaffer. I could tell when I went over to Portugal with the team that everyone is together. It’s a great team. It was an easy decision to make – it’s the Premier League with a good team and also a great manager</p>

Ian Holloway wants his former player Ravel Morrison to forget his Manchester United past as he is granted a Premier League chance at Sheffield United.</p>

<h4 id="2020-05-04-retrieve">2020 05 04 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ravel Morrison has admitted he would change a lot of things about his <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> career after being praised by Wayne Rooney]</b> Obviously amazing comments. Especially for the player that he is, he’s probably one of the best to come out of England, so it’s high comments from a high player. It makes you a bit upset that I could have gone a bit further. I should have gone a bit further. I’m hoping still to go a bit further. But to the likes of <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and Jesse <b>[Lingard]</b>; I think both great players. I think we had a great team, <b>[born]</b> around the 92s and 93s, that area of our year. I knew I had ability, but I didn’t realise and understand… obviously these are high players and I didn’t understand their thoughts at the time. I used to just go there and love playing football. I wouldn’t say I struggled with pressure because I didn’t really feel the pressure. Maybe some things in my life, when I was young, now I would sit there and not do things or go a different path and stuff like that. Going into <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> was a nice environment to go into every day, world-class players, just enjoyable. If I could go back through my life again there would be a lot of things I’d change. I grew up at United, I was there from the Under-9s. I’d skip training some days, and I would wake up and don’t know why I’d done it, but I’d skip it. And it’s hard to get me off the training field now</p>
