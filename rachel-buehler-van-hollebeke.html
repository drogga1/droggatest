<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Rachel Buehler Van Hollebeke, the 113-times capped USA defender, who surprisingly announced her retirement when she was just 29]</b> When I look at my pictures and think back about my career, I am overcome with emotion. I fell in love with the game when I was just a little kid, playing soccer in the backyard with the neighbourhood boys. As the youngest, and a girl, I quickly learned to be fearless and aggressive. These same characteristics set me apart as a player and earned me my beloved nickname, ‘The Buehldozer’. I still love the game and I always will, but the time has come where I am ready for other things. At the end of this 2015 NWSL season, I will be retiring. The decision was primarily driven by my desire to follow another one of my childhood dreams: to go to medical school and become a doctor. My father was a cardio thoracic surgeon. Not many kids grow up watching heart surgery videos, but I vividly remember sitting on the living room floor with my dad, mesmerised by the magical, beating mass on the TV screen. Influences from my father and my experiences with two torn ACLs in high school helped solidify my interest in medicine. I was pre-med at Stanford and when I graduated in 2007 I thought medical school was going to be my next step. Then, in 2008, things changed. The new U.S. coach, <a href="pia-sundhage.html">Pia Sundhage</a>, called me into camp. I made it onto the 2008 Olympic team, and after that soccer really took off for me</p>
