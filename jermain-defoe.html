He’s a fantastic player and I think a credit to the game<br /><br />If you talk about someone that’s done everything in a game and to still want to play and still have another challenge and still want to achieve something, when you’ve achieved so much, I think that’s a special person. He’s someone that I look up to, a legend in the game<br /><br /><b>[c is on the brink of surpassing <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a>’s goal tally for England, with both on 17]</b> Sorry Becks but I think I’ll do it. One more goal. It would be nice, not because of overtaking people, but it’s always nice to score goals for your country. It’s something that I’ve always wanted to do and then, when you do it, it’s the best thing in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Jermain Defoe explains role new pal Drake played in his Toronto FC transfer]</b> One night I was out at night in London having dinner and this number came up on my phone. It was Drake. You can imagine what that was like, it was quite surreal to be honest. He just said it is a fantastic city and that I would enjoy it. That the fans are amazing and there is a great sports scene – not just football but also other sports.<br /><br />He just told me that if I came here the people would love me and that my family would enjoy it. He also said he would look forward to meeting me and showing me the city. It was a special phone call and I appreciated that<br /><br />As a musician, Drake is someone who is up there with the greatest in the world. He is special and has a natural gift from God. He is a special person and I respect him highly. I actually met Drake about two years ago in London and at the time I was like a little kid with him because I love and appreciate his music.</p>

  <p><b>[Jermain Defoe speaks about Bradley Lowery, the young Sunderland fan who died of cancer aged six in July]</b> He was my best friend. It was genuine. He loved his football. He loved me. I loved him. There was nothing I could give him apart from just being a friend. Even towards the end when he was struggling, and I’d walk into the room, he would just jump up, and his mom said, ‘He’s not moved all day!’ So for me that’s how I saw him, it was a special feeling</p>

  <p><b>[Jermain Defoe has refused to rule out a return to MLS]</b> I definitely wouldn’t rule it out because when I was there, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed going to different places, places I’d never been before. But even when I was there, each team we played, I always felt like there were a few players that could probably go on and play at some level in Europe. I think the standard is improving. I think when David Beckham went there, it <b>[the standard]</b> was probably nowhere near what it is now. It’s definitely a league that’s improving. I watch the games and there are some quality teams and all the stadiums are full now<br /><br />I think maybe <b>[I went to the MLS too soon]</b>. It just made sense at the time because it was a good deal for both parties. For me going to another league, a new challenge, a club that had massive changes … I knew the manager, Toronto is an amazing city and I looked at it and thought, David Beckham went there, Robbie Keane went there, other players. I thought this could be good, a new chapter in my life. And, to be honest, I enjoyed it. My first game was against Seattle away. We left on the Thursday night, played on the Saturday, came back on the Sunday. That was strange. Five hours for one game, but there were something like 50,000 people at the first game, so it was like, ‘wow, this is different’. But it was good</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney is a special player]</b> What a guy and what a player. What he has done throughout his career, for club and country, he has been a special player since day one when he burst onto the scene at Everton. I think it will be a really special moment. I would like to go to see it because away from the football side, he is such a nice guy. I spent a lot of time with him with England, getting to know him, and he’s a lovely man. He deserves everything he gets. Knowing Wayne, he’ll go back into that squad a little bit nervous. He will want to impress people in training, that’s what he is like, he loves his football. The boys will love to see him and if I was one of those young forwards, I would be thinking ‘if I can achieve even half <b>[of what Rooney has achieved]</b>, then it’s special’. With players like that, you have to be a sponge, you have to think ‘I am going to get a little bit from that.</p>

  <p><b>[Jermain Defoe says <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> is going to be a top, top, top manager]</b> I have to give a shout out to my current manager, Mr <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>. He’s going to be a top, top, top manager. It’s a funny one because when I signed for Rangers, obviously you have a bit of banter in the changing room and the lads saying about how I’m pals with the gaffer and stuff like that, but he’s a natural. In terms of management he’s still fresh and he’s new but you can see that naturally he’s got everything. He always says to the players, ‘if you want to come speak to me about anything then my door is open’.<br /><br />He’s approachable, which is really important as a manager. Sometimes there’s stuff you want to talk about and you might have personal problems and you might have stuff you want to talk about but feel uncomfortable going to the manager. But with Steven, you can talk to him about anything. He reminds me a little bit of <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> and <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Sam Allardyce</a> where you can just approach them and speak about anything<br /><br />You don’t really expect to experience anything like this in your lifetime. Everyone has got to stick together and I want to give a big shout out, a thank you, to the NHS; to the doctors, the nurses, the ambulance drivers, the care workers … because this is an immense challenge. It’s something we’ve never faced before so I just want to pay respects to those people because they are the heroes in this. I can only imagine what it is like day in, day out having to deal with the people coming into hospitals every day. I’ve always respected the NHS; but my experiences when my dad wasn’t well a few years back, and obviously the stuff I went through with Bradley <b>[Lowery]</b>, you see it first-hand. I remember going in to see my dad at the hospital and I remember speaking to the doctors and nurses and seeing how they work day in, day out; I was looking at the nurses thinking, ‘wow, I saw you yesterday, you were here all day yesterday and now you’re back here first thing the next day’. I’ve always known the work they always put in, but with the situation like this it’s gone to another level</p>

  <p><b>[Jermain Defoe has described his decision to hand in a transfer request at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> in 2003 as a massive regret]</b> When I look back at it now, I think I was maybe naive at the time. It felt like I was at school knocking on the headmaster’s door. If I saw someone do that now I’d be like, ‘Wow, that’s strange, you shouldn’t do that’. As a young player, you should never ask to leave the football club and hand in a transfer request. I didn’t even know about transfer requests then. I spoke to my agent at the time. He basically said to me and my family, this is something you need to do because you want to be playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and if you hand in a transfer request it gives you a better chance to leave the club. I should have turned around and asked more questions like, ‘Do I really need to do this?’ because if someone wanted me they’d come and get me. Of course it was a massive regret. It’s honesty from the heart, but I just didn’t know what I was doing at the time. I felt like I was on my own. All the stick that I got after was about me, not the agent or anyone else. In the paper is my face on a rat. Previous to that, everything in the back pages is of me scoring goals and it was all nice and good, but all of a sudden you’re dealing with this and it’s something completely different for me<br /><br /><b>[When asked how he reacted after being told by his agent that <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> were chasing his signature]</b> I was like, ‘Wow, really?’ I was chuffed that a massive football club like <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> wanted me. It’d be big going to a different league; I’ve always been confident and always felt like if I go there I’d go there and score goals. But I wanted to go back to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. I didn’t want to leave there in the first place, so of course, I want to go back home</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers striker Jermain Defoe has said club-mate <a href="alfredo-morelos.html">Alfredo Morelos</a> has the potential to play at the highest level]</b> He’s really impressed me - he’s a natural goalscorer - I think people need to understand that he is still young. He has made mistakes, but he is still young, he is still learning. He has impressed me. I feel like this season, particularly the first part of the season, he improved a lot. His link up play, he was keeping the ball for us, scoring goals and just his all-round game had improved so much. Even away from that, he is funny in the changing room, as you can imagine, he’s a character. He is a nice guy. It is difficult for him because he is Colombian, his family are not here. He is here with his wife and sometimes she goes back and sees her family so sometimes he is just here on his own and it is really difficult for Alfredo and obviously we try and help him because he is a young lad, but he is a top, top player, a natural goalscorer<br /><br />I feel like he would need to be in the right team - a team that creates chances because I believe that if he gets chances at any level I believe he can score. He has got that arrogance that he believes that he can score in every game</p>
