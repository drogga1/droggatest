Even with the speculation about West Ham, it’s always nice when you’re wanted. But the end of the day, I’ve been a part of this game for a long time and that’s part and parcel of it now.

  <p><b>[Jermain Defoe optimistic about England chances]</b> I feel like I should have been involved last season if it’s based on merit and stats - on who’s scoring goals. I was in the England squad for like 10 years, and probably most of that time I was at Tottenham scoring goals. There were times where I wasn’t even playing but I was still in the squad because of the goals I scored before. So I don’t know. I’ve always been a positive person, but there comes a time where you think: ‘Is it really going to happen?’. All I can do is keep playing well. The English fans - I read some nice stuff on social media and in the press too. So for me it’s a nice feeling that people want me back into the squad. At the end of the day it’s up to the manager so we’ll see</p>

  <p><b>[Jermain Defoe is going vegan in order to give himself the best chance possible of prolonging his career at the top level]</b> I’m trying to turn vegan but it’s a funny one. When I go to my mum’s she’s got every meat you can imagine out on the table. My girlfriend said to me you’ve got to do it. She puts on these documentaries. It’s always nice when you’ve got someone around you helping you, driving you on and wanting you to do well. It’s not easy but I feel good so I continue to do it. I eat a lot of fish and that but I’m trying!.<br /><br />It’s down to me. I’ll go back to my club and have a good finish to the season. We’ve got some important games. I know the goals are needed. It’s important I get my head down, keep working hard and just do what I’ve been doing. We’ll see what happens<br /><br />I never give up but in my mind I was trying to be realistic. There were times when I thought with the previous manager that I didn’t really feel like I was getting an opportunity. There were times I was scoring goals, especially last season. Obviously I wasn’t selected for the Euros and I felt like I finished the season strong. In my heart I felt I’d done enough to be involved, to have the opportunity to play with this sort of quality. All these things play on the back of my mind because I love playing football, I love playing for my country, I still think about it. In a way it keeps the fire in your belly. I’ve never been one of those people who want something given to me on a plate. I want to work hard for it. When I have great moments it helps me feel good, I feel proud. Never once I did I think I was going to retire from international football. I’ve worked so hard and I still feel sharp. I just always felt if I do get selected I feel like I can still score goals at this level<br /><br /><b>[Where did he find out he hadn’t made the 23 for the plane to France?]</b> On the telly. Gareth phoned me and said even if you weren’t in the squad I’d still phone you. As players, you appreciate that. You have a conversation with the manager and you understand. You think maybe if I do this then I can get in the next squad<br /><br />The demands of the players are so high with the intensity of the games these days. For me the key thing is the recovery - how you recover after the games to give yourself the best opportunity to perform in the next game. I seem to have got that to a tee. There are a lot of things I do away from training, away from playing that helps me to perform on match day. The sharpness comes with games but in terms of fitness, fatiguing towards the end of games, I still feel good. I think I’ve got a better understanding of my body now. When I’m at the club I know what days I need to have a rest day. Everyone knows I do a lot of cryotherapy. When I get in that ice bath I don’t want to do it, at the weekend you get rewarded. It’s hard but in a way it’s easy.<br /><br />It’s just doing things that aren’t enjoyable but you try and do it like you’re loving it. When you play - everyone wants to play but everyone wants to feel fresh in the game - there’s no better feeling. I’m trying to tick every box. I still wake up in the morning and look forward to training. The buzz is still there. I just want to try and play for as long as I can. My mum always said it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish. Years later I’m back in the squad at 34, scoring goals for my country again and I’m just delighted</p>

Two and a bit years at Sunderland, I enjoyed my time there, it’s not nice when you get relegated, I don’t think its fair on the Sunderland fans to come out so soon after they’ve been relegated and say ‘yeah, I’m signing for someone else’. It’s too soon to put it out there. At the right time, I would like to say ‘this is the club I’ll be playing for.</p>

He insisted on having a party and he invited his cousins and girlfriend Poppy yesterday. They all laid on the bed having cuddles. I think it was his way of saying his goodbyes. Late last night his best friend Jermain came to visit him and it was so heartwarming seeing how Bradley reacted. He was so happy and laid for ages getting cuddles. Bradley was really relaxed with him.<br /><br />The relationship I’ve managed to develop with Bradley and what I’ve brought to his life and what he’s brought to mine has been really special.

  <p><b>[Jermain Defoe has refused to rule out a return to MLS]</b> I definitely wouldn’t rule it out because when I was there, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed going to different places, places I’d never been before. But even when I was there, each team we played, I always felt like there were a few players that could probably go on and play at some level in Europe. I think the standard is improving. I think when David Beckham went there, it <b>[the standard]</b> was probably nowhere near what it is now. It’s definitely a league that’s improving. I watch the games and there are some quality teams and all the stadiums are full now<br /><br />I think maybe <b>[I went to the MLS too soon]</b>. It just made sense at the time because it was a good deal for both parties. For me going to another league, a new challenge, a club that had massive changes … I knew the manager, Toronto is an amazing city and I looked at it and thought, David Beckham went there, Robbie Keane went there, other players. I thought this could be good, a new chapter in my life. And, to be honest, I enjoyed it. My first game was against Seattle away. We left on the Thursday night, played on the Saturday, came back on the Sunday. That was strange. Five hours for one game, but there were something like 50,000 people at the first game, so it was like, ‘wow, this is different’. But it was good</p>

What he has done throughout his career, for club and country, he has been a special player since day one when he burst onto the scene at Everton. I think it will be a really special moment. I would like to go to see it because away from the football side, he is such a nice guy. I spent a lot of time with him with England, getting to know him, and he’s a lovely man. He deserves everything he gets. Knowing Wayne, he’ll go back into that squad a little bit nervous. He will want to impress people in training, that’s what he is like, he loves his football. The boys will love to see him and if I was one of those young forwards, I would be thinking ‘if I can achieve even half <b>[of what Rooney has achieved]</b>, then it’s special’. With players like that, you have to be a sponge, you have to think ‘I am going to get a little bit from that.</p>

  <p><b>[Jermain Defoe says <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> is going to be a top, top, top manager]</b> I have to give a shout out to my current manager, Mr <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>. He’s going to be a top, top, top manager. It’s a funny one because when I signed for Rangers, obviously you have a bit of banter in the changing room and the lads saying about how I’m pals with the gaffer and stuff like that, but he’s a natural. In terms of management he’s still fresh and he’s new but you can see that naturally he’s got everything. He always says to the players, ‘if you want to come speak to me about anything then my door is open’.<br /><br />He’s approachable, which is really important as a manager. Sometimes there’s stuff you want to talk about and you might have personal problems and you might have stuff you want to talk about but feel uncomfortable going to the manager. But with Steven, you can talk to him about anything. He reminds me a little bit of <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> and <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Sam Allardyce</a> where you can just approach them and speak about anything<br /><br />You don’t really expect to experience anything like this in your lifetime. Everyone has got to stick together and I want to give a big shout out, a thank you, to the NHS; to the doctors, the nurses, the ambulance drivers, the care workers … because this is an immense challenge. It’s something we’ve never faced before so I just want to pay respects to those people because they are the heroes in this. I can only imagine what it is like day in, day out having to deal with the people coming into hospitals every day. I’ve always respected the NHS; but my experiences when my dad wasn’t well a few years back, and obviously the stuff I went through with Bradley <b>[Lowery]</b>, you see it first-hand. I remember going in to see my dad at the hospital and I remember speaking to the doctors and nurses and seeing how they work day in, day out; I was looking at the nurses thinking, ‘wow, I saw you yesterday, you were here all day yesterday and now you’re back here first thing the next day’. I’ve always known the work they always put in, but with the situation like this it’s gone to another level</p>

  <p><b>[Jermain Defoe has described his decision to hand in a transfer request at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> in 2003 as a massive regret]</b> When I look back at it now, I think I was maybe naive at the time. It felt like I was at school knocking on the headmaster’s door. If I saw someone do that now I’d be like, ‘Wow, that’s strange, you shouldn’t do that’. As a young player, you should never ask to leave the football club and hand in a transfer request. I didn’t even know about transfer requests then. I spoke to my agent at the time. He basically said to me and my family, this is something you need to do because you want to be playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and if you hand in a transfer request it gives you a better chance to leave the club. I should have turned around and asked more questions like, ‘Do I really need to do this?’ because if someone wanted me they’d come and get me. Of course it was a massive regret. It’s honesty from the heart, but I just didn’t know what I was doing at the time. I felt like I was on my own. All the stick that I got after was about me, not the agent or anyone else. In the paper is my face on a rat. Previous to that, everything in the back pages is of me scoring goals and it was all nice and good, but all of a sudden you’re dealing with this and it’s something completely different for me<br /><br /><b>[When asked how he reacted after being told by his agent that <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> were chasing his signature]</b> I was like, ‘Wow, really?’ I was chuffed that a massive football club like <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> wanted me. It’d be big going to a different league; I’ve always been confident and always felt like if I go there I’d go there and score goals. But I wanted to go back to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. I didn’t want to leave there in the first place, so of course, I want to go back home</p>

He has made mistakes, but he is still young, he is still learning. He has impressed me. I feel like this season, particularly the first part of the season, he improved a lot. His link up play, he was keeping the ball for us, scoring goals and just his all-round game had improved so much. Even away from that, he is funny in the changing room, as you can imagine, he’s a character. He is a nice guy. It is difficult for him because he is Colombian, his family are not here. He is here with his wife and sometimes she goes back and sees her family so sometimes he is just here on his own and it is really difficult for Alfredo and obviously we try and help him because he is a young lad, but he is a top, top player, a natural goalscorer<br /><br />I feel like he would need to be in the right team - a team that creates chances because I believe that if he gets chances at any level I believe he can score. He has got that arrogance that he believes that he can score in every game</p>
