  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen is not for sale despite reported interest from <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> and complaints over a lack of game time. When asked if he would leave in January, Christensen]</b> Difficult question. No, I don’t think so. Things are different from last season. I played a lot of games <b>[last season]</b> but this season it hasn’t been like that. It’s always difficult for a player but we’ll see what happens.</p>

  <p><b>[Andreas Christensen is no longer considering a move away from Chelsea]</b> I’m not wondering about my future now and I haven’t done that for some time. I’m happy to be in London and, with the way the season has evolved, there’s no reason to think about it anymore. I’m only 23, so it’s probably very wise to stay. It’s nice that there is peace and quiet and I can concentrate on playing football. I have always been happy but there have been times when I wanted to play more. If I can play as much in the future as I have done in the spring, then that’s fine. The end of the season has really been as good as it could. I got a lot of playing time and we ended up winning a trophy, so it couldn’t be better.</p>

  <p><b>[Andreas Christensen says <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a>’s injury has presented <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boss <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> with a selection poser up front. <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a> and <a href="michy-batshuayi.html">Michy Batshuayi</a> are more than capable of providing cover]</b> We have two other strikers who are more than capable of going on the pitch and being at that level. I didn’t actually see what happened to Tammy, but hopefully he is not too bad. The other two are more than capable of playing their part. I have been training a lot with them. I’ve been injured, but been preparing to come back into the team as they have as well. I think you’re going to see, whoever plays, that they’re very eager to come back. They know it’s their time to shine. We are all looking sharp and that’s why we can press like we do in every game<br /><br />We wanted to have a little bit more control at the end. But we hung in there and got a good result in a difficult place. Now it is up to ourselves at home to go through. I think we can be happy with that situation even though we wanted to finish it off here. Qualification would be massive for us. We look at ourselves as a team that belongs in the Champions League. That was the message before the game and was why we wanted to finish it off. We don’t want to wait but we had in our minds if it was tight at the end, we didn’t want to do anything stupid because we fancy ourselves at home. We will just look at ourselves</p>
