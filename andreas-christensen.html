  <p><b>[Defender Andreas Christensen, back from a loan spell at Borussia Monchengladbach, also echoed Kante’s thoughts and bemoaned their poor start to the game]</b> The second half was a little bit better from our side. We got a difficult start but I enjoyed it as it was good atmosphere. It’s just a game. We all had to enjoy it and work on our fitness and get some things in the squad. The team can’t do better than what we are doing right now. We just have to keep working hard and we have to keep doing that.</p>

  <p><b>[Christensen’s father, Sten, was a goalkeeper for Brondby. He has described watching his son progress, over a two-year stint at Borussia Monchengladbach, into a better footballer than he ever was]</b> The two years he has spent there he has been fantastic. His development has been huge. I think this is the best move he has even done. In the first year, nobody thought he would play that much - me, Andreas, Chelsea or Gladbach. We thought he might get around 15 games or so to try to get used to German football, but he played a lot. The first and second years were great. He played with a lot of good young players for Gladbach. <b>[Club director]</b> Max Eberl was great with him. I will miss going there a lot and so will he. Max very much wanted him to stay, but the loan deal ended and he will go back. Whatever happens, it is important for Andreas to play, he is not content with the b.</p>

  <p><b>[Sten admits that he told a lie to get his son into Birkerod, a youth team in Copenhagen, after watching him with a ball glued to his feet from an early age]</b> He has been playing football since he was two years old, he was always kicking. He loved kicking the ball in the small goals. From an early age he always had a ball at his feet. Even today when we are talking or eating, he has a football between his legs. He has been like that since he was two years old. He started football when he was four and we had to lie a little bit about his age because in Denmark, you can’t start to play until you are five.<br /><br />So we told people at his first club that he was five years old, when he was only four. Then he started at a little club in Nordsjælland. When Andreas was 10 years old, he asked me if it was okay to join Brondby to train out there at a higher level<br /><br />So I said yes, you can go out there. We took him there to play and one of the coaches there, John Ranum, he said, ‘Okay, we see Andreas as a six but we would need to teach him to defend so we can put him down as a centre back so he can defend a bit more’. When he was very young he played as a striker, a right winger and he also played left-back. He can still play in a lot of positions. His strength is in reading the game. He got good at it quickly and that was it<br /><br />When he was 15 years old, Aston Villa spotted him first in Holland, when he was playing in a tournament down there. One of the most important things about Andreas is that he is a team player and he always found room for his friends and he has never had an attitude. He is very calm. Andreas just wants to be on the pitch playing. That’s his sole motivation. He doesn’t need to be in the newspapers, he rarely wants to speak with the press. He just wants to play football because he loves it so much</p>

  <p><b>[Andreas Christensen admits to having sought the advice of John Terry]</b> I try to keep it inside the club and not bring it home with me. My team-mates have also seen all my other performances, so they know that these mistakes aren’t typical for me. I have had a small talk with John Terry, he has also experienced setbacks, and it is always nice to talk to someone watching it from the outside and to learn that they have experienced the same. He told me that it is natural to make mistakes. And he tried to put it in perspective for me saying that if a forward misses a chance he can make it good again by scoring when he gets the next opportunity, but we can’t change a goal scored against us. So when we make mistakes it is more crucial and it is easy to point fingers at. I have realised it, looked at it and now I have moved on.<br /><br />You just want to move on to the next match so that you can play a match without mistakes. I can’t avoid making mistakes, but in some games the mistakes have been decisive, so now I am just waiting for the next games to come, so I can prove that the mistakes aren’t typical for me<br /><br />I thought about it after making two mistakes in two matches, that I might be out of the next one. But I try to tell myself that before these matches I have played all the other ones almost with no mistakes at all. I hope that is the reason that I get to start, because he knows that - besides the last couple of matches - he can trust me, I haven’t made any mistakes, but been very solid for a long period. I am focusing on all the good games I have played this season</p>

  <p><b>[Andreas Christensen has admitted he is not happy with his current form]</b> It’s been a difficult time recently but I’m happy with the overall season. It is easy to just look at the recent games, but I try to remember I played probably 25-30 games with no mistakes at all before that. Everyone knows you can’t go through a whole season not making a mistake, as a defender - it is impossible. That’s the bad part about our job - when there’s a good chance you’re the one getting pointed at, but you still have to take responsibility next time you get the ball and do what’s best for the team. It helped when you’ve got good team-mates who take care of you and a manager who believes in you. That’s only made things more comfortable for me, and now I want to progress even more.<br /><br />The first season I was at Borussia Monchengladbach, we lost the first five games and didn’t get a single point. After the first game, I didn’t play for the next four, but I came into the team again and, and although I made some mistakes, I overcame them and we won something like 15 games in a row after that bad run. We went from last place to third in that period, so I know anything can happen in football and that’s why it is such a great game. Things can change very quickly</p>

  <p><b>[Andreas Christensen is aware the pressure will be on Denmark for their final group game against France following a controversial draw with Australia]</b> Obviously, if you told us that today we would have four points from two games then it wouldn’t be too bad. Especially depending how the other games go. But I think after we won the first one we just really wanted to go into this game and win, to make it look even better than it does now. To make it feel like a little less pressure against France in the last game. We are a little bit disappointed by that but in total having four points from two games, things could be worse. After the first game, we said we can play much better than this, but again we were happy that we scored. Today we couldn’t get a better start but we know we can play better. Hopefully at one point in this World Cup, we will find in our best form.<br /><br />It means a lot <b>[to play at the World Cup for Denmark]</b>. Every time I represent my country it is something big and it is something I dreamed about when I was growing up playing football so it is a massive achievement</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen admits he will have to consider his future options at some stage]</b> Right now, it’s not a good season for me, but I have to find some way to get back on. How? I do not know, but it’s up to me to figure that out. But right now it looks hard. We have good results and we play super football, which only makes it harder. It’s hard for me personally, but for the team it looks great<br /><br />I cannot show so much patience again. I’m 22 years old and I really want to play. In the last three seasons I’ve played a big role for the teams I have been with, so it’s clear that I cannot see myself staying if my current situation continues in the future. It’s too early to talk about change for now, and when that might happen, but it’s clear that this is not a good situation for me</p>

It’s always difficult for a player but we’ll see what happens.<br /><br />It’s a difficult question. I think if you asked every player that’s not playing if they are happy, they are going to say ‘no’. Everyone wants to play. I can’t do anything else but go back there, train and do my best. Every time I get an opportunity, I have to do well and perform well and show him <b>[Sarri]</b> that he can count on me. You don’t want to sit around and wait for it, you want to play. Not playing isn’t fun and it’s a different situation from last season</p>

  <p><b>[Andreas Christensen admits to having had doubts about his Chelsea future]</b> At the moment there’s two clear first choices, and then there’s me. I just have to show that I’m ready and take the chance when I get it. There was a lot of talk <b>[over a January move]</b> but it was quickly made clear that the club still saw me as someone who would play. Of course that’s really nice to hear so I just have to keep proving myself. I think I’ve been good the last few times I’ve got the chance and then I can only hope that I’ll be selected more often.<br /><br />Obviously I had a lot of doubts. But once the club assured me I am needed, it really wasn’t that hard for me to accept. I’ve been in the club for many years and I still love being here. It’s solely because of the playing time that the transfer consideration started. But I’m looking forward and I’ve come to terms with the situation</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard may remain in Real Madrid’s sights]</b> The situation I have ended up in has been very difficult to accept. The messages we have received are that Chelsea cannot appeal the case and therefore want to keep all the players.

Now I have played the matches in the Europa League and hope it will continue as long as we are in the tournament</p>

I’ve said I’d like to say, but they haven’t said I’m definitely staying. There’s been no conversation. I’ve said what I want to happen, and that was definitely staying.<br /><br />I wouldn’t play football if I didn’t have a dream or a target. <b>[Being the best in the world while at Chelsea]</b> is still the dream<br /><br />If I’m not playing, you get jealous. You sit there and watch. But we are hungry to play, all of us. Everything we work for, every day… we wake up wanting to get in the team. It makes me more hungry. We’re still young, we know that, but we want to play. It’s always healthy competition in the team. We try to push each other. It’s not fun to be the one playing less, but I’ve been trying to show myself in training. I’ve been quite happy with my performances so far. Healthy competition</p>

  <p><b>[Andreas Christensen is no longer considering a move away from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> I’m not wondering about my future now and I haven’t done that for some time. I’m happy to be in London and, with the way the season has evolved, there’s no reason to think about it anymore. I’m only 23, so it’s probably very wise to stay. It’s nice that there is peace and quiet and I can concentrate on playing football. I have always been happy but there have been times when I wanted to play more. If I can play as much in the future as I have done in the spring, then that’s fine. The end of the season has really been as good as it could. I got a lot of playing time and we ended up winning a trophy, so it couldn’t be better.</p>

I didn’t actually see what happened to Tammy, but hopefully he is not too bad. The other two are more than capable of playing their part. I have been training a lot with them. I’ve been injured, but been preparing to come back into the team as they have as well. I think you’re going to see, whoever plays, that they’re very eager to come back. They know it’s their time to shine. We are all looking sharp and that’s why we can press like we do in every game<br /><br />We wanted to have a little bit more control at the end. But we hung in there and got a good result in a difficult place. Now it is up to ourselves at home to go through. I think we can be happy with that situation even though we wanted to finish it off here. Qualification would be massive for us. We look at ourselves as a team that belongs in the Champions League. That was the message before the game and was why we wanted to finish it off. We don’t want to wait but we had in our minds if it was tight at the end, we didn’t want to do anything stupid because we fancy ourselves at home. We will just look at ourselves</p>
