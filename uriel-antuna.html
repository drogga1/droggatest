  <p><b>[It’s been a strange journey for Antuna. From Santos, where he was trying to win a starting spot to suddenly being snapped up by City Football Group. Then it was the Netherlands on loan, where he earned only limited minutes with Groningen]</b> The truth is that it’s an extra motivation to be at a club like Santos that gives so many opportunities to young players. I’m hoping for this chance, if God wills, to be a starter and become a senior national team player</p>

  <p><b>[The Mexico manager handed hat-trick hero Uriel Antuna a surprise start in Saturday’s 7-0 win over Cuba]</b> Since I scored the second goal, I said, ‘I’m going to go for the third goal. If it comes together great. If not, I don’t care.’ But then I had the nice assist for Alexis, thinking he’s in a better position than I was. I said, ‘Well, it’s your job to play in a team’.<br /><br /><b>[Antuna earned the start largely because Monterrey attacker Rodolfo Pizarro has a muscular injury]</b> I was a bit surprised. I thought it would be Pizarro and at the last minute he said, ‘Pizarro also has a little knock.’ I said, ‘I’m going to take advantage of the chances I’m given’. I was surprised, but also prepared for any moment</p>

  <p><b>[After a standout summer with the Mexico national team and important contributions with the <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, Uriel Antuna is drawing interest from Benfica]</b> My dream is to be with City and fight for a place there. There are world-class players but nothing is impossible, I will fight and try to be in one of the best teams in the world. The new contract is the result of things that I have been doing well, thanks to the effort and sacrifice. Being on the field gives you a lot of experience, a lot of confidence to play, to touch, to work and all those kind of things</p>
