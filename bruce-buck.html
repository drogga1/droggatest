Under his leadership some of the world’s finest brands and companies have joined us and we have announced some record-breaking sponsorships. Christian will continue to work with the club in a transition period until the end of the season. We are very grateful for his contribution and he will always be welcome at Stamford Bridge</p>

  <p><b>[During Michael Emenalo’s time at the club, Chelsea have won the Champions League, three Premier League titles, the Europa League, the FA Cup and the League Cup]</b> It is with regret that the owner and board of directors accepted Michael’s resignation this week. He has had a tremendous impact on the club over the past 10 years and this is evident in everything we have achieved. We are sorry to see him go but understand his desire to move on and explore new challenges.</p>

  <p><b>[Bruce Buck has outlined plans for how Chelsea are pushing to win trophies in a sustainable manner]</b> It is developing, I think that we are all looking to be breaking even, and even be profitable, over the long term, but it is difficult. The reason you have a football team is to win trophies, although there’s not a direct correlation, as winning trophies requires a lot of investment. At Chelsea, we have worked very hard to push the sponsorship model. We have done everything we can to increase our matchday revenues and non-match day revenues at events like this. Most importantly, and we are at a crossroads, we are looking at media and broadcasting. We are looking at the opportunities for the future to really make this club stable and profitable for the long term. Yes, we have central distribution for the main broadcasting revenues, but there’s lots of pieces that we can put together in terms of what’s going on in the world. Disruption media broadcasting <b>[including the likes of DAZN]</b> and looking at other avenues to capitalise on the assets we have. The world is desperate for content. The world is even more desperate for live content. We have that. We are looking at things like Dugout, which you might be aware of, and other things to try to increase the revenue base going forwards.<br /><br />There are 10 or 12 big clubs in Europe right now and I think five to 10 years from now, in round terms, those 10 or 12 clubs will be the big clubs then. The mix in terms of who’s on top, with respect to revenue, performance and trophies, that is up for grabs. The dream in England is, if you support a Conference team, someday you’ll win the Premier League. Financial Fair Play has pluses and minuses. One of the minuses is that dream is not possible. What Chelsea did in 2003, what Man City did five years later, that is virtually impossible under FFP. In terms of competitive balance, which is always viewed in a negative way, I personally believe that, for the development of football, marquee clubs and marquee players are important. It’s important in developing fanbases, encouraging young people to engage in this sport, and it’s also important in terms of the large clubs having the ability to put a lot of money into good causes, which they do. I’m not in favour of dumbing down the large clubs to make all clubs the great unwashed. They’ve done that in the US over the last 20 years and I think it’s been to the detriment, particularly of baseball. I just don’t think it works for the long term. Clubs have to seek their natural position in the football order. No matter where you are in that, you want to improve, but I don’t think we should assume that, because every club is not equal, therefore it’s bad.</p>

Every Chelsea fan in London and around the world loves Eden Hazard, and he’s not only a great footballer but I think he’s a wonderful lad. Let’s see how it goes between now and the end of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea’s player sales reached £113 million last season and have helped the club to achieve a record-high profit]</b> The club has now posted a series of record-breaking revenue figures and our profit margin has increased in consecutive years. This has occurred against a backdrop of varying participation in European football, and different degrees of achievement in the Premier League, which demonstrates we have built a sound business footing to support our on-pitch quest for success. With our matchday income steady, despite not finishing in the top four of the Premier League last season, and our global fanbase increasing, we thank our loyal supporters as well as our hard-working staff and valued partners for helping to make a successful financial year.</p>

  <p><b>[The Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich took control at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> back in 2003 and the Blues’ current chairman says he remains fully committed to his role]</b> I have never heard a word from Abramovich: ‘Let’s get this ready for a sale,’ or something. Because of the political situation, there are people who think they might want to buy <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> at a bargain. We do get inquiries and we really have nothing to say to these people. In terms of being involved, in looking at new players, talking about whether to extend players’ contracts… <b>[he]</b> was always intimately involved in that from day one and is just as intimately involved now<br /><br /><b>[Buck admits as much, saying of the faith <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> has placed in promising academy graduates]</b> I can’t deny that if there wasn’t a transfer ban we might have splurged out on one or two or three players. So, yes, it was some of that; it was <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, the players that were ready, a whole collection of things that resulted in where we are now.<br /><br />It makes Mr Abramovich very happy, because he is very interested in the academy. I would guess he’s one of the very few owners that have been to lots of academy matches<br /><br /><b>[Buck added on the future at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>, with it suggested that planning has been put on hold as stadium construction work is delayed indefinitely and Abramovich stays away]</b> I understand what you are saying and it is hard to disprove it, except to say: ‘Let’s see what happens in the next transfer window.’ The point I am making - it’s a glib one - if we go out in the next window and spend a zillion, it’s pretty hard to argue that things are on hold</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> post £96.6m loss after season out of Champions League]</b> Consistent revenue growth and careful financial management over recent seasons has allowed the club to make significant levels of investment in the playing staff while maintaining compliance with Financial Fair Play regulations. This has contributed to another Europa League victory at the end of the 2018-19 season and a return to the highest level of European competition. This solid commercial foundation, allied to a young and exciting team now led by <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, means that the club is well-placed to sustain its pursuit of success both on and off the pitch, as well as maintain its financial stability over the coming years</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> adopt anti-Semitism definition of IHRA]</b> All our players have been involved in our efforts. This week we unveiled a mural on the West Stand at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>. Adopting this definition is a big moment for this club. It brings clarity to the whole subject of what is anti-Semitic. Everyone will be fully aware of the definition. It’s been adopted by around 35 countries and British Police. We know it’s a long battle … this is a problem that has existed for a long time, the Holocaust is something we have to make sure never happens again. We all have to work at this. In 2017 there were a number of anti-Semitic incidents around the world. It came around, and we wanted to do something about it</p>
