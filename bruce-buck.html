  <p><b>[Chelsea managing director <a href="christian-purslow.html">Purslow</a> steps down]</b> Christian joined us in 2014‎ with the goal of transforming our commercial activities. Under his leadership some of the world’s finest brands and companies have joined us and we have announced some record-breaking sponsorships. Christian will continue to work with the club in a transition period until the end of the season. We are very grateful for his contribution and he will always be welcome at Stamford Bridge</p>

  <p><b>[The Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich took control at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> back in 2003 and the Blues’ current chairman says he remains fully committed to his role]</b> I have never heard a word from Abramovich: ‘Let’s get this ready for a sale,’ or something. Because of the political situation, there are people who think they might want to buy <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> at a bargain. We do get inquiries and we really have nothing to say to these people. In terms of being involved, in looking at new players, talking about whether to extend players’ contracts… <b>[he]</b> was always intimately involved in that from day one and is just as intimately involved now<br /><br /><b>[Buck admits as much, saying of the faith <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> has placed in promising academy graduates]</b> I can’t deny that if there wasn’t a transfer ban we might have splurged out on one or two or three players. So, yes, it was some of that; it was <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, the players that were ready, a whole collection of things that resulted in where we are now.<br /><br />It makes Mr Abramovich very happy, because he is very interested in the academy. I would guess he’s one of the very few owners that have been to lots of academy matches<br /><br /><b>[Buck added on the future at Stamford Bridge, with it suggested that planning has been put on hold as stadium construction work is delayed indefinitely and Abramovich stays away]</b> I understand what you are saying and it is hard to disprove it, except to say: ‘Let’s see what happens in the next transfer window.’ The point I am making - it’s a glib one - if we go out in the next window and spend a zillion, it’s pretty hard to argue that things are on hold</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea post £96.6m loss after season out of Champions League]</b> Consistent revenue growth and careful financial management over recent seasons has allowed the club to make significant levels of investment in the playing staff while maintaining compliance with Financial Fair Play regulations. This has contributed to another Europa League victory at the end of the 2018-19 season and a return to the highest level of European competition. This solid commercial foundation, allied to a young and exciting team now led by <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, means that the club is well-placed to sustain its pursuit of success both on and off the pitch, as well as maintain its financial stability over the coming years</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea adopt anti-Semitism definition of IHRA]</b> All our players have been involved in our efforts. This week we unveiled a mural on the West Stand at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>. Adopting this definition is a big moment for this club. It brings clarity to the whole subject of what is anti-Semitic. Everyone will be fully aware of the definition. It’s been adopted by around 35 countries and British Police. We know it’s a long battle … this is a problem that has existed for a long time, the Holocaust is something we have to make sure never happens again. We all have to work at this. In 2017 there were a number of anti-Semitic incidents around the world. It came around, and we wanted to do something about it</p>

  <p><b>[Coronavirus: <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> inform casual workers they will be paid April wages in full]</b> We are and have always been committed to supporting our communities, especially the vulnerable, and at this time we recognise this is more important than ever. Our owner, Roman Abramovich, has been instrumental in challenging us to find ways to support those in need and after we successfully launched the Refuge campaign and made the Millennium Hotel at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> available to the NHS, this was the priority so I am pleased to see it begin</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Hoffman named as new <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> chair]</b> Gary was the outstanding candidate in an extensive and highly competitive search process, and we believe he will form a strong partnership with our Chief Executive <a href="richard-masters.html">Richard Masters</a>, helping to guide the League while promoting new ideas and strategies. Gary has proved over decades, as an executive and a board leader, that he has the character to steer world-renowned organisations through both good times and crisis situations. At a vital moment in our history, Gary’s knowledge and skills are sure to help us through this very difficult period</p>
