  <p><b>[Reports emerged on Thursday linking Mario Balotelli to the Philadelphia Union]</b> There is not a piece of truth in that story. I don’t know why this is coming up. I never was in touch with him. I never was going for that type of striker. It doesn’t make sense in terms of what we are really looking for.<br /><br />I’m more interested in putting together a real good team for the next season. In terms of strikers, we are looking for young strikers and we are really in good negotiations in this moment. Maybe I can present something before Christmas, I don’t know, but it looks not bad</p>

  <p><b>[Philadelphia Union sign Mexico international Marco Fabian as designated player]</b> We have been targeting Marco as a creative midfielder and we are extremely happy to complete this deal to bring him to Philadelphia. Marco is a high caliber number 10, a true professional, and we believe he is a good fit for our system. He has played the game at the highest levels, whether in the German Bundesliga or of course with the Mexican National Team at multiple FIFA World Cups and the Olympic Games. We are looking forward to welcoming Marco as we turn our attention to the final phase of our preseason in Clearwater, followed by the season opener on March 2 vs. Toronto FC</p>

  <p><b>[Former Hoffenheim sporting director Ernst Tanner says he never had any doubts over <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>’s ability]</b> You should have seen the data that we got on him when he was coming for the first time <b>[to Hoffenheim]</b>. In Germany, we usually do these endurance tests, blood ones, which are pretty accurate, you know, and he had the worst numbers I have ever seen in professional football. I would say to emphasise that he was even worse than my grandma. You can’t imagine. They were so low that you couldn’t even believe that he was ever able to play professional football<br /><br />I was pretty sure that he would be a top <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> player. We do these evaluations in our scouting reports, you know, and I think that out of 10, nine and 10 are international level. And I gave him, I don’t know if it was an eight or nine, but I’m sure it was pretty high.<br /><br />Everyone <b>[at Hoffenheim]</b> was a bit curious about that at the time, but I rated him pretty high because I was so convinced about his abilities and even more so by his attitude. When I saw how the coach criticised him <b>[in a training with Figueirense]</b>, he was like a schoolboy standing there and listening to his teacher. I still have that picture in my brain. I thought to myself after an hour that if that coach had done that to a German player, he would head straight to the locker room totally pissed off, but <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> took the criticism well. He tried to improve, to do better. That was really impressive</p>
