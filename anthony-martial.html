He always demanded perfection from me. He has done a lot for me. He always showed me videos together with his assistant, even when I had scored a double. He pointed out the things I had done wrong. Sometimes it was annoying because you expected to be shown the things you did well, but I knew it was for my own good</p>

I think that’s what goes a long way to making me feel at home and at ease, and makes me really keen to stay here at the club.<br /><br />In France, even if you’re one of the best players around, they might begin to boo and jeer you if you go a couple of games without scoring. But here it’s just the opposite, they’ll try to cheer you on so you might be able to score, and so then you grow in confidence. I think it’s just a different mentality. That’s why I like the fans here so much</p>

We’re always ready and prepared and, what’s more, we have the squad to cope with the amount of games, so it’s an exciting period ahead.<br /><br />I feel really good at the moment, I’m training hard and, to be fair, with the matches and results since the new year, we’ve made a decent start, so I hope we can continue in the same vein. It’s a real honour for me that the supporters have voted for me. I think now it’s the third time it’s happened this season. I just hope I can keep this run going and maybe even try and win a few more of them!</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United forward Anthony Martial has revealed he had a soft spot for Arsenal as a youngster]</b> always followed English football. Manchester United because Patrice Evra was there and he comes from the same town as me. I followed Arsenal as Thierry Henry was there, also from Les Ulis. For my French heroes, I had Thierry Henry, of course, and then Zinedine Zidane, Zizou. They were the best. I admired strikers, number 10s. Another player who I really liked was Nicolas Anelka. He was a really great player, quick with loads of skill.<br /><br />My two big heroes were both Brazilian: Ronaldinho and Ronaldo because they had magic in their feet! Just about every player from my age group back then would probably tell you the same thing. I used to watch videos of everyone! Henry, Ronaldo - I would watch every striker on the internet, and sometimes, right before a game, I’d be by myself watching action clips, so I’d be able to reproduce what they were doing in those videos<br /><br />When I was a kid my favourite team was Lyon. It was at the time when almost all the best players were at the club. Lyon was really my team and that was also the reason I went to their academy. Karim Benzema was there, Juninho Pernambucano, with the great free-kicks. There was Lisandro Lopez, who went there after that. They had a lot of good players</p>

I would watch every striker on the internet, and sometimes, right before a game, I’d be by myself watching action clips, so I’d be able to reproduce what they were doing in those videos.<br /><br />If I was a kid of 14 today, who would I admire? Current players today? For me, I think it would have to be Juan Mata. He is class personified</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Martial has buried the hatchet with Jose Mourinho]</b> I think that <b>[my improvement]</b> is more on a tactical level. I try and take up good positions so I can best help out my team. I have been trying to work harder defensively too, and to really try and help out the side when we aren’t in possession of the ball. We work a lot on tactics and I try and do my best. I listen carefully to the advice of all the coaching staff we have here and I find that this helps me a lot.<br /><br />The key to it is playing games. For me, when you play in a game, that’s when you get back your enjoyment and you start to pick up your form once again. If you don’t feature regularly and you only take part in training sessions, you might still be in decent form but it’s not the same as when you are playing in matches. I hope I can continue to put together a good run of games and perform well in them</p>

I would like to thank Ole and his coaching staff for their belief in me and for helping me to take my game to the next level.

  <p><b>[Antony Martial says Manchester United are now seeing the real Paul Pogba]</b> We all know what quality Paul possesses - Paul is Paul. Now he has got this freedom to play with, I think we are beginning to see the real Paul Pogba play and let’s hope it continues. He is a leader, he talks more in the dressing room than he does on the field to be fair. Technically and with the spoken word, he is a leader in both senses. I hope he can continue to lead us to great things.<br /><br />I don’t think we are very far off the top four now so it is just a case of keeping going, winning as many games as we can so we can ensure a place in those Champions League spots at the end of the season<br /><br />Any footballer would say the same thing, <b>[my goal is]</b> to win as many titles and trophies as possible, as much silverware as possible and it is also really important to keep developing, progressing and improving as a player over the years. I’d describe the period <b>[since Martial has been at United]</b> as really enriching for me as a person and a footballer. They have been good years, I’ve learnt a lot and I hope that I can continue to push on in the next few years as well. The fans and I have had quite a special relationship from my first season and fortunately, it has continued to last until now. I hope it continues into the future and let’s hope that together, we can win trophies and silverware<br /><br />He <b>[Solskjaer]</b> is a coach with great values. I think he knows how to get the best out of players and he makes things clear so when we go out onto the field, we all know our jobs and we all know what we’ve got to do. He’s given me lots of advice. It’s always positive to get advice from a top player in his own right, but sometimes, when you’re out on the field, it comes down to what comes naturally to you and you do what you’ve always known how to do in terms of finishing. We have a laugh among ourselves quite often because I think finishing is something that comes naturally to me. I’ve played since I was a young kid, I’ve always been a footballer and a striker from that early age. The thing we laugh about is that I miss quite a few in training, whereas in a match, I may only get one chance and I manage to convert it</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Martial is embracing the pressure of being <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s No. 9]</b> Since I was a young kid, I have always played as a striker but, then again, I’m fine with playing more out wide as it’s a position that I enjoy playing. But it’s a real pleasure to find myself back in that more central role so I hope I can really help the team from there and go on to score plenty of goals<br /><br /><b>[On the message passed onto him by United boss <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>]</b> Now that I’ve taken the number nine shirt back once again, all he has said to me is that I have a responsibility and that I have to score goals, so that’s what I’m trying to do.

It definitely helps to unsettle them and that’s a good thing for us. It also means we can switch roles when we want to have a bit more time and a few more touches on the ball. It’s very important and the key is to keep the right balance for our team</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Martial believes his training ground scoring competitions with <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> are helping to give <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> At training, we have this competition between us about scoring goals. We measure who does the best finishing and who scores the most. Who’s winning? Well, that depends… Sometimes it’s him, sometimes it’s me. In games, Marcus likes to play in the middle, like me. I don’t mind dropping off, dropping out, we interchange during games. It doesn’t bother me to let him take the lead occasionally. It helps us to terrorise opposition defences and I hope we can keep it up over the course of the season<br /><br /><b>[Martial joined the ranks of players expressing solidarity with <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>, after his countryman was subjected to online racist abuse in the aftermath of his penalty miss in the 1-1 draw at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Molineux</a>]</b> It’s something you can’t really eradicate from society. Out there on the pitch, we can’t do anything about it per se. As players, we are there among white people, black people, people of all colours. The French expression is ‘we’re all the same’. Bans should be brought about for people who give out this hatred. People go to football stadiums to have a good time and enjoy the game, and there’s no place for it.

That’s not to say that there will be no more tricks, because tricks are all part of your learning and the passion you have when you’re a football player setting out. You’ve worked hard to get where you are if you’re playing here at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, and it’s important not to lose that joy of playing the game because if you lose that passion, things will get a lot harder for you, but if I do a piece of skill, I want to score after it<br /><br />Ole gives us forwards a lot of advice in relation to our positioning on the pitch, and we’re glad to receive it. He has a lot of knowledge to share from being a top striker himself and that will help us as forwards individually, and as we move forward as a team. Frankly, playing as striker, you’re not there to make blinding passes or massive runs. I’ve come to understand that, to score, you have to be obsessed, to be fixated on just that, scoring goals. That’s how you enjoy yourself as a striker. That’s not a choice - that’s how it has to be<br /><br /><b>[Martial went on to discuss the players who influenced him growing up]</b> I would say my favourite players were the Brazilians, <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>.

I mostly loved <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>, because he was a player who could make you dream, with his great big smile on the pitch, with his great technical skills.
