  <p><b>[Lucas Ocampos defends <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> in the ongoing debate over the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> man’s form when representing Argentina]</b> I think that Argentina is one of the few countries in which <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is criticised for some things that he does. But I think that more than 90 per cent of the world knows the quality that he has, what he represents for Argentina and for world football<br /><br /><b>[Lucas Ocampos is hoping he will be able to retain his place in <a href="lionel-scaloni.html">Lionel Scaloni</a>’s plans once he is fit again]</b> I thought that I could have had a call from the national team before but you have to realise that there are a lot of players from great teams with a lot of quality that play in my position. It was just a matter of continuing to work hard and now to keep working hard to stay in the squad<br /><br />Imagining that the coach will continue to count on me to represent my country, especially in an official competition, is the best one can hope for</p>

  <p><b>[Seville player Lucas Ocampos wins the 130th derby against Rea Betis]</b> I’m more than happy. I come from a country where clásicos are important. It’s my first derby. I won the most important one in Argentina and now I’ve won one of the most important here. I’m off to celebrate with my teammates; we deserve this</p>

  <p><b>[Sevilla stars apologise for party violating <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and government lockdown rules]</b> I want to ask for forgiveness and I recognise that we’ve made a mistake, damaging the image of the club. For this we can only apologise to the club, all our team-mates, the technical staff and society in general. We guarantee that we’ve learned our lesson and won’t repeat these actions</p>
