  <p><b>[Steven Davis underlined the importance of earning a result versus European zone Group C rivals Azerbaijan]</b> We have put ourselves in a good position in the group and have got an opportunity to strengthen that. They <b>[Azerbaijan]</b> will be a different proposition from what we faced when we played them in Belfast, but we believe we have the quality to get a result out there</p>

  <p><b>[Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis insists that his team-mates will use their perceived injustice in the first leg as fuel and motivation to reach the World Cup]</b> We had to put that <b>[the decision]</b> to bed straight away in the dressing room, we’re still well within the tie and we just need to go out and give it our all. Any emotions we have about the decision we have to use that as fuel and motivation. Listen, we have all dreamed of getting to a World Cup - it’s the pinnacle of players’ career so we have 90 minutes go and turn this tie around.</p>

  <p><b>[Steven Davis says he’s thrilled to work with an icon like Steven Gerrard as the Northern Ireland midfielder returns to Rangers]</b> I’m delighted to be back and looking forward to getting started. It’s been a little while in the making but when I found out the club was interested, this is the one that I wanted to happen.<br /><br />I found out there was interest a little while back and talks were ongoing between the two clubs to try and come to a conclusion. And then, when the decision is made, it all happens very quickly; so obviously I’m delighted to get it agreed last night and I was straight on the flight this morning to get out here.<br /><br />It’s great to be back and I am obviously very familiar with the club. I’m sure there will be plenty of faces I recognise as I go along and I’m looking forward to getting back out at Ibrox.<br /><br />He is an icon for any young player coming up and likewise for myself as well. I’m sure I’ll learn a lot from him and he’s obviously done a fantastic job in the six months he has been here. There seems to be a real good camaraderie within the squad and I’m looking forward to getting to know the boys a bit more this week. It’s a good introduction for me as well and then we’ll get back to Scotland and start the games. I think the club has come a long way in the last couple of years. Obviously the Old Firm result was massive for everybody and it was a massive psychological boost for the boys as well. So it’s a great time to come in amongst it. I’m just raring to go and can’t wait to get out there</p>
