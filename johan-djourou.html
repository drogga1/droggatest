  <p><b>[Johan Djourou believes Switzerland have the quality to progress to the latter stages of Euro 2016]</b> It was a very tough game. We were playing against an aggressive team because we have so many players with Albanian roots in the team. It was a very emotional game - one where we had to keep our cool. We did that and managed to come out with the three points even though it wasn’t the best game. We knew the most important thing in the competition is to win the first game<br /><br />We know that we have the quality. It’s important to start well in the competition and then march on. We have to be ready to get the three points in this game <b>[against Romania on Wednesday]</b> and then who knows how far we can go. The first test is over, we have to analyse. I believe we can go as far as possible<br /><br /><b>[On Granit Xhaka]</b> I think Granit has a lot of talent. He showed <b>[against Albania]</b> that he can bring his class and qualities to Arsenal. He’s a very aggressive player and he can be a very key player for the club. Arsenal have so many good players in that position. Don’t forget that there’s also Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey, Francis Coquelin and Santi Cazorla. It will be good to have some competition because he’s a great player.<br /><br />Next season is going to be more open <b>[in the Premier League]</b> and harder to win the league because teams are going to get new players, new managers, new ideas and philisophies. Arsenal has always been thereabouts and in the top four so hopefully it will be their year</p>

  <p><b>[Granit Xhaka is a perfect signing for Arsenal and manager Arsene Wenger]</b> He’s a great ball player and a ball winner so I think in the midfield he could help a lot. He’s got the ability to play very long balls and precise balls. He reminds me a bit of Andrea Pirlo, the way he plays.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal defender Johan Djourou has defended midfielder Granit Xhaka]</b> Why should I do that <b>[tell Xhaka to leave Arsenal]</b>? He got a red card again, yeah okay! We won at the end, that’s most important! And let me tell you, Granit gives everything for the Arsenal shirt and that’s his style of play so don’t be too hard on him! He plays with passion. He will learn!!</p>

  <p><b>[Johan Djourou forced to go blonde after Trump bet]</b> So let me explain! <b>[Emilie]</b> and me had a bet, I told her that Hillary Clinton would have been the next president of the US. She told me no way that Trump would be the next president, and not because she likes him but she just felt that way! And now I am Blond thanks baby, but I will get you back next time!!!! so guys what do you think of my haircut?.</p>
