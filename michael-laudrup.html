  <p><b>[Michael Laudrup admits <a href="malaga-fc.html">Malaga</a> caused his Mallorca team problems despite their 2-0 triumph]</b> We played very badly in the first 30 minutes, and <a href="malaga-fc.html">Malaga</a> created many problems for us. We were very slow, and against a team like <a href="malaga-fc.html">Malaga</a> that can cost you dearly. We then improved, and at present the most important thing is the points, giving us permanence in the top half of the table. Fortunately, <b>[Dudu]</b> Aouate has made many good saves and was very important to us</p>

If one scores a hat-trick, the other tries to beat that. They are two of the best, not just of this era - in 30 years we’ll be talking about them and the debate will be whether <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> or <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> is the greatest of all time<br /><br /><b>[When asked which of them he would rather have in his team, the Dane replied]</b> Both would have to be in it, as they’ve clearly been the best two over the past four or five years<br /><br /><b>[Laudrup also said that <a href="james-rodriguez.html">James Rodriguez</a> must become accustomed to the pressure of representing <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> before he becomes a weapon for <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a>’s side]</b> He’s a great footballer.

  <p><b>[How are you and what will be your next move?]</b> Since I left Qatar I have not done anything as a coach. I’m working with several media outlets and thinking about what I’d like to do in the future. I would like to coach again but I want new experiences. To return to the same thing I have done before is not something I want. I was in Spain, with Mallorca and Getafe, which were exceptional experiences. I enjoyed my time in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and in Qatar. But now I’m looking to do new things</p>

  <p><b>[Let’s talk about your career. Do you remember your first no-look pass?]</b> I do not remember, really. Many people ask me why I did it. It was to fool the defence, not to ridicule them. I did not do strange things for show, just to be more effective. In the end, we all want to win and you have to use all the resources at your disposal</p>

There are players who do things that remind me of what I was doing, but I never say they do what I do. <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> is one of them but he is himself. I played the way I did it because I knew it was effective. My intention was to win always, not to gain applause</p>

It was the year of the World Cup in Spain and I came in a bit unnoticed because everybody was thinking towards the World Cup. But for me that friendly was special and I scored a goal that I will never forget</p>

What was it like playing with stars like Scirea, <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a>, <a href="zbigniew-boniek.html">Boniek</a> and Rossi?]</b> It was very different from today’s era. There were very few foreigners and in Italy you were only allowed to play two per team, there was barely thirty six foreigners in the league. I came to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> at a very young age and it was amazing being one of the two, especially since the other was <a href="michel-platini.html">Michel Platini</a> who was the best in the world at that time along with Diego Maradona</p>

The first year was great. We won the Scudetto and it was very good. After that, however, I had injury problems. <a href="michel-platini.html">Platini</a> was gone and <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> were going through a time of transition. We were not at the same level as our rivals. <a href="arrigo-sacchi.html">Arrigo Sacchi</a>’s Milan were powerful and the German trio at Inter made them big rivals. I realised that big clubs are not the place to be when they are going through a transitional period. That was the problem and I went to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, it was a great club, but it was nowhere near what it is now. They won a league maybe every eight or 10 years and had never lifted the European Cup</p>

  <p><b>[You had five years at the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>. What is your best memory?]</b> It’s impossible to choose. Many of my former colleagues would pick the European Cup final at Wembley in 1992, but for me it is impossible to pick just one moment. We won four league titles, one European Cup and other titles while also playing great football. If I had to choose something I would pick the spirit that was in the group. We were friends and had a very good atmosphere in the dressing room. I think it was the most important thing</p>

  <p><b>[Your time with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> ended with THAT final in Athens how did it feel to go out on a low?]</b> It showed that the club entered a new era. I had a lot of experience in football by then and I realised football is continuous evolution, at whatever level. A team is never complete. You have to think to win today and tomorrow and to plan for the future. When you have to change seven or eight players that is when something has gone badly wrong. The day <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> they will both face a crucial challenge to try and keep on winning</p>

  <p><b>[When did you decide to leave? Before or after that game against Milan?]</b> Before. I could have stayed but there was a limit of four foreigners and you could only play three. The first few months of the 1993-94 season I was the one who played most but I was losing form in the decisive stretch and missed the final in Athens. I considered whether that trend would continue into the next season and came to the conclusion that I would have problems and time proved me right. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> had problems with injuries in 1994-95 and they could only finish third</p>

It was very intense on a personal and emotional level, but that is normal. When you’ve been very comfortable for so long that happens. But with the passing of time I also saw that people still loved me despite going to a rival team, which I understand was a blow to the fans</p>

When I returned two years ago I did not get a very good reception but when I finished as a player there was never a problem. I still go to the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> often. I always got well treated in Spain, both in the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> and the Santiago Bernabeu, but also in Bilbao and Seville. The truth is I do not know why they treat me so well in places where I did not play but this is what I’m most proud of</p>

It is not for me to say. That would be one for the players. I left Spain almost twenty years ago and sometimes people will say ‘that move reminds me of Laudrup’. Considering all the great players who have played for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> that fills me with a lot of pride</p>

He came in a difficult moment, he has achieved something for the first time in the history of the Champions League since it started in ‘93- the first team to win two consecutive Champions Leagues and in one of them he also won the Spanish league ahead of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, so I think he has done a fantastic job this season. Everybody was talking since the very beginning in the Supercopa, when they beat <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, and that year they won everything. This year is not like that but I think what he has achieved in the last two years should be more than enough to give him a lot of more credit even if they don’t win anything. He should have much credit and should continue with his job</p>

  <p><b>[The Danish football legend says comparing the two Argentina team-mates is unfair on the <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> forward, who has also rejected comparisons]</b> He’s a talent. The problem I think is that he’s from Argentina and he’s another player that people like to say could be the next <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. No, there is no next <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> now. To see the next <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, we’ll have to wait. I don’t think I’ll see the next <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> in my lifetime. You don’t see a player like that every ten years, or every 15. Maybe we’ll have to wait 25, 30 years, 50 years to see another player like that. This is the standard you use sometimes. He <b>[Dybala]</b> is from Argentina, he’s left-footed, he’s not so tall, the way he is moving. But I don’t think it benefits him that he’s compared to <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, because he is no <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. He is a very talented player, but he is no Messi</p>
