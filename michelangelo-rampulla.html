<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Gianluigi Buffon admitted that he may consider extending his career beyond the end of the current campaign]</b> I was the first man to be Buffon’s understudy at Juventus. He was already affirmed as a young champion, whereas I was at the end of my career. I was 40 at the time but we immediately struck up a great rapport. Gigi is a wonderful person, sincere and cheerful. There were never any resentment between us. Indeed, we built a strong connection. We were always room-mates. I remember one episode, in particular, after I’d joined <b>[Didier]</b> Deschamps’ backroom team as a goalkeeping coach. He was fresh from becoming a World Champion in Germany but Juve were in Seri B, so everything felt strange. But when we’d practically secured our return to Serie A, we got to talking about the future and I told him that if he were to stay at Juve, he would become a legend; one of the cornerstones in the history of the Bianconeri. And that’s how it turned out.<br /><br />Our relationship always remained unchanged. Even when I returned as goalkeeping coach, our dynamic changed a little on a professional level, for obvious reasons of hierarchy, but our relationship always remained ideal.</p>
