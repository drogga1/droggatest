  <p><b>[On Frank Lampard]</b> <b>[John]</b> Terry and Frank Lampard, for me, are the most influential players to ever play for Chelsea. <b>[He has been]</b> Unbelievable! He was a complete midfielder who was always working hard, setting up and scoring goals. There are not many players around like him anymore or ever have been <b>[like him]</b>. I wish him all the best for his time after football and I sent him a message <b>[after he retired]</b>. I hope he gets to enjoy life after football to its fullest now.<br /><br /><b>[Lampard would be a success in football management]</b> Of course <b>[he could be a great coach]</b>. He is analytical, a fighter and has the mentality to succeed. When you have these elements generally as a person then I believe you’re already on a good path. And also being an all-round midfielder he has a good understanding of the game</p>

  <p><b>[Mikael Forssell thinks that Eden Hazard’s recovery from his poor form of last season is a huge achievement]</b> For me, Eden Hazard is the one I would like to pick out. Every striker knows that there are circumstances in football that have an effect on your game. Going from being the best player in the Premier League in 2014, to what happened last season, and coming on to this season has been an unbelievable achievement. It is never easy to lose your form and come back to the top of the world. I could have answered Diego Costa or a host of other names to the question too.<br /><br /><b>[Forssell is glad that Diego Costa has remained at the club despite interest from China]</b> He has been one of the most decisive players in the success this season. He is deadly in front of the goal and on top of that he works hard for the team. I hope he will stay in Chelsea for a long time. He fits the Chelsea team and it is difficult to find that in football. Money doesn’t guarantee that fit. Of course, it is impossible to talk for another person about his motivation and motives to play for the club but I hope he will not move to China. He is great in front of goal and it is difficult to find a similar player. He has adapted well to English football and it is not easy <b>[to do that]</b> coming from Spain<br /><br />It is an unbelievable achievement coming to the Premier League in his first season to make such an impact. When you look at the way the team plays and have energy and how he gets the best out of players you can definitively put him up in the top five managers currently in the world. <b>[Is it over?]</b> Never say never and so I would be careful. Everybody knows that things can happen very quickly in football and so I wouldn’t be popping the champagne just yet. It’s a great achievement from the team though to be eight points clear and <b>[despite saying that it is not over]</b>. I believe no one will catch them and they will be crowned champions at the end of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Mikael Forssell helped Chelsea win their first title in 50 years, but is currently without a club after leaving Finish giants HJK, his boyhood club]</b> I left HJK Helsinki with the club having not won the title now for two consecutive years. The club decided to stick with the current manager so we departed ways. For me it was about getting more time on the pitch to enjoy football somewhere else. I have not retired and will most likely continue playing. I had opportunities to move abroad in January but due to writing my Bachelor Degree final thesis I could not leave with the family on such a short notice. But everything is still open for me.<br /><br />I was speaking to people in football, especially in Finland. The conclusion was that there is a lack of professionalism regarding running clubs and operating both their financial and marketing sectors. It is currently on an amateur level compared to the Premier League, with the exception of a couple clubs. I had the possibility to study a Bachelor’s Degree through FifPro in a Danish University that was 100% online. So I could keep playing football while studying on my own time. It was hard to combine that with family and football but I am proud that I have managed to pull through. I am grateful for the program and would recommend it to everyone in the game. I am starting my Masters Degree in May in a university in Madrid, which will also be online<br /><br />I am a massive fan of Chelsea! It was my first club abroad and, as said earlier, I made many highlights of my career at the club. Unfortunately, due to football, I haven’t had the chance to visit Stamford Bridge yet but will definitively do that in the future. I am fortunate to have had many great times in football with its ups and downs, but I would pick up my time at Chelsea as my best period. I saw the change from 1998-2005 to Abramovich coming in, bringing in new players and Mourinho.<br /><br />I had great times in Birmingham City and also my time playing in Germany and scoring goals for Finland. Being part of winning the Premier League in 2005 was amazing. I had just come back from injury and didn’t play a massive role but it is still a highlight in my career. Of course, simply scoring goals at Stamford Bridge was a dream come true</p>

  <p><b>[Mikael Forssell has backed Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata to return to form]</b> Of course it is psychologically tough not to score. Sometimes its about taking a striker out of the pressure to allow him gain focus and form. Also, sometimes its easier to score from the bench as there are no expectations towards that player. I think all of us strikers go through a dry patch. Generally, he can be happy with his first season in the Premier League as it is very different to any of the leagues he has played in before. It’s all about staying focused and working hard in training. It starts from there and eventually reflects on to the games. I am not worried. We have all seen him score amazing goals both abroad and in the Premier League. It’s also about the team feeding and finding him correctly on the pitch. He is a great striker and I believe he is a great player for Chelsea.<br /><br /><b>[On Eden Hazard’s recent appearances as a false nine]</b> He is definitely not as bad as what some people are saying. It takes time to adapt and to be honest, you put Hazard anywhere on the pitch and he will do a great job. He is so good on the ball and generally drops deeper to get the ball no matter where he plays</p>
