  <p><b>[The 16-year-old Pietro Pellegri had just made history as the youngest player ever to have scored two goals in a Serie A game]</b> In football, my father has looked after me since … I was a kid and … no, yes, anyway. To see these images of my father is so beautiful. He used to bring me to training, in the rain and the cold. My father took me on the right path in football, while my mother took me to school<br /><br /><b>[When previously asked about all of the talk surrounding his first-team prospects at Genoa]</b> I prefer to keep my mouth shut</p>

  <p><b>[Sixteen-year-old Genoa forward Pietro Pellegri tells about his relationship with his father, Marco, who was seen crying on the sidelines after seeing his son score in their 3-2 defeat by <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>]</b> It’s a dream come true that I’ve had since I was a child. It was an important evening for me and my father. I have not left school, but this year I’ll have a private tutor to help me after my morning training sessions. My father has been following my career since I was little and it’s wonderful that he was so moved. He always took me to training, even in the cold and rain. He’s the one who keeps me on the right path in football, while my mother makes sure I study at school</p>
