  <p>[Asier Illarramendi says <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a> will quickly prove to be a very important player at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>] I think <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> has already shown what a good player he is. It is clear that he will contribute a lot to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. He works well, as we’ve already seen with <a href="diego-simeone.html">Cholo</a> [<a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>], as well as scoring goals, and I think he will be a very important player for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>.<br /><br />[Illarramendi said of the 20-year-old <a href="martin-odegaard.html">Martin Odegaard</a>] I met him four years ago - I think he was 16 at the time - he was young and I was young, too. You could see he had good manners and he was a high quality player. Now four years have passed, he has already competed in the Dutch league. Even though we haven’t played many games, you can see with the ball that he’s a guy who has a lot of quality; without the ball, he also works very well. He has commitment, he works very well and I believe it’ll be a good year for him.</p>
