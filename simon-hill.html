<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Leading football commentator Simon Hill has slammed the A-League’s video assistant referee]</b> I want it gone. The bottom line is it has been brought in to get things right and it’s still not getting things right. I think it’s time consuming. I think it’s frustrating and confusing for players, fans, coaches and media. We’re in a situation at the moment where our referees and VARs are more famous than the players - that can’t be allowed to continue. I was against this VAR in the first place. I’ve always said give the referees the power to do their job and if the culture of the game needs changing, then change it. But don’t change the nature of the game because it’s the world game for a reason - and that’s because it’s pretty good<br /><br />Unfortunately we’ve gone down this road - I know it’s a trial - but I keep hearing FIFA want it, <b>[FIFA president]</b> Gianni Infantino likes it and we’ve got to get used to it. But FIFA is the organisation that wants a 48-team World Cup. FIFA is the organisation that takes the World Cup to Qatar in June-July in 45-degree heat and turns the world upside down to accommodate it when they know it was wrong. We don’t have to always say, ‘oh well we are just going to tip our lid and get on with it’. We’ve got to fight for what we believe is right and I just personally do not believe <b>[the VAR]</b> is right</p>
