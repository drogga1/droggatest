  <p>[Manchester United target Fabricio Oya happy to hone his craft at Corinthians] Who would not want to be here? Who would not dream of wearing the Corinthians shirt and walking out in this stadium with 40,000 fans chanting your name?<br /><br />I think this is a dream for anyone, not just for me, but I think it gets even better because I live for Corinthians and have been here for the last seven years. My love for this club is so big, I hope that at some point when I am ready I can leave my mark here<br /><br />I didn’t get the chance to see them much with the experience I have now of football, but my childhood idols whom I liked a lot and now search for in videos on the internet are Pirlo, Ronaldinho, [Zinedine] Zidane. Now I like watching Iniesta, Messi and Neymar. Neymar and Messi might stand about above the rest, but football is the same for everybody, it is a way to play, be happy and look for creativity so that serves as an inspiration to me. I don’t think I will ever be able to equal Pirlo and Ronaldinho’s free-kicks, though!<br /><br />I have my projects. My wish is to be playing well for Corinthians and winning titles within two years. I want to be remembered in the history of the club and after all that, play in Europe and if possible fight for a World Cup with my country. I think achieving that is the peak of your career, the most that a player can give. I hope to play in the Qatar World Cup and after that in the Japan Olympics of 2020 representing our Brazil team</p>
