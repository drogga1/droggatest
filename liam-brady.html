  <p><b>[Liam Brady has urged <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> to drop <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> from his <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team]</b> Have you seen <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>? Have we seen <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>? He’s on £350,000 a week. I know people go on about wages but he’s on £350,000 a week and he’s not really trying. I would have a kid in the team who is going to run around and show some enthusiasm. I think Freddie thinks he’s a bit too big to take on as he’s only the interim manager. You’ve got to make decisions. He should not be in the team. Emery bombed him from the team for at least two months and then backtracked and put him in the team again and I think that contributed to his downfall. They have a number of youngsters who have done well in the Europa League and League Cup, they had a tremendous game up at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. But I think Freddie is reluctant to go up against the big names in the squad. But if you are going to make an impression that’s what you need to do. <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> should not be playing for Arsenal</p>

  <p><b>[Liam Brady as Ireland’s greatest ever players. Brady was hooked by <a href="jack-charlton.html">Charlton</a> during the first half of a pre-World Cup friendly encounter against West Germany in Dublin. It was a demonstration of power by the manager and a message to the Irish people that he felt Brady was out of his depth. It was the end]</b> It was disappointing for me. You sense when your time is up or when a manager favours you, or when a manager is supportive of you. It was a sad way to go.<br /><br />Maybe with another manager, with another style of play, he would have wanted Liam Brady in the squad to go to Italy. But it wasn’t to be. I knew my time was up. Having been substituted at Lansdowne Road against West Germany, I said: ‘I’ve had enough. Good luck. Do well. And thanks for the memories.’</p>

  <p><b>[Ahead of <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s landmark of 20 years with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> this weekend, former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> midfielder Liam Brady tells that <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> will go down as one of the club’s greatest ever managers]</b> I think he’ll go down as one of the all-time great managers of the club, possibly the greatest. I know Herbert Chapman and the history of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, is an iconic figure but <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>, in his 20 years, particularly in his first ten, was magnificent. We were the only team to challenge <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, who were really on top of their game ad had probably the finances to outstrip any of the competition.
