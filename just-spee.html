<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Just Spee thinks ‘Very doubtful’ <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> will play again in 2019-20]</b> It was a very bitter day because you want this to happen on the pitch, not by two or three people behind a table having to make this decision. There are winners and losers and in particular for the losers it was a very very bad day so we feel sad. We feel sad that we had to come to such a decision, we sympathise a lot with those clubs and their supporters. At the same time, there was no way around it<br /><br /><b>[Spee, however, is not confident that games without fans is even feasible this season]</b> It is slim. At the same time I do know that what is true for us - we are footballers, we want to play - is true for all of my colleagues around the continent. And in the UK it is not different. So they will hold onto a sliver of hope as long as it’s there. But again, we’ve seen how this develops. Is it realistic? In the end it probably will not be but we’ll see. To be honest, seeing what is happening and seeing that things get postponed week by week by week, how realistic is it that within the next three or four weeks we will come to a different conclusion? Not so much I believe. And also <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> will need a number of weeks to complete their competition. Is there going to be enough time for that? Doubtful, very doubtful</p>
