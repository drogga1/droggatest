  <p><b>[Tyler Blackett pens new United deal]</b> I’m thrilled to have signed my new contract. I have supported United all my life and have been here since I was 8 years old. To come through the academy and make my debut this season was a dream come true. I want to keep improving within the first-team squad with the help of the manager, coaches and the players around me</p>

  <p><b>[Reading FC defender Tyler Blackett warned his teammates he is determined to stay in manager Mark Bowen’s side]</b> I just want to be on the pitch. I’ll play anywhere on the left and I’ll do my best in any position I play in. It’s good to have versatility and I’m more than capable of playing anywhere. Of course I’ve been frustrated, any player who wants to play gets frustrated when they don’t play. You just need to keep the right mindset and be ready for when that opportunity comes. It’s one of those things. Sometimes in your career you go through spells when you’re not playing. It’s about persevering. You have to keep going, keep focusing and support your teammates who are playing. When it’s your time though you have to be ready to play<br /><br /><b>[But their one-man advantage paid off as Lucas Joao scored a second before Meite added a third from the spot]</b> We did what we needed to do. Sometimes when a team lose a man they pile players forward and go for it. We knew we needed to ride out that period and get through it. We tried to rush it a bit. It was a game to keep possession and make them work. It paid off in the end. The aim was to keep the ball moving so the gaps would appear and we could get goals. We talked all week about getting another clean sheet. Now we just need to keep them coming and we’ll be able to get results from that</p>
