  <p><b>[Jupp Heynckes couldn’t work with sons of b<em>tches at Real Madrid]&lt;/b&gt; A week before playing Juventus I called Jupp and asked him how he was doing, he told me that he was deflated and that he wouldn’t work with the team. I asked him how he couldn’t work with the team and told him that he’d then left me deflated. I then had to gather seven or eight of the more important players and tell them that Jupp felt he couldn’t work with them, that they were sons of b</em>tches and that he couldn’t win with them. We were European champions, but logically someone who tells you that they can’t work with the team can’t continue. Explaining that the coach who had made us European champions was not continuing was complicated, but I couldn’t leave the situation how it was..</b></p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> president Lorenzo Sanz hospitalised]</b> We are quite worried and little can be done. He had been feverish for eight days, they called the phone and told him to take paracetamol. He endured eight days and did not want to go to the hospital until he was short of air and he was getting worse. They put him inside and told him that he was bad, with little oxygen in his blood. He said he had a low fever and did not want to collapse the system. We do not know if it is coronavirus or not, but it looks like it. He was in fine health. My mother is there because we have not been able to go. They have said that they would call and that, as long as they do not call, it is good news. We’re certain that he’s in the best hands with the Spanish public health system, they’ve been the pride of the national for a long time. He is at the <a href="raul-jimenez.html">Jimenez</a> Diaz Hospital, where they saved my life as a child when a virus attacked my heart. We must applaud the medical staff there because they are working out of their skins. Hopefully they can help us and many more families</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Sanz, Lorenzo’s son, said on Wednesday that he had been admitted to hospital after a period of ill health]</b> My father has just died. He did not deserve this ending and in this way. One of the kindest, bravest, and hardworking people I’ve ever seen is leaving. His family and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> were his passion. My mother and my brothers have enjoyed all their moments with pride</p>
