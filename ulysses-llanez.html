  <p><b>[None performed better than Llanez, who grew up in Lynwood, a dozen miles from Dignity Health Sports Park where Saturday’s game was played]</b> Since I was 14, I wanted to play in the stadium. But I never got there</p>

  <p><b>[The Southern California native admitted that getting his first cap in the Los Angeles area was something he never could have envisioned, saying he enjoyed his first taste of life with the senior national team]</b> It was a good experience. I never thought I would get my first cap back home. Training with the big guys … people that are experienced, it was a good experience for me. It’s just a PK. I always have one spot to shoot so that’s always my spot to go. It was just like, ‘If I miss I miss,’ but I had a good feeling I was going to score. My guts were telling me, ‘you know what, just take it. You have a good feeling of scoring’<br /><br /><b>[The match came just days after the tragic death of basketball legend <a href="kobe-bryant.html">Kobe Bryant</a>, and Llanez was able to take part in a tribute to the former Los Angeles Lakers star after scoring the opener]</b> We were celebrating and our captain (Aaron Long) told us, ‘Hey let’s do a Kobe celebration,’. I was like ‘all right, what are we doing? <b>[Long said]</b>, ‘All right Uly, get the ball and do a fadeaway’ so I got it and just did a fadeaway</p>
