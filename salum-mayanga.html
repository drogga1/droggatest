<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Benin vs Tanzania]</b> It is a good test for Taifa Stars, which is playing for the first time in Benin. We normally play our international friendly matches against Southern and East African opposition, but we managed to secure the game against Benin, which is among strong teams on the African continent.<br /><br />My selection of Taifa Stars players was based on their performance in various league matches in the Tanzania Mainland premier league. The match against Benin will not be easy as we are playing a team that comprises experienced players who want a victory due to their previous 4-1 loss at our backyard<br /><br />We will train here <b>[Cotonou]</b> for two days before we face Benin. The match is scheduled to start at 6pm Tanzanian time and we hope to record the best result possible. He said players such as Erasto Nyoni and Mzamilu Yasin were excluded from the squad after being shown a red card in the previous international friendly against Malawi at the Uhuru Stadium. I have replaced Nyoni and Yasin with Jonas Mkude from Simba Sports Club and Mudathiri Yahya from Singida United, as the two players have shown great progress in previous league matches and I believe they will fill the gap</p>
