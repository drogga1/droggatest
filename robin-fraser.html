  <p><b>[CCL still ultimately comes down to one question: Can someone outside of Liga MX win it?]</b> I think there are certainly things we’ll take away from last year that we’ll continue to do, and I think we’ll make some adjustments based on different things, various conditions. There are so many variables to preparing for competitions like this depending on where we’re playing, where we’re doing preseason, where our first opponent is and how that sets up. We’ll go back and look at it now and make the adjustments we think are going to be necessary.</p>

  <p><b>[As much as Fraser wants to be seen as any other soccer coach, one who helped the Rapids get a game away from the playoffs despite his predecessor starting the season on an 11-match winless run, he feels an additional pressure as a black head coach who hopes to pave the way for others to follow]</b> I do think that there’s a responsibility. The responsibility is to do well and be successful. In other sports, and other leagues, there were no black coaches and in the 40 years I’ve seen where it’s now gone the other way and in some instances, there are more black coaches. But it starts by a black coach being successful. There’s certainly a desire to do well because I know it would open doors for other people<br /><br /><b>[The path, such that there is one, is getting more clear, but that doesn’t happen without efforts from the top]</b> It has been a while since I’ve been seriously considered as a head coach and I think - I don’t know - it’s a difficult thing to say because who says who deserves a job. Obviously when people are hiring, they’re hiring based on what they think, and it’s really a question of what the thought process is of the people doing the hiring whether than asking the thought process of the people not being hired</p>
