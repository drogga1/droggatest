<blockquote>
  <p><b>[American youngster Keaton Parks has signed a new deal at Benfica to keep him at the club until 2022]</b> I feel great. I’m very excited to start a new journey at Benfica - continue my journey with Benfica - and get my chance in the A team and in the B team as I move forward.<br /><br />It was a new team. I didn’t have a lot of expectations, I didn’t know what to expect. But it has been an amazing experience playing with the B team and getting my opportunity with the A team as well. It’s been great - training with them every day, playing in the games on the weekend - it’s has been good<br /><br />All the coaches have helped me a lot. With the B team and players they talk to me a lot, they help me out and I think I’ve evolved a lot since I’ve come here to Benfica.<br /><br />To continue at Benfica, work very hard, and, if everything goes well, have more opportunities in the first team, more minutes in matches and prove myself</p>
