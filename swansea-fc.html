  <p><b>[Claude Makelele has joined Swansea City as assistant coach to new boss Paul Clement until the end of the season]</b> Swansea City is pleased to confirm that former French international Claude Makelele has joined the club’s coaching staff. The 43-year-old, who has signed a deal until the end of the season, reunites with head coach Paul Clement, who he worked with during his playing stint at Chelsea and as a coach with Paris Saint-Germain. The former Real Madrid, Chelsea and PSG midfielder has been named as an assistant coach… Makelele will get his first taste of the Liberty on Saturday when he’s in the dug-out for the Swans’ Premier League fixture with Arsenal.</p>
