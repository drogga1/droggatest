  <p><b>[When asked if this was a suitable time to move on from Sevilla]</b> It’s good timing, like you say. I really feel that. But I can’t lack respect for the club. Whatever the final choice is, I’ll be happy. It’s for them to judge. But I dream of playing at a high level, in the biggest clubs in the world and to be alongside players of international class. It’s a case of seeing where I can get to in terms of level. I’m not more preoccupied about that than by my future. I’ll take stock after France duty but it will also be for Seville to decide</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco complete €40m move for <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> striker Ben Yedder]</b> I am very happy to be involved with AS Monaco. I felt a strong desire on the part of the club to have me come. I chose Monaco because I believe in this project and I am determined to do everything possible to go after our common goals. I come with the intention to prove, as always, my qualities and with the desire to reach a new level. I want to thank the club for the trust it gives me. It’s a beautiful day and the beginning of a new story that I cannot wait to start.</p>

  <p><b>[Wissam Ben Yedder has revealed he came very close to joining <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in the January transfer window]</b> For starters, these are things that could have happened long before. Last summer, for example. They <b>[Barca]</b> took information about me several times. This winter, it could have been done. It didn’t happen, that’s how it was, that it shouldn’t be done. It shows that I am doing a good job. I stayed professional and focused on my performances with Monaco. When <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> arrived, I took it as a plus, as a bonus</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should regret missing out on Ben Yedder]</b> Last summer, for example, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> took information about me several times. This winter, a deal could have been done. It didn’t happen, that’s how it was, that it wouldn’t be done. It shows that I am doing a good job. I stayed professional and focused on my performances with Monaco. When <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> arrived, I took it as a plus, as a bonus<br /><br /><b>[He was initially noted for his prowess in futsal as much as in the 11-a-side game and it was not until he went professional shortly before his 20th birthday with Toulouse that he gave the indoor sport up]</b> It gave me a lot. A little more technique, the ability to wriggle free in small spaces, to dribble by players, to score from closed angles, to play faster with one or two touches of the ball. It still serves me today. In modern football, you need to make decisions quickly and play fast<br /><br /><b>[Even once signed for Toulouse, though, he faced a battle to convince those that he was worth a shot and was nearly loaned out to amateur side Luzenac before a moment in training changed the mind of head of coach Alain Casanova]</b> I was annoyed with him. I had to show him what I could do. I took the ball and I dribbled round everyone, even the goalkeeper. Then I went back and beat the goalkeeper and a defender before scoring. During that match, I did some great things while others were trying to tackle me and hurt me. They didn’t accept that I had done that.<br /><br /><b>[But having come from humble beginnings, the striker, who would have stood a fine chance of leading the line for France at Euro 2020 had it not been postponed, is pragmatic]</b> I couldn’t imagine playing in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> and the France team. No-one could have seen it. Every day is different. You always have to keep the faith and the ambition to realise your dreams. I always dream bigger</p>
