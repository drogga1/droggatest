  <p><b>[Meet David Wagner: Klopp’s best man preparing an FA Cup giant-killing for Guardiola]</b> OK, I think there is no doubt that we are the underdogs on Saturday. But - I’ve said this sometimes before - this is football. Huddersfield Town plays against Man City - is it realistic that Huddersfield Town will win this football match? No, this is unrealistic. This is totally unrealistic in my opinion!<br /><br />Is it possible? Yes! It is possible, because it’s football and in football, nobody knows the result before a game. This is, I think, what we have to make sure that we know - usually it’s unrealistic, but it’s football, and this is why it’s possible<br /><br />If we look at our competitors in the Championship - their individual quality, their experience, the money they have - then, in my opinion, it is completely unrealistic for us to be in the top six. But it is important to realise the difference between what is realistic and what is possible. Was it unrealistic that Leicester would win the Premier League? Yes, it was totally ridiculous. But was it possible? Yes, because it happened<br /><br />This is what I always tell my players: Don’t set goals. Don’t think ‘This is something that we have to reach’. In my first meeting with the group this summer, I said we would set no limits for this season. And if you give yourself a target then you give yourself a limit</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp was advised to sign Leroy Sane during his time at Borussia Dortmund]</b> I knew him early. He was more of a character because of his age and it was part of my job to mention the big talents of Germany to Jurgen. I made him aware of him for the first team of Dortmund, but he signed for Schalke. We should not forget how young he is. He’s still a talent and not a finished one.<br /><br />What he delivered so far is extraordinary. I’m a little bit surprised how consistent he’s been in recent weeks against big competition, but he has every talent, all the skills. I can’t speak about his character, but all the talents you need</p>

We’ve now achieved a promotion play-off spot two games before the end of the season and this is incredible, unbelievable.<br /><br />This <b>[squad]</b> is something very, very special we have together.

You can only manage your ambitions if you focus on yourself and try to work; this is what the players have done over the whole season and now they’re at Wembley.</p>

Over the season I thought we could do a little bit more, I thought around Christmas when we’d played everyone we had a chance. What happened is an unbelievable story - a fairytale<br /><br />We tried a lot of small details to bring this club forward - usually you need three or four years to do what we’ve done. I am so happy because when I arrived people said I had no experience, no experience of British football, no experience of players - I always had to fight against that. It’s proved experience is important but not everything. It’s heart and desire. We only wanted to play this season to our limits, and now we know where our limit is</p>

  <p><b>[Wagner excited to meet former mentor <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>]</b> I think I have a lot of calls to do to be fair. Maybe this is why I don’t like to get my head around it because I know how much work is in front of me. Of course I would like to have all of my players with me next season. If it is possible, we will see. I will speak with Jurgen for sure as well, not only about Danny but about what has happened. I will meet Jurgen on the sideline in the Premier League; it will be funny - when the game starts we are sometimes out of control - but we will see<br /><br />He was an outstanding player before this season. Aaron is the heart of our game. He’s able to decelerate when necessary or accelerate the game if you need it. He’s so confident and calm on the ball. He’s developed his fighting attitude since he arrived, because he arrived as a number 10 and usually number 10s are not the best fighters. Since he’s played a bit deeper, he has a great fighting attitude. He is one of many outstanding players we had this season and we are very happy that he was with us. Maybe this is a further phone call I have to do</p>

  <p><b>[David Wagner believes psychological problems are to blame for Schalke’s sluggish return to <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> action]</b> The game started badly. We weren’t dangerous enough with all the possession we had. We were really tense in the second half. Conceding goals from individual errors is typical of the situation we find ourselves in right now. Now we need to support the lads so they start playing with confidence again. We are making too many individual errors leading to goals. A lot of it is psychological.<br /><br /><b>[Suat Serdar is facing another spell on the sidelines after he suffered another injury]</b> He suffered an injury to the head of his fibula. I can’t say right now how serious it is. He is undergoing scans at the moment</p>
