  <p><b>[Meet David Wagner: Klopp’s best man preparing an FA Cup giant-killing for Guardiola]</b> OK, I think there is no doubt that we are the underdogs on Saturday. But - I’ve said this sometimes before - this is football. Huddersfield Town plays against Man City - is it realistic that Huddersfield Town will win this football match? No, this is unrealistic. This is totally unrealistic in my opinion!<br /><br />Is it possible? Yes! It is possible, because it’s football and in football, nobody knows the result before a game. This is, I think, what we have to make sure that we know - usually it’s unrealistic, but it’s football, and this is why it’s possible<br /><br />If we look at our competitors in the Championship - their individual quality, their experience, the money they have - then, in my opinion, it is completely unrealistic for us to be in the top six. But it is important to realise the difference between what is realistic and what is possible. Was it unrealistic that Leicester would win the Premier League? Yes, it was totally ridiculous. But was it possible? Yes, because it happened<br /><br />This is what I always tell my players: Don’t set goals. Don’t think ‘This is something that we have to reach’. In my first meeting with the group this summer, I said we would set no limits for this season. And if you give yourself a target then you give yourself a limit</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp was advised to sign Leroy Sane during his time at Borussia Dortmund]</b> I knew him early. He was more of a character because of his age and it was part of my job to mention the big talents of Germany to Jurgen. I made him aware of him for the first team of Dortmund, but he signed for Schalke. We should not forget how young he is. He’s still a talent and not a finished one.<br /><br />What he delivered so far is extraordinary. I’m a little bit surprised how consistent he’s been in recent weeks against big competition, but he has every talent, all the skills. I can’t speak about his character, but all the talents you need</p>

Over the season I thought we could do a little bit more, I thought around Christmas when we’d played everyone we had a chance. What happened is an unbelievable story - a fairytale<br /><br />We tried a lot of small details to bring this club forward - usually you need three or four years to do what we’ve done. I am so happy because when I arrived people said I had no experience, no experience of British football, no experience of players - I always had to fight against that. It’s proved experience is important but not everything. It’s heart and desire. We only wanted to play this season to our limits, and now we know where our limit is</p>

  <p><b>[Wagner excited to meet former mentor <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>]</b> I think I have a lot of calls to do to be fair. Maybe this is why I don’t like to get my head around it because I know how much work is in front of me. Of course I would like to have all of my players with me next season. If it is possible, we will see. I will speak with Jurgen for sure as well, not only about Danny but about what has happened. I will meet Jurgen on the sideline in the Premier League; it will be funny - when the game starts we are sometimes out of control - but we will see<br /><br />He was an outstanding player before this season. Aaron is the heart of our game. He’s able to decelerate when necessary or accelerate the game if you need it. He’s so confident and calm on the ball. He’s developed his fighting attitude since he arrived, because he arrived as a number 10 and usually number 10s are not the best fighters. Since he’s played a bit deeper, he has a great fighting attitude. He is one of many outstanding players we had this season and we are very happy that he was with us. Maybe this is a further phone call I have to do</p>

I’m sure our fans will be very happy to see him back!<br /><br />As I said many times last season, Aaron was right at the heart of our team. When he played well, we usually played well - and won!<br /><br />His performances for us understandably brought a lot of interest in him this summer, so it is a big statement that Aaron wants to return to us. I think he understands that playing so regularly for us at a good level improved his game too and now he has the chance to be a regular in the Premier League; something that is very exciting for every player</p>

He scores goals, creates them for others and is always a threat when he’s on the pitch, so I’m very happy to welcome him to the club.<br /><br />To have played over 250 games at just 25 years old is not normal; it’s great experience for a player who still has lots of space to improve. I have spoken to Tom and he has a massive desire to come to <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield Town</a> and play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.

Our fans will have seen in our games against Fulham last season what a good player he is and I know his abilities will suit our style of play very well<br /><br />Scott is a good physical presence and is a very capable defender, plus he adds a lot going forward. He shows good football intelligence to time his forward runs and can setup goals for teammates and scoring them himself.<br /><br />We already have a very good left back in Chris Lowe and a real young talent in Tareiq Holmes-Dennis, but as we enter our first <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season it is so important to have competition and the ability to rotate our side, as we did so successfully last season</p>
