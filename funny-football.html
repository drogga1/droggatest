But that’s up there with the ultimate. I’ll give all the awards back, everything. I wouldn’t swap [Ranieri’s words] for anything. That’ll do me that. We were in Bulgaria, so we managed to find somewhere that was showing the game. We watched the game, which was incredible. For him to say that on Match of the Day … wow. Wow</p>

  <p>[A Barnsley Fire Station spokesperson confirms that a Tykes supporter who had a bit too much to drink needed to be rescued after waking up on a toilet and making a failed attempt to escape from a locked-up Oakwell following Barnsley’s 1-0 loss to Fleetwood Town at the weekend] We had to get the ladder to get him down. He had no shoes on and had lost his mobile phone and his hat. He was more bothered about his hat though, he seemed a smartly dressed lad. I know Barnsley lost again but it can’t be that bad. It’s slightly embarrassing for the lad but it’s a lesson for him I’m sure, he’ll not be quick to forget it</p>

  <p>[University of Leicester geology student Richard Hoyle explains the seismic activity near the King Power Stadium] A few days after we installed the equipment at the school and were analysing data collected, we noticed large peaks on the seismogram during football matches being held in the stadium nearby. A closer look showed us there was a strong correlation between the exact time Leicester scored at home and the occurrence of the large seismic signals. We concluded our equipment was measuring small earthquakes produced by the sudden energy release by the cheering Leicester fans celebrating at the moment a goal was scored</p>

  <p>[Rochdale’s Callum Camps discovered during the game that he had left his car lights on. However, he went on to open the scoring in the 1-1 draw with Gillingham] I was listening to the PA because the ball was out of play, and as soon as I heard the reg I was thinking: ‘That’s my number plate’. I thought I’d blocked someone in, so I said to [team-mate] Jamie Allen: ‘That’s my car, that,’ and he said: ‘What?’ I said again: ‘That’s my car they’ve just called out.’ I looked over to Kevin Gibbins [the head of sports science] and said: ‘My car’s just been read out, can you sort it out?’</p>

Yes, I was shocked, it’s the strangest thing I have ever experienced in football. I asked the referee, ‘What, am I not allowed to break wind a little?’ ‘No,’ he replied. I don’t get it but maybe he thought I farted in my hand and threw the fart at him. But I did not</p>

It could have been worse as the cow ran at him for a second time but he managed to get out of the way.

  <p>[Hemel Hempstead Town match reporter Allan Mitchell describes an amusing moment in which the referee mistook Sanchez Watt’s name for dissent] The referee kept asking Hershel for his name, to which he replied ‘Watt’. The conversation then continued along the lines of: ‘Name?’, ‘Watt’, ‘NAME?’ ‘Watt’, etc. After a few seconds, the frustrated official clearly felt the mick was being taken and produced a red card. At this point, Hemel skipper Jordan Parkes joined the conversation and, with the player, explained that his name was indeed Watt and no mickey was being taken. The referee, to his credit then realised the error, saw the funny side and reversed his decision. He then trotted over to our bench and to East Thurrock’s to explain</p>

  <p>[Paul Maguire on odd ways to officiate] One referee in our local league, upon issuing a red card to a substitute for calling him a joke (me), then decided our team needed to also lose an outfield player as a result. Confusion as well as mirth reigned as he wandered around the park looking for someone – anyone - to clarify the law. It must have made him somewhat hungry, as at half-time he drove off into town to McDonald’s before returning replenished for a delayed second half. Not the same ref, however, who gave a corner as a consequence of encroachment on a penalty kick. Ah, small-town New Zealand football</p>

The phrase kept turning over in my head, and I’m well aware that I didn’t come up with it. A quick bit of investigation revealed it was from a Fiver published in December 2014. Congratulations. You have been a part of my internal monologue for almost four years. I loathe myself</p>

Dad is like, ‘oh, that’s nice’, and gives one of the gentlemen his phone for this stranger to take a photo of mum and dad on this train from Manchester. The stranger looks weirdly at my dad, and says [with a French accent] ‘No, no, no, I am asking if you would like a photo with me, sir?’ My dad looks at my mum like ‘who on earth does this guy think he is?’. But also my dad is mega-polite and obliges to be in the photo. Having read through all of these messages, my dad sends through the photo, and asks ‘Nathan, you wouldn’t happen to know who this is?’</p>

We were still trying to work out what had happened when Mo arrived. He’d seen one of the boys had hurt himself and he had the decency to drive back into the close to check that he was OK. No-one could believe it. Everyone was gobsmacked. Mo asked if the boys were all right and gave them a big hug which was what they both needed. They were made up and Louis forgot all about being injured</p>
