  <p><b>[It was the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Blaugrana</a> who had first approached Mallorca about signing the Palma native. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> even met the islanders’ €4.5m asking price and Asensio reportedly even travelled to Catalunya to go house-hunting. However, when Mallorca asked that the money be paid up front in one instalment, the deal collapsed. It was at this point that tennis legend, Mallorca native and massive Madrid fan Rafael Nadal intervened]</b> Rafa phoned (Real president) <a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a> and told him that they could not let me escape. In the winter, my agent called me to say <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> were interested. Then Florentino called before a game to tell me I was going to be a <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> player. Everything happened in one day: we travelled to Madrid, signed the contract, visited the Bernabeu and we returned to Mallorca to finish the season. It was all fast and intense, but the satisfaction was huge<br /><br /><b>[his dip in form could be partially linked to <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>’s departure as coach and the decision to replace the Frenchman with <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Julen Lopetegui</a>, and then <a href="santiago-solari.html">Santiago Solari</a>]</b> I can be more decisive on the right flank or in the middle. If I play more on the right or in the middle, I have more chances to be decisive and get more involved<br /><br /><b>[Of course, he will face stiff competition for a starting spot from <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> and the outstanding young Brazilian wingers <a href="rodrygo.html">Rodrygo</a> and <a href="vinicius-junior.html">Vinicius</a> Junior]</b> I feel very good. My adaptation has been good. The knee is responding well and the truth is that I am physically very well. I am back on the training pitch with my team-mates and that is the important thing.

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo is once again being linked with a move away from Real Madrid]</b> I can’t imagine playing without him. Ronaldo has been, is and will be very important for us. Real Madrid and him always have to go together.<br /><br />We’re different players. I like to drop a little to receive the ball and have more contact with it, being less of a finisher. Everyone evolves as a footballer through learning and we’ll see in the future what position I play<br /><br />I don’t know. I don’t control the way the prices in the market are, but it’s true that it’ll have gone up quite a bit since I signed. These prices are worked out by the clubs and by circumstance. I don’t know what I’d be worth<br /><br />The Zidane exit took us all a little but by surprise, but my experience with him has been really good. He has trusted me a lot and we have a really good relationship. From the start I had things clear in my mind, knowing what I was coming to. I have worked hard to have these opportunities and he gave me them. It has been the same with Lopetegui. From the start, it was really good as he spoke to me a lot and demanded a lot of me too. This is really important for me</p>

  <p><b>[Marco Asensio sees his future at Real Madrid]</b> Why not, for sure. At the end of the day, of course I want to continue to be successful at Madrid, I want to be important here, I have never hidden from that. I have been a Madridista since I was young, I always wanted to play for Real Madrid and now that I have the opportunity to be important here I want to take it<br /><br /> won’t lie, my favourite is 10 and whenever I’ve been able to I’ve worn that. Now it’s in the hands of Luka <b>[Modric]</b> who still has many years ahead at Real Madrid but of course I would like to have it in the future<br /><br /><b>[Reports have claimed that Asensio may be tempted to follow Ronaldo to Juventus]</b> No, they don’t come to me. That’s for my agent. I don’t think about anything other than focusing at Real Madrid. I have made it clear that I want to succeed at Real Madrid and continue here.<br /><br />It’s speculation. We will see if anyone comes, but right now it’s just speculation</p>

  <p><b>[How Marco Asensio has failed to explode at Real Madrid in post-Ronaldo era]</b> I can be more decisive on the right flank or in the middle. If I play more on the right or in the middle, I have more chances to be decisive and get more involved.<br /><br />I don’t think it’s for me to carry the team - there are players who are much more experienced, have more years playing under their belts and more status than I have and they’re the ones who have to lead the team. If those expectations exist it’s because I have proven it on the pitch and I deserve it, I suppose<br /><br />You want to do everything in the five or 10 minutes they give you, so if things don’t go well for you, you have to be strong mentally</p>
