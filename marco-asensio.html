  <p><b>[Real Madrid midfielder Marco Asensio lamented his bad luck but has vowed to bounce back after suffering a serious knee injury]</b> I began this season with renewed hopes, looking after even the last tiny detail of my preparation so that this would be a great season for all the Madrid fans and for myself. At the highest points in life, you can have an unexpected stroke of bad luck and suddenly everything changes. It is hard to accept everything these days, but I begin another personal challenge in my life. I still trust that this will be a great season. Your messages of support and loving gestures give me even more strength to face this challenge. Heartfelt thanks to all of you for your support. See you soon</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid attacker Asensio ready for <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> run-in after knee injury]</b> I feel very good. The first week was different when I returned to training, being with my team-mates. My adaptation has been good. The knee is responding well and the truth is that I am physically very well. The wait has been very long. I have worked a lot and, above all, I have had a lot of patience, because seeing your colleagues train every day while being in the physiotherapy room was something that hurt me a lot. I am already with my colleagues in the field and that is the important thing. The wait was worth it<br /><br />We really want <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> to start and to face those games that decide a title. We know that they are life-or-death matches.
