  <p><b>[Curacao manager Remko Bicentini said last week after his team’s win over Honduras]</b> We learned from the Gold Cup in 2017. We have good games against good teams, Mexico, Jamaica, El Salvador. We had chances but we didn’t score a goal. We learned that we must score a goal. Now we have more routine and that’s why we now can win in the Gold Cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Remko Bicentini has continued a project started by <a href="patrick-kluivert.html">Patrick Kluivert</a>, emphasizing beautiful football but also a good time during international breaks]</b> Every team that comes to play here, they say they’re jealous of the bus. It’s different to play against us, and it’s actually very difficult to get a bus like this. We want the players to enjoy, and the bus is part of that. Sometimes they ask me if I want a big, fancy-looking bus with air conditioning and everything. But the players like this one. We like this one, and we’re winning<br /><br />I like playing nice football. We have very good players who can play in the system and who like to play in this kind of system. What we’re doing now is making it better, to try and perfect the system and to keep going</p>
