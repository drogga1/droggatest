  <p><b>[Mexico could make Gold Cup statement with big win against Curacao]</b> We’re going to play our own style. We’re dealing with players that have left us, but we’ll be able to play our own style. We have a group that’s a little inexperienced, but they also showed they can do the job. Of course, Cuco Martina is a player with experience who plays in the Premier League and we will miss him in games like this. We’re talking about defense but on the other hand we have created enough chances to score goals</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico makes statement vs. Curacao - but not the one El Tri needed]</b> We did for sure. Especially in the first 15 minute when we created a lot of chances to score, in which we should have made it an easier game on ourselves. But we didn’t score.</p>

  <p><b>[Curacao manager Remko Bicentini said last week after his team’s win over Honduras]</b> We learned from the Gold Cup in 2017. We have good games against good teams, Mexico, Jamaica, El Salvador. We had chances but we didn’t score a goal. We learned that we must score a goal. Now we have more routine and that’s why we now can win in the Gold Cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Remko Bicentini has continued a project started by <a href="patrick-kluivert.html">Patrick Kluivert</a>, emphasizing beautiful football but also a good time during international breaks]</b> Every team that comes to play here, they say they’re jealous of the bus. It’s different to play against us, and it’s actually very difficult to get a bus like this. We want the players to enjoy, and the bus is part of that. Sometimes they ask me if I want a big, fancy-looking bus with air conditioning and everything. But the players like this one. We like this one, and we’re winning<br /><br />I like playing nice football. We have very good players who can play in the system and who like to play in this kind of system. What we’re doing now is making it better, to try and perfect the system and to keep going</p>
