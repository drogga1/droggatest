He has a young family, he likes to spend time with them, so why should he go out partying with the lads every few minutes?<br /><br />If I ever had a problem with a team-mate, I went to them directly and told them to their face, but to go to the media and try to belittle a team-mate and say he doesn’t like going out was not necessary.<br /><br />Why would <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Courtois</a> do that?

  <p><b>[Tottenham can win Champions League but must seize the moment]</b> <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> could win the Champions League this season, but they will have to answer some big questions if they are going to get close to achieving that<br /><br />They are only a couple of wins and a couple of draws away from the final, but only if they start playing to their potential again. If they can get back on form, this is the season to have a go at the Champions League as there are no outstanding teams in the competition this season. <br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were the team everyone in Europe feared a couple of months ago, but they are off the boil, even though they keep winning matches without playing too well. <br /><br />City look like a different team in the Champions League and conceded far too many goals and, with some of the big European teams like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> no longer the force they once were, an opportunity is there for a team like <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to have a real go at this competition.<br /><br />To do that, they need to believe in themselves and seize the big moments when they come along. Players like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> know how to seize that moment and always stand up when it matters. Now we have to see whether <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s players are ready to rise to that challenge.<br /><br /><b>[Pochettino stated last month that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> may be up to 10 years away from winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title]</b> People are asking whether those comments mean he wants to be there for 10 years to make it matter or is he saying he doesn’t want to wait that long to win something, but I just think it was a very clear message to his players to step up and prove they can be winners<br /><br />If you go over some of Mauricio’s comments over the last year or so, you’ll find some odd ones in there. What I think these comments are all about is getting a message to his players, as he feels they are not sensing the moments when they need to put the foot down and make a statement.<br /><br />The message he gave to his players ahead of their game at <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> a few weeks back was this is a cup final and that was a clear effort to get his players up for that game. They had a chance to get into the mix for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title in that game and <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> wanted his players to realise how high the stakes were.<br /><br />It didn’t work because they lost 2-1 at Turf Moor and you could see how much it got to him as he confronted the match officials after the game and ended up getting a touchline ban for his troubles.<br /><br />He wanted to get the point across and his players didn’t respond. Some of their performances this season have befitted a team that are destined to finish third or fourth and he wants more than that, but do these <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> players have the ability or the mental strength to give him what he wants?<br /><br />I think they do and, if I’m being honest, I just think they have massively over-achieved this season and that’s why I think this criticism is a little bit harsh. They have stumbled across a position in the league that meant they suddenly had a chance to compete with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, but they don’t seem to be able to do that at this moment.<br /><br />sIf you put the value of their first XI together, it would not be far behind the best teams in Europe. People say <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> haven’t spent the money, but on any given weekend, they could have <a href="danny-rose.html">Danny Rose</a>, Erik Lamela, <a href="eric-dier.html">Eric Dier</a>, <a href="victor-wanyama.html">Victor Wanyama</a> on the bench and not many teams have that much quality in reserve.</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jenas says Mauricio Pochettino could be lured away from Tottenham if a crazy offer is tabled]</b> If Mauricio gets a crazy job offer - for example, if Real Madrid came in for him, which is quite possible - who turns down Real Madrid? If he went there and won trophies, he would be just like a lot of other Real Madrid managers. But if he could win something big at Tottenham, it would be very special after the amount of time and effort he’s put into building the team. If he is going to leave, he deserves to go with a winner’s medal in his pocket, but the fact is Tottenham last won a trophy in 2008 - and I can remember it because I was playing.<br /><br />What I do know, from speaking to the players, is that they are desperate to break the drought - but trophies are not easy to come by when Manchester City and Liverpool are as strong as they are in every competition. And I know they are desperate to get that first piece of silverware, and get that monkey off their back. Reaching the Champions League final was great, but they will look back and wonder if they let it slip through their fingers and they could have done more. First and foremost, their main objective will be top four and playing Champions League football on a regular basis</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jenas says Tottenham should not be considering parting with Christian Eriksen for any less than £50 million]</b> If Tottenham are offered anything less than £50m for Christian Eriksen this month, then they should keep him - even if it means he leaves for nothing next summer. Eriksen’s importance to the team was quite clear even just in Saturday’s win against Aston Villa, when he came on in the last half-an-hour with Spurs 1-0 down. I know Dele Alli was injured and Son Heung-min was suspended, but they needed Eriksen to get back into that game and for me he gives them something different to every other player in Tottenham’s squad. I think Spurs have had a very good summer transfer window in terms of the players they have brought in, but it would change my outlook on the strength of their squad if they lose Eriksen - and certain other players - now. I hope Eriksen stays, because he is so valuable to their chances of winning a trophy under Mauricio Pochettino. Spurs might see last week’s loan signing Giovani lo Celso as a direct replacement for Eriksen, so they are ready if the right bid comes in, but they will be much stronger if he stays<br /><br /><b>[With speculation still mounting around Eriksen]</b> If they do get £50m, they will have done wonders - but any offers they get before the end of this month, when the transfer window closes in the rest of Europe, are likely to be a lot less than that. In terms of the difference it could make to Tottenham’s season, there are other players who I would be more willing to off-load to off-set some of the money they could lose out on by keeping Eriksen - Erik Lamela and Georges-Kevin Nkoudou for example. Part of it comes down to what the player himself is thinking, of course.<br /><br />Eriksen is 27 and said earlier this summer that he is at the stage of his career where he ‘might want to try something new’, and Real Madrid are reportedly interested in him. But he also spoke about the possibility of signing a new Spurs contract and of course he could always let his existing deal run down, knowing next year he can go for free. That is a win-win situation for him, because there would be no issues over which club meets Tottenham’s asking price. They can get him for free, and his wages will reflect that, so I don’t think he would sulk if he does end up staying with Spurs for another year</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jenas considers moves for Paulo Dybala and Bruno Fernandes to be a statement of intent from Tottenham]</b> Buying-wise, I was pleased with Tottenham’s summer transfer window despite them failing to get the Paulo Dybala deal over the line. When I heard they had agreed a £64m fee with Juventus for the Argentina international, I started to get excited. It was a shame the move fell through, because Dybala could have helped to bridge the gap from Spurs finishing comfortably in the top four to getting a lot closer to Liverpool and Manchester City in the title race - assuming they kept hold of Eriksen too. But the thing Spurs fans should be getting excited about is that a bid was made - along with a big offer for Bruno Fernandes at Sporting, by all accounts.<br /><br />I don’t think the intention was to buy both of them, but they certainly wanted to land one of them. It shows the mindset of the club that they gave it a go, and it is exactly the approach that fans have been craving. It makes me think that, come January, they can go again, or target that really big signing next summer in the way Manchester City and Liverpool have done in the past<br /><br /><b>[Jenas believes Tottenham are still in need of a few fresh faces, with uncertainty surrounding the likes of Christian Eriksen, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld leaving them with boxes to tick]</b> I am not sure Ryan Sessegnon is going to turn out to be left-back, but Spurs already have Ben Davies, who is decent, and <b>[Danny]</b> Rose too. If they can get Rose focused, then he is still one of the best left-backs in Europe. I am more worried about the right-back position after losing Kieran Trippier to Atletico Madrid because Pochettino does not seem to have much faith in Kyle Walker-Peters and things have not worked out for Serge Aurier. It already feels like defence is not the strength it was for Tottenham a couple of years ago - they lost 13 Premier League games last season, which is a concern. Then you have the situation with Vertonghen being left out of the squad completely on Saturday, which was very strange. Reading between the lines, it would not surprise me if he left in the next couple of weeks. Even if Vertonghen stays for now, he and Alderweireld are both into the final year of their contracts, and both over 30. They have been mainstays of the club for several seasons now but there is a chance neither of them will still be there this time next year. So, this is a process that doesn’t stop and, come January, Spurs need to have a plan. Otherwise they could be in a position where they need to make several signings in the same area of the team in the next summer window, which is exactly the scenario they want to avoid.</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jenas took aim at <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>’s performance against <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> on Wednesday night]</b> He’s unrecognisable. He really is. He’s had a couple of moments here where, I know for a matter of fact, that the manager has looked to the bench and said ‘we need to get him off’. You have bad games as a player, don’t get me wrong. It happens, and you just have to put them to the side. He’s had plenty of great games for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> but tonight’s not one of them. He’s standing out like a sore thumb in terms of how bad his display has actually been because the team’s not playing well on top of that as well. The thing with Christian is, he will take risks with the ball because that’s what you want him to do. You want him to try and get those balls behind defences, but it’s the simple stuff he’s getting wrong today, and that’s the worrying thing. Honestly, he looks a bit tired. He looks shattered</p>

They had a moment to figure out what they wanted to be, how far they wanted to go. You can lose games of football, but this is a battering from a top European club who have been there and done it on many occasions. It has been a tough couple of months for this group of players, this football club<br /><br />These are the types of results where do you start to look in the dressing room, you start to ask those questions - are they reacting to what is being asked of them? This scoreline tells me ‘no’ at the minute, this scoreline is a shocker. It’s the capitulation, it’s that moment of ‘it is not going great, let’s feel sorry for ourselves’. At what point do you say ‘no, the opposition are not scoring any more goals, it is not happening’?</p>

Sacking <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>, appointing <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> on double the money, spending tens of millions in the next couple of transfer window…. it’s all a huge gamble.<br /><br />Only if <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and his <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> squad deliver a trophy - the first for 11 years and counting - will it have succeeded. Players at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> are at the stage in their careers when they are thinking will silverware ever come?<br /><br />Now they have a man walking through the door who has every ingredient, every play, every way of doing it, to get over the line. I think the 11 months Jose has had out of the game since leaving <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> will have helped him reinvent his outlook to coaching. He is starting afresh, had a good look at it, and will be thinking this new generation needs something new.<br /><br /><a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> will have asked Daniel Levy: Are you going to open the cheque book? You can guarantee that come January and the summer, they are going to have a right go in the windows. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans will say to that: brilliant.<br /><br />But why not just back Mauricio in the first place. He earned that. It is annoying that he will come in on more money, get a bigger kitty… he could have done all those things for Mauricio. But he didn’t want to bet on him. Poch will have six month or a year out. He will get a top job. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. It will be a monster job. And he will probably come back and break Spurs’ hearts</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jenas says <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s stock is far too high for him to end up in charge at Arsenal]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is a huge football club and the wages would be great for Mauricio, but putting myself in his shoes, I think his stock will be far higher than that. The job that he did at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> puts him in a different bracket. If I was Mauricio I’d have six months off to recuperate after working non stop for six years at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. Come to the end of the season there’s a good chance that Man United, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and Madrid might ring. I know he mentioned he wouldn’t go to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> because of his Espanyol links, but there are a lot of huge clubs out there I think he can go to. The <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> job isn’t one that is that attractive to anyone right now<br /><br /><b>[Jenas added on Emery’s sacking at the Emirates]</b> The decision they’ve taken feels like a knee jerk reaction, there doesn’t seem to be any real planning behind what they’re doing. Are they just going to throw a load of names in the hat and go: ‘Is it <b>[Massimiliano]</b> <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a>, is it <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>, is it <b>[Carlos]</b> Ancelotti’.

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jenas says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> couldn’t trust <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> but fans won’t accept negativity]</b> I don’t blame Jose for playing the way he did against City, because of the way results went when he first took charge of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. He knew he had goals in his team so he went out and just let them play, and they had some crazy results in the first few weeks when they were winning by all sorts of scores<br /><br />That was never going to last. I could feel it coming where, in his mind, he went ‘enough is enough’. He could not trust his team to go out and score goals, especially when <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> got injured, so instead he started setting them up not to be beaten. That was clearly <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s approach against City on Sunday<br /><br />Look at Japhet Tanganga at left-back, for example. He was basically told ‘you are not going anywhere today’, so he had to stay back all game. It paid off for <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> in the end, but <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans will not allow that kind of negativity in every home game. So he still needs to work on his side’s style of play, but of course getting a result this way still has plenty of positives.<br /><br /><a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has been talking a lot about how his players lack confidence, which he probably did not expect when he arrived at the club. Well, getting through games like this one will give the players lots of belief, and we saw some other important signs too. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has sorted out <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>’s situation, by selling him to Inter, while <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Jan Vertonghen</a>, another player whose future is uncertain because he is out of the contract at the end of the season, was on the bench. I looked out on the pitch and there was not a <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> player out there whose focus I would be concerned about any more. Everyone was playing for the shirt, and giving everything</p>

He’s a spearhead for them with what he brings, his lack of respect for the opposition. You always felt like he was going to do something tonight.

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jenas agreed with <a href="chris-hughton.html">Hughton</a>’s verdict that <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> told why he did not produce ‘masterclass’ performance against Man City]</b> The statistics behind <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s win on Sunday might suggest it was another <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> masterclass. In reality it was more a story of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s missed chances. Yes, in the early stages <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> looked quite solid and strong, which is the way <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> likes to set his sides up in these big games, but City did what they always do and broke them down. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> showed character and hung in there thanks to a couple of big moments - the biggest one being Hugo Lloris’ first-half penalty save, which is when they might have started believing this could be their day. But if City were anything like as clinical in front of goal as they usually are, they would have put the game to bed long before <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Steven Bergwijn</a> put <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> ahead with their first shot at goal after 63 minutes</p>

  <p><b>[Jenas says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s stumbled into an era where his old methods don’t work]</b> A lot of <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s brilliance, as good as he was tactically and how much he changed things when he first came into the game, his biggest strength was in the mind and how he used to be able to galvanise a squad and make that ‘them against us’ mentality, get into certain individuals and make them raise their game by being elite in their mind.<br /><br />He would go into every single game making them believe that they are the best players in the world, making them feel like they are warriors going out onto the pitch.<br /><br />He was able to do that - when you look at the Inter performances, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> - you looked at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and they appeared mentality unbeatable, they were too strong at the time.<br /><br />My fear is that he has stumbled into an era where he cannot impose those same things on a new generation. They don’t react to those methods of maybe putting them down and expecting them to respond. We are talking about a completely different era of player.<br /><br />During his <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> days, he may have run into certain performances where for two weeks he may not have spoken to <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> because he felt like ‘you let me down’. Frank would have gone ‘I know how to put this right and I’m going to dig deep and get back on his good side’.<br /><br />I don’t think the players today respond well to that. His last job at United tells you that and I think right now we are seeing it as well</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jenas says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> has become overly negative at Tottenham]</b> It’s not a rant but what I will say is I will reserve judgement on Jose until the summer, until he brings in his new players because I think the players haven’t been good enough. What I don’t like about Jose at the minute is the negativity. I think he’s been far too negative in terms of the message he’s been sending out with the players. I know we’ve got injuries to <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a>, I know Son’s injured and now <b>[Steven]</b> <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Bergwijn</a>. But I think there needs to be a more positive structure going out to the players. And overall I still can’t see what the team are and how they’re trying to play. Are they a passing team? Are they a pressing team? Are they a team that plays deep and tries to counter attack? I don’t see from game to game, and I can’t tell you from game to game, what team he’s going to put out. He had the best part of six centre-halves playing against <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>. He has won everything there is to win in the game, so that’s quite a good reason why you’d want to go and play for him. He is a serial winner</p>
