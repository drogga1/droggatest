  <p><b>[Dele Alli lost his head during Tottenham’s Europa League clash with Gent, with a terrible challenge earning him a red card and widespread criticism]</b> It’s a shocker. Terrible, terrible challenge from Dele. He’s obviously disappointed that he didn’t get the free-kick there but to react in the way that he did, that’s just not on. It’s a leg-breaker. It’s frustration. He needs to control that emotion in the right way and that wasn’t it.</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino should resist the temptation to join Real Madrid]</b> It’s natural that Pochettino is sought after. It’s natural that, when you play well, the best and the biggest clubs come for you. It’s happening with Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Christian Eriksen and all the Tottenham players because they are playing attractive football and doing the right things. And that’s been possible because of one man - Pochettino. But he doesn’t have to rush to go to Real Madrid. He’ll keep growing at Spurs and I think there’s a long project for him here. He feels the club is backing and supporting him. When it stops, he will look elsewhere, but until then he will continue to manage Spurs.<br /><br /><b>[On Son Heungmin]</b> I watched him when he was playing in Germany and I knew he would succeed in the Premier League. When I see his attributes, I thought he’s kind of built for the Premier League. Did I expect him to be as successful as the level he is playing at right now? Probably not. I’ve said on numerous occasions this year that Son is the most important player, not because of versatility, but because of his productivity, his goals last year and this year</p>

  <p><b>[Dele Alli is replaceable at Tottenham]</b> If I was going to guess, I would say Dele Alli might go. I don’t think that is something that Spurs fans will want to hear, because he is a very popular player. But if the new stadium does exert some financial pressures on the club, Dele is the kind of player that Spurs could replace. Dele is without doubt a brilliant player and I am sure he will go on and play for another top team, but in the area he plays in he is replaceable.<br /><br /><b>[On Toby Alderweireld]</b> He is an absolutely incredible player and I would say he is someone that Spurs should do anything and everything they can to keep hold of him. But he seems like he wants to move on and there will certainly be no shortage of suitors for him<br /><br /><b>[On Harry Kane]</b> Although he is being widely acknowledged as the best out-and-out striker in the world right now, and rumours of a move to Spain keep surfacing, I think he will stay at least for a season or two because of the new Spurs stadium. I think Daniel Levy will have to break the bank to keep him at the club, but I think Harry will be the one player they do that for, simply because he is worth it</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham have been advised to consider parting with Manchester United target Toby Alderweireld]</b> I love Toby, he is a phenomenal player and Tottenham are better when he is in the team, but he is approaching his 30th birthday and I know how Daniel Levy operates at Spurs when a player gets towards that age. The wage demands, what they can afford and where they need to prioritise and maybe Alderweireld doesn’t fit into that structure. Also, when I said that Spurs had to do everything they could to hang on to Alderweireld, I was not thinking Davinson Sanchez would have had as good as season as he has just had. That Spurs defence looked pretty solid for most of the campaign and Sanchez was a key part of that, so the club may look at how much it would cost to keep Alderweireld and believe they have a better value for money option in Sanchez. In many respects, I probably agree with that. I would love Toby to stay because I believe he is the best defender in the world when he is right at it, but we will see where it goes from here. I’m sure there will be plenty of big clubs trying to sign him, with Manchester United believed to be among those<br /><br /><b>[On Mauricio Pochettino]</b> The Real Madrid job is always likely to be the one that takes Mauricio away from Spurs, but I’m not sure this is the right moment for him. There is no rush. He has the ability to go on and achieve something historic with this Tottenham side and that must appeal to him. Two or three years down the line, he might feel as if there is nowhere else for him to go with Tottenham and then he can look to go to Real Madrid or the other big clubs and have a real go at winning the Champions League and major trophies. The new stadium looks amazing, they are back in the Champions League, he had a lot of power and influence at Tottenham and that is a lot to walk away from. There are so many factors why he signed that contract and now we see what happens</p>

  <p><b>[Dele Alli’s raw figures of 14 goals and 17 assists in 50 matches during the 2017-18 campaign]</b> I disagree that it has been a disappointing season for Alli. There are certain things people don’t take into account when it comes to Dele. Number one is how young he is. The guy is younger than Harry Winks and we give Winks the freedom of being young and developing. He is a young player and he is still giving assists, he is still scoring goals. And in my opinion he was playing in a worse Spurs team this season than last year. Tottenham lost probably two of the best full-backs in Europe, with <b>[Danny]</b> Rose being injured and <b>[Kyle]</b> Walker going to Manchester City. <b>[Toby]</b> Alderweireld was injured for a large portion of the season too. Add that to the fact that they have moved away from home into Wembley. So the club and the team have had to deal with a lot. Which is why what they have achieved, finishing third, is brilliant. And Dele has been within that, he’s had special moments. Yes, he has had a bit of a dip at times, a dip in form, but I would put it down to a kind of pattern within his play. He went through a little stage where he was giving the ball away quite a bit, but he got over it.<br /><br />He is the confident type, he has that arrogance about him to take the game and say: ‘Alright, give me the ball, I can get the job done. It makes me angry when I see people having a go at him because of this season where they will say: ‘He has fallen well below’. Well, you might want to have a look at where his standards were before, because they were way higher than most players in the league. In my opinion, he was getting back to that towards the end of the season and I think it was another strong year for him</p>

  <p><b>[England’s attack can be the best in the world]</b> At the minute, everyone is obsessed with saying England’s midfield has a lack of creativity. But there are a lot of teams you can go through who are not as strong as they used to be, ­missing a few key figures, or their ­defence is a bit shaky. I tend to want to look at the ­positives with England, and that is our forward line. It can be the best in the world if we click and find the right channels to provide Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Marcus Rashford and co. So we can dare to dream. We can expect a positive ­competition. This England team can produce a World Cup we can watch, cheer and be proud of the team for once.<br /><br />The competition for places in this England squad can only be good for everybody. I like that everyone has to be ready. Everyone is on their toes. Some might argue Southgate should have a rigid first XI bedded down by now. But if you are at a World Cup and fear you won’t get a chance, that’s a problem</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jenas thinks England can reach the latter stages of the World Cup]</b> It would be a massive surprise to me if England don’t get to the quarter-finals. The team seem to be in a good place, when we play the tough games, we seem to be able to nullify and take the sting out of those teams. When you look back at the games against Brazil and Germany, we have faced Germany a few times in recent years and people expected us to get beat by a few more, but we have stood strong. I think Southgate can set up his team in that way, to be defensive as well. The only thing that would be disappointing is if we do not at least make the quarter-finals. And anything over that would be a massive success..<br /><br />England are missing a world-class centre-half, a world-class central midfielder. I think the ability to control a game in those midfield areas. The players we have are a bit more energetic and robust, a bit more combative, rather than the ones that say, ‘Okay it is a hot day today, we are keeping the ball and you are going to chase it’. But Southgate does have the ability to adapt his formation to help us. I think on the top end of the pitch, nobody is worried, but when you look at the goalkeeper, centre-backs and that midfield area. We have got good players, don’t get me wrong, but I would say that they are the areas where we are lacking something. The word leader gets battered around every major tournament. We had Terry, we had Rio, we had Paul Ince, Terry Butcher, we have had all the leaders. And, until this day, none of them have lifted the World Cup since Bobby Moore</p>

  <p><b>[England face tall task in stopping world’s ‘best’ midfielder Luka Modric]</b> I’ve not met many players as driven as Luka, and I’ve seen even fewer who are as talented as him.<br /><br />He would go into areas just in front of the full-backs where, if I was playing against him, I would think, ‘I am going to go out there and mark you. But he would get the ball and all of a sudden he would be at you - and past you. Every time I thought I had him pinned down, he just got away from me. I’ve seen him do the same thing time and time again at this World Cup. So it is going to be hard for England to shut him down on Wednesday because he is quicker than most people think, and a lot stronger too. For a player who is only 5ft 6in, he has got the biggest calves I have ever seen in my life<br /><br />When you consider how well balanced he is, I just don’t see a better player in that area of the pitch anywhere on the planet right now. Bearing in mind he has won the Champions League four times with Real, I don’t think he always gets the wider accolades he deserves. That is probably because he does not get more goals. He has got two at this World Cup, but throughout his career he has never scored in big numbers, and that is something some people use to judge how good a player is. I think differently. Like his Real Madrid team-mate Toni Kroos, Spain’s Andres Iniesta or another Croat, Ivan Rakitic, Luka is a rhythm-type player who sets the tempo of games and gives his team control of them</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham may have been able to keep Toby Alderweireld out of the clutches of Manchester United]</b> I worry about that situation. I think if anybody is going to be gone in terms of the window still being open in Europe, he would be the one that possibly does go. I’ve always hoped he would be the one that stayed but I get Toby’s situation. He’s coming to the end of his career, he wants that big contract, he deserves that big contract and he’s going to get that big contract. And if Tottenham aren’t the club to do it, he’ll wait and get it elsewhere</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino would likely swap Tottenham for Manchester United if given the chance]</b> I think they’ve been after him for a long time to be honest with you. It’d be a huge test. I think deep down that’s the one Pochettino wants. There’s only United and Real Madrid that I think really take his fancy. When you think about it, Jurgen Klopp’s not going anywhere at Liverpool. Chelsea change their manager every two minutes but the Tottenham and Chelsea thing would ruin everything he’s done at Spurs. He already said he won’t go to Barcelona because of the links with Espanyol. There’s just two clubs really. I know you’ve got Bayern, PSG and so on but I think he’d prefer to stay in the Premier League or go back to La Liga. If that did happen <b>[Mourinho leaves Man Utd]</b>, it would not surprise me if United go really hard for Pochettino. And, given what’s happened at Spurs, I’d be surprised if he stayed.<br /><br />The only sticking point for United is he’s invested so many years at Tottenham. I always say to people the way he’s loved by players, handles the football club and handles himself - you don’t see him moan too much - I reckon all the biggest clubs in the world want Pochettino to manage them. It’s on his terms when he wants to push that button. It’s whether he feels there’s a rush and a need in his career to go down that road. I’m almost certain if he left Tottenham without winning anything, it would leave a horrible taste in his mouth. He’d be thinking: ‘Yes, I had a good time, but what did I actually do there?’. The answer would be he didn’t win a thing. It would surprise me to see him leave without winning anything because Manchester United and Real are always going to be there whenever he wants the job</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jenas thinks that the Ballon d’Or has overlooked some great creative players due to its focus on goal-scorers like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi]</b> You would like to think so <b>[that others can compete for the Ballon d’Or]</b>. I feel like we are in an era where there is a lack of respect to other footballers, even in light of what Messi and Ronaldo have done. What they have done is amazing but I feel like at the start of the season we just say whoever is best out of Messi and Ronaldo, gets the award. When you consider that players like Andres Iniesta or Xavi never won the Ballon d’Or then no one can. These two players, Messi and Ronaldo, don’t seem human and have had great seasons but if you really look at others players. Like Modric this year, <b>[Franck]</b> Ribery for Bayern a few years ago could have got it and he didn’t get a sniff.<br /><br />Now Kante is in that scenario, no matter what he does, he will get some recognition but never THE recognition for what he does. Even off the back of winning the World Cup, someone like Paul Pogba will get more plaudits. He had a great World Cup as well, but there’s a popularity thing as part of it. I just watch football but the personality side of it is big too. <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba announced with Stormzy upon signing for Manchester United and the haircuts, I loved all that stuff. I came from an era where that would be unacceptable, where you kind of got told what to do. He puffs out his chest and he says, this is me, this is my style. You look at Kante, he looks like the shyest man in the world and from what I know from people who know him, he is extremely humble. There’s a lot to like about both but when it comes to getting noticed then Pogba is always going to be at the front. Pogba sells more shirts and he is big on social media. Kante has had great credit so far, but I don’t think he will ever win the Ballon d’Or.<br /><br /><b>[He looked to Arsenal’s example in how not to act after building a new ground]</b> I just feel that Wembley isn’t an issue either when they started there or at the moment. They will be a little disappointed to not be in their new stadium and dressing room and having that drive to White Hart Lane. It is back to business with the win versus Fulham. I like everything about the new stadium. I did the virtual tour. I have spoken to the club to get a couple of seats in one of the lounges. My mother is a massive Spurs fan, I am always working weekends, so they will be for her mostly. I am looking forward to that new era. When I first signed for Tottenham, I was part of the development for that club and I knew that I was taking the club from battling mid-table to challenge for Champions League spots and my team did that. Part of it was that they wanted to be what they are now. It will be nice to walk in there and think, my team was part of this journey and just enjoy the games there. You hope it will help them on the pitch but you can go they will stick or twist. You hope that it will be about a further push, but part of you thinks, well it needs to be paid for. So how long does it take to get to that place. Will they use all the extra revenue to pay off the stadium? All this money will come in but will they spend it on the stadium and not the players. I hope not because the minute they do that then they find themselves in Arsenal’s position, which is two years away from getting into the glory of the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri turning N’golo Kante into the complete midfielder]</b> If you think about Kante when he came to England, he played at Leicester in a 4-4-2 and he adapted to 4-4-2. We were all kind of shocked that this team could not only play 4-4-2 but be successful doing it as well. Everyone thought 4-4-2 was a dead formation and he was brilliant at making it work. Then he goes to Chelsea, he starts in a midfield two and with five at the back. So, he adapts to whatever situation he gets put into. He is smarter, as a footballer, than people give him credit for. Because he is dynamic on the pitch and wins the ball back, people say, ‘I would hate to play against Kante’ and that he is this, that and the other. But I think they underestimate just how clever he is. He plays little one-twos around people and he can dribble by you. Don’t get me wrong, though, I think in that final third, the composure is nowhere near the likes of Cesc Fabregas, Pedro or Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but he offers you so much up until that point. That’s why I say he won’t get 10 goals a season, but he can provide a few and with the amount of running he does, he can go box-to-box just as he did in 4-4-2. I see him adapting to it and making it work. I have seen him play both weeks and I never thought, ‘Oh god, you are struggling!’ He looked just as good as, if not more accomplished than Ross Barkley on the other side, and Barkley has been playing in that position for years!</p>

  <p><b>[Hugo Lloris has let Tottenham down too many times to remain their No. 1]</b> Tottenham suffered two high-profile errors in Eindhoven. The first, from Toby Alderweireld, doesn’t worry me. I can’t remember another mistake like that from him in his three years at Spurs. It may be that as he gets older and picks up more injuries, his stats drop off a bit. But a smart player, as he is, will take account of that and adjust his game. The second error from Hugo Lloris is more of a worry. He’s meant to be one of Mauricio Pochettino’s main men, his captain. But he’s let him down too many times. This started before the World Cup and in crucial games. Both fixtures against Manchester City and Chelsea last season saw Lloris errors which had an impact on the result. It happened in France’s World Cup qualifiers against Sweden. He’s No. 1 for France, a World Cup winner and Tottenham captain, so there is an assumption he is one of the best goalkeepers in the world. I don’t think his form in the past year backs that up. Spurs’ problem is that the drop off when Michel Vorm plays is too great. Paulo Gazzaniga, who played in the wins at Brighton and Huddersfield, should be No. 2. But there is no one to displace Lloris and Spurs need to look at that now.</p>

  <p><b>[Son Heung-min has arguably outperformed Tottenham team-mate Harry Kane]</b> Thankfully, Son got knocked out of the Asia games and he was able to come back early. The level of professionalism from him is unbelievable. He has travelled all over the world numerous times this season and he is back and ready to play. He is not only ready to play but he is producing, he is ready to fill the boots of Harry Kane. Essentially, it is that which has allowed Spurs to put themselves back into title contention. That’s not to discredit anyone else. Everyone is playing their part and they are tough moments when you lose a couple of your best players. You go onto the pitch lacking a little bit of that confidence and you can see that but they have dug deep and found some serious strength. Son, in my eyes, he is arguably Spurs’ best player for the last two years. Harry Kane had a below-par four or five months leading into the World Cup and that was partly due to injury. Within that period Son has been a shining light. In that period he was scoring goals last year and then hit the ground running again this year. With the emotions that he was going through going into the first time that he went to play in the Asian Games with the Under 23s. The circumstances surrounding that, he dealt with it. Then, to go again and come back, it can knock you out of your rhythm. It is interesting when you hear people describe Spurs as the ‘Harry Kane team’. If you look at most teams, they all have a star player. Whether it is Mohamed Salah at Liverpool or Eden Hazard at Chelsea. The flip side to that, would Christian Eriksen not get into the top sides in Europe? Would Dele Alli not get into the top sides in Europe? Lucas Moura was at PSG and they aren’t exactly average. There are plenty of players with that star power.<br /><br />It feels like a lot to say yes. My head is telling me not yet, I don’t think they will do. It depends on what you class as a success. The team didn’t dip into the transfer market, so to improve it was about performance. They have managed to improve their season by getting more points than any point at this stage in the season. The cups, they were unfortunate. They lost to a top side in Chelsea. In the FA Cup, they lost their best players and it was a bad performance. For the other two tournaments <b>[Champions League and Premier League]</b>, I do think that’s one or two seasons away and that’s where the investment needs to be made. If they get Champions League qualification comfortably, then that will be a remarkable achievement. They have got games at Anfield and the Etihad. If they can go and win those games then they are serious contenders but they have not done that for years. If they can, who knows</p>

I love the way he receives the ball, the way he takes the ball in pressurised areas, his technique and his mentality. He has got an excellent temperament. He is strong and he can mix it with players who get nasty with him. All these things mix in to create a top player which I think he is growing into, he has all these attributes. Scoring goals and getting assists come naturally to him so he is definitely a contender for Young Player of the Year. We’re talking huge money for him, I think because he is a good player and they know what he will build into. Dele <b>[Alli]</b> did it, quite smoothly, Raheem <b>[Sterling]</b> did it at Liverpool, and I did it when I went to Newcastle. Young players have the ability to be fearless when they go to a top club and play well. David Brooks will hopefully go somewhere like Tottenham; I think that’s a perfect fit for him. He’s also the perfect fit for the club. He would get game time so it would be nice to see him at Tottenham.<br /><br /><b>[On PFA Player of the Year award]</b> It has not been one of those years. Last year it was either <b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne or <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah, but this year you’re working a little bit harder for it. <b>[Heung-Min]</b> Son is definitely in there. <b>[Virgil]</b> Van Dijk is in there. Sterling should be there, he had an unbelievable start, and in the mid-section, he has been scoring goals. Beyond that, it is hard to nail down names. <b>[Andrew]</b> Robertson has been great in the left-back position. Two more spots to fill there. It always comes down to who wins the league so we will see. To pick one right now, I would probably pick Raheem Sterling</p>

If they can get back on form, this is the season to have a go at the Champions League as there are no outstanding teams in the competition this season.<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were the team everyone in Europe feared a couple of months ago, but they are off the boil, even though they keep winning matches without playing too well.<br /><br />City look like a different team in the Champions League and conceded far too many goals and, with some of the big European teams like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> no longer the force they once were, an opportunity is there for a team like <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to have a real go at this competition.<br /><br />To do that, they need to believe in themselves and seize the big moments when they come along. Players like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> know how to seize that moment and always stand up when it matters. Now we have to see whether <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s players are ready to rise to that challenge.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> stated last month that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> may be up to 10 years away from winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title]</b> People are asking whether those comments mean he wants to be there for 10 years to make it matter or is he saying he doesn’t want to wait that long to win something, but I just think it was a very clear message to his players to step up and prove they can be winners<br /><br />If you go over some of Mauricio’s comments over the last year or so, you’ll find some odd ones in there. What I think these comments are all about is getting a message to his players, as he feels they are not sensing the moments when they need to put the foot down and make a statement.<br /><br />The message he gave to his players ahead of their game at <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> a few weeks back was this is a cup final and that was a clear effort to get his players up for that game. They had a chance to get into the mix for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title in that game and <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> wanted his players to realise how high the stakes were.<br /><br />It didn’t work because they lost 2-1 at Turf Moor and you could see how much it got to him as he confronted the match officials after the game and ended up getting a touchline ban for his troubles.<br /><br />He wanted to get the point across and his players didn’t respond. Some of their performances this season have befitted a team that are destined to finish third or fourth and he wants more than that, but do these <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> players have the ability or the mental strength to give him what he wants?<br /><br />I think they do and, if I’m being honest, I just think they have massively over-achieved this season and that’s why I think this criticism is a little bit harsh.

I know <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> was injured and <a href="son-heungmin.html">Son Heung-min</a> was suspended, but they needed Eriksen to get back into that game and for me he gives them something different to every other player in <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s squad. I think <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> have had a very good summer transfer window in terms of the players they have brought in, but it would change my outlook on the strength of their squad if they lose Eriksen - and certain other players - now. I hope Eriksen stays, because he is so valuable to their chances of winning a trophy under <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> might see last week’s loan signing Giovani lo Celso as a direct replacement for Eriksen, so they are ready if the right bid comes in, but they will be much stronger if he stays<br /><br /><b>[With speculation still mounting around Eriksen]</b> If they do get £50m, they will have done wonders - but any offers they get before the end of this month, when the transfer window closes in the rest of Europe, are likely to be a lot less than that.

Part of it comes down to what the player himself is thinking, of course.<br /><br />Eriksen is 27 and said earlier this summer that he is at the stage of his career where he ‘might want to try something new’, and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are reportedly interested in him. But he also spoke about the possibility of signing a new <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> contract and of course he could always let his existing deal run down, knowing next year he can go for free. That is a win-win situation for him, because there would be no issues over which club meets <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s asking price. They can get him for free, and his wages will reflect that, so I don’t think he would sulk if he does end up staying with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> for another year</p>

When I heard they had agreed a £64m fee with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> for the Argentina international, I started to get excited. It was a shame the move fell through, because <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> could have helped to bridge the gap from <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> finishing comfortably in the top four to getting a lot closer to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in the title race - assuming they kept hold of Eriksen too. But the thing <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans should be getting excited about is that a bid was made - along with a big offer for <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> at Sporting, by all accounts.<br /><br />I don’t think the intention was to buy both of them, but they certainly wanted to land one of them. It shows the mindset of the club that they gave it a go, and it is exactly the approach that fans have been craving. It makes me think that, come January, they can go again, or target that really big signing next summer in the way <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have done in the past<br /><br /><b>[Jenas believes <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are still in need of a few fresh faces, with uncertainty surrounding the likes of <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>, <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Jan Vertonghen</a> and <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Toby Alderweireld</a> leaving them with boxes to tick]</b> I am not sure <a href="ryan-sessegnon.html">Ryan Sessegnon</a> is going to turn out to be left-back, but <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> already have <a href="ben-davies.html">Ben Davies</a>, who is decent, and <b>[Danny]</b> Rose too.

It already feels like defence is not the strength it was for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> a couple of years ago - they lost 13 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games last season, which is a concern. Then you have the situation with <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Vertonghen</a> being left out of the squad completely on Saturday, which was very strange.

So, this is a process that doesn’t stop and, come January, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> need to have a plan. Otherwise they could be in a position where they need to make several signings in the same area of the team in the next summer window, which is exactly the scenario they want to avoid.</p>

Sacking <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>, appointing <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> on double the money, spending tens of millions in the next couple of transfer window…. it’s all a huge gamble.<br /><br />Only if <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and his <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> squad deliver a trophy - the first for 11 years and counting - will it have succeeded. Players at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> are at the stage in their careers when they are thinking will silverware ever come?<br /><br />Now they have a man walking through the door who has every ingredient, every play, every way of doing it, to get over the line. I think the 11 months Jose has had out of the game since leaving <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> will have helped him reinvent his outlook to coaching. He is starting afresh, had a good look at it, and will be thinking this new generation needs something new.<br /><br /><a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> will have asked Daniel Levy: Are you going to open the cheque book? You can guarantee that come January and the summer, they are going to have a right go in the windows. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans will say to that: brilliant.<br /><br />But why not just back Mauricio in the first place. He earned that. It is annoying that he will come in on more money, get a bigger kitty… he could have done all those things for Mauricio. But he didn’t want to bet on him. Poch will have six month or a year out. He will get a top job. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. It will be a monster job. And he will probably come back and break Spurs’ hearts</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jenas says <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s stock is far too high for him to end up in charge at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is a huge football club and the wages would be great for Mauricio, but putting myself in his shoes, I think his stock will be far higher than that. The job that he did at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> puts him in a different bracket. If I was Mauricio I’d have six months off to recuperate after working non stop for six years at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. Come to the end of the season there’s a good chance that Man United, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and Madrid might ring. I know he mentioned he wouldn’t go to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> because of his Espanyol links, but there are a lot of huge clubs out there I think he can go to. The <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> job isn’t one that is that attractive to anyone right now<br /><br /><b>[Jenas added on Emery’s sacking at the Emirates]</b> The decision they’ve taken feels like a knee jerk reaction, there doesn’t seem to be any real planning behind what they’re doing. Are they just going to throw a load of names in the hat and go: ‘Is it <b>[Massimiliano]</b> <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a>, is it <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>, is it <b>[Carlos]</b> Ancelotti’.

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jenas says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> couldn’t trust <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> but fans won’t accept negativity]</b> I don’t blame Jose for playing the way he did against City, because of the way results went when he first took charge of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. He knew he had goals in his team so he went out and just let them play, and they had some crazy results in the first few weeks when they were winning by all sorts of scores<br /><br />That was never going to last. I could feel it coming where, in his mind, he went ‘enough is enough’. He could not trust his team to go out and score goals, especially when <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> got injured, so instead he started setting them up not to be beaten. That was clearly <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s approach against City on Sunday<br /><br />Look at <a href="japhet-tanganga.html">Japhet Tanganga</a> at left-back, for example. He was basically told ‘you are not going anywhere today’, so he had to stay back all game. It paid off for <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> in the end, but <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans will not allow that kind of negativity in every home game. So he still needs to work on his side’s style of play, but of course getting a result this way still has plenty of positives.<br /><br /><a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has been talking a lot about how his players lack confidence, which he probably did not expect when he arrived at the club. Well, getting through games like this one will give the players lots of belief, and we saw some other important signs too. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has sorted out <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>’s situation, by selling him to Inter, while <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Jan Vertonghen</a>, another player whose future is uncertain because he is out of the contract at the end of the season, was on the bench. I looked out on the pitch and there was not a <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> player out there whose focus I would be concerned about any more. Everyone was playing for the shirt, and giving everything</p>

In reality it was more a story of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s missed chances. Yes, in the early stages <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> looked quite solid and strong, which is the way <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> likes to set his sides up in these big games, but City did what they always do and broke them down. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> showed character and hung in there thanks to a couple of big moments - the biggest one being Hugo Lloris’ first-half penalty save, which is when they might have started believing this could be their day.

He’s a spearhead for them with what he brings, his lack of respect for the opposition. You always felt like he was going to do something tonight.

  <p><b>[Jenas says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s stumbled into an era where his old methods don’t work]</b> A lot of <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s brilliance, as good as he was tactically and how much he changed things when he first came into the game, his biggest strength was in the mind and how he used to be able to galvanise a squad and make that ‘them against us’ mentality, get into certain individuals and make them raise their game by being elite in their mind.<br /><br />He would go into every single game making them believe that they are the best players in the world, making them feel like they are warriors going out onto the pitch.<br /><br />He was able to do that - when you look at the Inter performances, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> - you looked at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and they appeared mentality unbeatable, they were too strong at the time.<br /><br />My fear is that he has stumbled into an era where he cannot impose those same things on a new generation. They don’t react to those methods of maybe putting them down and expecting them to respond. We are talking about a completely different era of player.<br /><br />During his <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> days, he may have run into certain performances where for two weeks he may not have spoken to <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> because he felt like ‘you let me down’. Frank would have gone ‘I know how to put this right and I’m going to dig deep and get back on his good side’.<br /><br />I don’t think the players today respond well to that. His last job at United tells you that and I think right now we are seeing it as well</p>

  <p><b>[Jermaine Jenas says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> has become overly negative at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> It’s not a rant but what I will say is I will reserve judgement on Jose until the summer, until he brings in his new players because I think the players haven’t been good enough. What I don’t like about Jose at the minute is the negativity. I think he’s been far too negative in terms of the message he’s been sending out with the players. I know we’ve got injuries to <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a>, I know Son’s injured and now <b>[Steven]</b> <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Bergwijn</a>. But I think there needs to be a more positive structure going out to the players. And overall I still can’t see what the team are and how they’re trying to play. Are they a passing team? Are they a pressing team? Are they a team that plays deep and tries to counter attack? I don’t see from game to game, and I can’t tell you from game to game, what team he’s going to put out. He had the best part of six centre-halves playing against <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>. He has won everything there is to win in the game, so that’s quite a good reason why you’d want to go and play for him. He is a serial winner</p>
