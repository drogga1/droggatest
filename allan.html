  <p><b>[Such proficiency has naturally led to comparisons with Arturo Vidal]</b> The Vidal comparisons? It is true that we are a bit similar, we have similar styles of play. I must continue to work hard, I’m happy that people are pleased with how I’m playing.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> boss <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> caught in the middle of San Paolo civil war]</b> ENOUGH! I think now it is really getting out of hand and I cannot take it anymore. First, my husband is attacked not for what he does on the field, but some alleged accusations created on purpose by someone who wants to distort reality <b>[…]</b> Then, every day I get insulted on social media with disrespectful words. This week, it even happened while I was out shopping. Last night, we add this enormous scare! People who broke into the house in full daylight, creating chaos and messing up the children’s rooms, violating our intimate home space. My children were crying, terrified! We’ve been welcomed so well since arriving in Naples, but now people cannot use fake news to treat a family and children like this. This is not football. This is not how you support a team</p>
