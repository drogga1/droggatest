  <p><b>[Liverpool attacker Xherdan Shaqiri has hit out at Charlie Adam]</b> I’m a totally different type of person. Some ex-football players, or ex-team-mates, they spoke to the media and it looks like I am a bad boy or something but I’ve never been a bad boy or had some problems at a club! I think it’s just frustration maybe or jealousy because I had a good move. I was surprised that he spoke like this about me but that is sometimes the character of a player. I know what he said was totally wrong because at that time I played there - especially when times were hard - I was there and I was scoring a lot of goals. I was one of the only ones who helped the team with goals in difficult games and he was that guy who took the red card in league games <b>[against Everton]</b> and missed a penalty <b>[against Brighton]</b>. For me, I’m a nice guy who likes to joke, so I think the people who spoke about me were totally wrong.<br /><br />I’m just a player who wants to work and who does my job every day, the same as I always did. I don’t have to prove Charlie Adam or some people that are speaking about me wrong. I know that people know how good I am - most of the people that understand football know that they are wrong</p>

But it’s the solution of the coach so you have to understand this. He came to me straight away and said why. I have a very good relationship with him so everything is okay</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool playmaker Xherdan Shaqiri believes that he is not afforded enough respect as a player for his achievements with Bayern Munich]</b> Being relegated with Stoke was a very bad experience for the club and for me and I hope they can come back quickly. But despite what happened there, I am a Champions League winner. I think that deserves respect. People should remember where I played before, the qualities I have, and what I have achieved in the game. I played for one of the biggest teams in the world in Munich and again I am playing for one of the big clubs. So I don’t feel any pressure from the Liverpool shirt.<br /><br /><b>[Shaqiri has been frustrated for opportunities since his arrival on Merseyside]</b> I think I am settled now and showing my best form. It takes time for me to understand what the coach wants and also for my team-mates to understand me. I am getting more minutes on the pitch now and I feel I am getting better. It’s great being back in the Champions League. This was what I wanted. It’s an unbelievable feeling for me to be at this level after what happened at Stoke last season. I have my dreams to win things with Liverpool. Why not?<br /><br /><b>[He celebrated a goal by making an eagle gesture in tribute to his Albanian heritage]</b> What happened in the World Cup is in the past and this is just another football game for me. Football is football and politics is politics. I will go there to play football. I am not going there to do anything else. I don’t think <b>[Red Star]</b> are the best opponents, to be honest, and I don’t worry about the game in Belgrade</p>

We don’t have to speak about this now.<br /><br /><b>[Xhaka apologised for the celebration, Shaqiri remained unfazed by the ramifications of the celebration]</b> Sure, I apologise if people felt attacked in Switzerland. Somewhere, I don’t know, maybe in the mountains, where someone watched the game and it bothered him, I would certainly apologise</p>

  <p><b>[Xherdan Shaqiri admits he is loving life at Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp]</b> I’m feeling good. I’m fit, and I’m trying to give my best every time I get a chance. It’s always nice when you get a standing ovation or the people are behind you. We have amazing fans and I scored again in front of the Kop so it was a nice feeling. I’m getting used to it!<br /><br /><b>[Shaqiri said when asked about Klopp’s decision]</b> He just wanted to concentrate on football. Everybody knows what happened. There is a very hot atmosphere there and so it was better to stay at home and just concentrate on football. When I went there everybody would be looking at me and so it was better to stay at home. I was fresh, I stayed here and trained with some other players. But it doesn’t change a lot. I wanted to give a good performance <b>[against Fulham]</b> and yeah, it was a good one<br /><br />I think in the end it is the coach’s decision who is playing and against who,” Shaqiri said, diplomatically. “He will change the teams against who we are playing and he chooses the team who he thinks is <b>[in]</b> the right moment and the right team to win games. In the end, if he decides to play you from the beginning, nice and good, but also if you are on the bench, try and come in and make an impact. In the end, only 11 players can play and we have a big squad and a good squad. Everybody has to accept the decisions of the coach and until now it’s going very good and we are in a good way<br /><br /><b>[Asked if it was a pleasure to play with such players]</b> Well, I played in Bayern Munich with Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben so I knew it already! It was nothing new for me. I knew already how good these very talented players were. We have a very good team, a young team also, so our process is going very well and I’m just proud to be part of this team. I try to give good performances and pay the coach and the fans back<br /><br />I changed teams and there are different mentalities and different visions, different goals. I have to adapt to the team, but the most important thing is to enjoy the football here. The coach wants that I enjoy the football, also to give my talent on the pitch <b>[which]</b> is of course in the offensive. He wants that I enjoy the game but also to try to make an impact and create some good chances for the team. We have to keep going, we had maybe the best start that Liverpool had ever and we just have to keep going, to work hard every day in training and to try to take that into the game day. We are in a good way</p>

But I was always calm, even when I got little playing time at the beginning. I knew of course, because of the experiences at Bayern and Inter, that I have to be patient, work hard and then take my chance when I get it. When I was left out at Bayern for three or four games, I felt misunderstood and wanted to go.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether he would rather taste Premier League title glory or a second Champions League triumph of his career]</b> Preferably both! But if I had to choose, it would be the championship in England. That would be my biggest dream, especially since Liverpool last won it before I was born</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool star Shaqiri issues title warning to Manchester City]</b> We’re going to be there until the end! We don’t have to look to Man City, we just have to look to ourselves and try to give our good performance on the pitch and win games, that’s the most important thing. Every game has its own history and we have to look game to game and not look where we’re staying at the end of the season. When you win games like this, we’re going to fight to the end for a lot of things so I think we just have to keep going, keep working hard and win games<br /><br />I’m feeling good, I’m fit and that’s important for me. I think you can see that also on the pitch, that I’m settling in well with the team. I think you saw that also <b>[against Watford]</b>. First half, I tried to give them some good passes. I’m feeling good, it was important to win and it was a good win<br /><br /><b>[Merseyside derby against Everton]</b> Of course. It’s my first derby so it’s going to be, for sure, very special. I want to see and to feel the atmospheres in these derbies. It’s going to be very special and I’m just looking forward to this game. I know just one Evertonian and he said to me when I was at Stoke, ‘You have to come to Everton’. But I always said ‘No!’<br /><br /><b>[As for PSG]</b> Every player has to be ready for that game. We don’t know how the coach is going to make the starting XI but everybody has to be ready. We had a lot of players today on the bench who didn’t play so I think we have fresh players behind us. It’s going to be a difficult game and a good game to show how good we are. We also go there to try and win the game, for sure.<br /><br />We had to be patient because they were set up very defensively and it was difficult to find solutions sometimes, to create something. I think that there you can see how good you are. Sometimes the top teams, you know the <b>[opposition]</b> are going to stay very defensive. In the end we showed our class and we deserved to win the game</p>

  <p><b>[Xherdan Shaqiri praised Liverpool’s bravery after they came from behind to win at Burnley]</b> He just said we have to be more in the game, more lively in the game, and to win the ball more because a lot times we played not forward but back. We weren’t exactly perfect to get on the ball but in the second half we did better and we managed the game very well and then we scored three goals. We have to be brave in these games. We know we are going to have a lot of possession but obviously we have to defend well. They scored - I don’t know if it was a foul <b>[on the goalkeeper]</b> or not but they decided to give the goal. We stayed calm and tried to manage the game and stay in the game and in the end we deserved to win. It was most important to take three points from here, which we know is not simple, so in the end we are happy. It is always tough to play here, I played with Stoke here and it was also a cold, rainy day so it is not simple to play this game but we managed it very well and we fully deserved to win the game.<br /><br />Definitely. It was a very important game, the coach said that to us. It gave a lot of players confidence to play this game and we managed it well. Obviously it is not simple for the other players who did not play for a long time so in the first half they needed time to come into the game but after that we managed it well and you can see we have a very strong team where everyone can play in the game<br /><br />You saw at the end of the game that I could sprint to the goal and try to score. He wants me to get on the ball and I tried a few times <b>[to score]</b> but it was not perfect what the coach wanted. We played very well in the second half and it was important to manage the game, retain ball possession, stay brave and wait for our chances and be clinical in front of goal and we did that</p>

There were a lot of good messages about the United game at first and then, when the news came out about Mourinho, I had messages saying: ‘That’s your fault!’ But this is football sometimes. I don’t think it was just because we won that game that United wanted to change their manager. There were other reasons but it means the game goes down in history. It will always be in my history too.<br /><br />Every player wants to play, that’s pretty normal. Every player is unhappy when he’s on the bench, that’s pretty normal too.

It has to be a winning mentality and the players need to be focused. The mentality is similar <b>[here]</b>. You need to go into games trying to win them and to give everything to do that. I am pretty sure with the talent we have in the team we can achieve a lot. Now we need to keep going this hard until the end.

So, in the end, it was a draw and we take the point. Obviously being five points clear is better than four. We wanted to win the game, but every game is very tough to play. Leicester have a good team, were very well organised - you saw that in the game - and it was difficult against them. So, we take the point and we go forward - we are looking to the next game now. Everything is good, so we will just keep going like this. We are looking forward to the next game on Monday, which is very important to win.

It is the football stage in Europe, everyone watches you - everyone wants the trophy. I want to win it a second time. We are there in the final and I want to win it with Liverpool. After what we did against Barcelona, we all want to win it. But there is a long way to go. It is difficult to speak about the final now as we still have one more Premier League game.<br /><br />It is so difficult to explain what happened in the game. Unbelievable! Unbelievable performance, unbelievable atmosphere. We knew everyone had written us off because of what happened in the first leg. It was an incredible performance. If you believe - if you believe in life - anything and everything can happen. The fans they pushed us to the end. They wouldn’t let us stop. Honestly, it is just belief. I say it, always in life you have to believe that you can achieve special things. Sometimes, you will not get there but we believed in life and we got there. We got what we deserved. We scored the first one; we got to half-time and then the second one came straight after. We knew that Barcelona were nervous and when you are in Anfield, anything can happen. What an unbelievable night - maybe the best night there has ever been here<br /><br />Crazy! Everyone was shocked, like they couldn’t believe it. We were celebrating, some of the guys were crying. Me? No! I am just so happy, so happy to have helped. We have achieved something special. The manager didn’t change things a lot. He just told us to perform, to keep going. We knew everything could happen and we are really proud of what we have achieved</p>

  <p><b>[Shaqiri assured of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> future as <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> fends off transfer talk]</b> Why should I talk about something which is absolutely not interesting for us. He was five weeks injured and that is a period when he is not seen as a player. Before that we spoke about him not having as many games as he wanted to but that was pretty much all. When I am with him he is completely happy and fine here and speculation is speculation, it is nothing we can change. I have no idea what I could say about that. Of course he has a future but we speak about the future always until the season ends and then maybe a player is coming to me or not but no-one thinks about that. This season he is a very important player for us<br /><br /><b>[<a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is adamant that minutes will come his way once Shaqiri returns to full match sharpness]</b> He has been really long injured, I think five weeks, so to get the match fitness again that takes time. He trained this week and we gave him some different things to do but that’s it, apart from that he should be completely fine. There is no reason to rush it but it’s nice to have him back. We saw a lot of really nice things in training this week but it is intense for him and he needs to get used to the intensity again and everything will be fine<br /><br /><b>[If he does come back into contention, then Shaqiri will offer an alternative option in a creative attacking post to the likes of <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, <a href="adam-lallana.html">Adam Lallana</a> and <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>]</b> Yes, but he needs to be fit for that. That is all we are concerned about at the moment. He was out long and he trained and was really good in moments and in other moments it was different to the rehab stuff he did before. All good, the most intense period is coming so he will be ready for that hopefully if nothing happens again and you will see him on the pitch, 100 per cent</p>
