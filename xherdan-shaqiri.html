  <p><b>[Xherdan Shaqiri has sought to end any talk of him considering a move away from Liverpool]</b> This club needs to win titles, and it’s a good start to win this one, no? Now next year we are going to go again and try to win the Premier League. That’s my big dream, to win the Premier League with this club. It just feels amazing. It’s been a long time since Liverpool won this title, 2005. It’s amazing to give the fans what they deserve. This club deserves everything, the staff, everyone involved. I think we’re going to have a big, big party!<br /><br />Of course if we didn’t win it, we’d have been very disappointed. We played such a good season, and we deserved to win at least one trophy. Now we won the biggest title in Europe, it’s amazing. It doesn’t happen every day. We are a very good team and we work hard together every day. I hope we can go on, this is just the start and we can win many more titles</p>

I have a long-term contract and I definitely will stay.<br /><br /><b>[One of those assists came in the Barcelona victory - it was from his cross that Georginio Wijnaldum rose to head Liverpool level in the tie]</b> It’s a special moment for me standing here with the gold medal again.

We have a big, talented squad, and many have to wait for their chance. I have never had a problem with the coach.

  <p><b>[Shaqiri assured of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> future as <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> fends off transfer talk]</b> Why should I talk about something which is absolutely not interesting for us. He was five weeks injured and that is a period when he is not seen as a player. Before that we spoke about him not having as many games as he wanted to but that was pretty much all. When I am with him he is completely happy and fine here and speculation is speculation, it is nothing we can change. I have no idea what I could say about that. Of course he has a future but we speak about the future always until the season ends and then maybe a player is coming to me or not but no-one thinks about that. This season he is a very important player for us<br /><br /><b>[Klopp is adamant that minutes will come his way once Shaqiri returns to full match sharpness]</b> He has been really long injured, I think five weeks, so to get the match fitness again that takes time. He trained this week and we gave him some different things to do but that’s it, apart from that he should be completely fine. There is no reason to rush it but it’s nice to have him back. We saw a lot of really nice things in training this week but it is intense for him and he needs to get used to the intensity again and everything will be fine<br /><br /><b>[If he does come back into contention, then Shaqiri will offer an alternative option in a creative attacking post to the likes of <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, <a href="adam-lallana.html">Adam Lallana</a> and Jordan Henderson]</b> Yes, but he needs to be fit for that. That is all we are concerned about at the moment. He was out long and he trained and was really good in moments and in other moments it was different to the rehab stuff he did before. All good, the most intense period is coming so he will be ready for that hopefully if nothing happens again and you will see him on the pitch, 100 per cent</p>

  <p><b>[Shaqiri airs <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> title dream after returning to Klopp’s plans in style during derby triumph]</b> We are grounded. We take it game by game and that’s the most important thing. We don’t need to think about winning titles. My biggest dream is to win the title with this club and give it to the fans. So we will try everything. We have to focus on the pitch, stay grounded and work hard every day. If we win, it will be amazing but we still have a long way to go<br /><br />I think you saw <b>[how much I enjoyed it]</b> on the pitch. It was unbelievable to be back on the pitch, I was very happy when I knew I’d play. I wanted to have a good performance. I’ve worked hard for the last few months - I’ve been injured and worked very hard. So I’m very happy to be back. I’m in good shape and very happy to be back. Obviously I was injured and I worked hard to come back. I was very happy when I knew I’d play. It was not simple to come straight back in the derby but I’m always confident and try to make a good performance and help my team. It was a really good day for us<br /><br /><b>[The first half]</b> was unbelievable. We obviously changed formation a little bit and some players played who didn’t play a lot for a few weeks. We did very well. It’s big credit for the team; you can see how good we are. We started very well. Of course, it was a little bit dramatic and we have to learn from our little mistakes, but that’s football. It’s a busy period now and we have to go on and win games, that’s the most important thing in football. It was a good night for us Reds</p>

I’m ready. I think the coach saw that too in training. I trained very well and he gave me the chance and I think I played very well. I’ve been injured but thank God I don’t have knee problems or something. I had some muscle problems, so I just needed a few weeks to recover well. The calf is very dangerous to get a re-injury and I had this so obviously it was not nice but I stayed positive and tried to come back. I worked very hard in the gym and with the fitness coaches to come back and be ready when the coach needs me. I’m feeling good. At the end of the day it’s important to win games with my team, we won it as a team, and obviously when I can contribute it’s always good.

I won it already with Bayern, it was amazing, and it’s also important for the club: a big trophy, an important trophy. We will do everything to win.

Sometimes I tell my family, ‘Look where I played, look how many trophies I won.’ It’s just incredible. You cannot have that every day, or not everyone can say they won the Champions League twice with two different teams, twice a world champion, many titles with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in Germany and in Switzerland too with Basel.

It’s very important for them too. For a few years it was always coming, coming and playing well, but no title. This big club needs to fight every year for the title. It seems like the winning mentality is here now and trying to stay at the top is very important, and difficult. That’s the most important challenge for this club, I think.<br /><br /><b>[The former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and Inter midfielder added]</b> It was a shame we didn’t win the league but it was amazing to get the Champions League title again for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. For me, the second time. You never forget these kinds of feelings, these kinds of trophies you win with the team. And to celebrate with the fans, after a long time they could celebrate something big in the city, was just amazing. The potential for this team is very high, I think we can go as high as possible.
