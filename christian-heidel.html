  <p>[Baba Rahman extension discussed] There is interest and Chelsea are aware of that. We are talking. It is about the conditions and of course money and the duration. We have to sort that out calmly and then there will be a decision</p>

  <p>[Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham have been alerted to the news that Schalke are prepared to concede defeat in their efforts to keep Max Meyer] At the moment we can and must expect that Max leaves the club in the summer. Everything suggests that. At the moment there is no offer from us and no wish from Max to have a conversation again.</p>

  <p>[Max Meyer has been suspended by Schalke in the wake of bullying accusations levelled at the club] We cannot tolerate this behaviour and these statements - in particular the false allegations against the club, which we reject in the strongest possible manner. Schalke 04 has always behaved correctly towards Max Meyer</p>

  <p>[Can the ‘German Messi’ Max Meyer prove his worth at Crystal Palace?] After the talks with Max Meyer, I got into contact with Roger Wittmann. Wittmann said ‘Christian, we first must determine if we’re talking about the same player.’ I said, ‘What does that mean?’ This is what Roger Wittmann told me: ‘I’m talking about the world-class player Max Meyer, who would start in every European squad. And he should be going to the World Cup in Russia. If we’re talking about the same player, you can send me an offer. If we’re talking about different players, don’t send me an offer’.<br /><br />I was of a different opinion, when I saw the performances of Max Meyer, I sent the offer nevertheless. But not for the world-class player Max Meyer, rather a very very good Bundesliga player Max Meyer, who has quite a lot of potential and can still get better</p>

  <p>[Schalke midfielder Weston McKennie looks set for an extensive injury layoff] We feared the worst. The entire tibia and fibula hurts him a lot.<br /><br />We hope it’s not a break, but we can not rule it out. He can not stand at all, but we need to get an X-ray and MRI to know more</p>
