  <p>[Chelsea are set to miss out on signing Sead Kolasinac after failing in a late bid to tempt him away from Schalke in January] Yes, there was an approach [from Chelsea], but it was off the table immediately.</p>

  <p>[Baba Rahman extension discussed] There is interest and Chelsea are aware of that. We are talking. It is about the conditions and of course money and the duration. We have to sort that out calmly and then there will be a decision</p>

  <p>[Leon Goretzka has passed a medical and agreed a deal to sign for Bayern Munich at the end of the season] Leon Goretzka has earlier this week informed us that he would like to leave the club and join Bayern Munich. We noted that with regret. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has told us that Leon has passed his medical. We are losing a very good player. He has signed a contract from July 1, 2018 with Bayern. We did everything possible to keep Leon</p>

  <p>[Chelsea left-back Baba Rahman is set to join Schalke on loan] I expect a decision to be taken in a relatively short term. Many things are already exchanged between Chelsea and us. Now I’m waiting for an answer from Chelsea to my most recent email. It’s not certain yet if the loan can be for 18 months.</p>

  <p>[Schalke CEO Christian Heidel has promised a resolution to the Max Meyer saga] Max will be deciding shortly if he wants to stay at Schalke past the summer. Max is very happy here, Schalke is his home, we will try to make it him as comfortable financially as possible. He is playing the best season of his life, and the coach has found a position for him that Max didn’t believe he could play. Personally, I didn’t think he could either.</p>

  <p>[Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham have been alerted to the news that Schalke are prepared to concede defeat in their efforts to keep Max Meyer] At the moment we can and must expect that Max leaves the club in the summer. Everything suggests that. At the moment there is no offer from us and no wish from Max to have a conversation again.</p>

  <p>[Max Meyer has been suspended by Schalke in the wake of bullying accusations levelled at the club] We cannot tolerate this behaviour and these statements - in particular the false allegations against the club, which we reject in the strongest possible manner. Schalke 04 has always behaved correctly towards Max Meyer</p>

  <p>[Can the ‘German Messi’ Max Meyer prove his worth at Crystal Palace?] After the talks with Max Meyer, I got into contact with Roger Wittmann. Wittmann said ‘Christian, we first must determine if we’re talking about the same player.’ I said, ‘What does that mean?’ This is what Roger Wittmann told me: ‘I’m talking about the world-class player Max Meyer, who would start in every European squad. And he should be going to the World Cup in Russia. If we’re talking about the same player, you can send me an offer. If we’re talking about different players, don’t send me an offer’.<br /><br />I was of a different opinion, when I saw the performances of Max Meyer, I sent the offer nevertheless. But not for the world-class player Max Meyer, rather a very very good Bundesliga player Max Meyer, who has quite a lot of potential and can still get better</p>

  <p>[Schalke midfielder Weston McKennie looks set for an extensive injury layoff] We feared the worst. The entire tibia and fibula hurts him a lot.<br /><br />We hope it’s not a break, but we can not rule it out. He can not stand at all, but we need to get an X-ray and MRI to know more</p>
