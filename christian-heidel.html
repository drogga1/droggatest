  <p><b>[USA youth international Weston McKennie has signed a contract extension with Schalke through June 2022]</b> Weston will develop into a key part of our first team with us. Weston has shown in the past few months that he is more than capable of contributing significantly to the future of Schalke. Thanks to his talent and his willingness to learn, Weston has made the rise from the U19s to the Bundesliga and it’s been a success from the get go. We’re very happy that Weston sees his long-term future to be at FC Schalke 04.</p>

We noted that with regret. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has told us that Leon has passed his medical. We are losing a very good player. He has signed a contract from July 1, 2018 with Bayern. We did everything possible to keep Leon</p>

  <p><b>[Schalke CEO Christian Heidel has promised a resolution to the Max Meyer saga]</b> Max will be deciding shortly if he wants to stay at Schalke past the summer. Max is very happy here, Schalke is his home, we will try to make it him as comfortable financially as possible. He is playing the best season of his life, and the coach has found a position for him that Max didn’t believe he could play. Personally, I didn’t think he could either.</p>

  <p><b>[Max Meyer has been suspended by Schalke in the wake of bullying accusations levelled at the club]</b> We cannot tolerate this behaviour and these statements - in particular the false allegations against the club, which we reject in the strongest possible manner. Schalke 04 has always behaved correctly towards Max Meyer</p>

  <p><b>[Can the ‘German Messi’ Max Meyer prove his worth at Crystal Palace?]</b> After the talks with Max Meyer, I got into contact with Roger Wittmann. Wittmann said ‘Christian, we first must determine if we’re talking about the same player.’ I said, ‘What does that mean?’ This is what Roger Wittmann told me: ‘I’m talking about the world-class player Max Meyer, who would start in every European squad. And he should be going to the World Cup in Russia. If we’re talking about the same player, you can send me an offer. If we’re talking about different players, don’t send me an offer’.<br /><br />I was of a different opinion, when I saw the performances of Max Meyer, I sent the offer nevertheless. But not for the world-class player Max Meyer, rather a very very good Bundesliga player Max Meyer, who has quite a lot of potential and can still get better</p>
