  <p><b>[Sven Bender has urged Leon Bailey to stay at Bayer Leverkusen]</b> He has got special abilities, he is incredibly fast and great at dribbling. But we did not expect that he would explode that fast. This example shows that football is a fast-paced business. It is important that he handles the hype around him correctly and does not want too much too fast. Now everybody comes to him and suddenly wants something from him. He is only 20 years old and therefore still has development potential. He is a great player and will probably leave one day for a high fee, but I wish him to stay with us for a long time.<br /><br />Of course the sums are very high at the moment. If someone is willing to pay this money for a football player, it is okay. You can’t blame the player for costing a lot of money. It is a question of supply and demand. It is a little bit unreal and far from reality. I hope someday it will find an end<br /><br /><b>[On Ousmane Dembele]</b> Football sometimes develops in the wrong direction. These young players have the big dream to play for a top club. And maybe they think it is the only chance to make that move as soon as possible. But you have signed the contract with your current club. It has something to do with fairness and respect for the club you’re playing for. There are measures taken, such as strikes that do not belong there</p>

  <p><b>[German midfielder Sven Bender also conceded his side got somewhat lucky against the reigning <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> champions]</b> It was extremely difficult, they were very oppressive, they play very strong at the moment and we fought passionately. We did not have much luck this season and I think we got a bit back today - it’s the only way to win in Munich</p>
