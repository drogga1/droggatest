  <p><b>[Paulo Cesar claims <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> has slipped out of the world’s top three since joining <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>]</b> I hope that <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> will give the answer that everyone expects on the pitch. He must prove that he has become strong again. Arriving at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, he was in the top three players in the world. For two years, he has not been a part of it. We know his abilities, so it’s normal to expect much better from him. I believe in <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s return to his best. He still needs games, so we’ll wait and see. It’s been two years since he played important games. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> was seriously injured twice. What he does in private does not bother me. But he must still be careful. If he takes good care of his body, then that is the best way to avoid injuries<br /><br /><b>[<a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> made a positive start down the path to redemption on Saturday when he made a match-winning return to action for reigning <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> champions <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>]</b> For me, he performed a smart match. In the first half, he almost did not keep the ball, just three touches maximum, because he knew he would be whistled. He was good in passing and moving. Then he started to let go. His goal is pure <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>!<br /><br /><b>[He added on the taunts and banners in the stands at <a href="psg.html">Parc des Princes</a>]</b> Given what happened in the media all summer, it seems perfectly normal. We must understand the supporters who defend their club, they have the right to demonstrate. But their love of <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> must be stronger than that. I hope it will not last too long because this strange atmosphere, it does not penalise only <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> but also the club, the team</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> defender Paulo Cesar also of the opinion that <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> can position himself back among the very best players on the planet]</b> I hope that <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> will give the answer that everyone expects on the pitch.

  <p><b>[Paulo Cesar says <a href="marquinhos.html">Marquinhos</a> is <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>’s best player]</b> For me, <a href="marquinhos.html">Marquinhos</a> is a great player. At the moment, he’s the best player in Paris. He needs to cement his position in the national team - that’s how people will get to know him and appreciate him more. In addition, it’s not just the player. Everyone knows about his state of mind. He’s the type of guy who speaks up and I think that’s great. He’s a guy that has my full respect<br /><br />The captain’s armband is not a subject that matters to me. What matters to me is that he plays the same way with or without the armband. It’s true that in France when you have the armband you command more respect than the others, but you also have other obligations.</p>
