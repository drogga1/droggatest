<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Black Stars management committee vice-chairman Wilfred Osei Kwaku is livid at calls for the resignation of Ghana Football Association president Kwesi Nyantakyi]</b> It’s uncalled for because I don’t think we voted President Nyantakyi into office to win Afcon for us; that is not the parameter we set for him. We only voted for him to develop Ghana football, so where from the call that he should vacate his position, simply because the Black Stars failed to win the Nations Cup trophy in Gabon. What exactly has Nyantakyi done to resign from his presidency? After all, he didn’t select players for the tournament so why would you force him to resign?<br /><br />Either those advocating for his resignation have a motive or a pre-conceived motive that should Ghana fail to win the Afcon, he would be forced to resign. I will be highly disappointed in Nyantakyi if he resigns because he has to be tough and be able to stand the pressure. We voted for him and we are comfortable with his job so far. Have you heard about Egypt and the other participating teams asking their respective federation heads to resign after failing to win the Nations Cup?</p>
