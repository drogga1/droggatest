I’m sure they can go through. They have a big chance. They have a lot of quality, much more than Olympiakos. In my opinion they will go through</p>

Mamic stated in the letter that he got an offer from another club in a neighboring country. NFC will take necessary actions accordingly.</p>

  <p><b>[Zoran Mamić, Al Ain’s new manager, has expressed his delight for his start with the UAE side following their 3-0 win over Al Nasr]</b> After the first game, I can say that my start with Al Ain was good. The most important thing is the mutual trust for the technical staff and players in order to make the best performance. I would like to give everyone the chance to participate, and I don’t care much about the elements that categorize older or younger players. Any win from now on will increase our chances in the competition. We could dominate the game until the end and we created several chances three of which were converted. The game was tough for my team in the first 20 minutes, as the opponents could create a number of chances to threaten us.</p>

  <p><b>[Zoran Mamic, Al Ain’s manager, insists his team need to get better at this stage]</b> At this stage, we need to be playing better, looking at the players in this squad, with all due respect to opposition teams. There are nine matches to go, so we need to work harder and focus. We must approach every match very carefully from start to finish. I trust my players and their ability to deliver results, especially after our injured players return to the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Al Ain FC boss Zoran Mamic not satisfied with 1-1 AFC Champions League draw against Zob Ahan]</b> Surely I am not happy with the outcome of our first game in the AFC Champions League, especially since my team was the closest to win as seen in the first half of the play, where we had control of the game but wasted a host of chances in front of goal. In the second-half, we did not show the required level and though we had several chances to score, the visitors managed to register a goal from one of the two attacks they made and are certainly very pleased with the result at the Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium.<br /><br />The truth is we are required to concentrate in front of goal, lifting the fitness rate, which fell because of pressure from the games and during the next training sessions we will work on the development of the team’s performance to achieve the best results<br /><br />There are a number of important players away from the squad due to injury. And we have to to move according to the possibilities available and personally I am confident in the ability of my team to finish the season well<br /><br />I took the decision because I see Diacah as a different player who can play in different circumstances and planned to play against Zob Ahan who rely on a defensive block. As for Shamrani, I have talked to him about my decision and he understands my point of view. It does not matter who plays, but always the most important is to play as a team</p>

  <p><b>[Zoran Mamic hails match-winner Omar Abdulrahman in Al Ain FC’s AFC Champions League victory]</b> All credit to skipper Omar Abdul Rahman’s efforts. The fighting spirit that the entire team showed was tremendous. They showed they had a strong desire to return from Tashkent with three points<br /><br />Certainly, relying entirely on the presence of a star like Amoory is not good, at the same time it’s not as bad if you have a few absentees due to suspension or injury. However, here we played more powerful and adopted collective style of football</p>
