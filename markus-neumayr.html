  <p><b>[Former team-mate of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> Markus Neumayr believes the intense work <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> has put in has set him apart from his rivals for The Best <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Men’s Player 2016]</b> You saw from the beginning that he had so much talent. I guess he doesn’t have the same talent as <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> on one level, but he works harder than everybody else. This is why he is the world-class player he is. When I met him for the first time at United he had a completely different body. He started to work on it every day. Another example is his heading ability. Through hard work he developed into a player who is one of the best headers of a ball in the world. Every single ability was increased permanently because he did everything for it</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> midfielder gives <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> verdict]</b> I can only say positive things about him. On the outside, it may have a somewhat repellent look, but his behaviour is just a protective mask. I perceived him as a very friendly and open guy. At that time he was in the first team, but was also very interested in us from the ‘B’ team. He knew everything about the ‘B’ team players. When I was with the first team during my last year, I was always at the back of the bus with <a href="gerard-pique.html">Gerard Pique</a> and him<br /><br />After my trial, he invited me to his home. His wife made tea for us and we talked about football for an hour. He explained what the club stands for and what he planned to do with me. For me, a 16-year-old youngster, this was very, very impressive<br /><br />I didn’t perceive it as extreme as some stories say. But he was very demanding and critical of the players. Unfortunately, I did not experience the legendary boot throw on <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, but I can visualise it. It was Ferguson’s great strength that he always knew who to tackle and how. He approached <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> or <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> very directly, for example, but treated the shy <a href="ruud-van-nistelrooy.html">Ruud van Nistelrooy</a> way more gently on the other hand. <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> and Keane are two warhorses, used to a certain toughness. In England there is a different way of dealing with each other. Very open, honest, hard and direct. Way harder than in Germany. The English, Irish and Scottish players set the bar for what is allowed and what is not. Ferguson could only stimulate <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> and Keane by handing out criticism as harsh as possible</p>
