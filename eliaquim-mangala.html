  <p><b>[City captain Vincent Kompany versus Madrid]</b> When you play against Real Madrid or Barcelona, you know there is always going to be a question about Ronaldo or Messi - and the answer is always going to be the same. If we perform as a team then we’ve got a chance of stopping him. If not, he’s a really good player and he’ll probably get chances and score goals. It’s the same answer as every player always gives before a game against Real Madrid - it’s no different from our side.</p>

  <p>I’m quarantined at home. I’m lucky, I have a house where my family can remain isolated. There is one floor where I stay, and my family is upstairs. We’re trying to avoid each other as much as possible. My day is simple: I don’t have any symptoms, so I can continue to train. They <b>[<a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>]</b> gave us a schedule. With a mask, I go out in my garden to keep training. And then I watch documentaries, movies, I play video games. There’s Netflix, I read as well</p>

  <p><b>[Eliaquim Mangala on Coronavirus symptoms]</b> I’m feeling good and I have no symptoms associated with the virus. I didn’t have any symptoms, I was just like every day. So, when Sunday morning the doctor told me I was positive, I was shocked. I thought it was a joke at first. But when he talked about quarantine, for 14 days, staying away from my kids, I understood it wasn’t a joke</p>
