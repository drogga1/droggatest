<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Kano Pillars have released six players ahead of the 2017-18 season, with another six demoted to the junior side]</b> We have retained 22 players and have asked six to find other clubs. We also told another six to go back to the feeder team because they have dropped in form. They will be examined again and will be brought back if there are significant changes. We want to improve better than we did last season. We dropped 10 of the 12 for low productivity while <b>[Bala Zakka and Adamu Mohammed]</b> were told to go because they have become bad influence on other players due to their lack of discipline.<br /><br />They are very good players that we would have retained but we can’t compromise overall team unity. We started training last week and we shall continue with the first phase until we notice that our players have regained match fitness. We are going to move to the next phase not long thereafter.</p>
