<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Young veteran Jonathan Osorio proves adaptable for Toronto FC]</b> I think in the first year with Ryan Nelsen I started off playing in the middle of a two-man midfield, and then when I really got going is when they moved me out wide,. Moving me out wide just allowed me to see the whole field so everything was in front of me and I could see everything happening, and that helped me a lot to transition back into the <b>[central]</b> midfield.<br /><br />With Greg Vanney we started playing in the diamond and I was playing at the side of the diamond, and that was a bit of a change for me as well. Something I had to adapt to.<br /><br />I also tried a little bit of the top of the diamond, which allowed me to be more attacking, and now that we’re playing in a new formation, it’s more of a No. 8 role. I think it’s my best role. I think being box-to-box, both ways, is what I’m best at. Obviously I’m more offensive-minded but I think I’ve improved a lot defensively over the years<br /><br />Over the years the club has brought in guys to play in the same position as I play in, and that’s only made me get better as a player. It’s made me be more competitive in training to win my position. So far, <b>[with]</b> everybody they’ve brought in I’ve found a way to stay on the field. All that is good for me<br /><br />This team has gotten a lot better and came a long way since the first year I was playing. There’s a lot of competition at every position and that’s how the team has gotten better<br /><br />I think keeping the team in possession is my biggest strength. My feet, my technical ability, I feel that is really, really good. All these things, all my strengths, I want to keep improving<br /><br />I would say that the thing that needs most improving is just the final product. Getting more stats - more goals, more assists - and completing the final product. I think I have everything before that, I think I get into good positions, I create dangerous occasions, I just have to improve on finishing them off.<br /><br />I think I’m doing a good job of getting into these <b>[more advanced]</b> places and I think the amount of times that I am dangerous now has increased over the years, and that just comes with experience. The final stages and the finished product, I think if I can <b>[add that]</b> to my game I’ll turn a lot of heads</p>

  <p><b>[The Seattle Sounders and Toronto FC will collide on Sunday for an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup rubber match that looked all too improbable just several weeks ago]</b> I don’t shake my head at it. It means something, shows the consistency of the clubs in the last four years and what it means to be a top club in this league. All three times we’ve made it to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup we’ve done it in different ways, Seattle as well. The two clubs just find a way to win big games and that’s what matters</p>
