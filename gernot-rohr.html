  <p><b>[Nigeria vs South Africa. Coach Gernot Rohr, meanwhile, has told his side they must be perfectly focused on their upcoming challenge]</b> At this stage of the competition, it is important to have total concentration and avoid little mistakes. I hope we can produce a better performance from our previous games and also progress into the semi-final</p>

  <p><b>[Algeria vs Nigeria. Super Eagles boss Gernot Rohr thinks his side are facing a very different Algeria team this time around]</b> They were fragile at the time. We beat them 3-1 and there were lots of individual mistakes, they made it easy for us…in the return match they were also fragile. Now they are solid, they have a good balance between attack and defence, they are still very physical and they have progressed a lot. It will be a very different match from those two years ago</p>

  <p><b>[Tunisia vs Nigeria. Gernot Rohr insisted that his side are determined to still deliver a result from AFCON 2019, particularly with his own future looking to be secure in charge of the nation]</b> We will keep focused on the third-place playoff and hope to sign off with a happy result. I worked in Tunisia but on the pitch this means nothing. Both teams have similar ambitions and many young players who would like to win. Alain Giresse is an experienced coach and I’m always happy to play against him. When you are one of the four best teams in the continent, this is a good result and we have to build on it. This is a team with a brilliant future</p>

  <p><b>[Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has urged both Maja and Samuel Kalu to learn from the senior players at Bordeaux if they are to secure more call-ups]</b> They lack the work and the confidence. Work is training, everyday life, matches of course. And confidence. Confidence in themselves, but also the confidence of the staff. Competition is tough, of course, but it’s the future. We must always have a little patience with young people. You have to time it right, give Josh Maja the chance to start from time to time. He must be able to learn alongside the likes of Jimmy Briand, see how he is preparing, he is a great professional and he can pass on his experience</p>

  <p><b>[Nigerian football superstars join NFF ‘stay home’ campaign]</b> It is a difficult battle because we don’t see the enemy but we can win it together if we have this good solidarity. We have it in our football family and we must have it all together in Nigeria</p>
