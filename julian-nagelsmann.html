  <p><b>[Nagelsmann leaves <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> door open after passing up <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> opportunity]</b> It’s normal if <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> call you, you think about it. I was surprised at first, I weighed it up and I didn’t feel comfortable with a decision to go there. I want to improve. If you go to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, there’s no time to improve as a manager. You don’t have a chance to be a better manager, you already have to be the best. I’m not the best now, but I can admit I want to be one of the best in future<br /><br />If you go to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, the fans, the media and the decision-makers don’t give you the time to grow into that. They only want to see victories every game, titles, Champions League trophies. If you don’t win, you can’t say ‘but I’m still young, I’m still developing’. It’s not that easy in football to plan a career, because it is so unpredictable, but you have to try<br /><br />The main thing is to make the right steps, not the biggest steps. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is probably one of the highest steps you can take so I thought ‘you turn 31, go to Real and where to do you go from there?’ The other thing is language is very important to me. I like to communicate, I’m very expressive with my players. I can’t speak Spanish yet, I can only say, ‘hola, que tal.’ So it was the biggest step, but not the right step<br /><br />My normal idea is to stay at Leipzig for four years, but in football you never know what can happen. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> interests me as do other clubs in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, but I have to improve my Spanish first. I know it’s very tough in England. I’ve been reading the interviews of <b>[Jurgen]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> and <b>[Pep]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> about the intense fixture schedule and the demands on players and staff. I have a lot of interests outside of football like motorcross, skiing and enjoying experiences with my family. In <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, there is no time slot for anything else. Football, football, football. But there are a few clubs that I watch closely and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is a goal for every manager</p>

  <p><b>[Nagelsmann reveals admiration for <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s Reds]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have developed so well, especially in possession and having variety. In the first two seasons under <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, it was more about counter-attack and creating attacking moments. That’s the same process we are going through now at Leipzig, expanding to not only rely on pressing and counters. If you want to be a good manager, you have to watch <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> games. What they are doing is incredible. It’s the performances that you can learn from, but more importantly, is what you can take away from their mentality<br /><br />It’s totally crazy when you’re so successful, you’re 22 points ahead of the next team in the league, but you do more and more and more to win games. That is a big message to give to players, especially the young ones. They should learn from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to always be hungry, to be better. It doesn’t matter if you’re nearly the champion, you still win and win and win and win<br /><br />I watch a lot of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. Last season, City had great flexibility, so many ways to open up the game and interesting positions in ball possession.

  <p><b>[Nagelsmann reveals how <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> shaped his own management style]</b> During his time at Porto, he really shaped me. He let <a href="deco.html">Deco</a> and Co. play exceptionally good football. How he won the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Cup and the Champions League a year later against Monaco with a team that is big in Portugal but not the biggest club in Europe, was very impressive. At that time he was also a very young coach who was not a big player himself before and had a similar career like myself. It was exciting for me to see and I also copied a few things. <br /><br />After that he was internationally successful in all of his clubs. You noticed in all the games that he just knows how to win these knockout games. The winning goal was scored in the 93rd minute and you had the feeling that it was somehow planned. For me, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is an extreme coach with focus on results who is not very concerned with glamour on the pitch. He puts the result above everything and if you get so many titles doing that, it is certainly not a wrong way<br /><br /><b>[Nagelsmann says <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a>, who went on to manage Mainz, <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> and now <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, is the man who has had the biggest impact on his career to date]</b> Who shaped me the most was <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a>. For the simple reason that he was my own trainer and the exchange was so much more intense. I can rate how he really thinks. But there are certainly great parallels to <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s football idea.<br /><br />Dominance in all phases of the game - that would be the big headline for it. To put it more simply, it is about awareness that football is not just about conquering the ball, not just about possession. It is about a holistic approach and about developing solutions in all phases. I personally experienced which exercises <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a> did in training - that shaped me. I also have a similar approach.<br /><br />For me there are also various complicated exercises and I do not follow the classic training theory and its linear structure. Warm up, passing game, shots on goal, a game. <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a> did it completely differently. I also want to map a game in training. And in the game it just doesn’t work that you can easily get into it first. It may be that you are totally challenged in the first minute</p>

I totally respect and accept that we cannot overturn our salary structure for a player. At Hoffenheim I experienced that in an even much more extreme way. We have to grow healthily, that’s the crucial point. The example of <a href="dani-olmo.html">Dani Olmo</a> shows that we can make some transfers that other clubs cannot do. But financially, we’re still miles away from Bayern and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. In the next step, we have to reach the Champions League with conviction every year. And above all, we must not make the mistake that other clubs have made more often in the past. That is, living above your means for a year and then falling the next year - then everything collapses. Bayern and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> are global players, but we are a very young club. Of course, we cannot keep up with clubs that have been on the market for decades<br /><br />We will try to put our style on the field against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. We will not stay back and hope for the best. We don’t see ourselves as worse than <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> may have a slight advantage in terms of individual player quality, but they haven’t made the most stable impression this season either. We have a chance to progress. Our boys will be eager to reach the quarter-finals. I don’t think there is an outright favorite. It is a 50:50 duel that will depend on the daily form twice. It will also be important for us that we do not consider the first leg in isolation. Of course, the first leg result has a big impact on the second leg, but we have to think carefully about how we want to tackle both games beforehand</p>

We’ll have the right kit<br /><br />I think it was tricky in the end because we didn’t score the second goal. In the game, over the 90 minutes, in the first half we controlled the game bar one chance from <b>[Steven]</b> <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Bergwijn</a>. We had a lot of good possession and we played in a very mature way in the first half. We really should have taken the lead in the first five minutes.

As long as we bring in young players, who want to take the next step with us, it’s normal for them to get involved with bigger clubs once they’re successful with us and are developing faster than we are. At least we get good money in return, which we can invest again</p>

  <p><b>[RB Leipzig manager Julian Nagelsmann tells about is love of skateboarding]</b> Sometimes I go home on the skateboard. I live only seven kilometres away. It’s very fast. I’m good at skating because I snowboard and that is similar. It’s easy. All the fans who see me ride through the city are laughing. They can’t believe the manager of Leipzig is skateboarding! They like it. They never say, ‘He’s crazy’. They recognise that you are living a normal life.</p>

  <p><b>[RB Leipzig boss Nagelsmann discusses life in quarantined training camp]</b> Basically it’s like a summer training camp. We will try to prepare for the games, not only the Freiburg game, but also the games afterwards. But in itself, it’s like a summer training camp. It will be a normal training week, the players will sleep here. The boys can keep themselves busy. We have billiards, darts, Playstation and a TV in the room. So we are not in prison here. We may have a bit more meetings, but there won’t be a discussion or movie night every night. The boys are old enough to take care of themselves for two or three hours<br /><br />You have to work your moments a little differently without spectators. It is more about coaching points and if you have already experienced many situations, you can draw on a greater wealth of experience and support the boys who play next to you, especially the young players. Mutual coaching on the pitch will become a factor in these games<br /><br />I am one who coaches very aggressively and screams loudly so that my players can hear me. I will certainly have to change that. But whether I can do that right away, I’ll put a big question mark. It is definitely on my agenda because coaching without spectators can be a little scary. So I’m going to try to put in the proper guardrails.</p>

  <p><b>[RB Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann says <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> has become all the more unpredictable for defences]</b> Timo now has a good sense not only of letting himself attack on the wing, but also of going into the No. 10’s position. Coupled with his speed, this makes him more variable and more difficult for his opponents to get to grips with him. We cleared things up relatively quickly. It was a very confident performance against Mainz. I really liked not only the result, but also the way it occurred here</p>

  <p><b>[Leipzig moved up to third with their win against Mainz, but Nagelsmann is anticipating a tough contest against in-form Hertha, who have won two from two since Bruno Labbadia was appointed in April]</b> It’s tough to predict anything about Hertha as it’s only their third game under Bruno Labbadia. They will probably sit back and play on the break. Vedad Ibisevic is the perfect player for that. I’m happy to see Bruno and his passion back in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>.

  <p><b>[Julian Nagelsmann insists Werner leaving Leipzig would be like Bayern losing Lewandowski]</b> Of course you have conversations from time to time, but I have not spoken to him about that in the recent past. I think he now has 34 goals and assists <b>[this season]</b>. I think you have to mention that I would like to keep him. That is an extraordinary quality. If he leaves for the next season there would be a big gap. It’s like if <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a> leaves <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. Nobody shouts ‘Hurray!’ there either, I think. They’re clearly weakened then, and it’s the same with us. That we’d like to keep him is completely normal. He has an exit clause until a certain date - I honestly don’t know when - and if a club comes along and he agrees with them by then, then that’s the way it is.<br /><br /><b>[Nagelsmann has little else to say to Werner when it comes to making an attempt to get the forward to stay put]</b> There is nothing we can do about it anyway. He knows what he has in Leipzig and also what he has with me, I know what I have in him. And I show him that - similar to what I do with <b>[Dayot]</b> <a href="dayot-upamecano.html">Upamecano</a> - by letting him play every game from the beginning and if everything goes normally he is allowed to play through most games. He gets many chances to develop himself. That’s my job, I have to do that. I don’t know if it will help him that much if I tell him every day. I try to do it more with action. A player has to feel that he can get better. If he doesn’t feel that, it wouldn’t do any good if I kept on telling him to stay here. In the end it is his life, his career, he can decide that. We already had this discussion last year, then in winter and now again. I’m basically someone who knows what he has to say and can add his two cents to everything. But here I can’t think of anything new to say to Timo either. So I rather try to convince him with actions and in the end he has to know what he wants to do</p>

He was very committed. He was always working out front, like <b>[Paderborn coach]</b> Steffen <b>[Baumgart]</b> said. He was on the run a lot. He has a total of 32 or 33 goals this season. Today he missed a few chances, but still set up Patrik <b>[Schick]</b>’s goal. I think he would have liked to score with one of his two big chances, but that has nothing to do with the hype about his person. He has known that since he was 14<br /><br />We haven’t had an exchange yet. Accordingly, we have nothing to report. <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> is a player for <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a>. He signalled a few weeks ago that he was busy with a transfer. Until now nothing is done. We are concentrating on the final sprint in the league. We want to qualify for the Champions League. That is the only thing we are currently discussing with Timo. It was important for us that we extend the contract with him. We did that last summer because of course it is important for our young club that no player moves on a free transfer. Of course, there was this exit clause that we put in the contract to give him the opportunity to take the next step. Now Timo is sitting in the driver’s seat, not us anymore. So far, he has not drawn upon the clause, nor has any club sent us a transfer contract</p>

  <p><b>[Julian Nagelsmann admits Replacing <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> at <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> will be almost impossible]</b> It’s not possible <b>[to replace him]</b>, you can’t clone a player. If <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> leaves us, the main thing would be to replace 34 goals a season. That would be the main task, which perhaps could not be solved by just one player. It is important that we get the same output at the end of the day, that is the complex thing about the topic.<br /><br />If the contracts remain as they are, a player whose contract ends on June 30th theoretically would play for a new team beginning July 1st. It’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s turn <b>[to solve the problem]</b>. I personally find the idea interesting that players go to their new clubs on July 1, and then the same rules should apply to the Champions League as to national team secondments. In other words, the new club would have to relinquish the player to the old club for the Champions League games. Then there could be confused scenarios, but it would be very strange for me if it should come to the situation that you suddenly play against your own player<br /><br />Of course there are coaches whose game idea is similar to mine, but to name another, <b>[Atletico Madrid manager]</b> <a href="diego-simeone.html">Diego Simeone</a> has been teaching a similar football style for years, which is not always pleasant for his own players and is not always the most exciting, but the players still follow him unconditionally.

He runs around like dynamite and is still well received by his players. <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> must have something that will cast a spell over his players. It is extraordinary</p>
