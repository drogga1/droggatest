  <p><b>[Brazil and Santos legend Pepe has heaped praise on Gareth Bale]</b> Bale is very good, he has a lot of quality. If someone plays for Real Madrid then it says a lot about their ability. Real Madrid need great players, and he’s among the best. The 1958 Selecao team had players like Mario Zagallo, Garrincha, Pele - fantastic players. But a talented player such as Bale could also make that team.<br /><br />Do I see similarities between Bale any myself? There might be some, yes, but football has changed a lot. Back then we used to play with five or six forwards. Nowadays if you play two strikers, people find the coach to be quite bold. Bale is a first-class player, capable of winning matches by himself.<br /><br />Didi didn’t have a very potent kick, but his Folha Seca was simply amazing! The curve the ball made was incredible. I guess Bale’s free kicks are a combination of mine and Didi’s. My free kicks didn’t curve as much, but they were a blast, also with the outside of the foot, in a straight direction<br /><br />I got injured in Italy, right before going to Sweden, severely spraining my ankle and being unable to play. I was angry and just stayed inside the medical department putting hot water and ice alternately but that got me a third degree burn on my foot that made my comeback even harder!<br /><br />There was a great atmosphere within the squad, though. We would play music and tell folkloric stories about Garrincha. But when it was time to play, we were serious. Back then, we did get some information on our opponents before games, sometimes even with clips of them playing. But we didn’t have the resources that are available today, now you can even tell the eye colour for each player!<br /><br />We knew very little about Wales back then, only that they were a very compact team, just like England, and that they could cause us some trouble - as they did. We won in dramatic fashion, their goalkeeper <b>[Jack Kelsey]</b> was the best player on the pitch. But they also had some threatening moments, with fast counter-attacks, they were a very dangerous team in that sense. But we grabbed the win, we advanced to the next round and ultimately won the title with a very strong Selecao side<br /><br /><b>[So are the current Wales team featuring Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Ashley Williams better than the class of 1958?]</b> It is hard to say, I don’t consider myself enough of an expert on this current Wales team. I do know the current team are stronger offensively compared to the 1958 side who relied mainly on counter-attacks. This team is more complete, the players think more and are more dangerous<br /><br />It’s a tough task, but I don’t see much difference between Wales and the other sides on their half of the draw. I think they are capable of playing at the same level with all of them and even reaching the final. They have the quality and experienced players to do that</p>

  <p><b>[Messi or Pele?]</b> He did amazing stuff. Messi does as well, but Pele was taller, stronger, a better header, he had more drive. He had much more than Messi. Messi is short, that doesn’t stop him being a marvellous player, as Maradona was. These comparisions will always happen. For me, <b>[Pele]</b> was an alien, he did things that I have never seen other players do. He had the ability of a Messi, and the heading, strength, drive and speed of Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
