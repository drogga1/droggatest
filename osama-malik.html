  <p><b>[Melbourne City are dreaming of the AFC Champions League ahead of Sunday’s clash with Perth Glory]</b> For us, it’s massive. We want to be a club that can challenge for all the titles and the <b>[ACL]</b> is massive. It’s the biggest one in Asia.<br /><br />That’s why we’ve been aiming for that third spot once we found out we wouldn’t be able to make second. So it’s a massive game for us. We need to go there and try and win the game. We haven’t probably won as many away games as we would have liked this season but we’re confident with the personnel that we have in our squad that we can beat any team<br /><br />The FFA Cup Final was massive for us in terms of confidence because that was a game where everything was on the line and we had to win it and I think it was probably one of our best performances for the season. So it’s something we’ve taken strength from and we know if we play well and we play as a team, we can beat anyone.</p>
