  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has seen his struggles at Manchester United mocked by Manchester City fan Noel Gallagher]</b> It’s unbelievable at Manchester United … I think he’s doing a great job though! They’re not playing well, none of them, and it’s great to see. It’s really, really great to see for City fans, particularly as the United fans had that banner up for 30 years about us not winning a trophy. Every day that goes past and that club is in turmoil is a great day. They’ve lived through that period Liverpool went through, when you couldn’t see them not winning the league. But they’re floundering at the minute. There’s no plan. They’re saying Jose is going to go, but the only thing that is keeping him in the job is the fact there’s nobody there to take it. <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane? He doesn’t speak English - it would be chaos. That club is in a chaotic state. The thing about Mourinho, is that he gets a lot of flak for telling it how it is. He’s digging the players out, but they’re not playing well, none of them.<br /><br />He’s spent a lot of money, but he just hasn’t bought very well. The one thing about City is the players we have bought, you look at Leroy Sane, for instance, when we signed him we all thought, ‘Really? All that money?’ Someone at the club has got vision. Bernando Silva, Leroy Sane, Raheem Sterling, John Stones, Kyle Walker - they were all big money signings but all turned out to be brilliant, massive players for us. United, on the other hand, seem to be just buying big money players without a plan</p>

  <p><b>[What football team do Oasis stars Noel Gallagher &amp; Liam Gallagher support?]</b> Man United were in the Second Division then and we were the top team in Manchester for about 10 years. But over the years, when City have been struggling and United have become the best team in Europe, I’ve sometimes wondered why my dad brought me to Maine Road rather than Old Trafford. The reason is basically a family one - my dad hated his brothers. They were all Irish people who came over here and decided to support United. My dad chose City instead, just to piss them off. No other reason than that. Liam and I should by rights have been United fans.<br /><br /><b>[Noel witnessed Manchester City’s incredible title win in 2012 where Sergio Aguero scored a stoppage-time goal]</b> My mate tried to pull the TV off the wall. I swore a lot and then I cried like a baby because I’ve never seen anything like that before. It was mindblowing</p>

  <p><b>[Oasis icon Noel Gallagher hoping Pep stays for the long haul]</b> Guardiola to Juventus? It will never happen - I won’t allow it!<br /><br />What’s missing to win the Champions League? A little bit of luck, but there’s always next year. We don’t have to do it now. Every season I always check to see which city will host the final of the Champions League. If it’s in, say, I don’t know, Azerbaijan, I would say we don’t need to win it. But if it’s in Rome, we have to win. So the next time the final is in Rome we will win</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> are in trouble with <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> &amp; Alexis Sanchez]</b> The other mob in Stretford, they’re just buying individuals. You see <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez and <b>[Paul]</b> <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>. They’re in trouble. They remind me of where we were in the late 1980s/early 90s - they’re just trying to buy their way out of trouble now. As long as <b>[Pep]</b> Guardiola’s here, they’re not getting anywhere near us. No one is.<br /><br />Even next season, can <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> be any better than that? They’ve jammed it this season. I think next season, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> don’t get near us either</p>

  <p><b>[The Gallaghers have supported <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> since the early ’70s, years before the club were taken over by owner Shiekh Mansour which began the process of reclaiming some of the glory from rivals <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> Man United were in the Second Division then and we were the top team in Manchester for about 10 years.

  <p><b>[Long-serving <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> fan Noel Gallagher has said <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> deserve to be awarded <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title]</b> They’ve won it anyway. They should just give it to them. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have won the league, so they might as well give it to them. But the only thing to stop them doing that is relegation and promotion from the other leagues<br /><br />I think they should just start planning for next season now because this is going to go on. Football is all about the fans and I don’t agree with playing games behind closed doors. I don’t care if there’s six games on a day - although of course it will make the lockdown a bit better - but the games behind closed doors aren’t even that good to watch and people will turn up. All my mates who are City fans have said ‘if they start playing games behind closed doors, we’re going’. It could cause more trouble than it’s worth</p>

When you go to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> you don’t run it, you know what I mean? He left for a reason, I think there are a lot of politics at the club. But at City, he runs it, make no mistake about this, he runs it from top to bottom. I think he’s in the most enviable position. Apart from him and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I’d say every manager wants to be in that position where they are the top man at the club. What Pep says goes at that club and that’s the end of it.
