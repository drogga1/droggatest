  <p><b>[The Gallaghers have supported <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> since the early ’70s, years before the club were taken over by owner Shiekh Mansour which began the process of reclaiming some of the glory from rivals Manchester United]</b> Man United were in the Second Division then and we were the top team in Manchester for about 10 years. I’ve sometimes wondered why my dad brought me to Maine Road rather than Old Trafford. The reason is basically a family one - my dad hated his brothers. They were all Irish people who came over here and decided to support <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. My dad chose <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> instead, just to piss them off. No other reason than that. Liam and I should by rights have been <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> fans</p>

  <p><b>[Long-serving <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> fan Noel Gallagher has said <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> deserve to be awarded <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title]</b> They’ve won it anyway. They should just give it to them. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have won the league, so they might as well give it to them. But the only thing to stop them doing that is relegation and promotion from the other leagues<br /><br />I think they should just start planning for next season now because this is going to go on. Football is all about the fans and I don’t agree with playing games behind closed doors. I don’t care if there’s six games on a day - although of course it will make the lockdown a bit better - but the games behind closed doors aren’t even that good to watch and people will turn up. All my mates who are City fans have said ‘if they start playing games behind closed doors, we’re going’. It could cause more trouble than it’s worth</p>

  <p><b>[While <a href="trevor-sinclair.html">Trevor Sinclair</a> believes <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> is destined to head back to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>, famous City fan Noel Gallagher is not convinced that the proven winner is looking for a way out of his current surroundings]</b> Pep runs <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, he runs it. When you go to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> you don’t run it, you know what I mean? He left for a reason, I think there are a lot of politics at the club. But at City, he runs it, make no mistake about this, he runs it from top to bottom. I think he’s in the most enviable position. Apart from him and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I’d say every manager wants to be in that position where they are the top man at the club. What Pep says goes at that club and that’s the end of it. So for him to throw that away and go back to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, where all the politics and the history … and going back, can it ever be as good? I can’t see it.</p>
