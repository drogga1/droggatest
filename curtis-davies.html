  <p><b>[<a href="ali-curtis.html">Curtis</a> Davies says Villa Still Aiming For Top Four]</b> Villa Still Aiming For Top Four. You’d have expected, in my opinion, to have taken more points from some of the games which we didn’t and we’d have been right up there then. But it’s one of those things. It’s a long season and we can always catch up, or drop off even more.<br /><br />Even if we were right up there I’m sure the likes of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> wouldn’t let us run away and stay in that top four. They would be trying to knock us back down, so it’s up to us to keep doing what we’re doing</p>

If we played <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>, at least they’d be the same in the heat as us. But playing them, I’m sure they are going to be running around like maniacs in that heat. Hopefully, we will get through the group stage, get to play <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and see what their new signings are like.<br /><br /><b>[The former West Bromwich Albion defender also feels the tournament will prepare the side for next season’s Europa League]</b> Come the Europa League, we are going to play against sides like <a href="malaga-fc.html">Malaga</a>, so this is the standard we need to reach</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>’s <a href="ali-curtis.html">Curtis</a> Davies Could Face Surgery]</b> I am disappointed, because I managed to get through the game on Monday at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> with no problems at all. I got a goal and felt good. Do I need surgery? Possibly. We will have to look at things. I don’t know if it needs a rest or something needs to be done, I don’t know. I need to speak to the boss. I can’t just make the decision myself because I am not a doctor. I’ll speak to the doctor and then we’ll go with however he wants to do it<br /><br /><b>[Davies was hoping to remain healthy, as he pushed for a first team spot at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>]</b> It happened about four years ago when I was at <b>[West Bromwich]</b> Albion in training. It never happened again, until the away FA Cup tie with <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> last season and then didn’t happen until <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> in the Peace Cup three weeks ago. But since then, it’s been awkward. I managed to get through a game two days later, which shows it is erratic but it can’t keep happening and I need to make sure it is right.<br /><br />It is something surgery can heal but it means a lengthy lay-off, so you have to weigh up the pros and cons. I want to play as many games as I can this year. I need a big year but at the same time I’d rather be playing at 100 per cent strength rather than 50 per cent strength because it is no good playing with one arm every game</p>

People describe me as having a lack of form of an injury but how can you lack form without playing games? I wasn’t allowed to go on loan in January but was kept as a spare part basically. Were promises broken? Yes, but I was more angry than hurt as I knew I should have been allowed to go out on loan and play matches</p>

  <p><b>[Hull boss <a href="steve-bruce.html">Steve Bruce</a> vows <a href="ali-curtis.html">Curtis</a> Davies going nowhere]</b> It’s the first I’ve heard of it <b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s bid]</b>. There’s going to be speculation about any player that’s doing well and <a href="ali-curtis.html">Curtis</a> is doing well. I don’t even have to bother with my owner with £6m. We don’t want to lose our good players and that wouldn’t even tempt us. I wouldn’t even have to ask the question on it and that’s the strength we’ve got.<br /><br />We all realise how important <a href="ali-curtis.html">Curtis</a> has been to us and for anyone to sell their best players now it would have to be at a premium which would blow us away. That wouldn’t even scratch the surface. Where could I replace <a href="ali-curtis.html">Curtis</a> Davies in January for that amount? The last thing I want to do is dismantle a squad I’m trying to put together. I’m not naive enough to think every player hasn’t got a price but not at that sort of money.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ali-curtis.html">Curtis</a> Davies admits Talk of <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> linking up with Derby was written off as a ‘wind up’ by those at Pride Park]</b> It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster season, to be honest. Wayne signing was massive. When we first saw it on the news we thought it was a wind up. Him signing was massive. He’s obviously come here for different reasons. He wants to start his coaching career with the club as well. That’s helped us to get him in but the job he’s done on the pitch has been fantastic and he’s been what you expect from <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a>. He’s been top quality and he’s been using it both for himself and also for the young lads to help them come through too<br /><br />He’s definitely got the way about him. I’ve not been in any sessions with him to know what his coaching is like but I know good managers can also be good coaches. I can see it in him, obviously he’s got a wealth of experience and played at the very top level, captained England, captained <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, won everything so at worst he can command the respect of any player, which is what you need as a manager when you are starting out</p>
