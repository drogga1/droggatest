  <p><b>[<a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> have parted company with manager <a href="martin-o-neill.html">Martin O’Neill</a> and replaced him with the former Ivory Coast boss Sabri Lamouchi]</b> The club would like to thank Martin for all his efforts during his time at The City Ground and wish him well for the future.<br /><br /><a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> are delighted to announce that Sabri Lamouchi has been appointed as the club’s new head coach. He led the Ivory Coast to the 2014 World Cup as the top-ranked side in Africa and the quarter-finals of the 2013 African Cup of Nations, and won the Qatari Cup and reached the Asian Champions League semi-finals during his time at El Jaish SC. <b>[Lamouchi]</b> will be assisted at Forest by six new members of staff who will support the first team</p>

  <p><b>[Leeds United vs <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a>. Forest, who went down last weekend 2-1 to West Brom]</b> The West Brom result impacted on the players a little bit but I’m asking them to keep their confidence up because I know they can play as well as they did in the first 10 minutes. That is why I want players here with personality and experience because we will go through tough times but it is how we respond to those tough times that is important</p>

  <p><b>[Lewis Grabban scored twice as <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> bolstered their position in play-off places with a 3-1 over <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> on Sunday]</b> I’m happy with the three points. It was a really important game for the rest of the season. Of course the way we play sometimes is enough and sometimes is not, but I’m disappointed at the end <b>[to lose the clean sheet]</b>. But it wasn’t always easy and it was a good result. Lewis is our key player and striker. He works a lot for the team so well done to him, but also well done for the boys</p>

  <p><b>[Tiago Silva’s terrific free-kick fired <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> to victory and extended Bristol City’s wretched winless run on a night when <a href="ashley-williams.html">Ashley Williams</a> saw red]</b> Massive result. It’s a great victory, an important victory. I was happy for the boys of course for the victory, but especially for the clean sheet<br /><br />Honestly, it’s impossible not to think about that <b>[automatic promotion]</b> especially when you are looking the way we play physically, where we are, what we are doing. We are having a fantastic season. We have now one more point than the last year so it’s really important to keep going, stay focused and game by game</p>

  <p><b>[Sabri Lamouchi says <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> must retain focus]</b> It is important to keep our focus, but the players know what they have to do. In the last game, <b>[a 1-0 home win over Bristol City]</b> I was really impressed because without fans and without the right intensity to keep the focus higher like that, it is not easy, especially when we played 16 minutes more. They know what they need to do because minute after minute, half after half, game after game they feel something good. They are working hard every day for that<br /><br />There are important games, important points, important details and important minutes and we have started in a fantastic way, scored five goals with seven points out of nine and we have conceded two goals only in extra time. It is positive, so we have to keep focused and to continue to work hard with this atmosphere around the team, inside the dressing room, on the pitch and at the club every day<br /><br />Definitely, we’ll give it a go. We have come a long way and we have now put ourselves in a position where we are one point off Cardiff. We all know we have six games coming up against the top teams in the league, but it’s positive that we have this big challenge ahead of us in the final stages of the league. That’s why we play</p>

  <p><b>[Jayden Stockley cancelled out a Lewis Grabban penalty as play-off chasers Preston and <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> fought out a tense 1-1 draw in the Sky Bet Championship]</b> It is a good point and a good performance. I think it was a fair result, a good result. I am happy for the boys because they never give up, they are focused and serious. They are fighters. We have just played Derby and Fulham - teams with a different dynamic. Here we faced a lot of long balls but the boys stood up. They are tired but they kept going. One point is a good result and now we need to think about the next one</p>

  <p><b>[Sammy Ameobi scored twice to leave <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> with one foot in the Championship play-offs and <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a>’s hopes looking rather slimmer following a 2-2 draw at the City Ground]</b> We will not relax, we will try to take more points. We will have a rest, because the players are tired and we need energy for the next one, at
Barnsley. We did not play so well in the first half. But there was a positive reaction in the second half from the boys. The way we started was so very wrong. We started without confidence or organisation. <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> are a good team and they showed that tonight. We deserved to be back in the game and we tried with the substitutions and our energy to win. We need to be more patient, we need to take more time. Sometimes we took the wrong decision. I am satisfied with the point, but we tried to play for all three. We wanted the win. Fortunately, Sammy was in a good place. He scored two nice goals, one with the right and one with the left</p>
