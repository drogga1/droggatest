  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> defender Michael Duberry knows what it takes to beat <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> at Old Trafford]</b> It’s always a tall order going to Old Trafford but if we could do it then I see no reason why the current <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> side can’t do it as well and go there and win, but everyone will have to be on top of their game. Nowadays the stakes are a lot higher because whoever wins this game will have taken a major step towards <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title. We had European expectations but it wasn’t a must-win game for us because winning the league was just beyond us, even though we did well in the knock-out competitions. Now they demand that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> try to win it. This Sunday they have a good chance of going up there and pulling off a win. No one should be writing off their chances but they will have to make sure they are ready for an early onslaught because United have scored 13 goals in their last two games which is phenomenal<br /><br />United are on fire but when <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> go there they will go there without fear. If they can defend solidly then they will have a fighting chance, especially if they can make their set-pieces count and make sure their counter-attacks are incisive. The thing is in those days we weren’t really on a par with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> but the current team is right up there so they have nothing to fear. We would always give them a good run for their money but they usually just had enough to beat us. Now it is different and if everyone plays to their potential, this <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> can go and do what we did and upset the bookies. We never got turned over but the expectations of the current set of players are much higher now than they were when I was at Stamford Bridge<br /><br />I still get tweets from people asking me if I remember that goal up at Old Trafford which shows that it was more significant than even I thought it was and for me it was massive. So I guess that just shows how much it means to be on the winning side there as a fan, a player or as part of the staff because it is one of the greatest and most historic stages in the world of football. I still remember it clearly. It was my mum’s birthday and I can recall to this day how I rose like a proverbial salmon to nod a corner past <a href="peter-schmeichel.html">Schmeichel</a> and then I remember Luca Vialli going through and beating <a href="peter-schmeichel.html">Schmeichel</a> one-on-one and we were ahead 2-1. Everything clicked for us that day. Everyone did their job and everyone to a man played well. Our goalie <a href="kevin-hitchcock.html">Kevin Hitchcock</a> was superb, Dennis Wise’s set-pieces were spot-on, our defence held their attackers, our midfield dominated <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> and <a href="mark-hughes.html">Mark Hughes</a> and Luca ran the United defence ragged. I went there a few times afterwards but never managed to win again which is why that was something to savour, and my goal celebration was even used by Sky Sports for advertising the next season. That always brought a smile to my face. I’m hoping one of the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> players gets similar treatment next season for scoring the winner</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Duberry signed for Leeds from Chelsea for £4.5 million in 1999. He would experience their spectacular rise and fall first hand]</b> The atmosphere and the environment was the best of my football career. I still speak to some of the squad now and they’d agree. Everyone wanted to do well and had each other’s backs. There was no bitterness. There were no cliques. Everyone just had the same vision and wanted the same thing<br /><br /><b>[Peter Ridsdale and his fellow board members had long known the risks attached to how the club was operating but felt that players could be sold at any moment to rebalance the books]</b> We’d just had a great campaign in the Champions League and fans were now seeing players being sold. Players started going and you could see that things weren’t the same. Any business that loses huge assets is going to go down the pecking order, and that’s what happened. As much as we still had some good players in the squad, you’re going to end up in decline<br /><br /><b>[Relegation seemed likely from the start]</b> I’ve always got this image in my head of me sitting on the floor with no shirt on after the home game against Charlton, when we’d gone down. As a sportsman you’re competitive. You tell yourself you’re good. You tell yourself you’re the best. But in that moment, you know you’re not good enough. You’re one of the three worst teams. That realisation that you’re not good enough – you’re not even a Premier League player any more – really hits home. The fans ran on the pitch but from a personal point of view no sportsman wants to deal with failure. It’s a deep loss. Leeds is a big club and you’re part of one of its darkest times. It’s not nice to have that association<br /><br /><b>[Leeds’ direction of travel was evident from their transfer dealings in the summer of 2003. Jody Morris was the only permanent arrival, on a free transfer from Chelsea, while gaps in the squad were plugged by speculative loan signings from French football, like Zoumana Camara, Lamine Sakho, Salomon Olembe and Cyril Chapuis]</b> Slowly but surely the squad was being stripped out. From that period up until now, Leeds United were just in the papers for anything other than football. It was a pure distraction. You’d be doing the press on a Friday and you weren’t even being asked football questions. Even if you were focused as a player it was just always brought up so you had to address it. With some of the fans not liking what they’re reading it made for an intense atmosphere<br /><br /><b>[In October 2003, Trevor Birch had been appointed as the club’s Chief Executive]</b> I remember the meeting vividly. All the senior players, like me, Mark Viduka, Gary Kelly, Jason Wilcox and David Batty agreed that any player earning over a certain amount would pay. Not the young lads. Anyone getting paid over a certain amount would agree to defer 25% of their wages, which we thought was reasonable. The club turned around to us and said we were being unreasonable. It got out in the media. I remember in The Yorkshire Post there was a big campaign saying that the players were greedy. It was a misinterpretation. The club was in turmoil and then a section of the fans were turning on some of the players because they thought we were being greedy and not wanting to help</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> defender Michael Duberry urges greater transparency in selection for football roles]</b> We need to see more black people on the coaching levels, more black people on boardroom level so that the way of thinking is diverse. At the moment the way of thinking is all the same because there is not a different voice, not a different way of seeing things. The way of thinking is the same. The selection process will be the same so unless you start getting some diverse people on the boards, the way of thinking will always be the same and it will filter right down to the grassroots level<br /><br />The <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> rule hasn’t impacted here and you see by the numbers. There should be a transparency in showing their selection, their interviews, the people that have come for interviews. It needs to be an impact from upstairs. You need to get a more diverse boardroom and then the decisions would be a little different. At the moment the way of thinking is all the same. Whether it is sport or business you need some diversity so as to change the way people see things and then there would be a sense of equality</p>
