  <p><b>[Fabian Delph discusses his supernatural sightings]</b> I see ghosts all the time. Genuinely. I think I’ve seen about four. When I first signed for Villa I stayed in a hotel there was a lot of things moving in the room, a lot of bangs. And about four months ago I saw, in my house in God’s country <b>[Yorkshire]</b>, I saw two ghosts in the bedroom. I don’t think they’re there to harm me. But I’ve definitely seen them. It was just a split second and then they were gone. The one four months ago, that actually was carrying a body, it went out onto my balcony, then disappeared</p>

  <p><b>[Kompany set to miss Gladbach clash]</b> Fabian Delph returned to training ahead of City’s trip to Monchengladbach, but Vincent Kompany looks set to miss out. The Man City skipper was forced off against Crystal Palace on Saturday after suffering from blurred vision and won’t be risked in Germany.<br /><br />Delph hasn’t featured for the first team since the end of August when he was an unused sub against West Ham. He required surgery on a troublesome groin problem and his return will give Pep Guardiola another midfield option.</p>

  <p><b>[Fabian Delph is hopeful of an England World Cup call-up]</b> I’m itching to get on that plane, I’ve had a good season and I’ve shocked a few people. The only problem I might have is that I’ve pulled out of the squad this year when I’ve not been fit, but Gareth Southgate is a good guy and a good manager. I’ve spoken to him a few times and he knows what my answer will be. I’m quietly confident that I probably will get the call-up.</p>

  <p><b>[Fabian Delph has hailed Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola as a genius]</b> He’s fantastic. For me, he is a genius. He has opened my eyes to so much. I didn’t picture football like Pep does. He’s painted the pictures for me. I stayed mentally strong, and I knew if I got my opportunity to play I could contribute and help the lads win games. I’m a very traditional English guy who believes in hard work and dedication and giving it absolutely everything. I’m there to fight and pick up second balls, to be that old English type of player, but he has reinvented me. Now it’s all about being calm and collected on the ball, being sensible in terms of if someone occupies my position then I need to occupy a different position. Pep smells the danger. We’ve got so many systems the way we played. Everybody seems to think, ‘Wow, what are they doing?’ But it is very simple. Basically we move the ball very fast, we take as few touches as possible and we stay in the positions, we utilise the spaces and distances perfectly and we have the courage to play out and build up from the back. And we work on it daily. Every session we do there is always an aim to it, there is always a reason why we are doing a certain exercise, not just having a five-a-side for the sake of it and fitness work. Everything is geared towards the game and the team we are playing next.<br /><br /><b>[He added on the position he considers to be his]</b> I’ll give you the textbook answer - wherever the team needs me I’ll be there to give 100 per cent. If it’s left-back, centre midfielder, defensive or attacking, I’ll give 100 per cent. If it’s in goal I’ll play there - but I will be rubbish!</p>

  <p><b>[Sancho shines on first England start to show Premier League youngsters the way forward]</b> I’m so pleased for him. Only 18 years old, to put in a performance like that. it was a very, very mature performance. He’s a special talent and the sky’s the limit for him. He’ll keep working hard and pushing forward, but I wasn’t surprised. I knew what he was capable of. It’s just pleasing that you guys get to see it.</p>

  <p><b>[Fabian Delph was thrilled to captain England for the first time]</b> We’ve got a lot of leaders at Man City. Vincent’s a very good leader but we’ve got five or six very vocal lads in the team, including myself, so it’s a role I’m used to having. I was captain at Aston Villa before I went to Man City, so I’ve been in that position before. It felt absolutely amazing. To represent your country is a massive honour but to lead them out as captain is something very special, something I’ll remember for the rest of my life. I always dreamt I would represent my country. I’ve always been the type of guy with a leader’s mentality whether I’ve got the armband or not, I’m usually very vocal. But to actually have the armband and lead the boys out was an amazing moment for me<br /><br /><b>[On Jadon Sancho]</b> I’m so pleased for him. Only 18 years old, to put in a performance like that, it was a very, very mature performance. He’s a special talent and the sky’s the limit for him. He’ll keep working hard and pushing forward, but I wasn’t surprised. I knew what he was capable of. It’s just pleasing that you guys get to see it. There’s a stigma around English players in the past, but this kid’s technically very good, he can dribble with both feet, he can score goals and get assists, he’s very fast. He makes very smart decisions for someone at such a young age, so I can see him progressing and doing well in the future<br /><br />I think the message is very clear. Everyone is very well drilled whatever formation we play. For me, I’m used to playing in different positions being at City. With the manager there we’ve got five or six different ways to play. It’s something I’m quite accustomed to, but Gareth and his team get the message out very clearly to the lads and if we’re able to implement what they want us to do, we’re usually successful. It’s always difficult because you come from your clubs and we’re only here four or five times a year with the national team. So you’ve almost got to pull yourself out of what you’ve been doing with your club and sink your teeth into what Gareth wants. But because we’ve got such good managers in the Premier League, the lads are becoming versatile and able to adapt to different systems<br /><br /><b>[On Wayne Rooney]</b> It’s been a fantastic week for him and for us guys, we’ve really enjoyed having him. You can see the class and the quality is still there, and for any young player wanting to do well in football, he’s definitely a role model that people will look up to</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> has no hard feelings towards England team-mate Fabian Delph after the tackle that wrecked the end of his season]</b> Me and Harry are really close. We’re in the leadership group here together and we’ve got a lot of time for each other. I mean, it was heat of the moment type thing, I wasn’t quite sure what had happened. I just felt his knee hit my knee and I landed on him. A lot was made about that challenge, whether I’d ‘done’ him or he’d ‘done’ me. I just think it’s part and parcel of football. I spoke with Harry straight after the game. I went into the changing room to see him and we had a conversation, wished each other well.<br /><br /><b>[Delph also faced a shorter time on the sidelines, giving him opportunity to poke fun at his international colleague’s frame]</b> I think I was out for two weeks after that tackle… his big knee. It was just an unfortunate collision where we both came out on the bad side of it. We spoke to each other, we’re good mates, and hopefully he’ll come back and be firing<br /><br />Although from the outside it looks like ‘bloody hell, where is everyone?’ we’ve been working diligently. We’ve been watching a lot of clips on Holland, we’ve been working hard in training, we know what we need to know. We know the systems that we might need to play or adapt to. Going into the game I think we’ll be totally fine. The guys that are in the Champions League, they’re exceptional players</p>

  <p><b>[Fabian Delph says he made the decision to leave <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in hopes of boosting his chances of playing for England]</b> From a personal point of view, I felt it was time for a change. I could have stayed there. They were happy with me. I wasn’t told to leave. I played quite a key role within that squad. I had a fantastic four years there, thoroughly enjoyed it, but I wanted a new challenge. I wanted to play more football. Playing for England is massive for me, so if I’m playing more regularly, there’s more chance of me being selected. I’ve got a great relationship with Gareth <b>[<a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a>]</b> and the England lads, we’re a really close group. The mentality there is fantastic<br /><br /><b>[while Delph was impressed with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s style at his old club, he claims training under his new boss <a href="marco-silva.html">Marco Silva</a> is tougher than it was with <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> champions]</b> The volume is a lot higher, we cover a lot more distance. There’s a lot more intensity and you definitely feel like you’ve worked come the end of the day. I love it. There’s nothing worse for me than going home with energy. City’s training is very good, it’s shorter and sharper and is the way the manager likes the lads to play</p>

However, it has now been decided that Delph is unlikely to feature and will return to his club for further rehabilitation.

He was the reason why I stayed in the team as long as I did. I owe everything to him. He was fantastic with me, always very honest. In my first year at City, I had been hit and miss with injuries. I didn’t play as much as I would have liked and had the opportunity to go. Mikel said: ‘I don’t want you to leave. I feel there is a spot here. The way we want to play is different to what a lot of people have seen but you are very capable of doing it’. We worked on it a few times in training and I decided to stay. Everything he said came true - I knew he would end up as a manager<br /><br />If your boss gets the sack, you will get a reaction because you want to impress your new boss. That happens at every club and in every walk of life. There are similarities between Pep and Carlo, they’ve both won and been very successful. They’ve both managed fantastic clubs and fantastic players - they both have a winning mentality. It’s still early stages but I’m really excited for the future</p>
