  <p><b>[Fabian Delph discusses his supernatural sightings]</b> I see ghosts all the time. Genuinely. I think I’ve seen about four. When I first signed for Villa I stayed in a hotel there was a lot of things moving in the room, a lot of bangs. And about four months ago I saw, in my house in God’s country <b>[Yorkshire]</b>, I saw two ghosts in the bedroom. I don’t think they’re there to harm me. But I’ve definitely seen them. It was just a split second and then they were gone. The one four months ago, that actually was carrying a body, it went out onto my balcony, then disappeared</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Kane has no hard feelings towards England team-mate Fabian Delph after the tackle that wrecked the end of his season]</b> Me and Harry are really close. We’re in the leadership group here together and we’ve got a lot of time for each other. I mean, it was heat of the moment type thing, I wasn’t quite sure what had happened. I just felt his knee hit my knee and I landed on him. A lot was made about that challenge, whether I’d ‘done’ him or he’d ‘done’ me. I just think it’s part and parcel of football. I spoke with Harry straight after the game. I went into the changing room to see him and we had a conversation, wished each other well.<br /><br /><b>[Delph also faced a shorter time on the sidelines, giving him opportunity to poke fun at his international colleague’s frame]</b> I think I was out for two weeks after that tackle… his big knee. It was just an unfortunate collision where we both came out on the bad side of it. We spoke to each other, we’re good mates, and hopefully he’ll come back and be firing<br /><br />Although from the outside it looks like ‘bloody hell, where is everyone?’ we’ve been working diligently. We’ve been watching a lot of clips on Holland, we’ve been working hard in training, we know what we need to know. We know the systems that we might need to play or adapt to. Going into the game I think we’ll be totally fine. The guys that are in the Champions League, they’re exceptional players</p>

  <p><b>[Everton have confirmed the signing of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> midfielder Fabian Delph, for a fee believed to be around £8.5 million, which could rise to £10m]</b> I’m really happy to be here, I’m going to give absolutely everything - nothing less than 100 per cent. Every time I have played against Everton, whether it was home or away, straight away the first thing that comes to mind when you see the fans is passion. The Everton fans seem to know football, seem to understand it, it seems to be in their blood and they really back the team. You are always going to hear Evertonians and I’m excited to play at home and hear them when I am playing</p>

  <p><b>[Fabian Delph says he made the decision to leave <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in hopes of boosting his chances of playing for England]</b> From a personal point of view, I felt it was time for a change. I could have stayed there. They were happy with me. I wasn’t told to leave. I played quite a key role within that squad. I had a fantastic four years there, thoroughly enjoyed it, but I wanted a new challenge. I wanted to play more football. Playing for England is massive for me, so if I’m playing more regularly, there’s more chance of me being selected. I’ve got a great relationship with Gareth <b>[<a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a>]</b> and the England lads, we’re a really close group. The mentality there is fantastic<br /><br /><b>[while Delph was impressed with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s style at his old club, he claims training under his new boss Marco Silva is tougher than it was with the Premier League champions]</b> The volume is a lot higher, we cover a lot more distance. There’s a lot more intensity and you definitely feel like you’ve worked come the end of the day. I love it. There’s nothing worse for me than going home with energy. City’s training is very good, it’s shorter and sharper and is the way the manager likes the lads to play</p>

  <p><b>[Everton midfielder Fabian Delph withdraws from England squad with hamstring injury]</b> The midfielder arrived at St. George’s Park with an injury but it was hoped he would be available to play a part in the Three Lions’ forthcoming <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Euro 2020 qualifiers. However, it has now been decided that Delph is unlikely to feature and will return to his club for further rehabilitation. No further replacements are planned as England prepare for Thursday night’s fixture against Montenegro - the 1,000th men’s international - and Sunday’s trip to Kosovo</p>

  <p><b>[Fabian Delph has said that he owes everything to <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> ahead of <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s trip to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> on Sunday]</b> Mikel was incredible for me. He was the reason why I stayed in the team as long as I did. I owe everything to him. He was fantastic with me, always very honest. In my first year at City, I had been hit and miss with injuries. I didn’t play as much as I would have liked and had the opportunity to go. Mikel said: ‘I don’t want you to leave. I feel there is a spot here. The way we want to play is different to what a lot of people have seen but you are very capable of doing it’. We worked on it a few times in training and I decided to stay. Everything he said came true - I knew he would end up as a manager<br /><br />If your boss gets the sack, you will get a reaction because you want to impress your new boss. That happens at every club and in every walk of life. There are similarities between Pep and Carlo, they’ve both won and been very successful. They’ve both managed fantastic clubs and fantastic players - they both have a winning mentality. It’s still early stages but I’m really excited for the future</p>
