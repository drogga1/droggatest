  <p><b>[Mason Mount is not afraid to make difficult decisions]</b> When I went on trial at Chelsea, it was like a year ahead of me. Their players were much better, the competition was much more intense and you could tell that it was different. It was a hard decision to choose Chelsea over my boyhood club, the team I grew up supporting and lived close to. But it was definitely the best decision that I have made. I think that was definitely the turning point for me. The improvement and development I made at Chelsea from a young age has turned me into the player that I am now.<br /><br />It has been a massive learning curve for me, coming from an academy to a professional league. At the start of the season, I found it hard because I wasn’t playing as much as I wanted. I knew that would be what would happen because I came from the Under-19 Euros and I came in late. It was hard, I sat on the bench when we played away at Ajax and it was very frustrating for me because I just wanted to play. It is hard to take, but that’s football and that’s what I learned from coming here. You have got to fight for your position<br /><br />My goal is to play at the highest level I can. To get to the top, that’s the goal of every young football player. I want to play in the Champions League; that’s the pinnacle of club football. I am working towards that. I am working hard in training every day to achieve that.<br /><br />I am working on my finishing. I want to score more goals and make more assists. That’s definitely my target: make as many goals and assists as I can. I work on my finishing with my right and left foot, my corners, free-kicks and my all-round game. When I was growing up and playing for Chelsea, Frank Lampard is someone that I would always watch. He is a goalscoring midfielder. I was watching his games, his goals and how he arrives into the box. He is always in the right position, so that’s something I try to look at and emulate. Also Luka Modric and Andres Iniesta; I think they are definitely top, top players. I always try to watch their games and take little bits from them. But I also work on the physical side. I am not a big physical player so I rely on my quick footwork and movement, but I think that’s a side that I am working on. I want to get bigger and stronger<br /><br /><b>[On starting against Lazio in a Europa League clash at the Stadio Olimpico]</b> That was definitely a moment I will remember for a long time. I took a lot from it. You are playing in a massive stadium against a very big team; that’s where I had to take my opportunity to show what I can do. I thought I played well. That’s definitely one moment that stands out. The decision to go out on loan was talked about way before I came here but I think it was the perfect step to go to Vitesse. I think my dad and my family have been very happy with the choice I made. So, my focus is at Vitesse until the end of the season and then I will go back to Chelsea and we will see what happens</p>

  <p><b>[Mason Mount, Derby’s NxGn hotshot hoping to follow in Frank Lampard’s footsteps]</b> This season is going to be tough for me - playing so many games - and I want to keep focus on that at the moment. Chelsea is the main goal for me, I want to play in their first-team. Frank <b>[Lampard]</b> has been brilliant. He has spoken to me a lot one-to-one before and after I signed. I’m always speaking to him and for me, being an attacking midfielder, I couldn’t learn off anyone bigger or better than that. I always go into a game trying to get an assist and trying to get a goal, I want to influence games.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea loanee Mason Mount opens up on first England international]</b> It’s something I’m going to remember for a very, very long time. It gives you confidence during the game <b>[to know the England manager is watching]</b>. But I just focused on the game and how I could influence the game. When I got the message I had to read it a couple of times to take the words in. But I just try to focus on football. We’ve got QPR coming up and that’s the most important thing for me at the moment. Then whatever happens in the international break, happens.<br /><br />Two tough games. It’s obviously great experience for me. I think I have to say thank you to the gaffer … all the staff here at Derby. And the players as well. Without them, without the way we play, the way we have been playing, I wouldn’t be in this position right now. It’s tough <b>[in the Championship]</b>. Sometimes you’re playing three games in a week, then you have to get the recovery in. There’s experienced, older players in this league</p>

It’s a game you want to play in but it does have a weird feeling because that’s our parent club and we’re playing against them, so it’s different, but we’re definitely ready for it.<br /><br />We were both expecting not to be able to play. It’s excitement, getting on the pitch, how many times we’ve played on that pitch already for the youth teams, we’ve been there before, it’s a massive game for us but the whole team’s ready.

I want to come back and play for Chelsea, but at this moment I’m at Derby and I’m loving it, so that’s where my focus is.<br /><br />This season so far has been unbelievable. To be called up to England, to play at Old Trafford and then to come and play at the Bridge, there’s so much experience I can take away. I’m loving it at Derby at the moment. We’re playing some unbelievable football and the team is so close, we’re like a family. That makes it even better. This season has been a step up and it’s been harder, but I’ve learned so much</p>

  <p><b>[The making of Mason Mount]</b> I was training with Portsmouth and Southampton a little bit more because it was close to home. Then I would travel up to Chelsea to train with them. At Chelsea, it was a totally different level. The boys were so much better, the training was a year in advance of the other two academies. It was the best decision because you learn so much, with the competition between the boys being so much higher.<br /><br />I think it was the best decision I made at that time. I had a season of U23s football and I played in almost every game. For me, at that time I needed to move on. I didn’t need to play another year of U23s and it wouldn’t have helped me. So it was a massive decision to move out to Holland. I was 18 and moved to a different country on my own. It was a tough decision but, looking back on it now, it was the best decision. I learned so much from being out there<br /><br />I think there’s a massive difference <b>[between me before I moved and now]</b>. I will have around 80 games when I finish this season. I am learning so much from playing in the professional leagues and I think I have gained so much experience. I have added different parts to my game. You learn so much from these different players that you wouldn’t have playing in the academy at U23s level. Growing up I was always small. I think growing up through the academy and being the small one, you get that technical side of the game and you are learning from bigger players. When you do get that ability and you are playing against bigger players then you know what to do. That’s what I have definitely gained throughout the academy and through the game that you have to learn that different side of the game<br /><br />Frank was an example throughout my career at Chelsea, and throughout my career as a midfielder. When it comes to scoring goals as a midfielder, you look at Frank Lampard as a role model. When the gaffer came in from day one, he was talking about working off the ball and how we are going to press. It is his philosophy. We want to try to play with the ball well, but when we lose it, we want to try to get the ball back as quickly as you can. I try to press, try to lead off the press, because the strikers can’t always hit the press. Sometimes from midfield, it is your time to go. Then the other team and players are coming with you. It gives you a good chance to get that ball back. We have been working on that a lot and continue to use it this season<br /><br />I looked at <b>[Luka]</b> Modric when he was in the Premier League at Tottenham. <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta at Barcelona in his prime, playing their tiki-taka, I was always watching them on YouTube. I saw the games as well. I think those two were a big part of me growing up, looking at those as role models. My dad always said to me that every training session, you have to train like it is your best or it is your last training session. The competition, with boys coming in from other countries, you have always got to stay one step ahead if you want to stay there and be the best<br /><br />It would mean so much. After joining the club at the beginning of the season, even though I am a loan player, my focus is squarely on the club and getting them where they want to be. Even though I am not signed to Derby, they have made me feel like part of the club. They have made me feel so welcome and straight away I am focusing on getting that goal and into the Premier League. It is very tight at the minute. All the teams around us, it is so close. Every single player in English football wants to play at Wembley, that’s such a big dream. If we get there then we could get that win. We just need to keep winning our games, focusing on us, not worrying about what other teams do and hoping that the results go our way</p>

  <p><b>[Mount alongside Declan Rice]</b> We grew up with each other throughout the age groups <b>[at Chelsea]</b>. He got released at 14, so that was a big blow for me because he was a close friend of mine. He was one of my best mates at Chelsea, but we have always kept in contact. We keep in contact now and speak to each other almost every day. You see how he is doing well, how he has bounced back from being released. Now he has gone to West Ham, has done what he has, and he is playing in the Premier League now. So he has done so well. I am so proud of him for doing that as well. I am really close to him. He was always a centre-back when he was younger. I was always a midfielder, so we would always have that connection. He has gone to West Ham and he has started off as a centre-back and has now moved into midfield. It is not easy to do that. He is a midfielder who is mostly defensive minded so that’s great for them to have him in their team because he is an unbelievable player. We would always speak to each other about maybe playing with each other one more time, or again. He was playing for Ireland so it didn’t really look like a possibility and now he has chosen to play for England and I was buzzing with his decision. Now we will see what happens in the future if we can play with each other one more time.<br /><br />I know Cal <b>[Callum Hudson-Odoi]</b> from playing with him and growing up together. He was the one who would play up <b>[an age group]</b> with us. He has had an unbelievable season. He has always had that technical side, that ability, that special thing you need to have throughout the ages. He has grown and got better and better. He has done brilliantly this season and hopefully he can carry on doing that. You always want the academy players and young boys to come through to try and get into the first team. It is obviously tough but if you are good enough it is going to happen and with Ruben and Cal, some other players as well, they are doing that. If you are working hard and good enough, then it will happen</p>

As soon as the game had finished, <b>[it was]</b> straight to bed because I probably had school the next day.<br /><br />I just remember all the family watching it and how excited we were, what a game, and you see all the celebrations after and how much it means to everyone, it means so much, and that is something in the history books for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. We have got to start this one off with a win. You have always got to set goals and that was definitely one of my goals to start this season. It was always to come back to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and work hard to get into the team.<br /><br />I knew the Champions League games were coming up so you have always got to set goals and I think you have got to work very hard to try and achieve that. It has been going well and hopefully I can start the next game. It is a dream to play in the Champions League and, for me playing in it with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, it is a massive game. You always want to get that first game under your belt and get that first three points. It is a tough, tough group, so we need to start strong and they are a good side. We are at home and we need to take what we did on Saturday into that<br /><br /><b>[The 20-year-old says <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> has not brought up his role in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s greatest achievement to date]</b> No, he hasn’t said anything, maybe he doesn’t want to put too much pressure on us. With the performance on Saturday, if we can keep that going and repeat it <b>[against <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>]</b> then we will have a good chance of winning. Everyone knows what he has done for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and to play under him, he definitely wants everyone to work hard and play attacking football, and that is what we did on Saturday. I think he is happy with our performance, the two goals are the disappointing part but clean sheets is something we will work on. To play under him, you just want to go that extra mile and work harder for him<br /><br /><b>[Following the <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> game, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will welcome <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> on Sunday]</b> They are a very good side but look what happened in the Super Cup, how well we played then, it was very solid so I think if we look back at that game, they all played and we played so well I think we should have won in 90 minutes. We can look at that game and know that we can hurt them and we are solid in defence</p>

  <p><b>[Mason Mount has revealed he feared the worst when he was forced off on his Champions League debut against <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>]</b> As soon as I did it, in my head I thought it would be a long-term injury. We iced it and we let it calm down a bit. Then we realised it wasn’t as bad as I first thought. The next day I was kind of jogging on it a little bit. From then on, I knew there was a chance of being involved. There was swelling, and there is still swelling there now, but it is solid. It felt good as I trained on the day before the game so I was pretty positive leading up to the game that I could be involved.<br /><br />It was my Champions League debut and you don’t want it to end so soon like that but that’s football. It happened. I tried to stay positive and look forward to the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game and set a goal to get ready for that. I feel like I am quick at recovering. So we worked on it hard and I was able to get back. No, not at all <b>[it wasn’t affecting me during the match]</b>. I think you have got to block that out of your head and just to try to focus on the game. When I had that chance at the end which I thought I should have scored but I rolled my ankle a bit. It still felt fine afterwards. It was fine. It was good throughout the game. It felt solid so it was alright<br /><br /><b>[The 20-year-old has started seven of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s eight games this campaign]</b> For me I thought I would try and work hard, learn off the boys and work my way into the team. Obviously, for me, going into pre-season, that was my main focus. To show the manager that I was ready, even though I didn’t think I would be starting the games. But showing him that I was ready to come on and prove to him that I can start games, but obviously starting games at the beginning is a massive confidence builder and I have been loving it and just learning from each game, every day in training. <b>[It is]</b> nights, games like this where you learn the most that what you play football for.

We need to win games at home, that’s a big focus. We are doing well away and now the focus is building that fortress at home and, when teams come here, they know it will be a tough game. We showed that in the second half. They are one of the best teams in the league and, in the second half, I felt like we dominated it. They had chances. Look at the team they have got and they are always going to create chances, but I thought overall in the second half we were very dominant. We had chances of our own and we could have scored. We look back at the second-half performance and take a lot of positives from it. I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are a very, very good side and they started the game well from two set-pieces which you can’t do very much from that with their quality. I thought they didn’t create much in open play<br /><br />So, I think we just need to be concentrated when the ball goes out of play so we are switched on and ready for anything to happen. It is set-pieces that are causing some trouble. They scored two and, when you go 2-0 down, then it is quite tough to get back into the game. I thought we were at the end but, if you switch off at set-pieces at this level, then you get punished. It happened twice so that’s something we will look at and we have been looking at. We need to keep working on it. I would say that we are not going through a tough, tough spell. We are going through a spell when we are getting little bits here and there wrong and we are getting punished for it. So, I think we have always got to stay positive.<br /><br />We are positive straight after the game, focusing now on our next two games, at home and wanting to win them. They are difficult games, but I think once you get that first home win and get that momentum building, then hopefully we can carry that on. I think the fans watching saw how much we put into the game. How hard we worked throughout the whole game. They probably feel as much as us that we could probably get something from the game at the end. It could easily have been a draw if we nick a goal so, they are watching the game and can see how much we are running, and want to win the game and want to play for the badge, so, yeah, that home win is due and we need to focus on that and hopefully in the next game we can do that</p>

  <p><b>[Mason Mount says that he was too desperate to end his 18-game goal drought following his bright display in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s 4-0 win over <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>]</b> I have found recently that I have been trying too hard to score and kind of snatching at shots and trying to take shot when off-balance and stuff. When you’re so focused on scoring and thinking ‘I need to score’, you do that.<br /><br />You start snatching at it. You don’t take your time and focus on your technique enough. Today, I kind of had looked at my game and where I’ve been going wrong recently and to aim, stay calm and not to try to look for it as much as I have been.<br /><br />It just happened. I took a touch and turned and finished. It wasn’t me thinking about it too much. I think I’ve been overthinking it. It hasn’t been coming my way and I have been snatching at it.<br /><br />Today, it was the total opposite. It wasn’t in my head, I just focused on the performance and it came. I do look at games. My dad is very into football and watching my game and where I can improve. He helps me a lot. He’s here for every game and after he’ll tell me what I did best and what I didn’t do well and where I need to improve. The last few games has been finishing and end product. I think I took a shot against <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> from an impossible angle where I was just trying to score a worldy when it wasn’t on. We spoke about that. More just me personally looking at my game, speaking to my dad as well.<br /><br />I think about games like the <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> game where I snatched a chance with my left foot where it hasn’t been on. It’s something where you don’t have to try so much. It just comes at the right time and it did today.<br /><br />You listen to every bit of advice coming your way and learn from it. It’s good to have my dad there focused on me, watching what I need to do better. It helps me so much coming off the pitch speaking to him in the car. We have done that since I was a little kid and some things never change<br /><br /><b>[Upon scoring, Mount leapt into the air in relief and upon landing did the dance he terms ‘the Frankenstein’]</b> It was a new one, yeah. I had an interview with Chunkz. He messaged me, I’m going to FaceTime him but it is his kind of dance move. We had an interview and he said ‘next time you score a goal, can you do it?’ So I always had it in my head and I pulled it out today<br /><br />We’ve been up and down through the whole season. It hasn’t been a very consistent season where we have been scoring a lot of goals and keeping clean sheets. It hasn’t been like that so we have had to focus on what we do really well and not change</p>

  <p><b>[Mason Mount does not expect <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> to struggle in the spotlight]</b> He is very grounded. He has got a very, very good family around him and he is a very screwed-on boy so that won’t get to him at all. I won’t let it get to him as well, I’ll keep him grounded! No, he’ll be fine. I’m not surprised <b>[by his performances]</b>. I know what he is as a player, as a boy. I am very close to him so I know what character he has. I had no doubts about him coming in, stepping up and performing like the way he has in the last two games. I have massive confidence in him and he shows it when he comes out onto the pitch. The young players coming through, they are going to have these challenges. It is obviously a big achievement to make it into the first team, to start a game at home at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>. The way my debut went here was very good. I scored but Billy has stepped up and done brilliantly. He’s come into the team, been dominant, been confident on the ball and that’s what you want.</p>

  <p><b>[Mason Mount relishing arrival of ‘world class’ <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Ziyech</a> despite added competition at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> So two years ago I was in Holland on loan so I knew a bit about him then and obviously how good of a player he is. So obviously it’s another amazing, world-class player joining the club. So yeah buzzing to work with him, train with him and hopefully play with him</p>

  <p><b>[Mount’s father Tony has revealed in the recent past]</b> Mason and Declan are best friends. They always have been and still are now. They talk to each other all the time. When Declan got released at 14, we were all devastated. Debbie <b>[Mount’s mother]</b> was in tears and Mason was gobsmacked</p>

I have to thank all the coaches in the academy from the beginning. Bob Osborne, Frank O’Brien, Micky Bill, Joe Edwards, <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a>, <a href="adi-viveash.html">Adi Viveash</a>. All the coaches in the academy and I think I missed a few, but they all give you different things, and you learn different things off them</p>

  <p><b>[Mason Mount would certainly like to be reunited with <a href="declan-rice.html">Declan Rice</a>]</b> He got released at 14, so that was a big blow for me because he was a close friend of mine. But we have always kept in contact now and speak to each other almost every day. It’s great when you see how he is doing, how he has bounced back from being released. I am so proud of him. We would always speak to each other about maybe playing with each other again. He was playing for Ireland initially, so it didn’t really look like a possibility, but now he has chosen to play for England and I was buzzing with his decision. Now, we will see what happens in the future if we can play with each other again…</p>

  <p><b>[Mason Mount says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are raring to go for the resumption of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football]</b> It’s very exciting. It’s something we’ve all been waiting for a long time, to get back playing when the time was right, so we are all excited. To get the games back is great and it’s something we all wanted if it was possible. We all love playing games and representing <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and we are all looking forward to getting started again. It’s been a long time since we played and the two months we had away in lockdown certainly seemed like such an age! So it’s been great to be able to get back out on the pitch at Cobham and do what we love. I think I speak on behalf of all the boys when I say we had to ensure we stayed fit during the lockdown, ready for when we could go back to work. It was important to remain active and to be honest, I think most footballers find it difficult to stay too far away from a football. I know I’ve been kicking one around my house all the time! Training has been great, and the boys are looking sharp. I think at the start, having been away for so long, there was a little rustiness to shake off but we are back to normal now and raring to go again</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s Mason Mount says he has grown on and off pitch this season]</b> There’s been ups and downs, but the main thing for me coming out of this season is how much I’ve learnt and grown as a player, on and off the pitch. Also how much I’ve learnt playing against some of the best players in the world. It’s my first season in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and, as a boy, I dreamt of playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. For me to have my first season, make loads of debuts and score some goals has meant so much to me</p>

  <p><b>[Mount out to emulate <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> playmaker targets goals and trophies]</b> I’m very lucky to have worked with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> at both Derby and then at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> this season. The manager has been great with me. He’s always giving me little bits of advice and he’s just been encouraging me to keep learning and to keep growing as a player. I’ve loved every minute of this season so far and hopefully we can come back and end it on a high now. I’d love to add more goals to my game, like Frank did when he played for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. If I could make even half of his goals then I’d be very happy! He was so dominant as a goalscoring midfielder. I’d also like to be successful like him in terms of trophies won. As young players coming through, you dream of lifting silverware and that’s no different to this team. We want to win trophies and having seen the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team when <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> was playing, that’s something we can aspire to</p>
