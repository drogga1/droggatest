  <p><b>[Mason Mount has committed to a new five-year contract at Chelsea, with that deal set to take the highly-rated midfielder through to 2024]</b> It’s a massively proud moment for myself and my family.

I’m really looking forward to the coming season now and working hard to have an impact here at Chelsea.

If you are ready and he thinks you are good enough then he’s going to put you in there. Being a midfielder and being at Chelsea you obviously look at him as a role model. For me working with him last year, and also this year, I have learnt so much off him. Speaking with him day in, day out I’ve been getting little stuff off his game, like him talking to me and telling me how to get into the box. I’m learning off him every day and it’s very exciting. You can see the group of players that we have is world class. For me coming into this team and working with them each day - I’m learning off them and that’s the best thing for me at the moment</p>

In the final third, it’s down to us to create and play freely. I think we did that in the second half and tried to combine in and around the box. In pre-season games, it doesn’t always come off but we’re working on it in training</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea youngster Mason Mount has revealed he took inspiration from a trip to Old Trafford to see Cristiano Ronaldo as a nine-year-old]</b> It was the first time I’d ever been to Old Trafford but there were good and bad memories for me. I went as a Portsmouth fan and we lost the game. I remember watching Cristiano Ronaldo and he scored this unbelievable free-kick - it was one of the best goals I’ve ever seen live. It was great for me to watch him as one of the best players in the world and that really motivated me as a young boy. I remember going to training the next couple of days and trying to recreate the free-kick. I was only young so I couldn’t really kick it that far, but when you watch something like that then you want to add it into your own game. It motivates you to practise and try to replicate it in a game situation<br /><br /><b>[Under the watchful eye of Lampard, who managed the Rams before making the switch to Chelsea this summer, Derby dumped United out of the League Cup on penalties - one of which was netted by Mason Mount himself]</b> I’ve got some unbelievable memories from that day and that game. It was early in the season and we went there as the underdogs, but I felt like we had more freedom and less pressure. We played so well and should have won in normal time but they equalised really late on. We had to show character in the penalty shoot-out but we showed our quality and it was really the game that kicked us on to do well in the cup and the league<br /><br /><b>[And when recalling his all-important spot-kick]</b> I didn’t feel pressure or look at the crowd, it was just me taking a penalty against a keeper. I’ve always liked to go first from a young age because my dad told me to set the good example and hopefully give your team-mates confidence. I knew where I wanted to put it in my head, went for the top corner and it went in!</p>

  <p><b>[Mason Mount insists he is loving every minute after getting his first taste of first-team football at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> during the opening weeks of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> season]</b> Before the season even started it was an exciting time for the academy boys because there was maybe a chance that was going to arise. We are loving it at the moment, and we are just working hard, getting our heads down. It is a very hard step because you look at the squad and how many world-class players there are here. For me, training with them every day, working under the gaffer, learning all the time, is the best thing for me.<br /><br />I am obviously learning and loving every minute of being with the first team, working really hard, but in the back of my mind, I am always pinching myself because this is what I have wanted my whole life and this is what I worked for. I think it means so much more when you have been here for all those years, working hard every single year, to get to the first team. That has always been my goal and every single coach I have worked with through the years helped me, so it’s not just me making that step to the first team, it’s for all the manager I have worked with. It was a very special moment</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount says that he does not feel that he has let the pressure brought by his sudden elevation]</b> I don’t really look at that pressure. I don’t really look at any other thing but focusing on how I perform, what I can do in the game. My family have always said: ‘Don’t worry about the pressure side.’ I’ve always stuck to that. I think <b>[the transfer ban]</b> maybe played a part but you’ve got to work hard to earn your starting place. All the boys have done that. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is definitely a big step up but you’ve got to be ready<br /><br /><b>[On <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>, Mount offered additional effusive praise of the man who helped nurture him at Pride Park last season]</b> After training he does one-on-one finishing work with me. I talk to him every day, especially after games, on what I can do better and where I can make runs to get into the box. There is no better person to learn from than him<br /><br /><b>[Before his spell in the Midlands with <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a>, Mount spent the 2017-18 campaign on loan with Vitesse, and he credits the Dutch side for stregthening his resolve at a critical point in his development]</b> It was tough at the start and for the first couple of months I wasn’t playing but it was the best step. I learned so much and my mentality got so much stronger living away from my family. It was very, very tough but I would always say to any young player: ‘Go to Germany or wherever,’ because you gain so much experience from those international leagues<br /><br /><b>[Mount’s early form at Derby last season then earned him a surprise call into the England fold in October]</b> I didn’t leave disappointed at all after the Croatia and Spain games last season. It just gave me more fire to want to get into a future squad and play. That was my mindset. Having a taste of being around the place and the first team gave me that extra hunger</p>

  <p><b>[Mason Mount says he treated his England debut against Bulgaria on Saturday as just another game of football]</b> I wasn’t really too nervous. It’s a game of football so it’s something that I’ve done all my life. When you come on, you just want to get on the ball, have your first touch, get that out the way and then try to influence the game. It’s an unbelievable feeling to make your debut for your country. It’s something that you dream of as a little kid. I think the percentage of people that do it are very slim but I’ve been working hard for a long time and obviously it’s a proud moment for me and my family. It’s been a crazy last couple of months. Making my debut for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, then being called up to the England squad and making my debut today.

  <p><b>[Mason Mount has revealed how he is inspired by <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s 2012 triumph in Champions League]</b> It is a historic night in the club’s history, I was at home with my family watching it. I remember every part of the game, <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> scoring the header and then the winning pen, brilliant night. Watching that as a kid, it gives you the extra fire and the goal to want to play in the Champions League because you have seen what the club has done before. I might have had my <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> top on. As soon as the game had finished, <b>[it was]</b> straight to bed because I probably had school the next day.<br /><br />I just remember all the family watching it and how excited we were, what a game, and you see all the celebrations after and how much it means to everyone, it means so much, and that is something in the history books for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. We have got to start this one off with a win. You have always got to set goals and that was definitely one of my goals to start this season. It was always to come back to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and work hard to get into the team.<br /><br />I knew the Champions League games were coming up so you have always got to set goals and I think you have got to work very hard to try and achieve that. It has been going well and hopefully I can start the next game. It is a dream to play in the Champions League and, for me playing in it with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, it is a massive game. You always want to get that first game under your belt and get that first three points. It is a tough, tough group, so we need to start strong and they are a good side. We are at home and we need to take what we did on Saturday into that<br /><br /><b>[The 20-year-old says <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> has not brought up his role in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s greatest achievement to date]</b> No, he hasn’t said anything, maybe he doesn’t want to put too much pressure on us. With the performance on Saturday, if we can keep that going and repeat it <b>[against Valencia]</b> then we will have a good chance of winning. Everyone knows what he has done for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and to play under him, he definitely wants everyone to work hard and play attacking football, and that is what we did on Saturday. I think he is happy with our performance, the two goals are the disappointing part but clean sheets is something we will work on. To play under him, you just want to go that extra mile and work harder for him<br /><br /><b>[Following the <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> game, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will welcome <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> on Sunday]</b> They are a very good side but look what happened in the Super Cup, how well we played then, it was very solid so I think if we look back at that game, they all played and we played so well I think we should have won in 90 minutes. We can look at that game and know that we can hurt them and we are solid in defence</p>

  <p><b>[Mason Mount has revealed he feared the worst when he was forced off on his Champions League debut against Valencia]</b> As soon as I did it, in my head I thought it would be a long-term injury. We iced it and we let it calm down a bit. Then we realised it wasn’t as bad as I first thought. The next day I was kind of jogging on it a little bit. From then on, I knew there was a chance of being involved. There was swelling, and there is still swelling there now, but it is solid. It felt good as I trained on the day before the game so I was pretty positive leading up to the game that I could be involved.<br /><br />It was my Champions League debut and you don’t want it to end so soon like that but that’s football. It happened. I tried to stay positive and look forward to the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game and set a goal to get ready for that. I feel like I am quick at recovering. So we worked on it hard and I was able to get back. No, not at all <b>[it wasn’t affecting me during the match]</b>. I think you have got to block that out of your head and just to try to focus on the game. When I had that chance at the end which I thought I should have scored but I rolled my ankle a bit. It still felt fine afterwards. It was fine. It was good throughout the game. It felt solid so it was alright<br /><br /><b>[The 20-year-old has started seven of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s eight games this campaign]</b> For me I thought I would try and work hard, learn off the boys and work my way into the team. Obviously, for me, going into pre-season, that was my main focus. To show the manager that I was ready, even though I didn’t think I would be starting the games. But showing him that I was ready to come on and prove to him that I can start games, but obviously starting games at the beginning is a massive confidence builder and I have been loving it and just learning from each game, every day in training. <b>[It is]</b> nights, games like this where you learn the most that what you play football for. So <b>[I’m]</b> loving every minute, and loving the game</p>

We need to win games at home, that’s a big focus. We are doing well away and now the focus is building that fortress at home and, when teams come here, they know it will be a tough game. We showed that in the second half. They are one of the best teams in the league and, in the second half, I felt like we dominated it. They had chances. Look at the team they have got and they are always going to create chances, but I thought overall in the second half we were very dominant. We had chances of our own and we could have scored. We look back at the second-half performance and take a lot of positives from it. I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are a very, very good side and they started the game well from two set-pieces which you can’t do very much from that with their quality. I thought they didn’t create much in open play<br /><br />So, I think we just need to be concentrated when the ball goes out of play so we are switched on and ready for anything to happen. It is set-pieces that are causing some trouble. They scored two and, when you go 2-0 down, then it is quite tough to get back into the game. I thought we were at the end but, if you switch off at set-pieces at this level, then you get punished. It happened twice so that’s something we will look at and we have been looking at. We need to keep working on it. I would say that we are not going through a tough, tough spell. We are going through a spell when we are getting little bits here and there wrong and we are getting punished for it. So, I think we have always got to stay positive.<br /><br />We are positive straight after the game, focusing now on our next two games, at home and wanting to win them. They are difficult games, but I think once you get that first home win and get that momentum building, then hopefully we can carry that on. I think the fans watching saw how much we put into the game. How hard we worked throughout the whole game. They probably feel as much as us that we could probably get something from the game at the end. It could easily have been a draw if we nick a goal so, they are watching the game and can see how much we are running, and want to win the game and want to play for the badge, so, yeah, that home win is due and we need to focus on that and hopefully in the next game we can do that</p>

There’s always been that competition within <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, so we’re all ready for that, and there’s massive competition within the team now to fight for your place<br /><br />We want to win trophies and we want to be top of the league. We’re so tight as a team, the bond is so good and we’ve got that focus and togetherness that we need to win trophies. That’s our next goal, to win a major trophy. We just need to keep getting better and better, which is what we’ve shown over the last couple of weeks. If we carry on this level of performance, we can definitely be a top contender in any competition<br /><br /><b>[Mount also talked up <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>’s management having spent last season working with him on loan at Derby County]</b> He’s been a massive influence for me. Working under him last season, knowing how he likes to work and how he likes to play, that’s probably given me and Fikayo <b>[Tomori, who was also on loan at Derby last term]</b> that advantage coming back to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He’s been brilliant. I’m learning off him every day, trying to perfect my attacking and defending, and there’s no better person for me to work under.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about his increasingly pivotal role in the team]</b> I was always ready. I’ve been at the club for a very long time so you’ve got to have belief in yourself and be ready for that opportunity. It probably did come a bit earlier than I expected, but I was ready and so fully focused on taking my opportunity and trying to play well. It’s been brilliant and I’m loving every moment of it</p>

I knew that would give me the best chance to show him that, when the season started, I could step in and play a big part. I always set a target of 10 goals too - double figures - no matter who it’s with. I achieved that last season and the year before, so hopefully I can do that this time as well. If you’re stepping up a level, then you’ve got to go to that level with your performances as well. The players around you are going to be better so you have to be better as well. Ten goals was always something I felt kept me focused and kept me looking forward, at any level<br /><br />My dad always said when I was younger that you can’t just be a luxury number 10 because you see so many players like that in academy football. You see so many players who want to get on the ball, do all the good stuff, but never want to track back, work hard or do the defensive side. You see that so much and he said to me that you need to do the other side of the game too, so that was always in my head</p>

You just have to fight. You know <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> can always buy £60 million or £70m or £80m players that are world-class. They want to come here and take my place. Just because I am an academy boy and young, that doesn’t mean anything. But the mentality I have means I won’t be pushed over easily. I will fight for my position and keep working hard. At a club as big as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> you have to have that mentality. It always stuck with me. It’s why I am here in the first place<br /><br />It’s natural that young players will be up and down and it’s probably the best thing that can happen. It makes you ask yourself why you played well one week and then dropped your levels the next. If I am not good enough in a game - if I am losing the ball and stuff - then I see those as key experiences and I won’t hide from that. You are playing against world-class players and they will take advantage of days when you are off it. That’s the best lessons you learn.<br /><br />After those home games you mentioned, I looked at myself and asked whether I created enough chances or took enough shots. We weren’t scoring. Was it my fault? I look at myself and know I needed to do more. I am an attacking midfielder and I need to get in to the box. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> has to be a fortress and it hasn’t been.

Obviously, with the two-window ban, we thought it would be two windows where we couldn’t buy any players and that we had to step up as young players and have an effect on games to be big players for the team. We knew that from the beginning of the season. That changed in January but that didn’t change our focus and goal on what we want to do throughout the season. <b>[Transfers]</b> is not something we look at. We focus on what we have and the game ahead. None of the players really look at that unless a player comes in. Then make them feel welcome as they come into the team. Our focus is fully on the game ahead and how we can perform<br /><br />Yes, I think you are always trying to focus on having an effect on a game. Making an impact, trying to get goals and get assists. For me to get two was something I was pleased with. Two for Rudi as well so we have that connection there. He is always telling me to put good balls into the box and this is the game that it worked in and paid off. He got on the end of the two balls so I am pleased with that.

  <p><b>[Mason Mount says that he was too desperate to end his 18-game goal drought following his bright display in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s 4-0 win over Everton]</b> I have found recently that I have been trying too hard to score and kind of snatching at shots and trying to take shot when off-balance and stuff. When you’re so focused on scoring and thinking ‘I need to score’, you do that.<br /><br />You start snatching at it. You don’t take your time and focus on your technique enough. Today, I kind of had looked at my game and where I’ve been going wrong recently and to aim, stay calm and not to try to look for it as much as I have been.<br /><br />It just happened. I took a touch and turned and finished. It wasn’t me thinking about it too much. I think I’ve been overthinking it. It hasn’t been coming my way and I have been snatching at it.<br /><br />Today, it was the total opposite. It wasn’t in my head, I just focused on the performance and it came. I do look at games. My dad is very into football and watching my game and where I can improve. He helps me a lot. He’s here for every game and after he’ll tell me what I did best and what I didn’t do well and where I need to improve. The last few games has been finishing and end product. I think I took a shot against Bournemouth from an impossible angle where I was just trying to score a worldy when it wasn’t on. We spoke about that. More just me personally looking at my game, speaking to my dad as well.<br /><br />I think about games like the Bayern game where I snatched a chance with my left foot where it hasn’t been on. It’s something where you don’t have to try so much. It just comes at the right time and it did today.<br /><br />You listen to every bit of advice coming your way and learn from it. It’s good to have my dad there focused on me, watching what I need to do better. It helps me so much coming off the pitch speaking to him in the car. We have done that since I was a little kid and some things never change<br /><br /><b>[Upon scoring, Mount leapt into the air in relief and upon landing did the dance he terms ‘the Frankenstein’]</b> It was a new one, yeah. I had an interview with Chunkz. He messaged me, I’m going to FaceTime him but it is his kind of dance move. We had an interview and he said ‘next time you score a goal, can you do it?’ So I always had it in my head and I pulled it out today<br /><br />We’ve been up and down through the whole season. It hasn’t been a very consistent season where we have been scoring a lot of goals and keeping clean sheets. It hasn’t been like that so we have had to focus on what we do really well and not change</p>
