<blockquote>
  <p><a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> says he wants to be the one to welcome former UFC welterweight and lightweight champion B.J. Penn back to the Octagon after it was reported that ‘The Prodigy’ is contemplating a return to mixed martial arts (MMA). Anyone interested in seeing this fight?<br /><br />Despite coming up short in his previous two bouts against Rory MacDonald at UFC on FOX 5 and Nick Diaz at UFC 137, former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Welterweight and Lightweight Champion B.J. Penn isn’t quite ready to call it a career just yet<br /><br />If and when he does come back, he already has an eager challenger ready to meet him inside the Octagon in the form of <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>. ‘The Eagle’ took to his Twitter account to plead his case to be the first to welcome Penn back to the cage.<br /><br />The undefeated Russian (20-0, 4-0 UFC) has slowly but surely made a name for himself in the promotion’s lightweight division, defeating the likes of Kamal Shalorus, Gleison Tibau, Thiago Tavares and most recently at UFC 160, Abel Trujillo<br /><br />A fight against an established veteran such as Penn, regardless of his current track record, would definitely be a step-up in competition. And while Khabib has staked his claim in 155-pound weight class, perhaps his ‘name value’ isn’t as high (yet) for ‘Baby Jay’ to accept his challenge at this stage of the Hawaiian’s career<br /><br />Or is it?<br /><br />What’s your take … should Penn answer Khabib on his challenge? Or would it be a ‘high risk, low reward’ type of situation for the former multi-division champion at this point?</p>

  <p><a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> and <a href="dustin-poirier.html">Dustin Poirier</a> will collide in a Lightweight title unification match this Saturday night (Sept. 7, 2019) in the main event of UFC 242 in Abu Dhabi. And the victor won’t have to think too hard about who his next opponent will be, as both ‘The Eagle’ and ‘The Diamond’ agree that <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> is next in line<br /><br />Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) President <a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a>, however, has the final word, and he has yet to confirm Ferguson as the next challenger, though he has teased the possibility of <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> swooping in and stealing his thunder.<br /><br />That won’t happen, though, as Ferguson says fight fans know who the true No. 1 contender really is, and the promotion can expect some blow back from the mixed martial arts (MMA) community should <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> be awarded an unjust title fight. In addition, Ferguson couldn’t let <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>’s recent woes fly by the wayside, also taking a dig at ‘Notorious’ for calling for a fight against mega-movie star Mark Wahlberg for his UFC shares.<br /><br />As far as his own showdown against <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>, Ferguson says while it’s something he campaigned hard to get in the past, it’s not something that is now at the top of his list because the mouthy Irishman is now irrelevant in the fight game.<br /><br />Still, to hear ‘El Cucy’ tell it, a fight between the two men isn’t completely out of the question, as he says <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> should face the loser of Khabib vs Poirier. If he wins that fight, then he might give him a shot at the title once he becomes undisputed champ.<br /><br />And if all goes as planned, Ferguson hopes to face the winner of this weekend’s title fight at the UFC 245 year-end pay-per-view (PPV) event on Dec. 14, 2019, in Las Vegas, Nevada.<br /><br />And if all goes as planned, Ferguson hopes to face the winner of this weekend’s title fight at the UFC 245 year-end pay-per-view (PPV) event on Dec. 14, 2019, in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>

  <p>Indeed, <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> has proven to have a wide array of skills in his combat arsenal, winning 12 fights in a row, nine of them via submission, knockout or technical knockout. That said, if Tony can’t hand ‘The Eagle’ his first loss, Brian Ortega says he will be the man to do it.<br /><br />Brian Ortega, who was lobbying to step in against <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> at UFC 223<br /><br />Currently fighting in the Featherweight division, Brian Ortega will obviously have no issues fighting at 155 pounds should he ever decide to do so. Getting to <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>, though, will prove to be a tough task, as he would have to rack up an impressive winning streak in order to get there.</p>
