  <p><b>[Blackburn manager Brian Kidd tries to take the pressure off Kevin Davies (two goals in 20 games) - but you kinda feel he wanted to add £100,000 would have been more like it]</b> It’s not his fault that he was valued at £7 million</p>

  <p><b>[Blackburn manager Brian Kidd after Saturday’s defeat by Nottingham Forest. Is the pressure getting to him, d’you think?]</b> We’re like a bunch of individuals who don’t hurt enough and a lot of them are rubber dinghy men. The ship’s going down, they’re saying I’ll go for help - rubber dinghy men. I think the inmates have been running this club for too long</p>

  <p><b>[Brian Kidd compares <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a> to Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> I have said before that Roberto is cut from the same cloth as Sir Alex, and people thought I was being a balloon. But the top managers handle themselves in a certain way, and we have seen over the past two years that Roberto has what it takes to make the big decisions. He knows how to handle top players and big personalities. They don’t frighten him one bit. Tactically he’s very good at setting the team up and changing things during a game. If things aren’t right he will pick up on it straight away</p>
