The ship’s going down, they’re saying I’ll go for help - rubber dinghy men. I think the inmates have been running this club for too long</p>

  <p><b>[Brian Kidd compares <a href="roberto-mancini.html">Roberto Mancini</a> to <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>]</b> I have said before that Roberto is cut from the same cloth as Sir Alex, and people thought I was being a balloon. But the top managers handle themselves in a certain way, and we have seen over the past two years that Roberto has what it takes to make the big decisions. He knows how to handle top players and big personalities. They don’t frighten him one bit. Tactically he’s very good at setting the team up and changing things during a game. If things aren’t right he will pick up on it straight away</p>

  <p><b>[Pep Guardiola has earned comparisons to Manchester United legends by his Manchester City assistant Brian Kidd]</b> We were on a few days off when we won the title. But as soon as we came back, he gathered everyone together. It was about showing respect to the teams we had left to play - five of them, all teams down at the bottom. He said we have to respect the Premier League. There would be no chance of bringing the deckchairs and sunglasses out - and that will set the marker for next season. When the boss here was talking that day, it reminded me so much of how Sir Matt had done it. It was that respect that he showed.<br /><br />The big thing is he is inspirational, both on and off the pitch. What he does is bring spirit and togetherness in all departments. He’s got time for the non-footballing departments as well. He cares. That takes me back to Matt Busby. We were brought up under him at United with humility, respect, empathy to people, your manners. How you conducted yourself was important. The boss here is similar to that in a lot of ways, what he wants from you. Even though it’s so many years ago, I can see it<br /><br />Sir Alex was a manager and did wonderfully well in his career. The boss here is a manager as well, but also a coach. He’s out there on the training pitch taking everything. It’s slightly different. But each manager is unique</p>
