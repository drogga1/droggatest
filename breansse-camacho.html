<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Costa Rica coach Breansse Camacho felt that his boys failed to capitalise against their German counterparts]</b> We put a lot of pressure in the first minutes but they scored first. We kept on trying but the German team kept on putting pressure on us. In the end the problem was that overall we didn’t take our chances.<br /><br />My players were better than Germany in some parts of the match. It’s very hard to lose a match in the 89th minute. We actually analysed Germany but couldn’t capitalise. Germany were physically very strong<br /><br /><b>[Both of the goals conceded by the Los Ticos were a result of defensive lapses, but the coach has backed his boys]</b> We worked to avoid mistakes but that can happen especially when you playing at the U17 level. It was a good experience for players in future. Now we need to support the players to improve their self-confidence and improve the performance in the next matches</p>

  <p><b>[Praising his goalkeeper, Ricardo Montenegro, Costa Rica head coach Breansse Camacho said]</b> He’s fantastic. We have been working with him in the past and I’m sure that in this tournament, he will show how good he is. He definitely has a very bright future.<br /><br />We have seen it tonight, especially when you play against African teams, they are physically strong. So we are satisfied with the result. We had some good moments. We were leading twice but were not in a position to keep the pressure. That’s something that we should work on so that when we are leading in the match, we should close it</p>
