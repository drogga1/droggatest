  <p><b>[England forward Eniola Aluko got vindicated as her allegations of racial discrimination against former women’s coach <a href="mark-sampson.html">Mark Sampson</a> were confirmed true following the findings of barrister Katharine Newton and the reports of the Parliamentary committee]</b> I would never say <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> is institutionally racist. My comments were based on comments to me and <a href="drew-spence.html">Drew Spence</a> and how they handled that. For Martin Glenn to say I should say that in order to get a payment I was contractually agreed to is appalling</p>

  <p><b>[Eniola Aluko announces her retirement from football]</b> Girls today have role models. They can watch women play football on TV. Diversity and equality are on the agenda. Women are using their voices and their feet to break barriers all over the world. I would say that women have never been in a more empowered position, and I am proud to have been part of the generation that has made that happen</p>

When people were dying in other parts of the world before this crisis, did you stop working? Probably not. I think you are naive to think there will be people not absolutely chuffed that they are being paid until October to not go to work at jobs they hate anyway.<br /><br /><b>[On Wednesday morning]</b> Opening up my tweets this morning to say sorry for any offence caused by any of my tweets on furlough last night. The tweets that seem to have upset people the most have been deleted. I have no interest in being a source of further public upset. No generalisations or widespread offence was intended. Just a personal opinion on the future economy in this crisis. This account will now be private and views, as always, remain my own</p>

Thanks. After a very difficult moment 3 years ago, I moved on and appreciate the self reflection for Nikita to move on too. Most importantly, black women should always strive for unity not division</p>

  <p><b>[Eni Aluko backs imposing targets to increase BAME representation in boardrooms of UK sports]</b> I think at this point we have to. There has to be something intentional about change. When you rely on self-regulation and people doing it themselves, they tend to just fall back into a comfort zone of what they’ve always done. I think we do need a target - I know the 30-per-cent target was mentioned earlier. I think that’s a good one in terms of it being something that you can always strive and achieve towards. We are still seeing a glass ceiling to a certain extent from where we’ve gone to having great representation on the pitch. But that transition doesn’t necessary reflect when it goes off the pitch into the boardroom and even in ownership<br /><br />The way to tackle it is about recruitment; recruitment behaviour and recruitment patterns. When we are looking for the best talent, are we fishing in a wide enough pool to find that talent or are we doing what we’ve always done which is safe and recruiting from the people that we all know and that look like us? Once you fish in a wider sea, you’ll be surprised at what you find in terms of the pool of talent. For me, as a new sporting director, and for owners, if you want the best talent you really should - it’s in your interest - look as widely as possible<br /><br />The talent base is there. There is a lot of BAME representation, certainly in academies. It says to me there is a pathway being created, but it’s not rising up to the top. There will be great black coaches and there will be bad black coaches. The minute we judge people by their talent and their character, rather than the colour of their skin, then we’re getting to where we need to get to. We want to find a black <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> or a black <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Asked about whether gay players have come out to their peers]</b> Knowing people and having a brother <b>[Reading forward Sone Aluko]</b> in the men’s game, there’s not an issue in the dressing room. There are gay players and they are just as respected, loved and admired amongst their teams. The issue is with the public - what backlash am I going to get? I think it is going to take a player to say ‘this is who I am - I’m gay’. I think that will be a game-changer. There’s a huge upside for a male player doing that. They will be admired around the world. I’m really hoping a male player will come out whilst they’re playing</p>

  <p><b>[Oriol Romeu caught <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> on the ankle, but referee Chris Kavanagh did not penalise the midfielder, who also escaped punishment upon VAR review]</b> I think it’s a red card. It’s difficult to judge the pace but there’s an extension of the leg and it’s a dangerous tackle. There needs to be a consistency, so the referee has the power to make the judgement</p>
