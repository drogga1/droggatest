<h4 id="2017-12-28">2017 12 28</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>On a Monday afternoon in Almaty, Kazakhstan, thousands gathered outside the upmarket Royal Tulip hotel in below freezing temperatures. In a few hours, the five-star hotel would illuminate with enchanting lights, glowing to contrast the deep blue sky - the preferred setting for displays of opulence common among the city’s elite. Yet those who gathered on December 12, 2016 – teenagers and young men dressed in sweatpants, hoodies, and other forms of casual attire – were there for an entirely different purpose: a glimpse of Khabib Nurmagomedov, the UFC’s first Muslim star<br /><br /><a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>’s father, <a href="abdulmanap-nurmagomedov.html">Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov</a> has said that his son learned to walk on a wrestling mat. And the adage was no exaggeration. A hardened coach with a remarkable resume of championships and accolades from his glory days during the USSR, Abdulmanap was training more than a dozen wrestlers on the bottom floor of his two-story residence at the time his son was born. He took these men in, rural youths from the local village, believing they had they potential to join Dagestan’s national freestyle team, if driven by the necessary tutelage<br /><br />Not since the great Fedor Emelianenko had Russia seen a fighter as popular as <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>, yet even the legendary heavyweight was unable to tap into the reservoir of Muslim fight fans in Russia’s now-neighboring countries. Likewise however, Khabib may never reach Fedor’s stature among Slavic Russians. In order to understand the Dagestani’s popularity - as well as its potential limitations - fans must first understand Khabib’s origins; his social standing through sports, as well as Russia’s ethnic divide<br /><br />Three days after his ninth birthday, <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> was led outside by his father, and towards a chained bear cub. The cub was larger and heavier than the trembling boy dressed in his red, blue, and white tracksuit. <a href="abdulmanap-nurmagomedov.html">Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov</a> turned on a handheld camera, looked down at his second-born and ordered him to wrestle the animal. Well accustomed to the Dagestani culture and patriarchy even at his young age, the boy knew better than to question his father’s wishes. Khabib tucked his chin and dove for the bear’s front paw<br /><br />The bear image was often used in Soviet propaganda. It appeared as the mascot of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, and more recently was taken up as the symbol for Russia’s ruling political party, United Russia<br /><br />While <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> was still a child learning to walk on a wrestling mat, Greco-Roman great Alexander Karelin had already earned the nickname ‘Russian Bear.’ It seemed fitting that the bear eventually found Khabib, the fighter many believe is destined to become Russia’s first UFC champion<br /><br />Khabib hails from Dagestan, one of Russia’s most troubled republics during the past few decades. According to stats provided by the General Prosecutor’s Office in Russia, the region is home to the highest amount of terrorist crimes in the nation. The data suggests that 966 cases of terrorism-related incidents were recorded in 2016 alone. By comparison, Chechnya, Russia’s more notably controversial republic led by de facto dictator Ramzan Kadyrov, had 187 terrorism crimes in 2016, less than one fifth the amount of activity reported in its neighbor<br /><br />Approximately 80% of Russia’s population is considered ethnic Russian (commonly referred to as Slavic) and 75% adhere to the Russian Orthodox faith. The fall of the Soviet Union’s centralist government allowed minority groups to demand cultural and political autonomy. Eventually, as a result ethnic tension rose as those groups’ have struggled to regain their identity and homelands from traditional Russians. Under Russian president <a href="vladimir-putin.html">Vladimir Putin</a>, who believed that as many as 2000 potential ethnic conflicts existed in Russia, the Kremlin resumed control of ethnic regions and selected their leaders (e.g. Chechnya/Ramzan Kadyrov following the Chechen Wars). This is a large part of why Russians generally make a clear distinction between ethnicity and nationality, the latter of which is never questioned. But, because of this diverse ethnic history, the Russian Federation has been plagued with issues of racism<br /><br />Racism can seep into all aspects of russian society, including sports. However, given that various ethnicities still represent the Russian Federation and its tri-color flag, minority athletes are more likely to find unexpected support among the broader public. Often, that support comes at a price.<br />According to Joanna Paraszczuk, judoka Beslan Mudranov (an ethnic Kabardian from Kabardino-Balkaria) and freestyle wrestler Abdulrashid Sadulaev (an ethnic Avar from Dagestan) are primary examples of this homogenization process. Both won gold medals for Russia at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, and were lauded as ethnic Russians<br /><br /><a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>’s tenure with the UFC has been riddled with similar misconceptions. Joanna Paraszczuk noted that ‘North Caucasians complain that MMA fans outside of Russia don’t understand that MMA fighters from the North Caucasus aren’t Russians.’ Since the UFC is primarily tailored to a North American audience, these concerns aren’t without grounds in reality. For years, former UFC play-by-play commentator Mike Goldberg bellowed inaccurate explanations of Khabib’s background, helping cement the geopolitical misconception among fans that all Russians share a relatively homogenous ethnicity<br /><br />… due to the rejuvenated ethnic bonds that have arisen following the fall of the Soviet Union. Violence eventually stemmed from renewed calls for independence and autonomy, which re-established the clear ethnic divide visible within Russia. As Chechnya sought independence in the 1990s, for example, the resulting bloodshed, civil war, and acts of domestic terrorism helped affirm longstanding central Russian feelings of racial hostility towards the various ethnicities of the Caucasus and Central Asia. In 2008 the Moscow Bureau for Human Rights announced troubling surveys that showed that xenophobia and other racist expressions were prevalent in approximately half the country’s population<br /><br />Those North Caucasians from the Caucasus are used to racism. ‘They <b>[Slavic Russian]</b> call us niggers to our faces. They don’t care about us’ said by a Chechen fight fan told BloodyElbow in St. Petersburg, Russia’s multicultural hub<br /><br />… <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>’s popularity among Russian Slavs suggests that some fighters from the North Caucasus could potentially transcend the ethnic divide. However, this acceptance mechanism is far from a perfect system and can also lead to further racial entrenchment<br /><br />On November 24, 2015, a video purportedly released by the Islamic State featured highlights from <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>’s fights in several clips. The video, titled ‘The Lone Wolf,’ called for a renewed focus on international terrorism. It also criticized Muslims like Khabib who fought for money and entertainment instead of defending Islam on the battlefield. It was an attempt to shame the fighter for his choice while simultaneously shunning him as a role model for Muslims. If Khabib could be shone to no longer be a legitimate role model for Dagestani youth, many of those who followed in his path might be pivoted towards fundamentalism. Khabib was a counter to jihadi recruitment in the region, and the Islamic State was well aware of it<br /><br /><a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> is also an accepted role model for North Caucasus youth because he not only represented his nation successfully, but proudly embraced the identity of his mountaineer ancestors. His nickname, ‘The Eagle,’ as well as his Papakha headgear, pay homage to centuries of highlander heritage. He is a practicing Muslim who speaks openly about his religiosity, his devotion to God, and his refusal to place fighting as a higher priority than his spirituality. These aspects of his personality have only furthered his position as a role model for North Caucasus youth, the vast majority of whom are Muslim<br /><br />Ramzan Kadyrov, the somewhat-infamous president of the Chechen Republic, rose to power in 2007 and has ruled over his people with impunity ever since. He is considered a loyalist to <a href="vladimir-putin.html">Putin</a>, and receives a sizable budget to spend however he chooses on the republic in return. He regularly reiterates pro-Kremlin statements on his popular Instagram account, his preferred medium for communication with his subjects<br /><br />Ramzan Kadyrov’s foray into MMA began in 2015, when he founded the Akhmat MMA promotion (now WFCA) and invited former UFC champions Frank Mir, Fabricio Werdum and Chris Weidman to attend the first show. He has since hosted other UFC fighters, including <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>, Alexander Gustafsson, Frankie Edgar, Makwan Amirkhani, Ilir Latifi. Werdum also happens to be an ambassador to Kadyrov’s MMA promotion<br /><br />Once his UFC career is behind him, <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> will likely follow in the footsteps of other notable Russian athletes. Some decide to open gyms and help train a new generation of athletes to represent their nation. Other pursue a career in politics, whether at a local or federal level. In Khabib’s case, he could potentially take over Fedor Emelianenko’s role as the president of the Russian MMA Union when elections take place again in 2020. He could also take on a role as sports advisor to the Kremlin, or a more pronounced role in the republic of Dagestan as a future minister of sports. The opportunities seem endless for the young star</p>
