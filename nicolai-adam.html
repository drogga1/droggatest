  <p>[Nicolai Adam, the coach of the Indian national U17 football team, reserved praise for all his young Colts] First of all, I’d like to compliment Latvia. I played against them as a coach of Azerbaijan. They have become much better since. They began playing football, not only defending. Let me especially mark Latvian number 10 [Grinberg Janis]. I think, this player could achieve a lot in Germany.<br /><br />As for our team, I can say I am happy with the entire team today with an exception of one player - number 11 [Aniket Jadhav]. I had to substitute him. You could see our desire to play, especially in the second half. Participation in this tournament is a wonderful chance to gain experience for our players. I think this is the first time in my career when I meet such boys who have crazy devotion, desire to learn and a strong wish to win<br /><br />[Asked if Yoga was a part of their extensive training curriculum] In fact, yes, we do [practice Yoga]. For example, my wife is a yoga instructor. Sometimes, she travels with us and holds yoga classes for the team. But I’d like to note that we are also playing basketball. We do this not only to develop physically but also to diversify our training. You can go nuts if you only practice football non-stop 24\7. As a coach, I have to introduce something new<br /><br />Boris is a very talented and important player for us. But I have bad news for him. He will not participate in the first match of the Youth World Cup. And this is caused by yellow cards that he received in the Asian Cup! This is not acceptable. I was asking the Technical Director of the AFC [Asian Football Confederation] to change the outdated regulations that stop the development of football in the region. I am asking him to make a change urgently, today, not tomorrow or a day after. As long as these changes are not made, I have to follow the existing rules even though I deeply disagree with them<br /><br />India is a very large country with rich history. But still, they’re behind in many aspects. And I am talking not only about football. Many people lack education. Many of my players come from poor families. But against all odds, India is playing in St. Petersburg now participating in a good tournament and is showing the play that they need</p>

  <p>[Nicolai Adam’s India Under-17 team went down 2-1 to Estonia in the Valentin Granatkin Memorial Tournament at St.Petersburg] I saw a beautiful play of the Indian team today. The boys did their best and I think that the youth football should be much like this. Despite [the fact that] they are young, they were fighting equally against the elder team. First of all, I don’t think that a player born in 2000 can be called a star. And I can’t say that we depend on him much. Yes, he’s good as a right defender and he is also good in other positions. But we have a big squad, and I would like to see more players in my team. As I said before, India is a huge country, but our football is only developing and we don’t have a lot of top players.</p>

  <p>[India Under-17 national team were edged out by Iran 1-0 on Tuesday at the Saint Petersburg Sports Complex, Russia] I am satisfied with performance of my team. In spite of our 8-0 loss to Russia in the first match, I think that the team is representing our country very well. We have problems on the finishing stage, and I guess that was the reason of today’s defeat.<br /><br />We were taking a free-kick that time [around the 90th minute mark], and I hoped that our number 5 - Sanjeev Stalin - will equalize. If so, a penalty shoot-out would have happened to decide the winner, and the goalkeeper I sent to the field was very good at making saves from penalties</p>

  <p>[German coach Nicolai Adam stated that despite the results pointing otherwise, India is on the right track] I love my job, but sometimes it is very hard, as it’s bitter to watch my team lose. I think that this is a good experience for us. Unfortunately, not everything went according to the scenario we developed. But I still believe that team India is on the right way of development.<br /><br />[on Stephen Constantine] We are great friends with him. We contact a lot! But I am travelling, and he stays in India mostly. He has his own team to work with, so he does not give any advice to me<br /><br />I can repeat once again that the World Cup is our main goal. To tell you the truth, before the tournament I thought we would lose all our matches. I must admit that we are weaker physically and we are younger than other teams. But I am satisfied with the way we represented India, as we showed competitiveness. I do not want to offend anyone, but I believe that is was not the good play of the Russian team, but the fact that we were not ready to compete against Russia rather.<br /><br />We played very well in other five matches. We had time to create our style and philosophy. Our players are shorter than their opponents by nature. But this has positive sides. If you want to develop, you need to play against taller, stronger and older guys. This is the way to progress. In other case, the German scenario can happen, when the U-19 players were winning everything, but when they got into the adult championship, they almost got lost, because they were not used to play against older opponents. We lacked the last pass on this tournament, but this is a thing that can be corrected over time</p>

  <p>[Former India Under-17 coach Nicolai Adam has left India for good in the wee hours of Saturday] I am grateful to AIFF for giving me the opportunity to serve as coach of the Indian U-17 National Team. I wish all the bright young talent the very best</p>
