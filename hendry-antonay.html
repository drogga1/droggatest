<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Hendry Antonay still recognizes Adam’s role in his selection for the national team]</b> I played for Pune FC in the I-League U-15 division. Once the league got over, the very next day I got a call from the coach informing me about the trials taking place in Mumbai for the Under-17 team. I went to Mumbai from Pune for the trials. Nicolai sir and Abhishek sir were there that day and I was selected.<br /><br />There were a lot of changes implemented by Norton sir. Earlier we focused mostly on defending, but Norton sir encouraged us to be more comfortable with the ball and develop our attacking instincts. Norton sir has rotated the players very well so that everyone has got a decent opportunity to showcase themselves<br /><br />It all depends on the timing of when you need to bomb forward and when you need to stay back. It depends on the winger too ahead of me. If he moves inside then I need to overlap to provide support. If he has moved further forward then I need to stay back<br /><br /><b>[Antonay also credits the mental preparation for one of the results of the India U17 team recently - the 1-1 draw against Chile in the four-nation tournament in Mexico]</b> We were wee confident going into the Chile match. Being the last match, our coach wanted us to finish on a high with a victory at any cost. We were mentally prepared and confident on the ball<br /><br />I did go to Pune FC since they have exceptional facilities and a lot of international players. My family and myself were looking for opportunities and so Pune FC made sense. When I was there I got the chance to attend an India camp</p>
