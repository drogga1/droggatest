<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Scudetto with Sampdoria]</b> The Scudetto with <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> was the most beautiful, the sweetest. Because I won it in the most difficult and most balanced league in the world and because it was the first for a club that had yet to celebrate in half a century of existence. It is a bit like when your first child is born. The joy is greater.</p>
