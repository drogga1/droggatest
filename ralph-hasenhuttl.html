At the beginning of the transfer period that we said we would start with the same team and of the players we had last year no-one will go. For us, everyone can see how important Naby is for our game. It’s 100% sure that he will be with RB Leipzig in the Champions League.<br /><br />When you play such a famous season as last year it is normal players get interest, that other clubs are watching us is normal. I said for all the players it is very important to stay together as it’s the first time we play Champions League and that is a new situation for every one of us. He is more focused on us and has more fun now than last year. He knows this season it will be fantastic for us</p>

In my opinion, Naby got a yellow card for every first foul. Before he gets the first yellow he was fouled dozens of times. In these situations I miss the equality of rights, but that was not the decisive scene of the game<br /><br /><b>[Hasenhuttl was left upset by a first-half incident, when the referee changed his mind and awarded Leipzig a free-kick after initially pointing to the penalty spot]</b> The decisive moment was when the referee decided for a penalty from the distance of three metres and took it back because his assistant had the better view from a distance of 40 metres<br /><br />Sorry, but it is very difficult to accept what’s going on with a referee in such a situation. He was so confident as he blows the whistle and he didn’t hesitate for a second so I can’t understand why he took the penalty back because of a note from such a distance, but we can’t change it</p>

It will depend how much pressure <b>[we put]</b> on guys that want to pass to him. Maybe don’t give too much time to these guys to put the perfect pass then it’s easier to defend his qualities - his speed, his heading in the box. That is our goal to defend him and the rest of the team. But he doesn’t need a lot of chances to score, as everyone knows.<br /><br />By the end of next week I <b>[will have]</b> spoken with every guy eye-to-eye. I wanted to know everything about him, about his history, what he’s thinking. The discussion I had with all the players was very interesting for me. You feel exactly how this guy works, what he’s thinking about, what his problems are. In this short time, it’s very necessary to know every player and I think it was a good investment from our side and I think they appreciated that. In the future, if there are some questions I want them to come to me. If they have good arguments that we should do something different, they can come to me and tell me. If I have a better one, we do what I want. If they have a very good one we can discuss that</p>

  <p><b>[Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl claims facing the Premier League’s top six is like taking on Bayern Munich 12 times]</b> We have six teams at the level of Bayern Munich in the Premier League. So, you could say we play 12 times against Bayern per season. 12 games in which you don’t get many points usually. And then there are four or five clubs with the quality of Bayer Leverkusen or RB Leipzig. And then we are the Mainz, Freiburg or Augsburg of the Premier League. I don’t want that to be understood disrespectfully but you can compare it very well regarding the general requirements. We have to play perfect matches and even then we don’t have a guarantee to have points afterwards. That makes it a special challenge.<br /><br /><b>[On the collective quality of the Premier League being above that in the Bundesliga]</b> The top clubs in the Premier League benefit very much from the fact that there are six teams on a very high level. They have so many games against each other so that they practically play Champions League the whole year. That helps them very much to persist in the international games. And for smaller clubs like us it’s also a benefit to play against the top six regularly.<br /><br />Maybe we can be the team which tips the scales. It’s impossible to say who will make it. Liverpool and Man City have so much quality and both can win every game until the end but at the same time they could fail every weekend. In the end little details will make the difference.<br /><br />I’m looking forward to seeing Klopp again. I only played a single game against him, when I met Dortmund with Aalen in the German Cup back in 2012. That didn’t end up well for me back then!</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle vs Southampton]</b> It was an important win, a massive win. You see the result on Tuesday shows that it was important that we won against Wolves, and there is now still a way to go. It underlines that speaking about 40 points is not being negative, but being clear what it’s about to stay in this league. It looks good in this moment, but there is still a way to go and I know no-one in this building has the feeling that we are safe, so let’s keep on working hard. The players like to play in the style we are playing in at the moment, they feel comfortable and they are hungry, and that’s the most important thing - hungry for taking points and hungry for taking wins, and that’s what we will do on Saturday</p>

We have to work harder than we did on Saturday in the first half because otherwise against Watford, a very strong team, it is again a big problem to take something. I think we have the quality to win there or to take a point, but we need a really, really clinical and perfect performance.<br /><br /><b>[When asked to analyse Watford’s season]</b> Outrageous. If they have the chance of the Europa League, it’s amazing because they are the best of the rest at the moment. To go there is nearly as difficult as to play against one of the top six, so we need a very, very good performance</p>

He is an exciting player, with tremendous pace and good finishing abilities, who we have watched closely for some time. We have been impressed with how he has adapted to football in Europe and the impact he has had in many games, and we had an interest in him as recently as January, so I am pleased we are able to bring him into the club. He combines his quality with a good mentality and he is the right profile of player that we want to sign - still in the early part of his career, already with a lot of talent, but also with a great amount of potential that I believe we can help him to fulfil.<br /><br />I think he will be an excellent fit for our style of play and shape, and these are the important characteristics we must look for.

  <p><b>[Ralph Hasenhuttl on Moussa Djenepo]</b> Moussa is back now from the funeral of his mum. He seems to be getting into a better mode again. It was not easy for him. We tried to help him as much as we can. It always helps if you are on the pitch and doing what you like to do the most. That helps you not to forget, but to get a little bit of deflection from what is around you at the moment. It has shown every day since he is here that he is getting his laughter back again. I like to see him laughing and don’t like to see him when he is sad. He was not really in a good moment when he came back, but now it is getting better and better. We are all helping him to get back to the Moussa we know because he was always the most positive guy in the squad. This gives the whole squad a lift sometimes because he enjoys his job so much and was always positive for the team. Now we try to bring him back in this mode</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> head coach Ralph Hasenhuttl has backed <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> to be a big hit in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> as he hailed the natural goalscoring abilities of the <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> striker]</b> Football is very intense and fast <b>[in England]</b>. That, in turn, suits Timo: with his speed he’s a brutal weapon in the right team. He sometimes needs a shoulder to lean on, or a little more encouragement but what I’ve always liked about him is that he scores goals that nobody else scores. Give him a bit of space and it’s hard to stop him. He has so many qualities that will always put him above others<br /><br /><b>[Saints boss Hasenhuttl, meanwhile, signed a new four-year contract to remain at St Mary’s on June 2]</b> This, for me, was a simple decision. Simple because of the relationship that I have built with the club, the players and the fans, and also because of the relationship they have built with me too. I said when I arrived at the club that we were at the beginning of a long journey, and also a journey that would bring emotion and hopefully enjoyment. We have already had some moments where we could celebrate together, and some that have been emotional and also challenging. The way we have handled this together as a group of people has been incredible for me, and I believe we now have strong foundations here that can allow us to take the next steps in our progress as a team. For me, this is an important step in the journey. My players, our staff, and of course the supporters must understand my commitment to this club and to what we are trying to build together. We value the same philosophies, and this is a big part of why I want to stay here, and I hope we can share in some very successful moments moving forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Ralph Hasenhuttl believes <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> will show a reaction from the disappointing showing against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> when his side head to relegation-threatened <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>]</b> When you compare it to the <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> game, for example, then we had half the sprint distance (as) against <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>. You can argue that it was a little bit hotter, but this cannot be the reason why. When you know our game and how intense we want to take it, then it is quite important for us to have high-speed running. This is why we didn’t have so many ball wins in the opposition half and it takes too long to win possession in the opponents’ half. Then you had some chances, but the chances are not so good in the transition situation.<br /><br />We stayed in possession for too long and didn’t have chances of quality and that’s not because the opponent was so strong, we must be self-critical and accept at the moment that at home we don’t show the same habits as we show in away games. We have to be motivated and this is not a question of how many points we have. We know every win gives us the chance to climb the table and the chance will be there until the end of the season. There is no reason to be not motivated. If we have a game for three points in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> then it must be enough to be motivated. I can tell you this defeat we had was absolutely something that will make us show a reaction at the weekend.<br /><br />We are 10 points ahead (of the relegation zone) I think, but as long as we have looked at 40 we know that we are not 100 per cent sure. We don’t think too much about whether we are safe or not because it gives us the feeling maybe of leaning back. We don’t want to lean back. I think we were disappointed about the game because there were more possibilities for us, especially in the second half where we played a little bit better, but overall we invested not enough. We were pushing for the goal enough and gave the goals away, conceding too easily, and it wasn’t quite like the performance in the first round (at Norwich)</p>

Everything is possible. We will play with him in the last six games, and if he gets a chance, you see how fantastic his finishing is. He seems to be fitter than ever, he was hard working in shutdown <b>[lockdown]</b> and that gives him now fantastic physical options.

  <p><b>[Danny Ings: <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> manager Ralph Hasenhuttl admits club were lucky to pull off signing]</b> For us, it would maybe not even be possible for us to get such a striker. As with every transfer, there is always a risk if you spend a lot of money, especially for a club like us. We know the bullets we have must find a target because we don’t have so much. It was important for him that he stays fit. This was always the biggest question we had about him. He had a long history of injuries, he was never as fit as he is at the moment. Hopefully it stays like this and then we will have the future with Danny Ings as a striker who is definitely finding the goal and also working hard for the team<br /><br />I think Danny has this hunting and working against the ball that he learned from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. They are also a pressing team and work very much on winning balls in the opposition half. He knows that this is necessary for him to work like he did there. It is a bit different to Che (Adams) or to Shane (Long).</p>

The post, penalty and everything. The last game we have given 26 chances or shots away. This time today I think it was two or three and you concede a goal.

What can I say? I can say that we have a player here that has one more year contract and he’s our player, we’d like him to stay as long as he has a contract. If somebody else wants to get him, then they must make a make a good offer. And even then, we have to decide, we as a club, the player has to decide, so we have to find a win-win situation and then everybody is happy. As long as we don’t have this, he is our player and he will stay with us. He wants to give everything as long as he is with us. This is what I expect because he is our player, he gets money from us, he’s paid by us. This is what he should do. About his future, he knows that there is some interest and hopefully, yeah, a club that wants him really shows that they want him. If not, he stays with us.<br /><br />I think it’s clear that we go there in this derby with all we have to win this game.
