  <p><b>[Ghana midfielder Jeffrey Schlupp has described his decision to join English Premier League outfit Crystal Palace as an easy one]</b> was at Leicester for many years and I think the time was right to move on and take my career onto a different path and I saw this opportunity come along to play for Crystal Palace and it was a no-brainer. Everyone knows how big the club is and you can see it is going places. It has quality players and a manager in Sam Allardyce who is known for doing well in the Premier League so it was an easy decision for me.<br /><br />I enjoy playing anywhere down the left hand side, left midfielder or left-back. I will play anywhere in the team that the manager wants me to play though as long as I am helping the side. It is easy to say that Selhurst Park has the best atmosphere in the Premier League for me, playing there is always something I look forward to and I can’t wait to bring my best attributes, pace and exciting the crowd and hopefully help the team get some results</p>

  <p><b>[Jeffrey Schlupp disclosed that Crystal Palace are building on their recent results in the English top-flight]</b> You try and look at it as less as you can <b>[the Premier League table]</b>. It’s one of those things that obviously everyone sees and people are talking about it but we’re taking the positives out of how we’ve been playing recently. There’s been three or four we’ve drawn recently where we feel we’ve done enough to win, so you’ve got to take the positives out of those, of course. We’re creating a lot of chances and hopefully we can keep doing that and win some games.<br /><br />It’s clear to see what Roy has got a great CV. He’s done well with every team he’s been at, really. We’ve got all the faith in him and he’s got all the faith in us and I think our performances of recent have been showing that. We’ve come a long way from the beginning of the season and I feel with him in charge we’ve got a great chance of staying up, which I’m sure we will do</p>
