  <p><b>[On Gregory van der Wiel]</b> When you make choices, not always do they turn out as hoped or expected. <b>[Now]</b>, Victor and Chris love playing again, found that passion. It comes down to us being human; understanding Gregory as a person, providing the things that people expect, allow him to be himself, enjoy and play the game. This is a club full of good people, eager to help and support each other. From that you find joy in life and on the field. And when you win, that helps.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC coach Greg Vanney took his team to Mexico during the preseason, playing friendly games against teams like current CCL favorite Club America]</b> From the quality standpoint and the vision of how we want to play, our thought is that we’ve closed the gap between MLS and Mexico. We have every opportunity to win this game.</p>

  <p><b>[He plans to have Toronto FC play its game, which suggests TFC plans on going on the attack]</b> We’re not going to come in and change a bunch of things and hope to try and get a result here. We’re going to play the game we think that is most in the vision of how we want to play. We’re going to play to try and win the game, and as the game progresses we’ll make decisions along the way.</p>

  <p><b>[Club America manager Miguel Herrera accused Toronto police officers of hitting his players during a scuffle at halftime]</b> I was front and center, and I saw everything. I’m not really going to digress into he said, she said. All of that, I think, will play itself out here in the next couple of days. I would disagree with <b>[Herrera]</b> - strongly. Just in defense of the Toronto Police I’m going to disagree with him strongly, because that’s not what happened. But the rest of it and how it started and all that kind of stuff, and what happened, will, I think, play itself out. I’m not going to get into that. We’ve seen that before and I’m not going to get into that.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC pays the price for mistakes and missed chances in CCL final opener]</b> We had some opportunities, and we didn’t make due with those. We gave away two goals that we shouldn’t give away, and we find ourselves in a little bit of a hole heading to Mexico.<br /><br />At the end of the day the score comes down to finishing your chances and not giving away goals you shouldn’t give away. The result comes to that</p>

  <p><b>[Campeones Cup the right idea at the wrong time for Toronto FC, Tigres]</b> I haven’t much, in terms of their performances or their results. I looked at their roster just to see which guys were back. They certainly didn’t get any worse, and added a couple more guys that will probably make them better. They’re going to be as strong, and deeper, than they were when we faced them six months ago. It will be interesting.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto coach Greg Vanney is hoping Alejandro Pozuelo forms a good partnership with striker Jozy Altidore]</b> An attacking player first and foremost, we want to use him in that role. He’ll play close to Jozy and help us set up attacks in the final action. He’s outstanding at understanding how to move around, manipulate numbers on the field, playing between lines, the vision for the final pass, the ability to spring runners and also to finish plays. <b>[An]</b> engine through that final phase of attack.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC played out a 1-1 draw with Orlando City in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> on Saturday night. Afterwards, the TFC coach Greg Vanney was questioned on whether his players could have done anything differently in order to prevent the goal they gave up]</b> Foul more. <b>[That]</b> doesn’t mean being nasty, doesn’t mean taking yellow cards all the time. It means slowing the game down, stopping the game, getting numbers behind the ball<br /><br /><b>[He went on, explaining the value in snuffing out counterattacks by illegal means]</b> If you take a good defending position at the start of the play and you’re between the man and the goal and the ball and the goal and you foul a player, a lot of times you probably won’t get a card. But if you get on the wrong side of the play and then you have to foul from the back side, then you might get a card. If the alternative is getting a card, or letting a guy go in on a breakaway or a start a counter, then take the card, especially if you’re not on one. We have to be more professional. And sometimes committing a foul is being professional. That’s a resource in the game</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="jozy-altidore.html">Altidore</a> ruled out of USMNT squad for Nations League openers]</b> His quad was sore. I don’t know to the extent, we don’t know quite where he’s at. We’ll have to see from an MRI what it looks like and what our timeline might be and how we’ll deal with it.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="jozy-altidore.html">Jozy Altidore</a> still questionable, but ready to help Toronto FC]</b> Good. He was on the field, did some work on the side, some work with the ball, some running. We’ll see. Every day is a ‘how does he respond to the day’s work?’ summed up the coach. We’ll do another fitness test with him tomorrow, see where he’s at. It’s questionable, but we’ll play it by ear.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="jozy-altidore.html">Altidore</a>’s session consisted of]</b> things he would encounter in a game, not a ton of playing. As we try to progress him, we’ll keep him in as safe an environment as possible and not overextend him, but have him ready for what we feel we might need him for<br /><br />It’s a collaborative process between the doctors, between the player, the training staff, myself. Everybody is involved. These are always tough because the games are so important, but there are some fundamental principles on whether we would put a guy on the field or not</p>

  <p><b>[Altidore: It would take a miracle to be ready for <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup]</b> I believe in miracles. Just keep working and put your head down and go for it and we’ll see. It’s a big game. It’s going to take a lot to keep anybody out of it. We’ll see, but I’m optimistic that we can keep pushing him there. With each game, we have optimism - more as we get farther and farther down the road. But we knew the first few were going to be really challenging.<br /><br />This one, again as I’ve said the whole time, he’s not going to be 100 percent. The question is will he be far enough along and be functionally mobile enough to do the things that he has to do for however long as he has to do it. Those are really the questions</p>

  <p><b>[Miracle or mind game? <a href="jozy-altidore.html">Altidore</a>’s injury status vital in buildup to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup]</b> He’s doing good. He hasn’t trained with the group specifically, but physically he’s doing good. We really won’t know anything until we actually put him in the middle of a training session and see where he’s at. But in terms of, we’re getting him to where we want, to see what that looks like<br /><br />Hopefully miracles can come true, as he said. But we know he’s putting in a lot of work and the guys around him are putting in a lot of work. So I know it will take a lot to keep him out of the team on the weekend, in the biggest game of the year</p>
