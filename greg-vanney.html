  <p><b>[Toronto FC aims to go one step further in 2017]</b> We’re much further along, for a lot of different reasons. First of all, we’ve had very little turnover in the offseason. The vast majority of our team is back. They’ve had one more year of experience together, obviously <b>[with]</b> a deep run into the playoffs and to MLS Cup. Last year we were adding some new faces, some important new faces in Drew <b>[Moor]</b> and Beita <b>[Steven Beitashour]</b> and Clint <b>[Irwin]</b>, and the culture of the whole group was still kind of … a work in progress. So a lot of that stuff is established now, and so it’s a much better starting point from that way, and I think in terms of clarity of our pieces and how they fit together and how we want to play and all that kind stuff is a lot clearer. It wasn’t that long ago that we played in some pretty big matches and some of that stuff still carries over and leaves us in a better starting position now as we go into this season.<br /><br />We want to be more consistent this year game in and game out. We would like to have some games where it’s clear that we’re the better team on the day and the margin shows it. We have bigger goals as a group to win championships and to win the big games and all that kind of stuff, but for us to really focus on performing better game in and game out is key, and to perform on a consistent basis is to show that you’re a good team with good character<br /><br />We have to feel like we are one of the standard bearers for the league now as we go into the year, but on paper and as words none of that really means anything. We stay focused on improving and working on the field, and ultimately showing it on the field so that the results speak for themselves<br /><br />It’s a group that’s confident in its ability to win things - win championships, win trophies, get a lot of good results over the course of the year. I think we all feel like we are a team that can contend for a championship</p>

  <p><b>[On Marky Delgado]</b> Part of the reason the ball moved faster was because Marky was on the field. Marky is an efficient player. He doesn’t try to always look for the final pass. He usually plays in the fewest amount of touches possible, which means he gets rid of the ball and moves it quickly.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC extends record-setting winning streak]</b> That’s five wins in 15 days, I don’t know if that has ever been done before. No one said the last one was going to be easy by any stretch.<br /><br />A little too entertaining for my liking; it was back and forth. Credit goes to them too. They were pushing. They were putting guys into some good spots and they created some problems for us. Obviously they kept matching our goals before we were able to give ourselves a two-goal lead. We kept having to scrap and claw and push to try and get enough to win the game in the end<br /><br /><b>[Vanney said his team’s willingness to go for the victory regardless of the circumstances is becoming more apparent]</b> There is a winning mentality, an aggressive mentality. We’re at home and at 2-2 <b>[late in the second half]</b> does one point give us a ton of good or does going for three points do us some good?</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls show signs of life in draw with red-hot TFC]</b> The win streak was going to come to an end at some point. We knew this was a tough place to play. We got down a goal, but continued to battle, got the equalizer, continued to battle for the goal that would have won it.<br /><br />Again, I’m proud of the effort. I think I was happy with our second-half performance. Still some things that can tighten up. I will probably always say that. But we came into a difficult place to play. We very much could have taken three points out of this.<br /><br />It’s a long season, and a lot of teams go through their moments where you just have to clean up a few things. You lose track of something, maybe some things that are important as a group that make you successful. Just a couple of things being off can turn things against you, and I think that’s the case with <b>[the Red Bulls]</b><br /><br />They’re a good team but just a couple of things aren’t going well for them right now. Things that they just need to tighten up eventually and they’re a team that’s fully capable of running a stretch of wins. We know they’ll be there somewhere in the end, that’s what we talked about this week. No matter what form they’re in, this is a team that - in order to get to where we want to go - we’ll have to go through this team</p>

  <p><b>[Vazquez would punctuate his night with an audacious free kick under the Columbus wall to seal the victory]</b> He is two steps ahead of everyone. He knows how much time he has, he knows where the pressure is coming from, he knows where the outs are and knows where the passes that can hurt people. He has the ability to make those passes and he is just very clever. Of all the attacking midfielders <b>[in MLS]</b>, he is the most clever by a long shot.<br /><br />We are over the moon about scoring five goals on a day like today. We had contributions from a lot of guys and had a guy <b>[Spencer]</b> make his first ever appearance in MLS, and all three substitutions making a big impact.

It’s been a while since they’ve been on the field together and it’s been a week and change since the group <b>[as a whole]</b> has played a game.<br /><br />One of our goals this year was to get the two of them linking up more often than they were in previous years. I think they both make very good runs ahead of the ball and they’re both very capable technically to find each other. And so they trust each other in that way and so they make hard runs <b>[for one another]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Any time Toronto FC and the Montreal Impact get together, it’s a hard-fought affair. Add a cup to the equation, and you get fireworks]</b> Montreal always, when we play them, it’s always a grind. They are a veteran team, a good team, an organized team, always a difficult opposition for us in every scenario. It just seems like every time we play them the games are more and more exciting in different ways. Obviously, congratulations to them in terms of always being the competitor that they are. It took us 90-plus minutes to finally get the goal that was decisive.<br /><br />For us it’s a big night because we were able to, with this group, lift a trophy in front of our fans in Toronto which is something that is very meaningful to us. Obviously with the way things went last year in the <b>[MLS Cup]</b> final and not being able to do so, tonight was an important moment in that way. We’re very proud to be the Canadian champions, that’s a big thing for us, it’s one of our goals, it’s one of our things that we can now check off</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Bradley’s work for Toronto FC and USMNT far from complete]</b> He’s proving his worth, both at the national team level and at the club level. Both sides right now are very successful. They’re stable. With Bruce and the national team things are a lot more stable than they were before. Our club is stable and it’s made it much easier to perform at the level that they’re expected to perform at when the environment is stable.<br /><br />As you get older, you get a little bit wiser. As a younger player he was such a doer and he saw every situation and he tried to solve that problem by getting to that space and doing it. A lot of it was based on a lot more running and a lot more work, and maybe sometimes not as efficient as he could be. And he learned to be more efficient, to move people around him, to communicate and get guys to do their jobs in a way that he doesn’t have to run over and try to do it.<br /><br />He sees things earlier and he sees things clearer now. A lot of that has coincided with him dropping in and playing a more specific role, the six role, and having some real consistency there. We are a little more specific with roles, and guys around him understand their roles, which allows him to move pieces around instead of trying to do everything. He’s learned a lot in terms of reading the game and manipulating the game sometimes, not just by doing, but by telling, and by demanding and by moving all the pieces around him</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto coach Greg Vanney believes that, if anything, the boos only served to help the visitors get more out of the American stars]</b> I think it motivated them. Each of them dug just a little bit deeper, and each of them pulled out a little bit more.<br /><br /><b>[on Jozy Altidore]</b> I thought Jozy was outstanding. He played big, he played physical. In days where you’re not getting out in transition all that great, you need somebody who you can target, who you can play off of, who can hold the ball up, who can bring people in. His contribution was huge. It wasn’t on the scoreboard, but I think Jozy is more than that. We’ve learned that over the years. Jozy’s the consummate team guy. He’ll do whatever he needs to do on the day, and he doesn’t get too caught up on how many goals he scores. We needed him to be the big guy tonight and he was great<br /><br /><b>[For Vanney, a former U.S. defender, the boos aimed at Bradley and Altidore are misguided]</b> I think the whole thing is nonsense. It takes a lot more than a couple of guys to not qualify for the World Cup. It takes structural issues and a lot of other things. The fans have the right to do what they want, but these guys really stepped up and proved a point</p>

We’ve had the best regular season, it’s been a historical regular season.<br /><br /><b>[Vanney believes Bradley didn’t generate as much MVP consideration because his role as a defensive midfielder doesn’t generate as much buzz]</b> I think it’s a position that’s not a glorified position, but for me it’s the key to a team in a lot of ways. It’s the piece that connects what’s happening in the back to what’s happening in the front on both sides of the ball. If you have stability in that position you can really build around that. Michael gives us that stability, we’ve been able to build around that and get the appropriate types of guys in the right positions.<br /><br />I think he’s done an amazing job being sort of the centerpiece of the team, but we also have other guys who can make incredible plays. Take your pick. They can give the MVP award to our team if they want. I’ll take that too. It’s a lot easier for me.</p>

We need to be forward thinking and we need to be aggressive and try to get as many opportunities as we can on their goal.<br /><br />I do think that ultimately the strength of their team is when they’re allotted a lot of time to move the ball around. Shift guys into different positions and try to break teams down. For us, it’s not about chasing them around all over the place, it’s understanding where the gaps are, and the spots are. Different people will show up, it doesn’t matter who shows up, it’s to make sure we understand where those spaces are that they’re trying to exploit and deal with that</p>

It has nothing to do with a Best XI.<br /><br />I think he understands it. To him it’s not that big of a deal. What’s important to him and all of us is that at the end of the day we want to win trophies and the individual stuff is subjective to people’s opinions. What’s objective is can we win trophies? Can we win the big one? That’s what’s really important.</p>

  <p><b>[On Brian Schmetzer]</b> I know Schmetz a little bit and I think he’s a great guy who, clearly, the guys love playing for, which means he’s probably a great manager of them and great communicator and gets a lot out of them. They seem to genuinely enjoy playing the game and that’s a positive thing. That’s always an edge in MLS, when you get an intense group that enjoys playing, and then you can just bring out the assets of the players you have on the field. I think he’s done a great job of that..<br /><br /><b>[Vanney has also taken note of Schmetzer’s ability to make the right in-game adjustments]</b> It’s a product of his personality. He’s not a highly emotional guy. He will sit back and he’ll take the game in and see what’s going on. He doesn’t get overly wound up about calls or about this or that, the things that don’t matter, he doesn’t get caught up in that stuff. He stays relatively emotionless and calm on the sidelines, and I think he’s taking in the game and utilizes his assistant coaches, as we all do, to get a good read on what’s happening and how he can get an advantage. I think he does a nice job of that. I think a lot of that has to do with his demeanor<br /><br />Obviously he’s soccer aware. He’s been around a long time and he’s a good coach. I enjoy that. I haven’t played against him a ton to say we’ve had these big tactical matches, but at the same time I recognize watching from a distance that he definitely can adapt and adjust the game and have an impact on the game with his moves, which again is a product of a good coach</p>

We’ve seen that before and I’m not going to get into that.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC pays the price for mistakes and missed chances in CCL final opener]</b> We had some opportunities, and we didn’t make due with those. We gave away two goals that we shouldn’t give away, and we find ourselves in a little bit of a hole heading to Mexico.<br /><br />At the end of the day the score comes down to finishing your chances and not giving away goals you shouldn’t give away. The result comes to that</p>

  <p><b>[Campeones Cup the right idea at the wrong time for Toronto FC, Tigres]</b> I haven’t much, in terms of their performances or their results. I looked at their roster just to see which guys were back. They certainly didn’t get any worse, and added a couple more guys that will probably make them better. They’re going to be as strong, and deeper, than they were when we faced them six months ago. It will be interesting.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto coach Greg Vanney is hoping Alejandro Pozuelo forms a good partnership with striker Jozy Altidore]</b> An attacking player first and foremost, we want to use him in that role. He’ll play close to Jozy and help us set up attacks in the final action. He’s outstanding at understanding how to move around, manipulate numbers on the field, playing between lines, the vision for the final pass, the ability to spring runners and also to finish plays. <b>[An]</b> engine through that final phase of attack.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC played out a 1-1 draw with Orlando City in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> on Saturday night. Afterwards, the TFC coach Greg Vanney was questioned on whether his players could have done anything differently in order to prevent the goal they gave up]</b> Foul more. <b>[That]</b> doesn’t mean being nasty, doesn’t mean taking yellow cards all the time. It means slowing the game down, stopping the game, getting numbers behind the ball<br /><br /><b>[He went on, explaining the value in snuffing out counterattacks by illegal means]</b> If you take a good defending position at the start of the play and you’re between the man and the goal and the ball and the goal and you foul a player, a lot of times you probably won’t get a card. But if you get on the wrong side of the play and then you have to foul from the back side, then you might get a card. If the alternative is getting a card, or letting a guy go in on a breakaway or a start a counter, then take the card, especially if you’re not on one. We have to be more professional. And sometimes committing a foul is being professional. That’s a resource in the game</p>

We’ll have to see from an MRI what it looks like and what our timeline might be and how we’ll deal with it.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="jozy-altidore.html">Jozy Altidore</a> still questionable, but ready to help Toronto FC]</b> Good. He was on the field, did some work on the side, some work with the ball, some running. We’ll see. Every day is a ‘how does he respond to the day’s work?’ summed up the coach. We’ll do another fitness test with him tomorrow, see where he’s at. It’s questionable, but we’ll play it by ear.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="jozy-altidore.html">Altidore</a>’s session consisted of]</b> things he would encounter in a game, not a ton of playing. As we try to progress him, we’ll keep him in as safe an environment as possible and not overextend him, but have him ready for what we feel we might need him for<br /><br />It’s a collaborative process between the doctors, between the player, the training staff, myself. Everybody is involved. These are always tough because the games are so important, but there are some fundamental principles on whether we would put a guy on the field or not</p>

  <p><b>[Altidore: It would take a miracle to be ready for <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup]</b> I believe in miracles. Just keep working and put your head down and go for it and we’ll see. It’s a big game. It’s going to take a lot to keep anybody out of it. We’ll see, but I’m optimistic that we can keep pushing him there. With each game, we have optimism - more as we get farther and farther down the road. But we knew the first few were going to be really challenging.<br /><br />This one, again as I’ve said the whole time, he’s not going to be 100 percent. The question is will he be far enough along and be functionally mobile enough to do the things that he has to do for however long as he has to do it. Those are really the questions</p>

  <p><b>[Miracle or mind game? <a href="jozy-altidore.html">Altidore</a>’s injury status vital in buildup to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup]</b> He’s doing good. He hasn’t trained with the group specifically, but physically he’s doing good. We really won’t know anything until we actually put him in the middle of a training session and see where he’s at. But in terms of, we’re getting him to where we want, to see what that looks like<br /><br />Hopefully miracles can come true, as he said. But we know he’s putting in a lot of work and the guys around him are putting in a lot of work. So I know it will take a lot to keep him out of the team on the weekend, in the biggest game of the year</p>
