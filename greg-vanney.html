  <p><b>[Toronto FC played out a 1-1 draw with Orlando City in MLS on Saturday night. Afterwards, the TFC coach Greg Vanney was questioned on whether his players could have done anything differently in order to prevent the goal they gave up]</b> Foul more. <b>[That]</b> doesn’t mean being nasty, doesn’t mean taking yellow cards all the time. It means slowing the game down, stopping the game, getting numbers behind the ball<br /><br /><b>[He went on, explaining the value in snuffing out counterattacks by illegal means]</b> If you take a good defending position at the start of the play and you’re between the man and the goal and the ball and the goal and you foul a player, a lot of times you probably won’t get a card. But if you get on the wrong side of the play and then you have to foul from the back side, then you might get a card. If the alternative is getting a card, or letting a guy go in on a breakaway or a start a counter, then take the card, especially if you’re not on one. We have to be more professional. And sometimes committing a foul is being professional. That’s a resource in the game</p>

  <p><b>[Altidore: It would take a miracle to be ready for <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup]</b> I believe in miracles. Just keep working and put your head down and go for it and we’ll see. It’s a big game. It’s going to take a lot to keep anybody out of it. We’ll see, but I’m optimistic that we can keep pushing him there. With each game, we have optimism - more as we get farther and farther down the road. But we knew the first few were going to be really challenging.<br /><br />This one, again as I’ve said the whole time, he’s not going to be 100 percent. The question is will he be far enough along and be functionally mobile enough to do the things that he has to do for however long as he has to do it. Those are really the questions</p>

  <p><b>[Altidore ruled out of USMNT squad for Nations League openers]</b> His quad was sore. I don’t know to the extent, we don’t know quite where he’s at. We’ll have to see from an MRI what it looks like and what our timeline might be and how we’ll deal with it.</p>

  <p><b>[Jozy Altidore still questionable, but ready to help Toronto FC]</b> Good. He was on the field, did some work on the side, some work with the ball, some running. We’ll see. Every day is a ‘how does he respond to the day’s work?’ summed up the coach. We’ll do another fitness test with him tomorrow, see where he’s at. It’s questionable, but we’ll play it by ear.<br /><br /><b>[Altidore’s session consisted of]</b> things he would encounter in a game, not a ton of playing. As we try to progress him, we’ll keep him in as safe an environment as possible and not overextend him, but have him ready for what we feel we might need him for<br /><br />It’s a collaborative process between the doctors, between the player, the training staff, myself. Everybody is involved. These are always tough because the games are so important, but there are some fundamental principles on whether we would put a guy on the field or not</p>

  <p><b>[Miracle or mind game? <a href="jozy-altidore.html">Altidore</a>’s injury status vital in buildup to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup]</b> He’s doing good. He hasn’t trained with the group specifically, but physically he’s doing good. We really won’t know anything until we actually put him in the middle of a training session and see where he’s at. But in terms of, we’re getting him to where we want, to see what that looks like<br /><br />Hopefully miracles can come true, as he said. But we know he’s putting in a lot of work and the guys around him are putting in a lot of work. So I know it will take a lot to keep him out of the team on the weekend, in the biggest game of the year</p>
