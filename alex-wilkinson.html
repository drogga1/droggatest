<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sydney FC’s Alex Wilkinson has applauded the way central defensive partner Jordy Buijs has seamlessly fitted into the A-League leaders’ line-up]</b> I think the more you play together the more natural things become as a centre-back. It obviously takes a bit of time to get to know each other’s strengths and whatnot but he’s <b>[Buijs]</b> fitted in seamlessly, and to be fair, so have other players all season. We’ve had a bit of chopping and changing the backline throughout the year and each player that’s come in has just fitted in and you would think they’d played a season or whatever together. That’s great to see. That’s credit to Arnie <b>[coach Graham Arnold]</b> and the coaching staff for doing a lot of video and tactical work with the guys who are coming in.<br /><br />Personnel-wise, I think this is one of the best teams I’ve played in. The depth we’ve got in the squad is very, very good. Arnie’s done a great job of recruiting a strong team and there’s at least two players who can play in every position<br /><br />Both games this <b>[season]</b> have been really good, exciting games. This one, it’s one v two again and a lot of pressure on them. They have to win to bridge the gap between us and them. So they’ll be looking to come up and play attacking football and looking to win, so it has all the makings of an exciting game</p>
