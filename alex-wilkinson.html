  <p><b>[Sydney FC’s Alex Wilkinson has applauded the way central defensive partner Jordy Buijs has seamlessly fitted into the A-League leaders’ line-up]</b> I think the more you play together the more natural things become as a centre-back. It obviously takes a bit of time to get to know each other’s strengths and whatnot but he’s <b>[Buijs]</b> fitted in seamlessly, and to be fair, so have other players all season. We’ve had a bit of chopping and changing the backline throughout the year and each player that’s come in has just fitted in and you would think they’d played a season or whatever together. That’s great to see. That’s credit to Arnie <b>[coach Graham Arnold]</b> and the coaching staff for doing a lot of video and tactical work with the guys who are coming in.<br /><br />Personnel-wise, I think this is one of the best teams I’ve played in. The depth we’ve got in the squad is very, very good. Arnie’s done a great job of recruiting a strong team and there’s at least two players who can play in every position<br /><br />Both games this <b>[season]</b> have been really good, exciting games. This one, it’s one v two again and a lot of pressure on them. They have to win to bridge the gap between us and them. So they’ll be looking to come up and play attacking football and looking to win, so it has all the makings of an exciting game</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney defender Alex Wilkinson paid tribute to the premiers’ depth as they kept their 17th clean sheet of the campaign]</b> Arnie’ <b>[Coach Graham Arnold]</b> has done a great job of recruiting at least two players for each position. When you’ve got that sort of depth, obviously everyone is fighting to get in the team and all of a sudden at training the level lifts and lifts and lifts. That’s only going to help the first 11 on the weekend</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC defender Alex Wilkinson believes his side has an edge heading into Sunday’s A-League showpiece final against Melbourne Victory]</b> They’re <b>[Victory]</b> going to say it’s a one-off game but of course we’re going to take a lot of confidence from beating them three times. You can say that the season doesn’t matter but we’ve got a fantastic record at home. Defensively, we’ve conceded very few goals at home which is going to give us confidence going into the game. We’re going to have a huge crowd there as well, so all those little things are going to work in our favour. Obviously they’re going to have to come up here and beat us on our own patch, which no-one has done yet. We’re going to go in very confident.</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC defender Alex Wilkinson was the most relieved man at Allianz Stadium on Sunday as his Grand Final misery ended with a maiden A-League championship]</b> It’s something that’s definitely been missing. I’ve been lucky enough to win premierships and other things overseas but I’ve never been able to win the championship. To tick that off is fantastic. And it’s just more for the boys after the year we’ve had. If we didn’t win tonight it still would have been a great year but it wouldn’t have had that icing on the cake. It’s just such a great feeling and I’m relieved to get that monkey off my back.<br /><br /><b>[On Danny Vukovic]</b> He’s been first class all year. Penalty shootouts are made for the goalkeepers to stand up and he did that tonight. He kept us in the game and congratulations to him because he’s been absolutely brilliant</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroo guns Aaron Mooy and Tom Rogic will be favourites to win the PFA’s Footballer of the Year after the nominees for the award were announced on Wednesday]</b> As a player, being recognised by your peers is the greatest honour you can receive. All these players should be very proud of what they achieved during the 2016/17 season. Some of the very best footballers our country has ever produced have won these awards in the past and I’ve got no doubt that the current generation will leave their mark on Australian football.</p>
