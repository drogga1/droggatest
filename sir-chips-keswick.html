  <p><b>[Former England coach <a href="don-howe.html">Don Howe</a> passes away at 80]</b> We were aware Don had been enduring a long battle with illness, but it was still a shock to learn the news about someone who was loved by so many people at the club, and who had such a remarkable influence as a player, coach and manager here. Don possessed a marvellous ability to get the very best out of players with his coaching techniques and provide them with the perfect preparation for matches. He was the very best at what he did - and he did it with us, at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, for decade after decade. He will be greatly missed by everyone who knew him and his name will live on in the history books as one of the most influential footballing figures in the history of the club</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal announced the club’s financial results for 2018-19: A loss after tax of £27.1 million ($34.8m)]</b> Our player trading profit for this financial year was limited and this combined with a second consecutive season of Europa League football has meant the club recorded its first overall loss since 2002. For 2019-20 we will see increased commercial revenues from Adidas and our renewed deal with Emirates but another season outside the Champions League will continue to apply pressure to our financial results</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal chairman Sir Chips Keswick retires after 15 years at Emirates Stadium]</b> It has been an honour to be the chairman of this great football club. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> has always held a special place in my life and that will remain the case in the future. I made my plan to retire at the end of this season clear to the board, before the global health crisis we are now experiencing. The club is in safe hands with Stan and Josh, the board and the executive team. I know <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> will emerge strongly from this situation and I look forward, like all our supporters around the world, to seeing the team in action as soon as possible</p>
