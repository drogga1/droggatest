  <p><b>[Newcastle star Matt Ritchie has admitted that he has his first beer in over two years this week … just so he could urinate for a drugs test]</b> I had a knock on my door at 8.45pm - it was the drug testers. And to try and make myself have a wee, I had my first beer since my wedding day two years ago!<br /><br />Even when we won the league I didn’t have a glass of champagne. I had a lime and soda with my meal. I will probably get labelled boring for that but I want to give myself the best opportunity to be the best I can be<br /><br /><b>[It was announced earlier this month that Ritchie sells more shirts with his name on their back than the likes of Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar]</b> If someone had said to me five years ago that this would be the case, I would have laughed at them. The fans have been fantastic to me since I’ve been here and the least I can do is give everything for them. Sometimes I won’t be having the best of games, but one quality I have is that I’ll never hide</p>

  <p><b>[Rafael Benitez and over that 40 points milestone]</b> Forty points at the start of the season is the target that everyone looks for. Credit to everyone involved.<br /><br />At Arsenal away I remember we got beat 1-0 but towards the end we were always pushing, pushing in the game think that’s the key thing in this league - to stay in the game and give yourself an opportunity. You will always get chances<br /><br />We give ourselves these opportunities to win games or to take points from games. That’s down to our work ethic on and off the ball. Everyone’s working so hard. That’s the difference between being on the right side and the wrong side of those results<br /><br /><b>[On Rafael Benitez]</b> He’s definitely improved me. For sure. There’s small details that with different managers you take on board and every manager has got different ideas and ways of playing. There’s details in my game now that I didn’t have before I arrived. Definitely off the ball - more so as a team than an individual. It’s small details you see when we haven’t got the ball. We’re so compact, we’re so hard to break down - whether that’s against Man City or teams that were in and around us<br /><br />Throughout the whole season, even when the results weren’t quite going our way, we’ve never really been rolled over or gone down without a fight. It’s always been one-goal margins. We’ve worked for it and we’ve been on the right side of those one-goal margins in the last six weeks or so. It <b>[unity]</b> comes from everyone working together with the same mentality, the same desire. We’ve got a fantastic group pushing each other each day in training. Standards are high and that’s how it needs to be to get the best out of each other and as a team. It’s a really positive camp. It’s about on the training pitch making sure we’re competitive and making sure our mentality on matchdays is correct<br /><br />We were around the bottom three and if we hadn’t have won that game, we might have been in a different fight. But we did win that game and that’s football and we’ve kicked on since then</p>

  <p><b>[Matt Ritchie was relieved that his horror miss was not punished as Newcastle held on to record a 2-1 victory over Burnley]</b> I thought I’d scored to be honest. I was probably celebrating before I put it in the net. Hopefully it doesn’t make the worst Premier League misses! I was delighted at the end there to see that ball <b>[a late Vokes chance]</b> go over the bar and the whistle go. It was a huge relief</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle wide-man Matt Ritchie remains optimistic that manager Rafa Benitez will sign a new contact]</b> I don’t really want to talk about that because I don’t think we’re going to <b>[lose him]</b>. I’m optimistic that he will stay; I hope he stays, everyone hopes he stays. There is no point talking about ifs and buts, as we don’t know yet, let’s just wait and see.<br /><br /><b>[And when asked if the players wanted Benitez to stay]</b> Yeah of course. It’s out of our hands. We can’t affect it but it is down to the manager and the board. There is no secret the manager has been fantastic since he has arrived. Hopefully he can stay and we can continue to create a good team, and look forward to the future with hope<br /><br /><b>[Newcastle’s win at Fulham brought the Magpies to 45 points]</b> I think this team deserved it. What a performance on the final day when playing for nothing</p>

  <p><b>[Matt Ritchie has confirmed he is in talks over a new contract with Newcastle]</b> There are discussions at the moment, hopefully we can get them resolved. This is a massive football club I’m really enjoying playing for, so until I’m told my services are no longer required, I’m fighting for my life as I do every week to perform.<br /><br />Who knows what the future holds but until I’m told my services are no longer required, I’ll do everything for the football club. Don’t get me wrong I’ve been very pleased with the way I’ve adapted to the new regime. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed it and learnt a lot but you can’t say it is my best season<br /><br /><b>[Ritchie spent three years at Bournemouth before making the move to Newcastle in 2016]</b> The Championship was a different season, we were expected to win. I’ve been pleased with all three seasons. There is always room for improvement and I want to strive for more and improve in areas of my game. I still want more</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> team-mate Matt Ritchie says <a href="jonjo-shelvey.html">Jonjo Shelvey</a> is talented enough to play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> For me, I’ve said to him so many times, ‘If you just got your head down, focused solely on football and forgot about golf and whatever else…’. It’s true, though, isn’t it? He’s mad. He’ll play golf three times a week, and I’m like, ‘Jonj, you can’t do that’. He’s like, ‘No, no, I feel better, Matty’. I’m like, ‘That’s impossible’. But what a player, what a player. I’ve been at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> now for four years, and I’ve honestly seen him inside a box <b>[rondo]</b> no more than 10 times. That’s how good he is - and we do boxes every day. This guy has the natural ability to just see passes, to receive the ball, to move the ball. I remember playing against him as a kid. I think he was 14 - we were playing Charlton Under-16s at Portsmouth - and I think he scored a hat-trick. He was unbelievable. Obviously, he’s got his moves and he’s ended up at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. But I say to him very regular: ‘Jonj, if you had your head screwed on, you could play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> so easily.’ He’s that good, isn’t he? He is, though. He’s that good. He’s got everything, he’s got the short one, and at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> now, he hits longer passes and tougher passes and he’s the one we look to to open teams up and create. But - and this is no disrespect to us at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> - I feel like if he was playing for a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, you could imagine he’d blow teams away with his ability. You’ve got to have everything in the right place, and he likes his golf too much, doesn’t he? He says to me, ‘I know Matty, but this is what I’m like, this is what I’m like’. Imagine if you wanted to. You could.</p>
