  <p><b>[<a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> team-mate Matt Ritchie says <a href="jonjo-shelvey.html">Jonjo Shelvey</a> is talented enough to play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> For me, I’ve said to him so many times, ‘If you just got your head down, focused solely on football and forgot about golf and whatever else…’. It’s true, though, isn’t it? He’s mad. He’ll play golf three times a week, and I’m like, ‘Jonj, you can’t do that’. He’s like, ‘No, no, I feel better, Matty’. I’m like, ‘That’s impossible’. But what a player, what a player. I’ve been at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> now for four years, and I’ve honestly seen him inside a box <b>[rondo]</b> no more than 10 times. That’s how good he is - and we do boxes every day. This guy has the natural ability to just see passes, to receive the ball, to move the ball. I remember playing against him as a kid. I think he was 14 - we were playing Charlton Under-16s at Portsmouth - and I think he scored a hat-trick. He was unbelievable. Obviously, he’s got his moves and he’s ended up at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. But I say to him very regular: ‘Jonj, if you had your head screwed on, you could play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> so easily.’ He’s that good, isn’t he? He is, though. He’s that good. He’s got everything, he’s got the short one, and at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> now, he hits longer passes and tougher passes and he’s the one we look to to open teams up and create. But - and this is no disrespect to us at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> - I feel like if he was playing for a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, you could imagine he’d blow teams away with his ability. You’ve got to have everything in the right place, and he likes his golf too much, doesn’t he? He says to me, ‘I know Matty, but this is what I’m like, this is what I’m like’. Imagine if you wanted to. You could.</p>
