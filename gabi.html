  <p><b>[<a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>’s Gabi on Neymar]</b> He’s got an odd way of playing, particularly when he’s winning. He’s always making gestures on the field, especially when he’s in front. Nobody likes to lose and these things irritate you</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> captain Gabi says When this coronavirus is over, I hope we’re better people]</b> To tell you the truth, it gives you a bit of despair at not being able to be with them. I have my parents in Spain. They are not very old, but they are people at risk. And then there is my sister also, who is a nurse, with all that that entails<br /><br />Although it sounds a little cheesy, give hugs. To my loved ones, my family and my friends. The other day I heard I think Ricardinho reflect on this whole situation and give food for thought: Sometimes when we have everything, we sin by not being too loving. When all this coronavirus is over, I hope we are better people<br /><br /><b>[Gabi added that he had faith Atletico could pull off a Champions League upset against holders <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> Although it seems crazy, I experienced the <b>[second leg at]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> calmer than in other games. I trusted Atleti, because in this type of game I know they always show who they are. Atleti today can beat anyone. It was shown again that in football there is nothing written<br /><br /><b>[As he nears the end of his playing career, Gabi has admitted that he would love to return to his former side in the future as an assistant coach]</b> I will not lie to you, of course I see myself in the Atleti coaching staff. Because of the link with the fans, how I know the club, how I know the squad and the current coach</p>
