  <p><b>[<a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>’s Gabi on <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>]</b> He’s got an odd way of playing, particularly when he’s winning. He’s always making gestures on the field, especially when he’s in front. Nobody likes to lose and these things irritate you</p>

  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois €35 million move from Chelsea to Real Madrid was strange]</b> It hurts. He has played with you, won trophies, it’s a strange one. That’s it, more than it hurts - it’s strange. I prefer to value what we have at home, those who really love this team - Koke, Saul <b>[Niguez]</b>, Juanfran, Godin. Godin is indispensable. He cannot leave, and he doesn’t want to. I’ve spoken with him. These offers - United, Juve - exist. I am sure he and Atletico will work it out in the end. Diego is a leader, the ideal captain.<br /><br /><b>[Gabi also believes that Antoine Griezmann made the right call in sticking with Atletico after a protracted pursuit from Barcelona]</b> I had doubts, it was confusing. He told me: ‘Capi, I’m staying.’ But then I saw <b>[Gerard]</b> Pique, who said: ‘He’s told us he’s coming’. In the end he made the right decision, said no to Barca and stayed. He knows there is nowhere better than Atleti</p>

  <p><b>[The Ballon d’Or will lose all meaning if Antoine Griezmann is not named the world footballer of the year]</b> If they don’t give (the Ballon d’Or) to him this year, I will not understand anything. For example Cannavaro won Ballon d’Or because he won the World Cup and no one has won so much as Griezmann did this year. He won the World Cup, Supercup, Europa League, been the best in the final, he won a lot. I think If Griezmann doesn’t win, the Ballon d’Or doesn’t make sense.<br /><br /><b>[Gabi has followed in the footsteps of Raul in moving to play in the nation which will host the World Cup in 2022]</b> This came in a natural way, it was curious. The prince signed Raul and then Xavi. He signed Real Madrid and Barcelona captains and he went crazy when I scored during Lyon final. He said to Xavi that he must sign Atleti’s captain. They called, they were crazy and they made me a huge offer. It was a difficult decision but I decided to start an adventure</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> captain Gabi says When this coronavirus is over, I hope we’re better people]</b> To tell you the truth, it gives you a bit of despair at not being able to be with them. I have my parents in Spain. They are not very old, but they are people at risk. And then there is my sister also, who is a nurse, with all that that entails<br /><br />Although it sounds a little cheesy, give hugs. To my loved ones, my family and my friends. The other day I heard I think Ricardinho reflect on this whole situation and give food for thought: Sometimes when we have everything, we sin by not being too loving. When all this coronavirus is over, I hope we are better people<br /><br /><b>[Gabi added that he had faith Atletico could pull off a Champions League upset against holders <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> Although it seems crazy, I experienced the <b>[second leg at]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> calmer than in other games. I trusted Atleti, because in this type of game I know they always show who they are. Atleti today can beat anyone. It was shown again that in football there is nothing written<br /><br /><b>[As he nears the end of his playing career, Gabi has admitted that he would love to return to his former side in the future as an assistant coach]</b> I will not lie to you, of course I see myself in the Atleti coaching staff. Because of the link with the fans, how I know the club, how I know the squad and the current coach</p>
