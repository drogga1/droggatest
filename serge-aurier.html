  <p><b>[Tottenham have announced the signing of right-back Serge Aurier from Paris Saint-Germain for a fee believed to be £23 million]</b> This is a huge and exciting opportunity at a massive football club and I am determined to prove myself as a professional both on and off the pitch. This is a fresh start for me and I will do everything to make the Spurs fanbase, which is huge and diverse, proud of me. The fans are the most important people at any club and I am looking forward to showing them and everyone at Spurs the real Serge Aurier.</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd’s £52.5m Fred call backed by Tottenham duo Serge Aurier &amp; Lucas Moura]</b> Fred is a very good player. He likes to play freely with the ball, he likes to run and he moves well from box to box. I remember when I played against him when he was at Shakhtar Donetsk and I was at PSG, he played well but he was only young then. Now he has got much more experience, he’s been to the World Cup. He signed with Manchester United in the summer and, for me, that was a good decision by United. He’s good defensively and it’s a big, big test when you’re against him but we also have very good players and we will be trying to play our game and get the three points.</p>

  <p><b>[Serge Aurier has revealed that he does not want to leave Tottenham]</b> n football things can happen very quickly. For the moment I do not desire to leave Tottenham. For the moment, I am very happy. This season I have been interrupted by injury more than anything else, but life is like that. I will have to see what will happen. We have done a good season and we are in the Champions League final, we are going to enjoy that, see how it goes and next year, my season is not finished, I still have an Africa Cup of Nations too</p>

  <p><b>[Serge Aurier has confessed that he had decided to leave north London during the summer]</b> I had decided to leave, which was fine for me. Finally, a lot of things came into account and I could not leave. It also proves the club trusts me on many points. We will see how this season progresses. Now the transfer window is over and we must focus on the upcoming season<br /><br /><b>[Despite that state of affairs Aurier dismissed the idea that there is any rivalry for the right-back position at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a> Stadium]</b> What competition? There isn’t any</p>

  <p><b>[Quizzed on whether he had wanted to leave]</b> Yes, but that was the situation before the transfer window closed, the transfer window is now closed, now I am calm and happy to stay. I speak with everyone, I don’t want to leave. I had something in my head, but I didn’t want to leave for the gaffer or the chairman <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a>. It was my personal situation and now it is OK, everyone wants to give me another chance and now I am happy to stay and happy to play and happy for the victory. We need to give the best for this season and for the trophies. Nothing has changed in my life. I stay and now I want to prove and give my best for the supporters, for the club, for everyone</p>

  <p><b>[Aurier reveals <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> ambition as <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> star has ‘unfinished business’ in France]</b> I would like to finish at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. It is before everything else the club of my heart. I have a feeling of unfinished business. It has been my club since I was a kid, I would go watch matches at the <a href="psg.html">Parc des Princes</a>. It was a dream for me to come to <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and for me that dream is not finished. If I was to finish my career at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, I would love that. I could have spent my entire career at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, that certainly wouldn’t have upset me. When you play for the club of your heart, you don’t want to go anywhere else nor do you have regrets. There are players who have spent nearly their entire careers at one club because it is love. It is not a question of money or anything else. All my family is in Paris, I am Parisian, I cannot dream of better. Today I am having my little career elsewhere, I hope to be the best a bit everywhere. I am following <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> from afar, but it remains my club and that will not change</p>
