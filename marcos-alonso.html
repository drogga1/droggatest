  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso is flattered to be linked with the likes of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> Yes <b>[he is happy to hear of interest from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b>. It means I’m doing well if other teams are trying to get in touch. I am very happy here but we will see what happens this summer. First of all, I’m focussing on the final. I am very happy to have four more years here and hopefully I will stay many more years. For me, the path changed. I started very well. Then the manager wanted different things from me. After that, I was trying to do what he wanted and then he told me he wanted to play like I was at the beginning of the season. So maybe that has conditioned a little bit the way of my game. I think I’m settled now. I am very happy at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and looking forward to finishing the season with a win and a cup.<br /><br />It’s been a tough season, to be honest. We have lost important games at some points, but we have also won some games against big teams when we were struggling. For example, we beat the Champions League finalists <b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> and we won against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at home. There have been too many ups and downs, we need more consistency.<br /><br /><b>[There are times when <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans have turned on Alonso during the 2018-19 campaign]</b> Football is like this. The better the team you play for, the more fans follow you and there are millions of coaches and managers around the world! Some of them understand football one way; some of them have another opinion. I am the best to judge when I play well and when I don’t. Of course during the season you play some bad games, but it’s been a good campaign. I’m always looking for more, looking to improve and get better. That’s something inside me, I know I have to work for it. I don’t really care about the critics or when people talk good about me. It can’t affect you. I’m one to trust myself and to look for more. I had a good season and hopefully the next one will be even better<br /><br />That is the standard of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> these days. Everyone is competing very well. They have built very good teams and there is a lot of competition. We want to win a trophy, even if <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are winning or not. We have to think about ourselves, our fans and our families and give them a big satisfaction with a win. Sometimes it is only the small details that make the difference in one season. We have to keep the concentration for the whole season, take our chances to score the goals, defend well as a team. There are so many things we have to focus on for the whole season. It is not easy but that is what we have to aim for. We have a lot of players and a lot of quality in the team, also lots of players on loan who can help <b>[in the event of a transfer ban]</b>. We will see what happens, but I trust this team and we have been doing very good things in the last two or three years and we will fight to keep that position</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso thinks <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s recent history makes it just as important for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">the Blues</a> to win the Europa League as it is for final opponents <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> We aren’t tired with this kind of thing and we have had the days to recover. We are training properly every day. It’s a final. It’s the last chance we have to win a trophy this season, so it is a massive game for us. It is always important for us, for the fans, for the club to win a trophy. Of course, we are preparing to be ready and we are going to go for it. No, I don’t think so <b>[that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> will want it more to get into the Champions League]</b>. We have the same need here at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to win something. In the last few years, we have won more trophies than them and are more used to winning things. I don’t think that is something bad. It is something even better for us. We know what it is and this is another chance and something we all want.<br /><br />To be honest, I don’t care who scores the goals. Of course, I have great memories playing against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and have scored three or four times against them already. But it is a different game. It is a final, so I don’t care who scores. I just want to win and we have to play together as a team and that is the best way to get the win<br /><br /><b>[The 28-year-old is hoping for more luck in Azerbaijan after <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> scored a contentious opening goal for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> at Wembley in a game they went on to win 2-1]</b> Yeah, I think that was a game where we deserved better. We conceded a goal a little bit…how do you say? A bad decision. I don’t know how to explain it. It is another chance. That is the past, we have to think about this one and it doesn’t matter about before. We have to go for it, it is a different game and a new challenge another trophy</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso shuts down <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> exit talk as he is ‘very happy’ with Blues]</b> Of course. I signed a new contract last year and I’m very happy here. I don’t know if there’s been any contact, you will have to speak to Marina <b>[<a href="marina-granovskaia.html">Granovskaia</a>]</b> about that<br /><br />I have four more years here and I’m very happy. The last three years have been amazing and I want more of that. I want to keep playing and winning things.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> has, however, been succeeded by <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> this summer and Alonso is looking forward to embracing a ‘fresh start’ for all concerned]</b> I think it’s a fresh start for everyone. Last year is part of the past and now I just want to keep working, enjoy playing and to help the team win and get better. Of course I would love to play every minute and to always be in there. Things happen like this and now it’s a new season. I’m very happy, training very well and looking forward to the start of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso admits <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have endured a hard time after being stung with a transfer ban]</b> There are many new players who have had their chance and are showing their value. They are doing very well. They have brought very good energy to the team, and that mix with the experience that the older players have, the balance in the team is going really well and we are all enjoying the moment. For the other players who have been here for a long time, it’s also good to keep demonstrating the level of play we are. It’s obviously a hard time when you cannot make signings and you lose good players, but the players here are showing we have the quality to do great things<br /><br /><b>[He added on his input in the final third]</b> It’s not my main focus but of course it’s good to help the team with goals and assists. I feel good when it happens, but I know my main focus is to defend and I love that. To win games sometimes I need to get more in attack, and sometimes I need to defend more, but the main thing is to focus on getting the three points every game, and I will manage when to go forward more and when to help the team in defence</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso’s father hints at <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> return for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> full-back]</b> Awesome.

He has very good memories<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on whether a return to Italy could be made at some stage]</b> I don’t know, it’s difficult to say. He still has a three-year contract with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, it doesn’t depend on him, but on the will of the English club. I can only say that my son loves Italy</p>

He was the best free kick taker I have seen in my life, I think. I learned from him in training. I used to hit the ball, like, five metres from goal because I couldn’t reach! But I remember him telling me, ‘When you are 14, 15 years old, you will take free kicks like me’. I couldn’t even imagine that, but today I do my best</p>
