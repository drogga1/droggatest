  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso hits a personal landmark against Leicester City on Saturday]</b> I used to play more forward but in my senior career it is the first time I have scored a brace. I was unlucky not to score again but I am very happy to help the team by scoring goals and I am delighted with the win. We played okay in the first half, the manager asked us to give more in the second half and I think the team played very well after the break. We controlled the game and scored another two goals. Against a good team, it was important to bounce back from that defeat against Tottenham and the team showed that we are not afraid and we are going to fight for every game. There have been a couple of tough weeks after the Tottenham defeat but I think we didn’t play a bad game there and against Leicester, we showed we are still fighting. We have to keep working hard to get another win next week.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso maintains that he did nothing wrong in opening the scoring for Chelsea in their 3-1 victory over Arsenal on Saturday]</b> I jumped a bit higher and got to the ball first, I didn’t even see him <b>[Hector Bellerin]</b> coming so I don’t think it’s a free-kick. I feel sorry for him, he’s a good friend but I didn’t see him. I hope he’s ok.<br /><br />I’m happy for another three points, we played a very good game, we were consistent and we need to keep going. I think we controlled the game for the 90 minutes. We’re a little bit disappointed with the goal we conceded but it was a very good performance from everyone and now we need to keep our focus and concentration. We’re enjoying a good run. Three points against a direct opponent is like six points. It was good to score another goal and with the point we got on Tuesday it’s been a very good week for us</p>

Since I left there I have had no contact with the club and now I am very focused on Chelsea. We have a very important season ahead.<br /><br />The team are playing very well. We have adapted very well to the idea of the coach and we hope to continue this way until the end of the season. We are training a lot and very well. The team has understood perfectly what the coach wants and we are proving that every weekend<br /><br />It is clear that not playing Europe is an advantage over other teams but we are training very well, and I think that’s the most important thing. That’s what is allowing us to stay free of injuries and play with almost the same eleven every weekend. It is not easy to bring the methods of a new manager to the Premier League. We are seeing that with Pep Guardiola and other new coaches. In the Premier League it is not easy to innovate <b>[like Conte is doing with his 3-4-3 system]</b>. But we are doing things well</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso has revealed that he could have joined Barcelona prior to his move to Chelsea]</b> Well, I think there was some conversations <b>[with Barcelona]</b> but the truth is that at that point it was not in my plans to leave Fiorentina. It was only when the interest from Chelsea arrived in the summer when I started to consider to make a change.<br /><br />There were some great teams interested in me in the summer but I decided to join Chelsea because they are a team that I had always liked. I saw a possibility of succeeding here. I had some other offers from other teams from Italy and Spain but when Chelsea came to get me, I did not think twice. Chelsea are a club that had always attracted me. From my early years at Bolton I knew that Chelsea were a great club and the truth is that I was right to come here. Things are going well but I have to continue this way because I think I still can give much more. Now with the tranquility of not having to prove anything I have to keep improving</p>

So happy for that and hopefully more to come.<br /><br /><b>[Chelsea are seven points clear with seven games remaining in the Premier League]</b> It’s going to be tough. Diego <b>[Costa]</b>, Eden <b>[Hazard]</b>, they are having great seasons, scoring so many goals, tough choice that. I’m very happy for that. Everyone tries to give 100 per cent for the team. If you can help with goals or assists then it’s even more important. That’s what we all try to do. It was a very good game from everyone and good to go back to London with three points<br /><br />Diego Costa had another couple of chances to score but no doubt next week he’ll be there again</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea have seven finals left starting with Man United]</b> We knew the Tottenham score before the game, so we knew we could only win. I think the team does well whenever we have pressure on us. We know what we are playing for, motivation is 100 per cent and I think we played a good game. We have seven finals left, every game is going to be massive, we are going to have to play each game as the last one because we need the points to get closer to the title. Every game we win is a strong message for the other teams.<br /><br />We’ve been there almost all season, we are showing we want to be there, we’re playing very good and fighting for it, and that’s what we need keep doing. The group is fantastic. We all know where we are going, we are all going in the same direction, and that’s very important. The starting XI and the players who are not playing so much, the staff are all together and that’s very important. That’s a big thing, and it’s going very well this year<br /><br />I think we saw last week, we defended very well, we were compact together, we are conceding more goals but credit to the other teams as well. They do well and we will try to keep more clean sheets, but there’s always a good team in front us trying to score goals. So we need the same focus, same concentration and onto the next one. We knew it was going to be a very tough game, we controlled it after scoring first but they got that goal and we ended the first half as we started and we came out there in the second half and played a good 45 minutes to get the three points</p>

He had another couple of chances to score against Bournemouth but no doubt next week, he’ll be there again. Is he a big-game player? Yes. Manchester United is going to be a tough game for us but it doesn’t matter who scores, hopefully we will get the three points. We have a week to rest a little bit and then prepare, that’s what we have to be focused on these days</p>

We will have to do the same or more than before to get another win. They’re playing at Anderlecht tonight but they have a big squad, full of good players. They will be hard to beat, no matter who they pick or the fact they’re playing in the Europa League just three days before. We will have to be ready.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso is delighted that he made the decision to leave boyhood club Real Madrid]</b> I lacked the patience to play there. In my final season there, I got my debut but I wanted to play every week. When I had an offer from the Premier League, I had no hesitation. I don’t regret it. When you are a kid, you aren’t mature and you want to get up and play every week. I didn’t do anything wrong. I’m very happy with my career and I want to improve even more. Real Madrid was my home for a long time and I’ve not forgotten it. I grew up there, I met a lot of people and I made my debut. There’s part of me that will always be there, I can’t deny it. To play for the first team was a dream.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if players who leave for abroad are valued less]</b> They’re not valued less, but it’s true that they are not as well known as those who are in Spain<br /><br /><b>[he still believes that he can break into the national squad]</b> I think I can contribute a great deal to the team. But right now, I’m worried about my matches with Chelsea and it’s not a subject that concerns me a great deal because in the end the decision isn’t mine. I can only do what I can on the field, and that’s why I’m trying. To win a ticket for Russia, first I have to win with Chelsea</p>

It is still a long way to go and we have to win every game now.<br /><br />It was a very good minute to score and I am happy to help the team get the three points.

We have important games now in the Premier League, we have to focus on that but then we have to prepare for this game well. We must try to play another good game there and see what happens. I think we controlled the game well. We defended very well and I am a bit disappointed to not take the victory, but we take away the positive stuff. We showed we can play and we can win against a big team like Barcelona. With the draw, it is disappointing. We did the perfect game apart from that mistake but it can happen to anyone. It has happened and now we have to think of the next game and not what has happened. We will have to take all the positive things and put in an extra shift in Barcelona because it will be even more difficult. But we definitely can do it and we will fight until the end<br /><br /><b>[On Andreas Christensen]</b> He is okay. It can happen to everyone in any game. We had to try to play because we can’t just counterattack for 90 minutes and it is just a mistake. It has not been a very good season so far for Chelsea but it has been a good season for him. When we win, we win together; when we draw, we draw together. Now we have another tough match but it will be nice to play 90 minutes in Barcelona and Chelsea will give problems until the last minute, for sure<br /><br />Just a couple of weeks out is not that bad after playing more than 30 games already. I have been working hard to get back today and I am happy to help the team again. It wasn’t a break, it was a little injury, but this can happen and it is good that I can recover very quickly and now I am ready for the next game</p>

We will go to the match with a lot of confidence and belief in what we are capable of doing, especially after the first leg<br /><br />I think it’s an attitude problem and we have to make things clearer and improve quickly, because we have nine matches left and we want to be in the top four. I think that it is difficult, but we have to change the attitude, right? I don’t think we have a problem with quality, we have shown in many matches this season that we can be competitive against any team, like we were against Barcelona a couple of weeks ago. If we don’t reach that kind of level of performance in every match it’s because of our attitude</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso has defended Thibaut Courtois after the goalkeeper’s errors proved costly in Chelsea’s elimination at the hands of Barcelona]</b> I think he is just unlucky. If it happened again 10 times, for sure he doesn’t score. Thibaut is a great goalkeeper and I think it is just an unlucky action. Even in conceding these goals, if we had scored the chance we had <b>[we might have gotten back into the tie]</b>. We had plenty of chances.<br /><br />We hit the post twice in the first leg and twice again today. It is also very unlucky. It is what it is but we have to keep fighting for these last eight games because I think we deserve to play again in this competition next year. We conceded too much for the first two goals. It was too easy for a team like Barcelona, but we had so many chances. I think we showed great character in both games. Today and in the first leg. I think the score is too much but it is fair because they put the ball in and we didn’t. There have been a lot of positives in the two legs against Barcelona and we have to show the same desire in the next games and make sure that we win every game. You saw until the last minutes today that we can play against any team and now we have eight finals. We have to make sure we play in the Champions League next year<br /><br />That’s difficult no? It is the only trophy we have left. At the minute, we can only fight for this after the defeat today. Next season will be another season but definitely FA Cup and top four is what we have to go for. If we play every game like we did against Barcelona <b>[we would be in the top four]</b>, but that’s not the case. That’s another thing that we have to take into consideration and learn from this defeat and get stronger. It is difficult, we have had so many games this year. We have not got as big of a squad maybe. I don’t know, we can only look forward, to try and fight for a spot in the Champions League and win the FA Cup</p>

But I also like to play with the current Sarri system, which is also very similar to the way Luis Enrique plays. In modern football the position, the placement of the team and occupying spaces is important. Luis Enrique insists on this, as does my coach at Chelsea. For my part I am comfortable and adapted to this football. My natural position is left-back in a four-man defence, but you have to be ready to help the team in the way the coach wants</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Marcos Alonso has reflected on his time at Real Madrid]</b> I was 11 or 12 when I had my trial with Real Madrid. My father is a massive Barcelona and Atletico fan because he used to play in those teams. My mum’s family all support Atletico, so it wasn’t easy for them! One day they came and they told me: ‘listen, we got this call from Real Madrid, only if you want, it’s just a trial and you can go and see what happens’. That was during the summer. When I went back to Madrid I did the trial and they asked me to stay. When I signed I was a winger, and then two or three years after I had to play left-back because of injuries. I did very well, and I had a chance to go to the second team and play left-back, and that’s where I stayed.<br /><br />I felt the pressure when I was training with the first team. It was good pressure, a good feeling, but of course, it was pressure. I was training with Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, and I was only 16 or 17 years old. I was going 120 percent! It was a dream come true. The day I had to play for the first team, my debut in La Liga, that was unbelievable, but I remember I was so nervous before coming on. My legs were shaking when the manager, who was Manuel Pellegrini, called me. Six or seven times I had travelled with them, I warmed up, but I didn’t get a chance. But when he called me that day - which was in Santander! - it was an amazing feeling. And I came on for Gonzalo Higuain!</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso is flattered to be linked with the likes of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> Yes <b>[he is happy to hear of interest from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b>. It means I’m doing well if other teams are trying to get in touch. I am very happy here but we will see what happens this summer. First of all, I’m focussing on the final. I am very happy to have four more years here and hopefully I will stay many more years. For me, the path changed. I started very well. Then the manager wanted different things from me. After that, I was trying to do what he wanted and then he told me he wanted to play like I was at the beginning of the season. So maybe that has conditioned a little bit the way of my game. I think I’m settled now. I am very happy at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and looking forward to finishing the season with a win and a cup.<br /><br />It’s been a tough season, to be honest. We have lost important games at some points, but we have also won some games against big teams when we were struggling. For example, we beat the Champions League finalists <b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> and we won against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at home. There have been too many ups and downs, we need more consistency.<br /><br /><b>[There are times when <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans have turned on Alonso during the 2018-19 campaign]</b> Football is like this. The better the team you play for, the more fans follow you and there are millions of coaches and managers around the world! Some of them understand football one way; some of them have another opinion. I am the best to judge when I play well and when I don’t. Of course during the season you play some bad games, but it’s been a good campaign. I’m always looking for more, looking to improve and get better. That’s something inside me, I know I have to work for it. I don’t really care about the critics or when people talk good about me. It can’t affect you. I’m one to trust myself and to look for more. I had a good season and hopefully the next one will be even better<br /><br />That is the standard of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> these days. Everyone is competing very well. They have built very good teams and there is a lot of competition. We want to win a trophy, even if <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are winning or not. We have to think about ourselves, our fans and our families and give them a big satisfaction with a win. Sometimes it is only the small details that make the difference in one season. We have to keep the concentration for the whole season, take our chances to score the goals, defend well as a team. There are so many things we have to focus on for the whole season. It is not easy but that is what we have to aim for. We have a lot of players and a lot of quality in the team, also lots of players on loan who can help <b>[in the event of a transfer ban]</b>. We will see what happens, but I trust this team and we have been doing very good things in the last two or three years and we will fight to keep that position</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso thinks <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s recent history makes it just as important for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">the Blues</a> to win the Europa League as it is for final opponents <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> We aren’t tired with this kind of thing and we have had the days to recover. We are training properly every day. It’s a final. It’s the last chance we have to win a trophy this season, so it is a massive game for us. It is always important for us, for the fans, for the club to win a trophy. Of course, we are preparing to be ready and we are going to go for it. No, I don’t think so <b>[that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> will want it more to get into the Champions League]</b>. We have the same need here at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to win something. In the last few years, we have won more trophies than them and are more used to winning things. I don’t think that is something bad. It is something even better for us. We know what it is and this is another chance and something we all want.<br /><br />To be honest, I don’t care who scores the goals. Of course, I have great memories playing against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and have scored three or four times against them already. But it is a different game. It is a final, so I don’t care who scores. I just want to win and we have to play together as a team and that is the best way to get the win<br /><br /><b>[The 28-year-old is hoping for more luck in Azerbaijan after <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> scored a contentious opening goal for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> at Wembley in a game they went on to win 2-1]</b> Yeah, I think that was a game where we deserved better. We conceded a goal a little bit…how do you say? A bad decision. I don’t know how to explain it. It is another chance. That is the past, we have to think about this one and it doesn’t matter about before. We have to go for it, it is a different game and a new challenge another trophy</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso admits <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have endured a hard time after being stung with a transfer ban]</b> There are many new players who have had their chance and are showing their value. They are doing very well. They have brought very good energy to the team, and that mix with the experience that the older players have, the balance in the team is going really well and we are all enjoying the moment. For the other players who have been here for a long time, it’s also good to keep demonstrating the level of play we are. It’s obviously a hard time when you cannot make signings and you lose good players, but the players here are showing we have the quality to do great things<br /><br /><b>[He added on his input in the final third]</b> It’s not my main focus but of course it’s good to help the team with goals and assists. I feel good when it happens, but I know my main focus is to defend and I love that. To win games sometimes I need to get more in attack, and sometimes I need to defend more, but the main thing is to focus on getting the three points every game, and I will manage when to go forward more and when to help the team in defence</p>
