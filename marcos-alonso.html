  <p><b>[Chelsea left-back Marcos Alonso reveals the steep learning curve he was on during his spell with Italian club Fiorentina]</b> It’s like after <b>[university]</b> when you go to do a master’s <b>[degree]</b>. Italy is like that for defenders</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso shuts down <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> exit talk as he is ‘very happy’ with Blues]</b> Of course. I signed a new contract last year and I’m very happy here. I don’t know if there’s been any contact, you will have to speak to Marina <b>[Granovskaia]</b> about that<br /><br />I have four more years here and I’m very happy. The last three years have been amazing and I want more of that. I want to keep playing and winning things.<br /><br /><b>[Sarri has, however, been succeeded by <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> this summer and Alonso is looking forward to embracing a ‘fresh start’ for all concerned]</b> I think it’s a fresh start for everyone. Last year is part of the past and now I just want to keep working, enjoy playing and to help the team win and get better. Of course I would love to play every minute and to always be in there. Things happen like this and now it’s a new season. I’m very happy, training very well and looking forward to the start of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso admits <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have endured a hard time after being stung with a transfer ban]</b> There are many new players who have had their chance and are showing their value. They are doing very well. They have brought very good energy to the team, and that mix with the experience that the older players have, the balance in the team is going really well and we are all enjoying the moment. For the other players who have been here for a long time, it’s also good to keep demonstrating the level of play we are. It’s obviously a hard time when you cannot make signings and you lose good players, but the players here are showing we have the quality to do great things<br /><br /><b>[He added on his input in the final third]</b> It’s not my main focus but of course it’s good to help the team with goals and assists. I feel good when it happens, but I know my main focus is to defend and I love that. To win games sometimes I need to get more in attack, and sometimes I need to defend more, but the main thing is to focus on getting the three points every game, and I will manage when to go forward more and when to help the team in defence</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso’s father hints at <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> return for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> full-back]</b> Awesome. He always talks about his legendary three years in Florence, says that <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> is a beautiful championship and continues to be very close to Italy because he has many friends there. He has very good memories<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on whether a return to Italy could be made at some stage]</b> I don’t know, it’s difficult to say. He still has a three-year contract with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, it doesn’t depend on him, but on the will of the English club. I can only say that my son loves Italy</p>

He was the best free kick taker I have seen in my life, I think. I learned from him in training. I used to hit the ball, like, five metres from goal because I couldn’t reach! But I remember him telling me, ‘When you are 14, 15 years old, you will take free kicks like me’. I couldn’t even imagine that, but today I do my best</p>
