  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso considers Luis Enrique to be a great coach]</b> Luis Enrique has shown at Barcelona that he is a great coach with many qualities and I believe he would be good for any club, but I do not know him a lot on a personal level.<br /><br />When we face Barca in the Camp Nou we will have to put in a perfect performance to progress to the next round, this is clear. We will go to the match with a lot of confidence and belief in what we are capable of doing, especially after the first leg<br /><br />I think it’s an attitude problem and we have to make things clearer and improve quickly, because we have nine matches left and we want to be in the top four. I think that it is difficult, but we have to change the attitude, right? I don’t think we have a problem with quality, we have shown in many matches this season that we can be competitive against any team, like we were against Barcelona a couple of weeks ago. If we don’t reach that kind of level of performance in every match it’s because of our attitude</p>

But all I can do is give all my support to the family and to Fiorentina. He was an outstanding guy, and a very healthy guy, so I still can’t believe that this has happened. It’s been a difficult day today, I am very sad for what has happened but when you are on the pitch you just have to try not to think about things away from the pitch.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso has defended Thibaut Courtois after the goalkeeper’s errors proved costly in Chelsea’s elimination at the hands of Barcelona]</b> I think he is just unlucky. If it happened again 10 times, for sure he doesn’t score. Thibaut is a great goalkeeper and I think it is just an unlucky action. Even in conceding these goals, if we had scored the chance we had <b>[we might have gotten back into the tie]</b>. We had plenty of chances.<br /><br />We hit the post twice in the first leg and twice again today. It is also very unlucky. It is what it is but we have to keep fighting for these last eight games because I think we deserve to play again in this competition next year. We conceded too much for the first two goals. It was too easy for a team like Barcelona, but we had so many chances. I think we showed great character in both games. Today and in the first leg. I think the score is too much but it is fair because they put the ball in and we didn’t. There have been a lot of positives in the two legs against Barcelona and we have to show the same desire in the next games and make sure that we win every game. You saw until the last minutes today that we can play against any team and now we have eight finals. We have to make sure we play in the Champions League next year<br /><br />That’s difficult no? It is the only trophy we have left. At the minute, we can only fight for this after the defeat today. Next season will be another season but definitely FA Cup and top four is what we have to go for. If we play every game like we did against Barcelona <b>[we would be in the top four]</b>, but that’s not the case. That’s another thing that we have to take into consideration and learn from this defeat and get stronger. It is difficult, we have had so many games this year. We have not got as big of a squad maybe. I don’t know, we can only look forward, to try and fight for a spot in the Champions League and win the FA Cup</p>

I don’t know what would’ve happened if I stayed, I live in the present.<br /><br />In England, after winning the Premier League, it is normal to have a difficult year, especially with the level that Manchester City are maintaining throughout the season.

Alonso denied the charge and further submitted that if found proven the suspension would be excessive, however, this was rejected following Wednesday’s hearing. The incident, which was not seen by the match officials but caught on video, occurred in the 43rd minute of Saturday’s game.</p>

The season starts now<br /><br />I have heard the stadium is really cool and maybe it won’t be as hot there as it has been in England! We hope to put on a good show for the fans.

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso claims to be happy here at Chelsea]</b> I feel good. I’m enjoying the new manager, I’m enjoying my team-mates, I’m happy here at Chelsea. I’m obviously still hungry for more. It’s going to be a tough season, lots of teams are fighting for everything but I want to win all the titles we are playing for. For that we have to work hard and I have to be ready for tough times. It’s never easy to get the points at the beginning of the season and even more with a new manager. We are still on our way to where we want to get. I think we are doing well and getting points but we still have to improve and we still have to play better. If we do this we will be up there fighting for every title.<br /><br />That’s why I came to Chelsea. When you come to one of the top teams in the world with some great players, you can fight for that spot and that’s what I try to do. I want to keep improving and to work hard to be one of the best. I want to score more goals, I want to give more assists, I want to do more tackles. Everything I can do to help is good for the team and good for myself</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Marcos Alonso says he will extend his contract at the club in the coming days]</b> I am very calm and very happy at Chelsea, and the club must also be happy with me because, although I still have two years left on my contract, they have offered me an extension. We are talking about it and the talks to renew are already advanced. If everything goes well, I think I will renew before the end of this month - in the coming days<br /><br />My father takes care of that as he is the one who leads the negotiations. I am 27 years old, I still have two more years and I am going to extend my contract. What concerns me is to play as well as possible to win matches and titles with Chelsea and with the national team. I’m calm with my contract<br /><br /><b>[On Antonio Conte and Sarri’s system]</b> I feel comfortable with both systems. I also had the three-at-the-back system in Italy, and it went very well for me. I liked playing in lanes, especially because of the offensive opportunities you have in that position. But I also like to play with the current Sarri system, which is also very similar to the way Luis Enrique plays. In modern football the position, the placement of the team and occupying spaces is important. Luis Enrique insists on this, as does my coach at Chelsea. For my part I am comfortable and adapted to this football. My natural position is left-back in a four-man defence, but you have to be ready to help the team in the way the coach wants</p>

  <p><b>[Ross Barkley is capable of blossoming into a star for England]</b> Even at the World Cup England, despite playing well, were aware that they didn’t really have that kind of player, someone in the middle who played and made others play, who used the ball. He’s a great player. He showed it not just <b>[on Monday]</b> but against Croatia too: he showed that he can be a great player. I hope he keeps improving and that he helps us at Chelsea to stay near the top. Last year he had a long time out injured, the first year with us at Chelsea and I have no doubt that with confidence and minutes he is a great player and I hope that he can help us a lot for the rest of the season<br /><br /><b>[Spain complained that they were denied a penalty when England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford lost the ball to Rodrigo]</b> He robs him off the ball, he’s ahead of him and if he doesn’t grab him, then Rodrigo has a clear goal. So it’s a penalty and red card, but I don’t like to talk about the referees</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Marcos Alonso has reflected on his time at Real Madrid]</b> I was 11 or 12 when I had my trial with Real Madrid. My father is a massive Barcelona and Atletico fan because he used to play in those teams. My mum’s family all support Atletico, so it wasn’t easy for them! One day they came and they told me: ‘listen, we got this call from Real Madrid, only if you want, it’s just a trial and you can go and see what happens’. That was during the summer. When I went back to Madrid I did the trial and they asked me to stay. When I signed I was a winger, and then two or three years after I had to play left-back because of injuries. I did very well, and I had a chance to go to the second team and play left-back, and that’s where I stayed.<br /><br />I felt the pressure when I was training with the first team. It was good pressure, a good feeling, but of course, it was pressure. I was training with Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, and I was only 16 or 17 years old. I was going 120 percent! It was a dream come true. The day I had to play for the first team, my debut in La Liga, that was unbelievable, but I remember I was so nervous before coming on. My legs were shaking when the manager, who was Manuel Pellegrini, called me. Six or seven times I had travelled with them, I warmed up, but I didn’t get a chance. But when he called me that day - which was in Santander! - it was an amazing feeling. And I came on for Gonzalo Higuain!</p>

  <p><b>[Marcos Alonso is flattered to be linked with the likes of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> Yes <b>[he is happy to hear of interest from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b>. It means I’m doing well if other teams are trying to get in touch. I am very happy here but we will see what happens this summer. First of all, I’m focussing on the final. I am very happy to have four more years here and hopefully I will stay many more years. For me, the path changed. I started very well. Then the manager wanted different things from me. After that, I was trying to do what he wanted and then he told me he wanted to play like I was at the beginning of the season. So maybe that has conditioned a little bit the way of my game. I think I’m settled now. I am very happy at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and looking forward to finishing the season with a win and a cup.<br /><br />It’s been a tough season, to be honest. We have lost important games at some points, but we have also won some games against big teams when we were struggling. For example, we beat the Champions League finalists <b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> and we won against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at home. There have been too many ups and downs, we need more consistency.<br /><br /><b>[There are times when <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans have turned on Alonso during the 2018-19 campaign]</b> Football is like this. The better the team you play for, the more fans follow you and there are millions of coaches and managers around the world! Some of them understand football one way; some of them have another opinion. I am the best to judge when I play well and when I don’t. Of course during the season you play some bad games, but it’s been a good campaign. I’m always looking for more, looking to improve and get better. That’s something inside me, I know I have to work for it. I don’t really care about the critics or when people talk good about me. It can’t affect you. I’m one to trust myself and to look for more. I had a good season and hopefully the next one will be even better<br /><br />That is the standard of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> these days. Everyone is competing very well. They have built very good teams and there is a lot of competition. We want to win a trophy, even if <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are winning or not. We have to think about ourselves, our fans and our families and give them a big satisfaction with a win. Sometimes it is only the small details that make the difference in one season. We have to keep the concentration for the whole season, take our chances to score the goals, defend well as a team. There are so many things we have to focus on for the whole season. It is not easy but that is what we have to aim for. We have a lot of players and a lot of quality in the team, also lots of players on loan who can help <b>[in the event of a transfer ban]</b>. We will see what happens, but I trust this team and we have been doing very good things in the last two or three years and we will fight to keep that position</p>
