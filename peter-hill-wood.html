  <p><b>[Wenger accused of outstaying Arsenal welcome by the man who appointed him]</b> I clearly am not very happy about what is going on. I think that there probably ought to be a change of management. He has done fabulously well, it is just he has overstayed his welcome. I find it very sad because he was the great love of many and then it <b>[overstaying his welcome]</b> has destroyed it all.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger has made 100 per cent the right decision in stepping down at Arsenal]</b> I think he has made 100 per cent the right decision. He has given us a hell of a run, he has been frightfully successful and I thought it was time he stepped down. I think he has found a very sensible way of doing it. It is the right time and the right thing to do<br /><br />He is going as a hero. If he hung around people would have gotten upset and he would have undone an awful lot of the good work he has done in the last 20 years, which would have been very sad. Human beings can be very weird and some of them do slightly lose their heads</p>
