<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Over the years footballers have used countless excuses to explain away late showings at training sessions - but Guillermo Marino’s claim that his soul was removed by extra-terrestrials on the way to practice surely sets a new benchmark for players everywhere]</b> Guillermo says that he arrived late to one training because he was abducted by aliens. He gave us the entire explanation of what he felt and the rest of it. There are cases where the player says: ‘I left and I came back two days later because I was kidnapped by aliens’. But Guille is not that kind of player. Guille was a very proper guy. Everyone knows him<br /><br />He started to explain that he was suddenly lost and abducted by aliens. He explained that they take out your soul, analyse it and all the while on the journey they are looking after you. He said something like that. Honestly I believe in aliens. He gave a great explanation and we’ll have to believe him. So other types of channels will have to call him so he can tell it better. But in any case: he was abducted by aliens. I don’t know if Guille would have told <b>[Sampaoli]</b> the same story, honestly. They must have had a chat afterwards. But knowing Guille, I think he must have believed him. What can you say? This is worthy of the Discovery Channel or something</p>
