  <p><b>[David Silva feels like he has spent an eternity at Manchester City]</b> I have been here for an eternity and I am happy. It is vibrant and very demanding football. I like lots of things, the competitiveness every weekend. There are lots of good things here and the British fans are amazing. But personally I just try to work day to day - I do not get obsessed with thinking about titles.<br /><br />I’m always proud to wear the colours of Spain. The truth is that this new phase with them is very exciting. We maintain the same motivation with the group and this is what is important in order to do great things and bring more happy moments</p>

  <p><b>[Spain midfielder David Silva indicated after the victory over Slovakia that he felt that the quick-passing football of Spain’s all-conquering team of 2008 was back]</b> I hope we qualify and we’ll see what happens in the tournament. All matches are important, and Macedonia too. We are a team of touch, and we’ve shown that since 2008. We always play well, but it is not easy. Teams are enclosed and it is very complicated. The fact that we scored early against Slovakia helped us.</p>

When I was a kid I just loved how he played the game. I was transfixed watching him play, and I liked his personality too and so for me, he was a real example. Also there’s Juan Carlos Valeron as well because he’s from my part of the world and a top quality player as well.

After all the years I’ve been in the game and with all my experience, I’ve really learned a lot in these four or five months with him. Even when you think you can’t learn much more about the game, you can and do in fact learn more by looking at things in a different light. He truly is an exceptional coach</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City star David Silva has confirmed he will no longer represent Spain at international level]</b> It is not easy, after everything I have experienced, to sit down and write this letter. There have been days and weeks of reflection and analysis to make the decision to finish my time in the Spain national team. Without a doubt it is one of the hardest decisions in my career. The national team has given me everything and has allowed me to grow as a player and as a person from my first days in the youth set-up. I leave with pride after playing 125 games and scoring 35 goals in a 12-year spell where we lifted the World Cup and two European Championships.<br /><br />I leave happy with all I have achieved, experienced and dreamed with a team that will be remembered forever, and I have ended an era filled with emotion from all those moments that come to my mind, like the figure of Luis Aragones, a teacher that none of us will ever forget.<br /><br />I cannot leave without thanking all of my team-mates, the coaches that had faith in me and the RFEF employees that do everything to make our lives easier. I also want to thank my family for their support over the years, without their help I would never have been able to form part of this team. And of course, the fans who have always given me their support and respect every time I wore the Spain shirt. Thank you, good luck and farewell!</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City star David Silva has admitted that he may have signed his final professional contract]</b> I have two more years on my contract here. I feel great here. I want to stay until the end of my contract and then I’ll see how I feel physically and mentally to carry on.<br /><br /><b>[He had shown off son Mateo]</b> It was very special. Besides the milestone of it being my 250th game and the goal I scored, having my son there healthy at the Etihad Stadium is something that I will always remember<br /><br /><b>[On Vincent Kompany]</b> He’s a good captain because he always focuses on the details. He always looks after the best interests of the team. He’s been here for a long time and I think he gives a lot to the team. He is an outstanding player. He gives an additional boost to the team</p>

  <p><b>[David Silva says Manchester City finally get respect from Manchester United]</b> If you are telling me that statistic, it is a good statistic that we haven’t finished below United since he <b>[Ferguson]</b> left, so maybe that is good evidence. The derby has changed since my time here. A key turning point was the 6-1 at their place <b>[in 2011]</b> - I think things have changed since then. When they come to play us here or anywhere, they probably have higher respect for us than before. The respect is always there, no matter who you are playing, but maybe now, the way in which City are viewed by United has changed and maybe we have got the upper hand.<br /><br />Vinny’s goal was really important. That game was key in that we went on to win the title. But the 6-1, for the fact that it was at Old Trafford, too, was probably even more important. That was one of those games that goes down in history<br /><br />I can’t make a direct comparison because I have never played for Barca or Real, so haven’t played in a Clasico. But there is a huge impact from this game, whether you do badly or well, whatever the result of the derby, it has a massive impact. United are a little bit off pace maybe, but they have always had a great side and they still have a great team now and I’m sure that, come the end of the season, they won’t be too far away. But there are lots of important games. You look at the teams who are flying high, like Chelsea and Liverpool, so games involving them are important. You have Arsenal and Spurs too, so that is what is special about the Premier League, there are lots of top games involved</p>

  <p><b>[David Silva reveals the challenge he had in playing last season, while his baby son Mateo fought for his life after being born prematurely last December]</b> You know, I don’t know <b>[how I played on last season]</b> and I ask myself that sometimes. Maybe it was a form of release when I was out on the field, where you would just put things to one side. You could forget what was happening and enjoy being on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[David Silva believes Manchester City can improve on their history-making season last year]</b> The club is making progress and buying players, but keeping the old guard. I think it is a mix of old players and young players so that is a good mix. I think it is good and the club is doing well, which you can see on the pitch. This season, maybe we can do better than last season.<br /><br />I adapted so well because the people here helped me a lot, so I am grateful to them. That is one of the reasons, the other one is that my family are always with me and behind me and I am so strong in my head. It is always there and I am working a lot every day. When you work and you give everything, things become easier. It was tough at the beginning because I wasn’t fit. We won the World Cup <b>[in 2010]</b> and I had only two weeks to rest and when I came here, I realised how tough this league was. It was physically strong so I had to get fit. I think it was about two months and then I scored the Blackpool goal <b>[his first Premier League goal during a 3-2 win]</b> and my confidence increased<br /><br />I don’t have a plan <b>[for the future]</b>. Now, I just want to enjoy it more because I’m 33 and someday, football will be over for me. I want to enjoy life more after what happened with my son, and enjoy time with my family and friends. I don’t think too much, I just play every game and try in every training. I don’t think about the future. Maybe more now because I’m older, but before I just enjoyed playing and working hard and that’s it. This club is progressing well and they want to sign good players so someone will come in to replace me. Another year, playing at a high level and winning titles, it is not easy in England so that is why I think they like me. When you do something which is not good for your body, you can feel it more <b>[as you get older]</b>, but in my head, it is still the same so when this is not going well, there is a problem. For now, it is still fresh so I’m feeling good</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City midfielder David Silva has claimed that local rivals Manchester United have huge respect]</b> We had a huge amount of respect for them and I think you could tell,” Silva told City’s official website. Then, after the second year, everything started to change and I think now the respect for us is enormous. The <b>[derby]</b> is getting bigger and bigger. These games have something added now, whoever wins will see the effect all around the world. Honestly, the games are getting better by the year, and we hope it keeps going like that. The first derbies were complicated, especially in the first year. We drew at home and lost the other one at <b>[Old Trafford]</b>. But from that point on, everything started to change a little bit and nowadays they have huge respect for us.<br /><br />I think that, on balance, the derby lands in our favour. We have won more games. There are many memories because we have won a lot of games. I’ve been lucky enough to score some myself. We know the derby is very important for the fans and for us too because when you win this kind of game it gives you a morale boost. We need the fans’ support, as usual. We know it is a very important game for them and we will try to give everything we have, as we’ve been doing, and hopefully, we can win the game</p>

  <p><b>[David Silva has backed <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> to fill his boots when he leaves <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at the end of next season]</b> I’m sure he’s going to be a fantastic player. He’s a very nice man and he will be a good replacement for me. Apart from his natural skills, he’s a very competitive person. He always wants to win and that makes a very good footballer. When you’re young, you always ask people with experience. I’ve given him lots of advice, like how to move on the pitch. He’s taken the information in and he’s getting better day by day. He reminds me of myself when I was young - especially how he is as a person. He’s very quiet but always there, competing. He hates losing. The best advice I can give him is always stay calm. Whatever happens in football, the highs and lows, always keep calm.<br /><br /><b>[Silva’s announcement comes in the wake of <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a>’s decision to swap City for his boyhood club Anderlecht]</b> It’s going to be very difficult to replace a player like Vinnie, on the pitch and off it. He was an excellent warrior for City. But with the new generation we will find another one, another Vinnie. You always need experienced footballers around to help you. But City’s future is in safe hands with <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a>, <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>, <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> and <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> there</p>
