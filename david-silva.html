When I was a kid I just loved how he played the game. I was transfixed watching him play, and I liked his personality too and so for me, he was a real example. Also there’s Juan Carlos Valeron as well because he’s from my part of the world and a top quality player as well. He plays the game the way I like it, and has great quality on the ball.<br /><br /><b>[David Silva insists that he continues to work hard on his game at City under <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>, a coach he considers to be one of the finest around]</b> You learn an awful lot. After all the years I’ve been in the game and with all my experience, I’ve really learned a lot in these four or five months with him. Even when you think you can’t learn much more about the game, you can and do in fact learn more by looking at things in a different light. He truly is an exceptional coach</p>

But, I think everyone needs to talk about it as a team and as a club. It will be spoken about when everyone comes back. I think we need to do that together because it’s really important job not only on the pitch but off it.</p>

  <p><b>[David Silva has backed <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> to fill his boots when he leaves <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> at the end of next season]</b> I’m sure he’s going to be a fantastic player. He’s a very nice man and he will be a good replacement for me. Apart from his natural skills, he’s a very competitive person. He always wants to win and that makes a very good footballer. When you’re young, you always ask people with experience. I’ve given him lots of advice, like how to move on the pitch. He’s taken the information in and he’s getting better day by day. He reminds me of myself when I was young - especially how he is as a person. He’s very quiet but always there, competing. He hates losing. The best advice I can give him is always stay calm. Whatever happens in football, the highs and lows, always keep calm.<br /><br /><b>[Silva’s announcement comes in the wake of <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vincent Kompany</a>’s decision to swap City for his boyhood club Anderlecht]</b> It’s going to be very difficult to replace a player like Vinnie, on the pitch and off it. He was an excellent warrior for City. But with the new generation we will find another one, another Vinnie. You always need experienced footballers around to help you. But City’s future is in safe hands with <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a>, <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>, <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> and <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> there</p>

After that, I don’t know. It depends how I feel physically and mentally.<br /><br />I’ve always said that I’d like to play for Las Palmas - my local team.

Not only this season, but all of the seasons before, I wanted to win it with my team-mates. We didn’t, so it will be important match.

  <p><b>[David Silva has revealed his long-term future is on hold during the coronavirus pandemic, but he will not go back on his decision to leave <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> Everything is on standby, there’s nothing for now. My family ask me all the time but my answer is that everything is stopped. I’m back in training again and looking at places where I feel I can be at 100 per cent. Some friends text me with stories saying I’m going to this place or this other place, but they actually know more than me. Honestly, now I’m waiting that we go through all this situation<br /><br />When I say something, I go forward with it. That’s how I feel it. I’ve had 10 years in Manchester and I’ve accomplished what I wanted to. My era ends here, but I will always have this club in my heart for everything I’ve lived here. From the first moment I’ve been treated in an incredible way. Here in Manchester you are really respected, people show me a lot of adoration. But now my family and myself need another challenge. To play football, there is a perfect atmosphere. And to live as a footballer too, it’s a calm life over here. The only bad point is the weather but you can actually feel really good here. Those 10 years have even gone very fast now that I look back.<br /><br /><b>[The Champions League is the one major medal missing from his collection and he could yet have one more shot at it, if the competition is restarted]</b> It’s going to be a bit weird. We’ll have to wait for what they tell us and try to get there in the best condition. I’d love to win it.</p>
