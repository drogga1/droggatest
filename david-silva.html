When I was a kid I just loved how he played the game. I was transfixed watching him play, and I liked his personality too and so for me, he was a real example. Also there’s Juan Carlos Valeron as well because he’s from my part of the world and a top quality player as well. He plays the game the way I like it, and has great quality on the ball.<br /><br /><b>[David Silva insists that he continues to work hard on his game at City under <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>, a coach he considers to be one of the finest around]</b> You learn an awful lot. After all the years I’ve been in the game and with all my experience, I’ve really learned a lot in these four or five months with him. Even when you think you can’t learn much more about the game, you can and do in fact learn more by looking at things in a different light. He truly is an exceptional coach</p>

  <p><b>[David Silva reveals the challenge he had in playing last season, while his baby son Mateo fought for his life after being born prematurely last December]</b> You know, I don’t know <b>[how I played on last season]</b> and I ask myself that sometimes. Maybe it was a form of release when I was out on the field, where you would just put things to one side. You could forget what was happening and enjoy being on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Wolves vs Manchester City. David Silva is thought to be a frontrunner, while Kevin De Bruyne is also a contender, and the latter has admitted that it would be a great honour to wear the armband for the Citizens]</b> If the team wants me to be captain I will gladly accept it. But, I think everyone needs to talk about it as a team and as a club. It will be spoken about when everyone comes back. I think we need to do that together because it’s really important job not only on the pitch but off it.</p>

  <p><b>[David Silva is in no rush to decide his long-term future with the midfielder focused on his final season at Manchester City]</b> Ten years for me is enough, it’s the perfect time. Initially the club were talking about two years <b>[contract extension]</b> but I decided to sign another one so I finished at 10 years. It completes the cycle. It’s a nice round figure. I can never see myself playing against City for another team. So 10 years - that’s it!</p>

In this case it would be Sergio. I’ve known him a long time, he’s a leader and would be good for us<br /><br /><b>[City are searching for a maiden Champions League trophy]</b> It’s very important. Not only this season, but all of the seasons before, I wanted to win it with my team-mates. We didn’t, so it will be important match. I believe the second leg at home is better for us because it’s with our people. We will need a good match and a good result</p>

  <p><b>[David Silva has revealed his long-term future is on hold during the coronavirus pandemic, but he will not go back on his decision to leave Manchester City]</b> Everything is on standby, there’s nothing for now. My family ask me all the time but my answer is that everything is stopped. I’m back in training again and looking at places where I feel I can be at 100 per cent. Some friends text me with stories saying I’m going to this place or this other place, but they actually know more than me. Honestly, now I’m waiting that we go through all this situation<br /><br />When I say something, I go forward with it. That’s how I feel it. I’ve had 10 years in Manchester and I’ve accomplished what I wanted to. My era ends here, but I will always have this club in my heart for everything I’ve lived here. From the first moment I’ve been treated in an incredible way. Here in Manchester you are really respected, people show me a lot of adoration. But now my family and myself need another challenge. To play football, there is a perfect atmosphere. And to live as a footballer too, it’s a calm life over here. The only bad point is the weather but you can actually feel really good here. Those 10 years have even gone very fast now that I look back.<br /><br /><b>[The Champions League is the one major medal missing from his collection and he could yet have one more shot at it, if the competition is restarted]</b> It’s going to be a bit weird. We’ll have to wait for what they tell us and try to get there in the best condition. I’d love to win it.</p>

  <p><b>[Man City legend David Silva includes <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> rivals in list of greatest team-mates and opponents]</b> The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is a top competition and during these 10 years I played alongside and against very good players. Naming one would be unfair. In my team, Kun <b>[Aguero]</b> has scored a lot of goals and very important ones, Yaya <b>[Toure’]</b>s role was fundamental when he was at his peak, Vinnie <b>[Kompany]</b> because the hierarchy he had on the team and on the defence, <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> too. When I first arrived, Joe, Gareth Barry, <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a>. They were great players, but they also made things easier for me, they really helped me to settle<br /><br />I can name a lot of rivals too. <b>[Frank]</b> <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>, who was my team-mate too, his stats were amazing and he was a great man too. There are a lot of Spanish players too like <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a>, Cesc <b>[Fabregas]</b>, who has also done great things in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Players that are part of the competition like <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a>, <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a>, the Neville brothers. They were all fantastic players and very passionate for their club and the national team too</p>

  <p><b>[Before the start of the current campaign, Silva stated 2019-20 would be his final season in England]</b> I will say one thing, I am moving forward. I am sorry, I have been here 10 years and I have fulfilled what I wanted. The cycle closes here, but I will always keep this club in mind for everything I have lived. From the first moment people have treated me incredibly. Here they have a great respect for you, people give admiration towards you. Now my family and I need another challenge</p>
