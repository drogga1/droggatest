  <p><b>[<a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> star Houssem Aouar is keen on playing under <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> coach <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> but is in no rush to leave the <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> club]</b> It is a great European club and all players have this urge to play for the biggest European clubs, which in addition is led by <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>, who for me is a reference as a coach. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> has seen everything before. It is extremely good to play his teams and that’s what I like, his way of seeing football.<br /><br /><b>[Aouar does not appear desperate for an immediate move]</b> I’m still under contract with <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. I would like to leave a mark on the history of this club. After this season there is a new direction, a new coach <b>[<a href="sylvinho.html">Sylvinho</a>]</b>. We will have to sit down and discuss the role I can have. I’m ready to have a technical leadership role. I’m a technical leader in the field and especially as a leader in the locker room, so there we go, we will discuss and then we will make decisions with the club</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> midfielder Houssem Aouar says he is not thinking about leaving the <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> side]</b> I’m not thinking about by future. I’d rather think about the weeks to come. They will be important for <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> and for us. I still have a lot to bring to the team and I’m trying not to pollute my mind by staying focused on what happens on the park<br /><br />No-one saw us playing a match like that but we did it. We had belief from the start and collectively we surpassed ourselves. We can’t get carried away. I think that we’ve given ourselves a chance and we’re going to try to play our game and not to defend because if we do that, it could get very complicated<br /><br />We have to win this match. There’s going to be a lot at stake, even if neither side is where they should be in the league</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> midfielder Houssem Aouar says he is proud that <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> interest]</b> I’ve listened to it all with a good deal of pride, but I repeat, I’m going to try not to pollute my mind. There’s a great end to the season to come with the club. We can win a title, eliminate a great team like <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and we still believe that we can finish in the top three, so we’re going to focus on that.<br /><br />I’m very satisfied with the performances I have produced lately, but there a lot of important matches to come with the team and I am 100% focused on them. It all depends on how I perform on the field. It’s true that the French team are struggling a bit due to injuries or lack of playing time, but they are very big players who bring a lot to their clubs. I watch them like any football supporter, but I’m focused on what I can do</p>
