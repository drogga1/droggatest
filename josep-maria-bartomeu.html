Once the action got under way, the forward’s every touch was whistled. Then, when he went to take a corner early in the second half, the north stand really made their feelings towards him known, unanimously bellowing: ‘Griezmann, you bast*rd, get out of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>!’. All we were missing was a pig’s head. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> president Josep Maria Bartomeu was hit hardest by <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a>’s U-turn; the World Cup winner was meant to be his stellar summer signing.

  <p><b>[Bartomeu congratulated <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> for their ruling following the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> announcement while stating his support of FFP rules]</b> It is a club in which there are traditions, owned by 144,000 members, and it is a club in which democratic principles and freedom of expression are held deep within. It is a club run with rigour, always. In this regard, we thank <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>, who in recent years has been so sure to follow up on Financial Fair Play. At <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, we have been following it and we have regular investigations or we have meetings at <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> to explain how we are doing it. From here we want to support <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> for all the good it does in football</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> president Bartomeu admits <a href="martin-braithwaite.html">Martin Braithwaite</a> transfer unfair on Leganes]</b> We have paid the clause following the regulations, although we believe that it should be revised because it is not fair that Leganes cannot now sign anyone. After analysing different players, we chose Martin. We believe it will help us win the two remaining titles.<br /><br />I am very excited about the arrival of a new player and we hope he will help us in a league that we want to win and that is very open. He will give us strength. We had a long-term injured player like <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Dembele</a>, in addition to <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>. The technical team has studied players and we hope <a href="martin-braithwaite.html">Braithwaite</a> can debut quickly. He has signed for the next four and a half years and comes to help now and for the future</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> won’t leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in the summer as Argentine superstar decides not to activate exit clause]</b> Surely it will be the wish of all parties, if he feels strong and ambitious, to extend this contract indefinitely. Ultimately it is he who must decide. He has earned the right to decide when he will stop playing football. But he wants to finish his playing career at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. Over the next two or three seasons our leader will continue to be <a href="lionel-messi.html">Leo Messi</a>. There’s no doubt that he is still young, still strong. He is still ambitious.
