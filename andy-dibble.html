  <p>[Claudio Bravo’s worrying form in front of goal could be arrested with the help of a sports psychologist] The pace of football in this country is so much faster than in La Liga. He’s finding how sad and lonely our position can be - that is why he needs real help now. Guardiola needs to have talks with him and the goalkeeping coach and create a plan of action. He has to try and do all he can to help him and using a sports psychologist would be a good idea. Claudio is only 33, he still has a lot of years left in him. What he needs is help - guidance and hard work on the training ground and support off it.</p>

  <p>[Ederson is the world’s best goalkeeper] Ederson is the best in the Premier League for me. He’s so calm and composed and there’s none better in my opinion. I watched him against Newport on a poor, bumpy pitch where he was getting balls pinged at him continually to his feet and he was dealing with everything with no problem. It was a like a poor Sunday League pitch, and he was always available, wanting the ball. Alisson and Kepa are great keepers, too, but Ederson has everything and he is the world’s best<br /><br />It would be an interesting project! With a keeper like that, you’d just keep him ticking over whereas you’d focus on the No.2 and No.3 keepers so that they are ready to go if needed. I don’t think there’s much you could teach a talent like Ederson</p>
