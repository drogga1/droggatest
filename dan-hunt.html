  <p><b>[FC Dallas president hopes to announce designated player signing this week]</b> You don’t ever want the window to close, but yes we have expectations. I always tell our fans, you should expect from us that we’re going to win silverware every year. If you don’t believe that, then we’re not doing our job to compete. I have expectations to win more this year.<br /><br />We were the 11th-highest spender last year when you include transfer fees, which is something that’s never really talked about in the league and I think we will, with a 20-25 percent increase in our spending this year, will move up from there. Now, I don’t know where we’ll finish up because it takes a little bit of time, but we have a very good opportunity here and my brother and I have committed to winning and that’s the players that we’re bringing in here<br /><br />In the end, it’s a fine deal and we’ve already reinvested all of the proceeds plus more that we received. Obviously the league shares in some of the revenue, but we’ve already outspent what we’ve received in that, so we’re getting prepared for the 2017 season. It looks like our payroll increase through designated payroll expenditures is gong to be 20-25 percent higher than it was in 2016, but we’re in this window now where we’ve had success in 2016 and we want more championships in 2017<br /><br />Hopefully we’re going to fill that last DP place this week, so we will be full and we will have spent every dollar of TAM <b>[targeted allocation money]</b> and potentially with one other iteration we will also have spent most of our allocation money. We’ll still have some remaining, but we’re actually working on one last thing with allocation money. I would say we’re maxed at the cap or we’ll be close. We always retain some allocation money and we have an open roster spot for a summer move. But for us, with Mauro Diaz coming back in the summer, we kind of look at that as our summer signings. We’re bringing back a MLS Best XI player in the summer and his recovery, the last I checked he was about 45 days ahead of schedule<br /><br />It’s not going to be an easy walk, but it’s of extremely high importance to this club to be competitive and I told Oscar my stated goals, one of them was to win this tournament this year. I know he’s focused on it, he’s very pleased with our offseason signings and the challenge is coming into our preseason playing that tournament. That always has been a difficult for Major League Soccer. I wll say this: This will be the best year of play, I think, in the league. I think we’re going to see a significant step up in Major League Soccer. I’ve been following the acquisitions across the league. I think fans of Major League Soccer and fans of FC Dallas are going to see a tremendous year of soccer</p>

  <p><b>[Luchi Gonzalez named FC Dallas head coach]</b> Since joining FC Dallas, Luchi has proven himself to be a championship-caliber coach within our Academy who has incredible knowledge of the game on every level. During our exhaustive head coaching search, it was clear that his philosophical approach to the game and love for this organization make him the right choice to guide the future of our first team</p>

  <p><b>[FC Dallas built around developing the next generation]</b> We gave every other candidate an honest look because you want to hear what they have to say, hear their perspectives or their ideas. We came back and we both said, ‘It’s Luchi.</p>

  <p><b>[Robben’s potential next destinations]</b> We have an open international slot and salary space to bring a Bayern player on loan if we need one. It’s always complicated. Your positional needs change almost daily. … As we get closer to the summer, we’ll address. If it’s not for this summer, then it has to be for 2020. Those are two global superstars, I’ve admired them over the years. The success that pair has had is unbelievable. If MLS is something of interest to them, I think both would do very well. Once they get on the field, they beat people with superior talent and score goals. Who doesn’t want that for FC Dallas?</p>

  <p><b>[Dan Hunt, the FCD owner who hired Luchi Gonzalez this offseason and whose family also owns the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs and a portion of the NBA’s Chicago Bulls]</b> Because soccer is so diverse, the candidate pool we had was very diverse. The NFL mindset is that we need to make sure that all doors are open for minorities to have opportunities to interview. You’re specifically talking about the <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> Rule, which I think is a great rule that has provided people opportunities to shine when they might not have had the opportunity. That’s good.<br /><br />We have such a diverse workforce in this country, and so many languages are spoken in the game of soccer. There were a lot of candidates. Does that door need to be more open for coaches of African descent or from North Africa or the Middle East? Yes, I think so. Without question</p>
