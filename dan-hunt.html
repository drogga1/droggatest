  <p><b>[Luchi Gonzalez named FC Dallas head coach]</b> Since joining FC Dallas, Luchi has proven himself to be a championship-caliber coach within our Academy who has incredible knowledge of the game on every level. During our exhaustive head coaching search, it was clear that his philosophical approach to the game and love for this organization make him the right choice to guide the future of our first team</p>

  <p><b>[FC Dallas built around developing the next generation]</b> We gave every other candidate an honest look because you want to hear what they have to say, hear their perspectives or their ideas. We came back and we both said, ‘It’s Luchi.</p>

  <p><b>[Robben’s potential next destinations]</b> We have an open international slot and salary space to bring a Bayern player on loan if we need one. It’s always complicated. Your positional needs change almost daily. … As we get closer to the summer, we’ll address. If it’s not for this summer, then it has to be for 2020. Those are two global superstars, I’ve admired them over the years. The success that pair has had is unbelievable. If MLS is something of interest to them, I think both would do very well. Once they get on the field, they beat people with superior talent and score goals. Who doesn’t want that for FC Dallas?</p>

  <p><b>[Dan Hunt, the FCD owner who hired Luchi Gonzalez this offseason and whose family also owns the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs and a portion of the NBA’s Chicago Bulls]</b> Because soccer is so diverse, the candidate pool we had was very diverse. The NFL mindset is that we need to make sure that all doors are open for minorities to have opportunities to interview. You’re specifically talking about the <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> Rule, which I think is a great rule that has provided people opportunities to shine when they might not have had the opportunity. That’s good.<br /><br />We have such a diverse workforce in this country, and so many languages are spoken in the game of soccer. There were a lot of candidates. Does that door need to be more open for coaches of African descent or from North Africa or the Middle East? Yes, I think so. Without question</p>
