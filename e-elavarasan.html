  <p>[E. Elavarasan admits that for newcomers like PKNS FC to reach the top five would be tough] This season it will be tough for us. The target is to finish among the top five, and also to win at least one trophy in 2017. When you look at the teams in Super League, there will be teams that usually will finish at the top and teams that will finish top two or three every season. So for newcomers like us, such a target is really tough but we will try our best. When you have high targets, the players will do their best to reach it. Every team will have similar target like ours, so there’s no pressure on us, said the coach following.<br /><br />[On Safee Sali] Safee’s partnership with Patrick is getting better. He’s getting back the competitiveness as a player. He knows he will be in the first eleven so he’s getting back his form. Patrick can also do a good job for us upfront. He is used to our style. But for the two Argentinian players, Gonzalo Soto and Lucas Espindola, it might take some time for them to settle down<br /><br />[When asked whether the problem with their venue is disrupting the team’s preparation] We need to start well, but with this kind of problem, we are like nomads. Others have their own home grounds and home support but for us, everywhere [we play] is like an away game. We just need a good place and we will wait for the management to decide. I have no problems if we have to play in the late afternoon</p>

  <p>[PKNS head coach E Elavarasan is confident forward Safee Sali will get to his best form in the next few matches] I think he [Safee] can put in more effort we know what he is capable of. He hasn’t been playing for awhile. He got one or two chances but we can see the whole team are yet to settle down. This will take time but we know what he can do so maybe next game we can improve.<br /><br />For now, we are yet to get the best out of them. We can see some weaknesses especially when they were in front of the box, and they were rusty with their movements. But we can see the errors, so we can improve and we are confident that it will be better in the next game<br /><br />[Elavarasan said the team tried to find the equaliser] We tried to find the equaliser. Of course, when we went forward, Felda will have a lot of space to attack but overall, without our full line-up, there are still a lot that we can improve. We still lack understanding when going forward. We played better in the second half and created a lot of opportunities to score goals</p>
