  <p><b>[E. Elavarasan admits that for newcomers like PKNS FC to reach the top five would be tough]</b> This season it will be tough for us. The target is to finish among the top five, and also to win at least one trophy in 2017. When you look at the teams in Super League, there will be teams that usually will finish at the top and teams that will finish top two or three every season. So for newcomers like us, such a target is really tough but we will try our best. When you have high targets, the players will do their best to reach it. Every team will have similar target like ours, so there’s no pressure on us, said the coach following.<br /><br /><b>[On Safee Sali]</b> Safee’s partnership with Patrick is getting better. He’s getting back the competitiveness as a player. He knows he will be in the first eleven so he’s getting back his form. Patrick can also do a good job for us upfront. He is used to our style. But for the two Argentinian players, Gonzalo Soto and Lucas Espindola, it might take some time for them to settle down<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether the problem with their venue is disrupting the team’s preparation]</b> We need to start well, but with this kind of problem, we are like nomads. Others have their own home grounds and home support but for us, everywhere <b>[we play]</b> is like an away game. We just need a good place and we will wait for the management to decide. I have no problems if we have to play in the late afternoon</p>

  <p><b>[PKNS head coach E Elavarasan is confident forward Safee Sali will get to his best form in the next few matches]</b> I think he <b>[Safee]</b> can put in more effort we know what he is capable of. He hasn’t been playing for awhile. He got one or two chances but we can see the whole team are yet to settle down. This will take time but we know what he can do so maybe next game we can improve.<br /><br />For now, we are yet to get the best out of them. We can see some weaknesses especially when they were in front of the box, and they were rusty with their movements. But we can see the errors, so we can improve and we are confident that it will be better in the next game<br /><br /><b>[Elavarasan said the team tried to find the equaliser]</b> We tried to find the equaliser. Of course, when we went forward, Felda will have a lot of space to attack but overall, without our full line-up, there are still a lot that we can improve. We still lack understanding when going forward. We played better in the second half and created a lot of opportunities to score goals</p>

  <p><b>[Elavarasan Elangowan has blamed his midfield after they suffered a 3-1 defeat to Kelantan]</b> I could see the weakness in our midfield. Although we have good strikers, but when we reach the middle third, we cannot get the ball to our strikers. Overall, it was not so good. We could not supply the ball to our strikers. When the engine room didn’t function, the whole team can’t play well.<br /><br />This is only the second game. As newcomers, when we play in the Super League, you will go up against teams that have been here for many years. They have the experience and their performance is always consistent. In the Premier League, you don’t play strong teams every week. But it is different in the Super League. State teams are strong, despite their off-field problems and they are always consistent. To break the barrier, we need more time</p>

  <p><b>[PKNS FC head coach, E. Elavarasan praised his two strikers, Patrick Ronaldinho Wleh and Safee Sali after ther dominant 5-3 win over Selangor]</b> I think Patrick did really well as a striker and I think his fitness level is at a different level compared to the previous games. So is Safee, from what I can see, he finally found his form in front of goal, which can only bring good things for the team and the country. The changes in tactical including a change in our lineup also proved to be very effective for this game.<br /><br />Despite they scored and gave an early pressure, the motivation to get three points really drove us to get the win. We can take all the positives from tonight but we must remember that it is still a long way to go in the league. We only won one game and that doesn’t change anything. We must be consistent if we want to end the season at a better position</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Espindola vindicates E. Elavarasan’s decision to sign him for PKNS after his two-goals exploits against Perak]</b> I think the turning point was when our keeper saved the penalty. That was when we knew we had the advantage. Because before that, Perak were still very threatening and had they score that, the result might have been different.<br /><br />As I’ve said before, we took Lucas because we wanted someone who can score goals. He’s not the best in midfield but he can score goals. Since we have others to do the job in midfield, that’s why we took him on. For him, we are more concern for him to play further forward and score goals<br /><br />We still more games to go. We will go through better and worse conditions. What is important from games like this is that the team shares the goals around. When Wleh is not scoring, others contributed</p>

  <p><b>[E Elavarasan puts Melaka defeat down to wrong tactics]</b> This is a knockout tournament, if you win, you get to advance, and if you lose, you have to pack your bags. That’s the way it is. We failed to convert our chances and they managed to punish us with one or two mistakes that we did.<br /><br />Any teams that play away from home will find it difficult and will take some time before they got to get used to the pitch. My players did their best and maybe because when we were behind in the second half, my strategy to put plenty of strikers upfront didn’t work. And it was Melaka United who showed great discipline defensively and defended really well from giving us any chance to drag the match into extra time</p>

  <p><b>[PKNS FC head coach Elavarasan Elangowan has blamed his side’s lack of patience for their 3-2 defeat at home to Sarawak]</b> <b>[We]</b> started okay but we lost our grip when Sarawak scored their first goal, after that we were not as organised as we had been. Afterwards when we started playing more aggressively, we created chances but we failed to convert them. In the second half the game became more open and we did find an equaliser, but it was too open. Anything could have happened in the match really, five or six goals could have been scored. After we equalised, we looked for the winning goal and that opened up more gaps in defence. This is the problem we observed in the match. Even after drawing level we need to be patient when finding the winner or trying to extend the lead. This is one of the problems we are facing.<br /><br />…in the past two games, we’ve been letting in very soft goals. Against T-Team we conceded soft goals, and today we let in easy goals. We practically gifted them. This is what we need to improve, to stop conceding soft goals, and our game will change. These are very costly mistakes in football. Strikers will miss ten chances, but if a defender makes one mistake, that cannot be fixed. We have to fix this, as we’ve let in too many goals in the past two matches. Three today and two goals in the previous match<br /><br />…on the attacking part I think they did not give up, they kept trying. Of course they did miss a number of chances, but what’s important is they kept trying until the end. That’s a very important attitude, which will better a team over time<br /><br />Another ingredient that pushes the team to fight I would say is our national striker Safee <b>[Sali]</b>, who also motivates the team. This is among the influences that motivate the team to go all out until the end and make them not give up<br /><br /><b>[He also gave credit to Sarawak striker Mark Hartmann]</b> In fact my players have been warned that he can take long-range shots, and that he’s a good, technical player. But in the end we gave him too much space in the middle third to take shots and he took advantage of that<br /><br /><b>[He also revealed that Palestine international Matias Jadue, who suffered an injury before the match]</b> I think he will be absent for the rest of the week. He experienced a tear two days back</p>

  <p><b>[Elavarasan was nonplussed by the referee’s decision in the match against Penang that cost his side all 3 points on Saturday]</b> We lost a golden opportunity with that penalty miss. Luckily Patrick scored with that header. In the second half, both teams looked tired. I’m not sure the second goal is offside and I’m not sure how the referee can overruled it. I think that was controversy at the end. When I asked the referee, he said ‘deliberate save’. What is ‘deliberate save’? I cannot understand that word. It’s new to me. We accept the result but we want to see that again.<br /><br />We were still tightening up when we put on defensive players because at the time we were on the defensive. Only in the last five minutes when we put Bobby in, we tried to go for the win. That was the risk we were taking<br /><br />I looked at the record of the games we’ve played. When Nazrin was playing centrally, we were good on the attack but defensively we were quite loose. That’s the reason we put Nizam there to tighten the midfield a bit. It worked but the weather took its toll on the players today<br /><br />For us, it’s a good break. We will get Guru, Affize <b>[Faizal]</b>, Fauzan <b>[Dzulkifli]</b> back by then. When we resume, we’ll have our midfield back. If we want to improve further, we need to make changes. We need to improve the quality. Definitely our midfield side need to be improved. At the moment, we are patient</p>

  <p><b>[Elavarasan Elangowan is determined to get a win in order to improve their position in the league]</b> We want to improve our position in the table. I can see some positive signs during the game against JDT and Kedah so I hope we can bring back three points</p>

  <p><b>[Elavarasan points to defensive awareness as the key to victory against Kedah]</b> The players need to stay in focus, any lapse and we will be punished by a very experienced Kedah forward line. I do not want us to be punished because of any careless mistakes.</p>

  <p><b>[PKNS FC showed great character to recover from being two goals down at half time to eventually hold Kedah to a 4-4 draw in a Super League match]</b> First half when we conceded 3 goals, we have to accept that our defence were too loose with our marking. In the second half, the players knew what they had to do and they fought until the end.<br /><br />It was a bit of a shame that we didn’t take more from this because Kedah didn’t have most of the best players today but the most important is for us not to lose today.<br /><br />No, I don’t think so <b>[relegation]</b>. With a few changes, the team will come back. We always know that we’ll improve after this transfer window. This is game number 12 and we need to improve several departments. Even though the situation isn’t good, the local player give 100% but we’ll need extra to help the team better</p>

  <p><b>[Elavarasan sees Ghaddar’s signing as the final piece in the JDT jigsaw]</b> With the recruitment of Ghaddar, they are one of the most complete squads at the moment. Ghaddar is the top scorer in the Super League and with him, the confidence level of JDT will be higher. On our side, we are short of one foreigner because Gonzalo <b>[Soto]</b> is still nursing his knee injury. We’ll have a tough time managing their attacking force<br /><br />On our side, Patrick and Matias <b>[Hadwa]</b> is still there, and they can cause problems for JDT’s defence. Definitely put him <b>[Wleh]</b> to combine with Matias. We need extra body in the attacking third. Knowing JDT have an all round good squad, we need to stay focus the entire 90 minutes<br /><br />We recognise what they have done last year for the team. We know how important it is for them to get us promoted lat season. But end of the day, it’s all about the performance. Looking at the performance we also need to improve. That is why after the 24th, we’ll have a discussion with the management then we talk about how to improve the meeting. We thank all these players who have done well last season and hopefully they can be with the team as long as possible</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[E Elavarasan remained happy with performance against JDT but stressed that reinforcements are on the way]</b> I think overall our players played well even though we played with one import less. Our defending was organised and out target was to make sure we don’t concede in the opening 45 minutes. But in the last 15 minutes of the game, the game changed. In the second half, both sides had chances. Of course JDT looked like they had more chances but we are almost the same, just that we didn’t use the chances we got.<br /><br />Of course if we had Safee, we would have more in attack. He’s a striker who can find openings on his own. Today we have two big strikers who wasn’t very mobile so we had to depend on the crossing but we didn’t do too well there<br /><br />I think at that moment, at the half way line there was a mistake. The mistake was when we played a square pass when it was supposed to be a forward pass. When the right back overlapped, the right side was opened up. Either we counter or when we lose the ball they counter. Games like these are always tight. Even though we lost, the players commitment was very good<br /><br />We’re the only team who haven’t made any changes this window. For the next game, after we make the changes with the import players, I’m sure we will be better. At the moment we have identified a few but we’ll wait for the management decision</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Elavarasan confident that the new imports will give PKNS a stronger bite in attack]</b> <b>[The changes made is]</b> What I think suitable to go along with the strike force that we have. That’s the changes that we made because we have Patrick <b>[Ronaldinho Wleh]</b>, Safee <b>[Sali]</b> and Bobby <b>[Gonzales]</b>. The right midfield Fabio, who can also play on the left and right. I have another Korean who can play across midfield. So I got the option whether I need him to be on the flanks or to pack the midfield.<br /><br />I think it’s Fabio because he comes with a good background. He comes from the A-League with one of the top clubs there. Even though they wanted to re-sign him, he wanted to get expose himself in other parts of Asia, so he’ll try very hard to prove he’s a good buy.<br /><br />I think it’ll <b>[the call-up]</b> give him <b>[Nazrin]</b> more confidence. Basically it’ll inspire him to play better so that he’ll get more opportunities. For me, it’s the first step for any player to look further in their football career</p>
