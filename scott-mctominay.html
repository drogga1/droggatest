  <p><b>[Scott McTominay says that he is proud of Scotland team-mate Andrew Robertson’s Champions League title with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I’m a Man United man through and through so I can’t lie it wasn’t easy, it was a tough watch. But it was still good to see a fellow Scotsman on the pitch and beautiful to see what he’s gone through from 2012 to now.<br /><br /><b>[McTominay says his team-mate’s achievement will serve as inspiration for the rest of the team going forward]</b> It’s amazing for him and we’re relishing getting him back and hopefully kicking on in a Scotland jersey. If that’s not inspiration for the whole team right there I don’t know what is. He’s done incredibly well and that’s my aim - to be replicating something like that winning big trophies and hopefully playing in major tournaments in the future with Scotland.</p>

It’ll be good to be together as a group and if a few signings come in we’ll be ready for that and welcome them with open arms. <b>[United’s pre-season plans]</b> will be good for the younger players who came on the tour last year and who will come again this year to get a feel for exactly what goes on - how the players prepare for games, exactly what they do, the meetings we have and things. It can be a vital time in their development. It just helps them get to know the lads and it allows them to see what you’re about on the pitch as well. That’s one of the most important things - they have to trust you on the pitch and have confidence in you. It’s an invaluable experience.</p>

That’s one thing that I’ve done over the last two years, I’ve always backed myself. I’ve tried to train hard and I’ve always wanted to do extra things to try and give me that one per cent difference. It’s my ambition to be a regular No. 6, No. 8, a box-to-box player – that’s my main ambition. That’s always been my goal. It’s important that I really go for that now. Obviously there is an opportunity there and you’ve got to take it with both hands. Last year I had some decent performances and it’s important that I carry on from that<br /><br /><b>[McTominay says that everyone at the club is desperate to return to their glory days]</b> That’s the desire from kitchen ladies at Carrington, to the kit men, to the physios to the players and all of the staff and the manager. That’s the sole aim of the football club, to get it back to where we want to be. That’s the top of the league and it’s important we get there</p>

  <p><b>[Scott McTominay is using the example of the Class of 92 as inspiration]</b> The Class of 92 were absolutely exceptional and it’s going to be very, very difficult to replicate something like that. We’ve got a good group of young boys who are ready to learn and ready to go the extra mile and do everything to get into the team and push some senior pros to get their places. That is going to be my aim, Axel’s aim, Mason’s as well. So it’s important all the boys come together and have that real solid team spirit that young players always have going through the age groups. From the Under-9s to the Under-23s, that’s the most important thing for us</p>

We’ve got players who’ve won titles and many trophies, but young players are there as well and they are hungry to compete for their place in the team. Just because someone’s played more games than you, it doesn’t mean they’re always going to get in ahead of you. It’s about who does the business on the pitch and I feel everybody has got that message in their own head. It’s not a given that you’re going to play every single match. But that’s the sign of a healthy dressing room. Age is just a number when you see people like <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> and <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>.

Where I want to get to is being that player in the team where you’re a leader, you’re the one telling people. You’re driving the standards<br /><br />There’s a lot of things I know I can improve on. I’m constantly working.

After <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> away I came home and I was nearly in tears. It was so difficult to handle. I’ve really enjoyed this pre-season. It has been different, we have put a lot more work in. I feel that the boys have taken to it well and in the games that we’ve had we’ve shown glimpses of what we can do, with the expansive attacking football. I’m definitely fitter than I’ve ever been. I feel fresh and ready to go, to compete for a place in the first XI</p>

Obviously you have to remember and respect the fact that Paul is a world class player who can pretty much do anything on a football pitch. You have to adapt to what he does as well and the different runs that he might make, and obviously adapt your game off that. If you are playing with someone else, you have to change that as well.

Obviously it’s about building that up and keep the relationship between each other, to know what each other does and keep adapting to the circumstances. I think we handled it quite well.</p>

We need to do more on and off and pitch. The manager has reiterated that, how it’s about the standards of this football club and they weren’t there today. It’s sickening when you come in and that’s the result. It’s so tough to take and it’s difficult for all our fans as well who were unbelievable all game. Unfortunately we didn’t send them back with three points<br /><br /><b>[McTominay is not looking to use absentees as an excuse]</b> We have quality all over the squad and obviously some of the main players who play every week are injured, but so be it.

It’s not all of a sudden just going to click straight into place. Once Sir Alex left, it was going to take time for the club to find the right manager, and I do believe that we have the right manager now in Ole.

In this day and age, clubs are just willing to sack a manager without really thinking about the consequences for how that team is going to go forward in the next five or six years. Ole definitely has a plan for the short-term and long-term, and when you’ve got a guy like that, it’s important you stick by him<br /><br /><b>[McTominay identifies the success of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as more motivation to restore United to prominence]</b> They’re doing well and that’s life. Sometimes teams can do well and other teams who’ve had amazing histories can drop off a little bit.

  <p><b>[McTominay disappointed first <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> goal didn’t deliver win over <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> It is definitely a disappointment with different opportunities we had in the game and the way we started in the first 45 minutes, because we were right on the front foot and doing a lot of things right. I thought we were good value for three points. It is little mistakes that we have to start cutting out because they cost you games, and points in this respect.

I have said it in previous weeks we have to get more opportunities and create more.

He’ll always have a special place in mine and my family’s heart because he’s the one who brought you in, he was the one who trusted you, he was the one who had belief in you. I owe a tremendous amount of credit to him because if it wasn’t for him I might not necessarily be sitting in this seat<br /><br />I wouldn’t be at this football club if it wasn’t for Paul McGuiness, Dave Bushall, Tony Whelan and people like that who show an absolutely ridiculous amount of patience with somebody who can’t even play an U18 game because he’s growing, his legs are stretching and he’s got no co-ordination. Yeah they need to be patient. Off the pitch as well they have to be patient with you as well. There’s a lot of different things with school and in your education and your digs you’re staying in. Dave Bushall had to change my digs like three or four times because my mum at home wasn’t happy or whatever.

The manager has said that to us; the best players are going to play and that’s simple whenever you walk into a dressing room. It’s not just playing academy players for the sake of it, it’s playing them because he believes in those players and believes he can win trophies playing us.

So we are just going to do whatever we can to make sure I am back on the pitch as soon as possible<br /><br />He is a pleasure to play alongside and he is a great guy as well. We get on really well and have a good relationship off the pitch. He’s a pleasure to work with and he’s a player who I admire a lot. He has come on leaps and bounds in the past few months, and he deserves all of the credit he is getting at the minute. Long may it continue as well<br /><br /><b>[McTominay added on the <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> new boy]</b> Yeah, in the brief moments that I have seen <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> in training, he has looked really, really good. He has looked like every type of player that the manager wants as well, so hopefully that can come to us on the pitch and he can show us what he can do. I can’t wait to play alongside him</p>

  <p><b>[McTominay excited to rub <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>’s derby win in City faces]</b> I know some City fans, well, one or two, so it’ll be good to rub that one in their faces as well. That was such a sweet moment, especially in a game where we could have done with another goal earlier on to finish the game, but credit to the boys - they were top drawer. We had a sticky first 15, 20 minutes, but you see how much it means to the boys to win the derby again. That’s three times this year. But we have to keep going. It’s a game we have to take confidence from, but in the coming weeks, we have to go for some proper results and keep this run going. It was such a beautiful feeling, in front of our fans in the dying minutes. We can’t get too carried away but we’ve got to keep going and keep pushing for the Champions League.<br /><br />You can see with the run of games we’ve been on, I’ve been injured for two months and I was desperate to get back because I could see the progression of the team. Just to come on and help the boys today was a pleasure. Obviously I’m fighting for my place, everybody in this team is not guaranteed a starting spot and everybody has to keep working every week. For me, that’s one of the most important things, but we’ll keep our feet on the ground and keep pushing forwards. We’ve won a game today but it’s the next one and the next one</p>

  <p><b>[Scott McTominay praised the arrival of born winner <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a>]</b> With Bruno you can see he comes in and he’s a born winner - you see than in training. He’s willing to take the ball in any situation and play the killer pass - we need that creative spark. I can’t give him enough credit for the way he’s started. He’s very demanding, a No.10 who wants the ball, but he’s been a breath of fresh air. He’s got a personality and that’s what this football club needs - he has that in abundance<br /><br />It’s so important. If you don’t have competition for places people take their foot off the peddle and relax. It can only breed a healthy environment and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have always had that. I want to be one of the first names on the team sheet, but Nemanja is a great player and I can learn a lot from him<br /><br />Obviously when you are growing up and play Under-18s and reserve games you are used to playing in front of lesser crowds. But it will be strange. We just have to keep doing what we have been doing. It is a real shame fans from both sides can’t come</p>

  <p><b>[Scott McTominay is looking to add more goals to his game against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> It’s always been part of my game, scoring goals from midfield and obviously making <b>[it into]</b> the box late and scoring from outside the box as well. Headers as well, I need to do better with them as well, so obviously there are a lot of things that I need to improve on. Obviously goalscoring is something that I take very, very seriously and obviously for myself it’s nice to get a few goals in the last couple of weeks, coming back from injury, but you need to keep scoring as regularly as you can and pushing towards the end of the season for trophies as well<br /><br /><b>[McTominay said of that ambition heading into the first leg of a continental clash with LASK]</b> Yeah, that’s so important that we have that mindset of going the distance and every competition that we’re in - it’s not acceptable just to put a competition to the side and not concentrate on other ones. We’ve got a big enough squad now where we need to have full focus on every competition and for us it’s so important to get trophies - the manager and the coaching staff have reiterated those points to us. We just have to keep pushing in the league and obviously the cup competitions we’re in</p>

  <p><b>[Scott McTominay motivated to keep improving at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> following injury frustration]</b> I had a couple of injuries which were difficult to deal with mentally. For me that is one of the main priorities, keeping your head screwed on mentally. Physically I’ve always had that attitude to keep improving and wanting to do more and more to sustain yourself in the team, and keep yourself in the best shape as possible. For me that has just been normal for me.<br /><br />I’ve had a training partner, Callum, who’s asking me the questions, and we’ve had a really good week or two of training and eating all right foods, and staying on top of it. So I feel like that motivation comes from him as well and everyone around me who are good people. So for me that is important</p>

  <p><b>[McTominay explains why he was never tempted by loan move away from <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>]</b> Yeah, about a year and a half ago there was a time where it (a loan move) might have been a possibility and then somebody leaves or something like that, and then your opportunity comes and you have to take it. You hear loads of stories about boys going on loan and different things like that and I always had it in my head that I don’t want that.<br /><br />I want to be showing myself here first and if it doesn’t work here then you go somewhere else. For me, you hear the stories about getting the life of luxury at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and people take that for granted, like the food in the canteen, your kit being laid out for you every morning. People just expect that and you have to always remember where you come from in that respect and always appreciate what people do for you. I feel like that is culture that is brought through for us</p>

  <p><b>[McTominay names his top three <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> academy talents to watch]</b> There’s a lot. You see Di’Shon <b>[<a href="bernard.html">Bernard</a>]</b>, Largie <b>[Ramazani]</b>, Jimmy <b>[Garner]</b>, you see Mason <b>[<a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a>]</b>, obviously, coming in and Mason’s on his way to being established. He’s not quite at that level of being a regular first-teamer, and that’s what Mason has to strive to become. He’s one of the most talented players that I’ve seen for a long time - his left-foot, right-foot shooting is ridiculous. For me, it’s my responsibility - we’ve got to take a responsibility now to push these younger boys and get them up to a level where it’s justifiable that they’ve reached their potential. For everyone at the football club, that’s the primary goal as well. It’s the same for myself: I’m getting pushed by the coaching staff every single day<br /><br />What can we expect after isolation? I don’t know - the same old Scott! Motivated, wanting to learn, wanting to do well, coming back fitter. I’m sure all of the boys will be in their shape where we’ll have two or three weeks’ training and hopefully hit the ground running, and I’m sure there’ll be a lot of games. I think the simple answer to that question would be hungrier than ever. When I got back from injury, you have four or five games and then the season just stops. It’s like, well, no, this is where I need to kick on now! This is where I want to keep going! For me, it was bad timing, but always whenever you’re working hard at home, I’m sure we’ll come back and it will become good timing as well</p>

  <p><b>[Scott McTominay says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> remains a dangerous tool for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> You’ve got the physique and the presence to hold people off and the burst of speed where you can get through as well. There’s so many good examples of it in world football. Paul’s probably one of the best examples of it, he’s very, very powerful and gets across the grass really, really quickly. It’s a dangerous tool to have in the middle of the pitch as well<br /><br />For myself, someone who’s quite strong and a good runner, I should be testing teams more than I do. I should be breaking lines similar to what Paul does, drive into the box and create chances. We always have to have that balance of one goes and one sits, which is so important for a midfield player. Being box-to-box, there’s some amazing examples: <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>, <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>, driving through the middle of the pitch and were exceptionally good at it. For me it’s important to keep watching clips like that, I get the guys to send them over as much as they can to analyse it.</p>

All I have ever known is United and I hope that my passion for the club shows every time I go onto the pitch. I’ll continue to give everything for this club whenever I pull on the shirt. I want to thank the manager for the faith he has shown in me and everyone at the club that has helped me to get where I am today. I’m looking forward to finishing this season on a high and hopefully achieving our aims</p>

  <p><b>[Scott McTominay is very excited about the future at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, with the Scotland international having committed to a new contract with the club through to 2025]</b> Very excited. You see the team we’ve got now and it’s amazing. For everybody from the outside looking in they should be saying that we’ve got a real chance to go and do really well. For us we have to keep our feet on the ground, keep training well every day and listen to the coaching staff and the ideas they’re portraying to us and put that into practice on the pitch. It’s strange with no fans at the minute but hopefully in time we’ll be able to get back to normal and resume where we left off after the last game<br /><br />The manager is not wrong and has hit the nail on the head! You see other boys in the same situation to myself like Marcus <b>[<a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>]</b> and Jesse <b>[<a href="jesse-lingard.html">Lingard</a>]</b> and Axel <b>[<a href="axel-tuanzebe.html">Tuanzebe</a>]</b>, boys who are doing tremendously well, and I want to be a role model for younger kids growing up and show them how you can get to a certain level with the first team. That’s by maintaining hard work throughout a number of years and for me that hard work doesn’t stop, it continues, and that’s the way I’ve been brought up through the football club. There are obviously a lot of other things going on in the world right now which are far more important than what’s happening with me, but it’s a real pleasure to be involved with this football club and hopefully going forward we’ll do really well</p>
