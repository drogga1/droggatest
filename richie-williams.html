  <p>[On Christian Pulisic] You could tell he enjoyed the game. He enjoyed being at training. For me, he’s always been a competitive guy. You can tell he has a passion for the game. He shows up, he’s consistent, shows up every day in training, trains well.<br /><br />Scouts from Europe were saying he was one of the highest-rated around the world at his age group. You could see it in the games we played, against better competition, that he was one of the better players</p>

  <p>[On Matt Olosunde] What caught my eye was his ability to get forward from the right back position. The ability to just get up and down. You could see his athleticism, his stamina and quickness, but on top of it his ability with the ball. He could combine, put balls in the box, and score<br /><br />When residency started, he was one of our better players. Unfortunately he went over to Europe for training with some European teams after we qualified for the World Cup and pulled his hamstring and that kept him from being able to show what he could do</p>
