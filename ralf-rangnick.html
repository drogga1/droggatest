If I were his advisor or father, I would clearly advise him to stay and extend his contract. When a really big club comes in for him and he wants to leave, he can still do that<br /><br />Timo is of the opinion that he does not want to extend the contract. So far, no club has reported their interest or said they would speak with Timo and want to sign him. It’s not a good idea for Timo to go into the final year of his contract, which could be difficult for his relationship with the fans depending on how his performance turns out. It would be a shame because since he joined he has become a crowd pleaser</p>

The fact that we no longer have such people in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, the pace is a bit more leisurely, the game has slowed down.

And, I think, out of the top clubs in Europe, he’s probably the coach with the highest number of former players from us<br /><br /><b>[The 61-year-old added on the similarities between his own footballing philosophy and Klopp’s]</b> The style is very similar to Jurgen. It’s proactive, it’s high pressing, counter-pressing. Once we have won the ball we don’t want to waste any time by square passes or back passes. We are trying to play forward as quickly as possible, trying to create chances, trying to score as many goals as possible<br /><br /><b>[Rangnick was Salzburg’s sporting director when they signed <a href="takumi-minamino.html">Minamino</a> from <a href="enrique-cerezo.html">Cerezo</a> Osaka in 2015]</b> You could see he was good on the ball, very technical, good mentality. He is also like many Japanese players, willing to invest in the team’s efforts to win the ball back. Of course he had to learn those things tactically, but his willingness and his mentality was already there. He’s not the kind of player to say, ‘OK the other team has got the ball so, please let me know once we have the ball so I then can take part in the game again’. Even at the age of 19 you could see he was a good boy<br /><br />Of course any big club in England should be attractive, but also there has been no contact between the relevant clubs and myself. I’m very happy and my full focus is on my job at Red Bull. Should that change it takes a lot (not money) because I’m more than happy with what I’m doing now</p>

  <p><b>[Rangnick is known for being a strict disciplinarian and made an example of Jean-Kevin Augustin in public when he did not live up to the high standards expected]</b> I’ll say it with a wink: If there’s a player, who doesn’t really know if he’s happy about me as a coach, it’s probably him. And he has good reasons for that. I’m going to get on his nerves just as much this year until he does what he has to do. He has so much potential and rarely uses it. We won’t give up until he can continually show it. I’m far from giving up. I prefer hanging out with him every day</p>
