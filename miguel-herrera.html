  <p><b>[Miguel Herrera on Mexico at World Cup]</b> If I don’t go to the World Cup thinking about winning it, then I might as well just go along as an extra, an outsider. We’re entitled to aim to become world champions. We’ve got a good infrastructure and good players, so why shouldn’t we think that way? They really celebrate football <b>[in Brazil]</b>. It’s going to be sensational and it’s going to be a different story for Mexico, that’s for sure. Why not choose Brazil as the place to make history, like Brazil once chose Mexico?</p>

  <p><b>[Timing is everything as Atlanta United and Club America set for intriguing Campeones Cup]</b> The fans aren’t quite as stuck into this tournament since it’s just starting, but for us it’s really important. America is a team were you go out and have to look to win, and the trophies you can win, you want to lift them. So, it’s going to be a very important game. We’ve come here with the best we have and are taking it with the necessary seriousness</p>

I’ve told the guys that, and everyone knows it. Since the start of the tournament, they’ve demanded the title from us here. They don’t say ‘You have to qualify,’ If we didn’t qualify (for the playoffs) we’d all be out. They demand titles</p>

They’ve called me before, but I’m coaching America and I’m really happy here<br /><br />It’s growing by taking giant steps forward. It’s a league that is on a really good path toward becoming a powerful, strong league. They’re showing it economically. I think you’ve seen that with three or four clubs already opening their wallet with how they’re bringing in coaches, bringing in players. If that keeps changing, we’re going to have a lot more competition because the middle portion of their rosters, that’s the part that still hasn’t finished raising its level. But it’s also a young league. We can’t say they’re just doing everything perfectly. It’s a young league, but it’s growing really, really well<br /><br /><b>[Herrera said after a 2-0 win over Morelia that qualified the team for the Liga MX final]</b> This is the most demanding club there is in Mexico.
