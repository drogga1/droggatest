  <p><b>[On Andres Ibarguen]</b> I see Ibarguen as a really good player. He’s very good, nice, he brings a good atmosphere and he’s taking advantage of the minutes he’s had. Fortunately we chose well when putting the group together and everyone knows they have to be at a good level.<br /><br /><b>[Last weekend’s comeback draw against Veracruz]</b> I like the attitude, the determination and the desire to not let a single point go. This point meant a lot for our attitude, how we didn’t let it go. That’s the good thing about this team, that it doesn’t fall down. Losing the undefeated run could happen at any time, but the attitude of the guys is what stands out</p>

We’re OK but not happy because I think we came to go out and win the match. But if you come short on these types of plays, it’s difficult to be able to win. We played really well. … We didn’t win because we weren’t precise and above all missed a penalty. You can’t miss a penalty. I think what we’re lacking is that dagger. We had a great team in front of us in their house. The fans made themselves heard, but I think we’re doing well.</p>

It doesn’t change much because that’s why we strengthened the team, to have these headaches that have us thinking, ‘Now, what are we going to do?’ I have to decide on the 18.</p>

In this type of games, yes there’s the pride beyond simply the three points, but it’s still three points. The desire to win in whatever circumstances, to get the three points, is the same.</p>

He has a really good physical presence and he’d be a great partner for Oribe.</p>

  <p><b>[Club America manager Miguel Herrera accused Toronto police officers of hitting his players during a scuffle at halftime]</b> We have to take advantage on a much better field, we’ve got to play a lot better. Honestly, I’m willing to leave that behind but what I’m very annoyed about - and the CONCACAF people know it and I hope they report it - the police were hitting my players. And the CONCACAF officials saw it, so I want to see it reported. Because if they’re going to use the police to attack the players when you think they’re going to calm down the situation and calm us down and the CONCACAF people saw it, I hope the report comes out that the CONCACAF officials saw the police’s aggression toward America’s players<br /><br />They hit Marchesin, they hit Bruno and Giber. I think if there’s scuffling we can calm ourselves down. That’s what the security is for, to calm things down. But the security, it didn’t intervene in this way. I saw the CONCACAF people there and I hope the report comes down. Because if not it means CONCACAF is going to hide what happened at halftime when they saw it. We hope the report comes out<br /><br /><b>[Yet when asked to clarify if he was accusing the officers of assault]</b> Of course. Of course. Not one <b>[player was hit]</b>, three. We’re annoyed. The police don’t need to be there assaulting the players, on the contrary they should be calming the people down. The CONCACAF official saw it<br /><br />No, no, the truth is it isn’t <b>[trying to condition the match]</b> I think it’s a spectacular city. But I really wasn’t expecting the police in such a calm, beautiful and safe city to act in this way. To reiterate, it wasn’t just me, there were two people from CONCACAF outside the locker rooms. They saw it. So it’s not conditioning anything. They’re coming to Mexico, did their preseason in Mexico, we played a friendly against them in Mexico and they know that in Mexico these things don’t happen. There are moments where things heat up in a game and the police don’t get involved to hit anyone. Here either. And I’m not saying it’s every police officer, just the two or three there in the locker room area who instead of calming things down made it more heated. I was pushing my players into the locker room because I know if you hit a police officer, you go to jail<br /><br /><b>[On referee Henry Bejarano]</b> It started in the locker room. The referees came in with a bad attitude in the first place because the players were putting on colored tights and I think with a bit of common sense you could’ve let players who wanted to play with extra material to stop the cold a bit but because it was black they took it away. So when you see they’re acting like clowns, being annoying, the fourth official, he has to come in but he’s saying, ‘Hey number 20, come here,’ this starts to influence you that the referees didn’t come to call things evenly. I want a referee team that can come and call an important semifinal. That’s where their influence started from. I think when you see the Costa Ricans that aren’t in a good mood, that’s where the errors you could see on the field start when they come in with this power</p>

  <p><b>[Pride on the line for Liga MX teams in CONCACAF Champions League second legs]</b> I think there’s a situation where we’ve had Mexican teams in the finals for many years and it’s obvious that MLS, which has grown, wants to have teams there, but the errors have been against the Mexicans and that’s how it’s gone. It’s not what they want, that’s how it’s happened. Officials have the pressure of calling games with Mexicans teams. It’s not CONCACAF. We’re part of a great confederation and we should respond for the FMF.</p>

He doesn’t have to be doing anything besides observing this soccer. But the federation’s demands with people who aren’t from our country … they give more freedom to do what they want. That’s how it’s always been.</p>

The team tried and did what it had to do. Beyond that, we had errors that put us out at this stage, the kind of mistakes that are so serious that you can’t have those kind of plays against these opponents because they’re going to take advantage of that.

  <p><b>[America manager Miguel Herrera doesn’t like the idea of new Mexico boss Tata Martino’s microcycles]</b> I don’t really agree with this, but as we’ve said America is a team that supports - they’ve taken 10 players between U-20, U-21 and senior national teams. They’ve taken 10 players and until Thursday we’re going to work with that. I understand the U-20 because they’ve got a World Cup on the doorstep, but the other? I didn’t do that. La Volpe did it but all the players were in Mexico. But it’s other people’s decision. We’re loaning the players.<br /><br />I’m not afraid of (injuries). I know they can work. The players are doing well physically. What I don’t like is that you’re working with a few people but today I don’t see it being possible that the people outside - before all the Mexicans were playing in Mexico. Today you can call up 25 but there are 10 outside the country that have to be present at any time. But, again, it’s not my decision. It’s one thing not to agree and another thing not to support</p>
