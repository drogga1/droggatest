<blockquote>
  <p>[Michael Valkanis, who has worked in youth academies in Australia and the Netherlands, is another who has seen plenty of Van den Berg] I was impressed with the calmness and ability of a 16-year-old to play at the highest level in Holland. He’s always been a very mature player for his age, Sepp may come across young but he plays with experience somehow. He’s capable of reading the game very well, physically he’s strong for his age, he’s tall, quick and comfortable on the ball. In saying that there’s a lot of improvement in him. Many clubs have seen there’s a lot of potential and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are the lucky club who will have a fantastic central defender. I think when you look at him for his height, you don’t think he can be quick, but Seppi is very athletic. I think he’s done very well in the Eredivisie - which is known for good attacking football with quick wingers.</p>
