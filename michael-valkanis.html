  <p><b>[Melbourne City striker Tim Cahill dedicated Thursday night’s 2-1 win over Central Coast Mariners to the late father of former coach John van Schip]</b> I mentioned it last week, we’re definitely playing very well. We’re getting into the box many times and today we had many clear cut opportunities to score. At the end of the day, I think would be a problem if we weren’t getting into the box and weren’t scoring goals. In the future, something is going to click and someone will cop a battering, because the team is playing very well. They played well tonight and regardless if it’s 10 men or 11 men <b>[on the other side]</b>, the boys played the style we want to play, created many goal-scoring opportunities and as I said, only one man stood in the way, and that was <b>[Mariners goalkeeper]</b> Paul Izzo.<br /><br />Sometimes you’ll see him <b>[Cahill]</b> dropping deep, he does that for a reason because he’ll slow down the game when you need to take control. He’s an outstanding leader on the park and I think he had a very good game<br /><br />Part of the win today will be for John <b>[van ‘t Schip]</b>. We’re here for him and he knows we’re here for him</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne City coach Michael Valkanis has questioned the media’s disrespect of the rest of the A-League]</b> We have got a strong squad, but a lot of people seem to disrespect everyone else in the league - that’s what I gather with the media. Everyone disrespects every other team, that they’re not good enough, or they think our team is a Playstation game. When I play with my sons the players get a certain rating, and every week they play with that rating. We’re talking about human beings who put in 100 per cent effort today to try and win the game.</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne City coach Michael Valkanis praised the club’s youngsters after his understrength side came from behind at AAMI Park]</b> The young boys were excellent and even the older boys with experience like Tommy Sorensen did a great job to make sure in the end we got a result. I would have liked he three points but the boys were fantastic. The young boys have come in and they are full of energy and they have given everything. There’s been a lot of comments about our culture and I think we showed what our culture is all about here at Melbourne City today.</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne City coach Michael Valkanis says his talented centre-back Ruon Tongyik will have learnt more valuable lessons after his own goal in the 3-2 win over Central Coast Mariners]</b> Our first half was quite good and again we seemed to be in control, 2-0 up and had very good chances to make it three or four nil. A minute before half-time we conceded that free-kick and we spoke about it at half-time, about how important the next fifteen, 45 and 60 minutes are. They got another deflection, the goal got Central Coast a lot of momentum and back into the game. What’s happening is sometimes individual mistakes are costing us goals. Like today as well, a deflection was the first goal, the second goal it deflected off Ruon <b>[Tongyik]</b>.<br /><br />That happens in football and he has to move on with it quickly, and be positive and learn from it as a young player, but it’s moments like those that we have to get out of our system. He’s <b>[Tongyik]</b> a young player and it will be a great learning curve for him. He was under immense pressure and he did very well on the ball. A couple of times he got caught in a couple of situations where I’m sure he would have liked to have defended better. For a young player he is doing really well and taking great steps forward<br /><br />At the business end of the season it’s very important to come away with the three points. We’ll look at it and assess the performance in the first half, analyse the second half and what went wrong, and move on to the next game. We missed two good opportunities to make it 4-0 <b>[in the first half]</b> and I thought Paul Izzo’s two saves were exceptional. It could have been a very different game if it was 4-0 at half time</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne City coach Michael Valkanis has denied his club are interested in luring Socceroos midfielder James Troisi across from Melbourne Victory]</b> No. I don’t think so. At the moment, this game - no matter who it would be - is important that we win. We need the result. It doesn’t matter whether its Sydney or someone else, it’s an important game for us moving forwards in terms of where we want to finish on the table. But Sydney are the benchmark this year of the A-League and they’ve performed extremely well, but we also believe in our ability playing against them because I think in the previous games we’ve done well.<br /><br />We feel at this stage that we have to make some change. We have to make some change and we’ll probably do so now against Sydney in preparation for finals</p>

  <p><b>[Former England manager Roy Hodgson has been spotted in Australia - not on the beach but helping out A-League club Melbourne City]</b> That’s why it’s so good being a part of this group, the City Football Group. It’s great when you get football people together. A 10-minute conversation <b>[today]</b> ended up being one hour. We’re so lucky to have him here… he’s a man with a wealth of experience that can help.</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne City coach Michael Valkanis can’t help but wonder what might have been if centre-back Michael Jakobsen had been fit all season]</b> He’s trained well and we knew he’d get 90 minutes under his belt because he’s a professional … I thought he had another very, very good game. In the A-League, it’s a salary cap. You’ve got a certain amount of players and the players that you bring in from overseas, you want Michael to be available and to play, and he makes a difference and when a player like that is unavailable it causes you problems.<br /><br /><b>[Tim Cahill proved the difference, flicking on Nicolas Colazo’s corner with a trademark header in the 36th minute to score his eighth goal of the season]</b> We know Timmy is a weapon but not only his header today but his performance on the pitch, his workmanlike attitude, his pressing, his work-rate off the ball … I thought he was exceptional and he did a very good job for us</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Valkanis, who has worked in youth academies in Australia and the Netherlands, is another who has seen plenty of Van den Berg]</b> I was impressed with the calmness and ability of a 16-year-old to play at the highest level in Holland. He’s always been a very mature player for his age, Sepp may come across young but he plays with experience somehow. He’s capable of reading the game very well, physically he’s strong for his age, he’s tall, quick and comfortable on the ball. In saying that there’s a lot of improvement in him. Many clubs have seen there’s a lot of potential and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are the lucky club who will have a fantastic central defender. I think when you look at him for his height, you don’t think he can be quick, but Seppi is very athletic. I think he’s done very well in the Eredivisie - which is known for good attacking football with quick wingers.</p>
