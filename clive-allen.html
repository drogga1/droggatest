  <p><b>[on Harry Kane]</b> I think you could play Harry on his own with players deeper with a five-man midfield and Harry leading the line because I think that’s his best position. He’s played in a number of positions for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, a little bit withdrawn and deeper, but when he leads the line, when he’s a traditional number nine, that’s his best role and I think eventually that will be the role he will play for England</p>

  <p><b>[on Harry Kane]</b> I saw him walk through the door (at Tottenham) as a 16-year-old and had the pleasure of working with him for four years while I was on the staff and he was a fine young man. You could see from the day he walked in he had a real desire to improve himself as a footballer and the one thing I’d say about him, which unfortunately you don’t say about a lot of young footballers, is that he had a passion for the game. He loves football, he loves playing, he loves scoring goals</p>

  <p><b>[Club legend Clive Allen says <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> would be welcome back at Tottenham]</b> I would, yeah. I would because I think he could provide something that no one else can. That is something you can never underestimate, you add a player of that ability to your team, it’s not only a talent but it lifts everybody else in the club as well<br /><br />When Gareth walked through the door, and I don’t think he’ll dislike me for saying this, he was a young man, he was a baby. But he developed physically, mentally. The first time he introduced himself to the world was the <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a> game away in the San Siro, where he scored the most incredible hat-trick. But then he backed it up in the second leg at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart Lane</a>, and had as good a game that night. But the performance of <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> showed everybody what he is capable of. He’s up there with one of the best that I’ve seen with extraordinary things that he could do at such speed.</p>

  <p><b>[Kane to leave <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> for trophies? <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> legend Clive Allen expects striker to stay]</b> I worked with Ledley King who was an incredible talent and played all his career at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. But in the modern day game, I think the way that things work, Harry is very, very ambitious. He will want to play a career where he has trophies and he’s won competitions. Obviously there will come a point, perhaps, where he decides that may not be at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. But I believe that he believes that it will happen at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. I think <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are in brilliant shape at the moment.<br /><br />I know they’ve had a difficult time since the Champions League final, but just to reach the Champions League final was an incredible feat. I do think that Harry’s happy at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> and he’ll continue to score goal there for many years to come</p>

  <p><b>[Clive Allen says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> striker <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> starring as an NFL kicker in the years to come would come as no surprise]</b> Former strikers are the ones that can do it well. Kane has a great interest in it and I wouldn’t be surprised if in years to come he’ll be kicking an NFL football. Knowing Kane - and having worked with him - I know all about his mentality and attitude. I’m sure he could adapt his style to do the job and I wouldn’t put it past him being very successful at it. It’s also not got the physical demands of soccer - kicking at least - so players can go on a little longer<br /><br /><b>[Allen admits there are certain intricacies that any rookie would need to adjust to]</b> The ball is not necessarily set perfectly when it’s snapped back to you, so you have to adjust - even in your run up. It’s a different technique, certainly from kicking a soccer ball. The NFL ball is remarkably light and deviates a lot. The kicking technique is straight leg, locked knee and pointed toe. And where you strike the ball is really important. It took quite a lot of practice and work for me to hone the skill and make it work</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham legend Clive Allen says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> should be looking to bring <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> back to the club and sign <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Edinson Cavani</a> as cover for the injured Harry Kane]</b> I think definitely signings will be made. We need to buy someone - one, maybe two - and I think the club will be working tirelessly to do that. I cannot believe <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> has come into the football club without asking that question <b>[about signings]</b>.<br /><br />I would bring Gareth back. Whatever has happened at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, it still doesn’t seem like that’s changed. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> knows Gareth, Gareth knows <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, Jose even knows Gareth and I think it would be a fantastic fit. At this stage of his career with what’s happened to him, he’s been so successful at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> but to come back to London and to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, and not just a new <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> but a <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> that has evolved in the years he’s been away, I just think it’s fantastic fit, I really do. And I think he’s still got so much that he can do in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Let’s just keep our fingers crossed<br /><br /><b>[Allen hopes that reports of interest in <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> striker <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a> prove to be correct]</b> I do feel with everything they have in place that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> can attract marquee players. They’ve needed that big marquee signing for a while now and <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a> fits that. Yes he’s 32, but he’s been prolific. He stepped into the shoes of <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, he had to produce and he did. He’s a quality striker, a proven goalscorer and he’d relish the chance of playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. I think he’d be a good fit for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> at this moment in time.<br /><br />Piatek is 24 but is not necessarily prolific, so it’s massive gamble to bring him in to affect the team and score goals consistently. There’s no return with <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a> financially, you’re paying him to come and produce, while on the other hand Piatek might be an investment. But from a football view <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a> is a better option</p>
