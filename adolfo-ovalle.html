<blockquote>
  <p>[Taylor Booth is not your typical American] His development started to go so fast, so incredibly good. I mean this kid is at another level. Not only the vision, not only the first touch but Taylor can take people on, Taylor can shoot left and right without a problem and he’s not afraid of making a mistake in the attack. He’ll take chances, and that’s what makes him so special in my opinion<br /><br />Ever since I was younger, I’d say Europe was always the goal for me. My coaches knew that, my teammates knew that. It’s not because I didn’t like RSL, because I loved everything there. They’re a great club, and I definitely had to think about the homegrown contract that I got offered. But Europe just - my mind was set on if I get a chance in Europe, then I have to take it<br /><br />Right now, I’m just looking forward to starting the second half of the Bundesliga season, U-19, get those games under my belt and of course I’m looking at the U-20 World Cup in May. That would be an unbelievable opportunity for me. Maybe make a push for that roster. It’s been hard because I haven’t been able to get games before (joining Bayern), but I’m looking to make a push for that roster. As far as Bayern, just see what I can do. It’s all in my hands, how well I’m playing, how far I can make it, if I can make it to the first team, I mean, it’s all up to me</p>
