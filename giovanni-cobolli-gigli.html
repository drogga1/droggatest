  <p><b>[Giovanni Cobolli Gigli on Maurizio Sarri’s move to Juventus]</b> Maurizio Sarri has no class, regardless of whether he dresses in a suit or a tracksuit. I won’t forget the middle finger he flashed at the Juve fans when he was on the team bus. He can stick that finger somewhere else!</p>

  <p><b>[Napoli fans were understandably upset by Sarri’s appointment as Bianconeri boss, given the Tuscan’s previous ties to the Partenopei. The bitter response from some Juventini was more surprising, though]</b> Sarri has no class, regardless of whether he dresses in a suit or a tracksuit. I won’t forget the middle finger he flashed at the Juve fans when he was on the team bus. He can stick that finger somewhere else…I don’t think Gianni Agnelli would’ve chosen someone like Sarri. He is a fine coach, but in terms of communication, he was never able to say anything less than unpleasant and malevolent towards Juve</p>

  <p><b>[Giovanni Cobolli Gigli believes that <a href="miralem-pjanic.html">Miralem Pjanic</a> is soft like mozzarella]</b> The difficulty of the midfield is psychological. <a href="miralem-pjanic.html">Pjanic</a> seems to be as soft as mozzarella. He looks tired, and perhaps in need of a rest. The midfield problem has to be solved<br /><br />I have always been critical of <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a>, but I don’t like to kick a man when he is down. <a href="fabio-paratici.html">Paratici</a> has said that <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> is one of our best players, so why does he want to sell him?<br /><br /><b>[Cobolli Gigli did acknowledge that he believes <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> do have enough to continue their dominance of Serie A]</b> I think that believing the players are tired of winning is a bit dramatic considering the investments made. The <a href="gianni-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> family have made risky but fair deals. Andrea <a href="gianni-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> is an excellent communicator, perhaps the only one to take the situation by the hand and make himself heard</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> president Giovanni Cobolli Gigli believes the decision to let the Portuguese head home to Madeira prompted other players to leave]</b> Things at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> got complicated when <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> left. He said he was going to Portugal because of his mother, but now he only appears to be taking pictures by the pool. When the exception was made for him, things fell apart and others wanted to leave but it shouldn’t have been like this. They all should have been quarantined<br /><br />Criticising now is easy, but from the outside I don’t know why players wanted to leave Italy. When they return it’ll be more difficult to get back in shape because they’ll have to stay in quarantine for 14 days</p>
