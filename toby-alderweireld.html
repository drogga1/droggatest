We got to 4-2 and tried to press them, and then of course there’s space for them and they did very well at the end. The last couple of goals, we took a lot of risks.

No words can describe it. Another couple of years here at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, I think there is no place I could be happier.

At the beginning, when I came here, they accepted me very well, it’s like being friends. You couldn’t do the things we’ve done in the last couple of years if you’ve not got a very good group.

I think that’s why maybe we have a good connection, the fans and me. I’m very happy and it was always in my mind to stay. It’s easy to talk now like this after I signed a deal but hand on my heart it’s true. Of course <b>[<a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>]</b> is an influence but in a decision like this there’s a lot of things to consider. You talk with your family, of course my wife.

At the end, it was not a difficult decision. The connection with the fans was a big factor, big factor. From day one, it’s a cliche but I felt at home, I felt good. I think they appreciate what I’ve done for the club and I just want to pay them back with loyalty and with good performances in the next couple of seasons<br /><br />There’s a lot of things: family, how I feel about the club, the fans, how I am with the manager. Of course, there’s a financial part as well, so it’s all small parts that make your decision.

Even on nights like this, when everything goes wrong I try to put 100 per cent so they know I did everything for the club. And I’m quite a loyal guy. So if I’m going, it wasn’t an easy step for me.

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> defender Toby Alderweireld says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> was a decisive factor in signing a new deal at the club]</b> Financially the club made a good effort that showed me they really wanted me so that gave me respect. I could maybe earn a lot more somewhere else, but then I chose loyalty, that’s worth something as well.<br /><br />I talked to my wife, we have a second kid on the way. First of all, I asked her: ‘What do you want?’ She said she’s happy to stay, she loves it here, but that I can choose whatever I want. That gave me the opportunity to explore everything that I wanted. But the more that I thought about a new episode somewhere else, the more I thought, ‘No, I just want to stay.’ I’ve always been happy here since day one. I’ve felt very wanted here and have a very good connection with the fans. Then, of course, the last step was the manager, who really believed in me. I had a good connection with him from day one. So all those small steps took me into the big decision to stay<br /><br /><b>[Alderweireld admits recent below-par performances have drawn a stinging reaction from <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>]</b> If you are not performing well, he’s angry. That’s normal. He’s a winner. When we don’t win, he’s not happy. That’s very simple. He’s a manager you don’t want to let down. It’s a negative that you don’t want him angry. It’s not about wanting to let him down. We had a good connection with the manager before. We achieved a lot of big things. And it’s the same now - everyone believes in what Jose says and thinks and how we need to play<br /><br />Imagine the last four seasons, four times in top four, improving in Champions League every time and reaching the final - or one FA Cup? It is short-term vision for me. It is always a discussion, FA Cup or top four? Of course, I want to win a trophy but you have to be realistic in what you have achieved. It would be stupid to think the last four seasons were worth nothing because we didn’t win a trophy. The club had taken a lot of big steps, that has taken a lot of big effort in difficult times - at Wembley, going away from <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart</a> Lane, things like that. So, we can see what we have done as some sort of trophy but, of course, we want to win one.</p>

That’s the feeling you get, the feeling I have for him. You don’t want to disappoint him. I guess it looks like I am happier now because the former manager left and I signed a deal.

The manager never gave me any reasons. But I understand that. I am not the guy who knocks on his door and says: ‘Hey, what about me?’. I think that is very selfish. Let’s be honest, he brought this club to the next level and I am grateful for what he did for the club. I think everyone is.

Friday we went in lockdown and Saturday and Sunday we were at home - but on Monday we were straight into zoom sessions and all of the equipment was sent to us at home for our muscles. We got the training we needed to keep our tone in the muscles. We had GPS for the running in the park - not easy running, tough running. So when we got back to training it was not like a holiday.
