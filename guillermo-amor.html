  <p><b>[After helping Adelaide United to a superb win over Melbourne City on Thursday, Reds midfielder James Holland is set for a move to the Chinese Super League]</b> Yes, he goes tomorrow or after tomorrow. The market is open now and this possibility is open and he goes to China. I don’t know if he signed or not signed in this moment, but I know that he goes.</p>

  <p><b>[Adelaide United coach Guillermo Amor insists the struggling A-League champions may still sign some players before the transfer window closes]</b> The club is working on this. Until this moment players have been going and don’t arrive but I think the club is moving and it’s possible in the next few days until the close of the market some players will arrive.<br /><br />When you are winning you want more <b>[goals]</b>, you have confidence. It’s possible the players in the game see the opportunity to get the second goal. I like it when you’re winning to go for the second, go for the third, go for the fourth. This is football. But it’s also important to be intelligent, to have control in every moment. We knew that Wellington in transition is fast, is dangerous with players like <b>[Roy]</b> Krishna, with <b>[Roly]</b> Bonevacia</p>

We lost it’s true, but we go home with a good sensation.</p>

  <p><b>[Adelaide United coach Guillermo Amor applauded his side’s comeback away from home in the AFC Champions League after the Reds drew 3-3 with Gamba Osaka]</b> Today was difficult because we conceded the first goal inside five minutes from a corner. It’s always hard especially away and after we conceded the second goal, which was a very good goal. After being 2-0 down the team wants to win and this is very important. The team believed today and we achieved <b>[a good result]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[Amor highlighted the performances of 20-year-old pair Warland and Ochieng, who stepped into the visitors’ back four in Japan]</b> It’s true that some players couldn’t play today in our team, in our defence. The players that played today in centre-back or full-back in this case, who don’t usually play, were very good</p>

I don’t remember his first game, but I remember the first training session I saw. He was something impressive at that age. We watched him train, we saw him playing and we always had the same question: will he be able to do everything he is doing now in a first-team shirt at Camp Nou?.<br /><br />How he has done it! He has pulverised all expectations. What he has done in the first team is equal or even greater than what he showed us at La Masia</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona director Guillermo Amor recently told when quizzed on reports suggesting that the La Liga leaders have discussed a deal for Griezmann]</b> It could be that <b>[club president Josep Maria]</b> Bartomeu had a meeting with Griezmann’s family. If that’s what the newspaper says, it may be that way, although I do not know. There is good harmony, a good relationship, there can be conversations, rumours are inevitable in the world of football. In the case of Griezmann, there are many players with whom one can be talking and engaging in some kind of relationship in case there is an opportunity. It’s our obligation to have contacts with players.</p>

The debutants have been positive, they have performed to their ability, they are good footballers. Alaves worked a lot, maybe more defensively and they were well positioned. They didn’t want to score and that the minutes went by and it needed to be Leo with a set-play to get the breakthrough<br /><br />If you look at it like that then maybe but we’ve never had problems that Messi plays for Argentina. Messi’s level has not dropped after returning from Argentina. Leo has been here since he was 13 and knows our style of play, he is happy, enjoying himself and surrounded by quality</p>

It is a match won by the teams. Atletico is a great team and could have taken the game too. It has been fairly even. There have been several phases during the match - a start very strong by Atletico, then we have reacted and we have finished at a good level. In the second half we have controlled and dominated. We have not let them out and in the end a genius of Leo has decided it</p>

We were very dominant, they hit us quickly<br /><br />If we consider the first half then I think it was a very good performance. Very good. We had the game under control and had chances, but missed them. If you forgive a team like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> they’ll have their chances.
