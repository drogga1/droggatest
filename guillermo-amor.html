  <p><b>[Barcelona and Bayern Munich confirm agreement in principle for one-year Coutinho loan]</b> I can confirm that there’s an agreement in principle in the case of Coutinho’s loan <b>[to Bayern]</b><br /><br /><b>[When pressed on the club’s interest in the Paris Saint-Germain forward, Amor was less forthcoming]</b> The Coutinho news is true and it has come out, but with Neymar it’s better not to say too much. He is a PSG player and we have a game this evening, so we should focus on winning that</p>

  <p><b>[Guillermo Amor described <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> as the ‘genius’ matchwinner after the Catalans put the clamps on Atletico]</b> Leo has been back to his level again. It is a match won by the teams. Atletico is a great team and could have taken the game too. It has been fairly even. There have been several phases during the match - a start very strong by Atletico, then we have reacted and we have finished at a good level. In the second half we have controlled and dominated. We have not let them out and in the end a genius of Leo has decided it</p>

  <p><b>[Guillermo Amor played down suggestions <a href="ernesto-valverde.html">Ernesto Valverde</a> was close to being sacked after <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s Supercopa de Espana loss to Atletico Madrid]</b> It has bothered us a lot to lose. We continue, this is very long. There are many and very important <b>[games]</b>. Of this you say about Valverde, there is nothing<br /><br /><b>[Amor lamented the final result, with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="gerard-pique.html">Gerard Pique</a> both having goals disallowed by VAR for handball and a marginal offside decision]</b> When you have played football, you know that these things can happen, especially in important games with strong teams. What you think is won, you can lose. In the summary of the game, I think we have dominated the first half. They advance and the two goals that were annulled indicate that we were close and we were superior</p>

  <p><b>[Guillermo Amor says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> ready to pounce for new striker]</b> We cannot name names. Other players have left and we have to wait and see what <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Dembele</a>’s situation is before we decide. If there’s a good opportunity to sign someone, then we’ll see what we can do<br /><br />We repeated the performance from Bilbao. We’ve risen and shown that we’re a winning team. We’re a strong team who want to fight for everything. We’ve shown face and we created a lot of chances. I think we’re also doing well defensively. In a normal situation <b>[the suspended Gerard]</b> <a href="gerard-pique.html">Pique</a> would have started. Today <a href="clement-lenglet.html">Lenglet</a> and <b>[Samuel]</b> <a href="samuel-umtiti.html">Umtiti</a> started and did well. The central defenders played well</p>

  <p><b>[Guillermo Amor says <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> didn’t deserve to beat <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in El Clasico]</b> They pushed up and they pressed us. Their idea was to stop the game. They pressed and created chances. It proved costly for us, but I don’t think they deserved the win. We were very dominant, they hit us quickly<br /><br />If we consider the first half then I think it was a very good performance. Very good. We had the game under control and had chances, but missed them. If you forgive a team like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> they’ll have their chances. Once they scored they saw they could win and were encouraged<br /><br /><a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> was good. He was great in the first half. He created, played and played. But when you lose, everything seems negative. We weren’t bad though. We had a great first half and were the better team. But then things went crazy and we lost control</p>
