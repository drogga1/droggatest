  <p><b>[Dalian Maatsen is the cousin of the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> teenager and, although eight years senior to Ian Maatsen, he was in the Feyenoord academy at the same time. His own football journey saw him line up alongside the likes of <a href="nathan-ake.html">Nathan Ake</a>, Terence Kongolo and Karim Rekik, but he would take time out to watch his cousin in the younger age group]</b> I think everyone is already very proud because we were at Feyenoord together at the youth academy but they said he was too short so he went to Sparta. He did well and then goes to <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>, from <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He was disappointed when he had to leave Feyenoord at seven or eight years old. I am proud because it has gone very quickly. He is training with the first-team squad. When I see the pictures, I say to him, ‘I play with <a href="willian.html">Willian</a>, <a href="marcos-alonso.html">Marcos Alonso</a> and these guys as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> on <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and you are in the same dressing room. Go for it. You have nothing to lose and you are with them’. That’s what I say to him. These things can go quickly one way or another. For him, it is good and he doesn’t need to put too much pressure on himself. He can make his debut this season under <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> but he is 17 years old so he has time. He can still learn from training sessions and youth matches. He is already doing well and he is one of the best in the Under-18s. He can wait for his chance when <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> need him<br /><br /><b>[The Maatsen family only became a footballing one in this generation and a large part of Ian’s success may have come from his father Edward, who is a former military man]</b> His father is disciplined and he told him what to do and not to do. He can get cross if you misbehave. He encouraged him to do extra training. It is good for Ian because he is now 17 and everyone deals with girls and people are inviting you to parties. As a young player at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, if you come back to Holland, everyone treats you like a hero. It is good that his father can teach him to stay focused like that. I am glad he is like his dad because he knows to focus. I am proud of him that he can shut that out at his age</p>
