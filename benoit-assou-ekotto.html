  <p><b>[Former Tottenham full-back Benoit Assou-Ekotto has laughed off claims from Harry Redknapp that he is looking into becoming a porn star]</b> It was just a joke. What is absurd is that it has been taken seriously. As if I wanted to become a porn actor. It made me happy that he <b>[Redknapp]</b> thought of me and said that he wanted me after no contact for three or four years. The joke didn’t bother me at all, it made me laugh. What bothers me is that people take everything so seriously. If he had said that I wanted to be a cosmonaut it would have made less noise!.<br /><br />My mother discovered it on Mother’s Day. She told me that she would have preferred a different gift! The worst part is that since it came out, some of them have contacted me on Twitter. Jacquie and Michel left me a message saying ‘come and see us’. And Dorcel invited me to come for a casting. Not to mention the American actor who wanted me to become his apprentice. It made me laugh and I thank them, but I believe I will continue in football</p>

  <p><b>[Former Tottenham defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto has restarted a feud with Paris Saint-Germain sensation Kylian Mbappe]</b> European players of African origin who hold Africa in their hears and who want to help the sport in Africa … blah, blah, blah … while rushing to play for a European national team make me chuckle. It looks good when you have a cause though.<br /><br /><b>[It sparked a sarcastic response from Mbappe, who twisted Assou Ekotto’s own words as he tweeted a reply. Assou Ekotto responded with a quote from French author Victor Hugo]</b> A lion who copies becomes a monkey<br /><br />Put yourself in the place of the players from Cameroon. You, a French player are going to come to develop us … Stay at home, help your guys in Bondy, in your neighbourhood, in your France. Yes, you love Africa, but you never go there. So what’s the story? Yes, you love your wife, but you go out with another. It’s a game I know, manipulate public opinion, blah, blah blah</p>
