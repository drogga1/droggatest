  <p><b>[Rene Adler is confident of his chances of breaking through for the national team despite his lack of experience]</b> With good performances and favorable circumstances, maybe you can get in before you are 30. There is competition between us of course but our relationship is really comradely. I see Jens as No. 1 for what he’s done and for his personality. I am here to learn and he’s giving me tips. I am realistic, I was surprised to be even invited. I am just trying to do my best and leave a good impression in practice. My first goal is to become a permanent member of the team</p>
