<blockquote>
  <p>[Alex Karidis looked at Ronaldo’s transformation since arriving at Old Trafford as an 18-year-old in 2003] It looks like he has had Botox around the eyes and forehead. His skin is now almost immaculate.<br /><br />Fillers plump up an area where time has deepened the lines, such as smile lines around the mouth. Ronaldo’s face is smooth there now which could be because of fillers which are injected in fluid form into the skin<br /><br />It is possible he has had a tweaking to the tip of his nose although it isn’t drastic. His nose looks smaller than it was ten years ago but that could just be his face evolving<br /><br />[Ronaldo was pictured at a Monaco gala with signs of a receding hairline, a normal thing for many men as they age, but it had seemingly vanished upon his next public appearance] We’re sure the star would want to catch hair loss as soon as it began</p>
