  <p><b>[Jadon Sancho has revealed he will ‘always love’ Pep Guardiola, but felt that leaving Manchester City to join Borussia Dortmund was best for his continued development]</b> When I left City, people doubted me. They said: ‘Oh, you shouldn’t leave Pep Guardiola’. But I thought it was best for me. I’ll always love Pep and the club because they signed me from <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> and helped me to develop into who I am today, and of course I’m also grateful to Dortmund. I’ve been able to take the next step there. I’m thankful to everyone who has been part of my journey so far<br /><br /><b>[The teenager is contracted to remain at Dortmund until 2022]</b> It’s crazy what’s happened because I’m still only 19 and things like that usually happen when you’re 23 or 24. Now it’s about keeping that level. People are waiting for me to dip so they can say I’m a one-hit wonder. I just need to keep playing and hope I stay clear of injuries. I just have to keep working hard and helping the team. That’s the main thing.</p>

  <p><b>[Seattle Sounders vs Borussia Dortmund. England international Jadon Sancho, who has enjoyed a pair of breakout seasons with the club since switching from Manchester City, has spoken of his desire to prove that he is more than a teenage one-hit wonder]</b> It’s crazy what’s happened because I’m still only 19 and things like that usually happen when you’re 23 or 24. Now it’s about keeping that level, People are waiting for me to dip so they can say I’m a one-hit wonder. I just need to keep playing and hope I stay clear of injuries. I just have to keep working hard and helping the team. That’s the main thing<br /><br />I want the guys who step on the field to make sure they’re focused on Dortmund because we obviously want to put on a performance. Fans are paying money to watch us play. So, we need to make sure that the group that gets out there is prepared, organized and anxious to play</p>

  <p><b>[England winger Jadon Sancho fears players will start to fall out of love with football if instances of racism continue to blight the game]</b> I personally think that it just has to stop. No player wants to play football and have abuse like that. It puts the confidence down in players and the love of the sport will go very soon if it doesn’t stop. Everyone should be happy and do what they are doing without receiving racial abuse. I don’t think it is <b>[just]</b> social media. Some fans are just really passionate and obviously they say what they want to say. I feel they need to slow it down a bit - we’re still only human. Just because we play football people might think we are just famous and ignorant to that but we just love the sport and just want to play. It is hard to see things like this because it feels like ‘why should we play football?’. I felt that <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> handled it really well by not reacting and carrying on playing</p>

I am just happy that I’m playing and that’s the main thing. I’m just helping my team and learning every day when I’m on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[England winger was adamant he could block out the outside noise and believed his location helped avoid pressure from the media]</b> I don’t really try to take notice of all the media. I just try to stay focused on my game. Obviously being in Germany has taken off the pressure of the media and I think that’s really helping me a lot and keeping me focused</p>

It means a lot to me personally and for my family it is a special day. I dedicate the goals to my nan, who was a big fan of me but has sadly passed away<br /><br />It was a crazy game. I’m delighted to score my first goal for England. The opener was a bad mistake from us but it was a great comeback.<br /><br /><b>[Sancho acknowledged there are defensive improvements needed despite a fourth Group A win out of four games]</b> I think we started a bit slow <b>[after half-time]</b>.

  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund star Jadon Sancho has aired his frustration at EA Sports once again, this time for getting his hairstyle wrong in the new <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> game]</b> My tattoo has to be in the next part of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. In addition, EA should take a closer look at my hair to get my hair done better. Because actually my hair has a transition on the sides, but not in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> 20. That bothers me when I see it in the game<br /><br />I always look immediately for my rating in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. This year my rating should have been better - especially my passing value. That’s why on Twitter I complained to EA. But I’m sure the number will increase over the course of the season. Of course it’s very important to me. I don’t like to see <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> fall come up short with my ratings. But my numbers speak for themselves: if you look at what I did last season, how many assists I gave, that does not fit in with my rating in FIFA<br /><br /><b>[The former <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> academy star revealed his strategy when it comes to the Ultimate Team mode, saying he tries to get his friends on his side]</b> First I try to buy my friends: <a href="reiss-nelson.html">Reiss Nelson</a>, Marcus Edwards, generally many players from England. Of course, I also get my card as fast as possible and all my team-mates from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>. But that’s not always easy, because a few players are too expensive for my team in the beginning. When I play Ultimate Team, I just look at the strength of the players. I don’t care about chemistry, so <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> should work on that in my opinion: the chemistry should not be decisive. There’s a big difference <b>[from real life]</b>, it’s not a game after all. When a new player joins the team, it always takes a few weeks for him to get used to the new environment and the system.</p>

  <p><b>[England star Jadon Sancho reveals <a href="marco-reus.html">Marco Reus</a> <a href="marco-reus.html">Reus</a>’s <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> warning]</b> The players at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> give me loads of advice because they’re so experienced. <a href="marco-reus.html">Marco Reus</a> is a great player and he keeps telling me that I need to keep working hard in training because someone can take your place at any time. I really listen to that because I believe what he says. There’s always someone below you who wants to take your position. If you work hard week in and week out it makes it hard for them to get picked instead of you. Football’s very competitive and you can’t afford to slacken off<br /><br />Every foreign player who comes to England has to learn English. Spanish players find it different to home. I felt like I’d enjoy adapting and learning a different language. I’ve picked up the training terms really well. When everyone’s speaking German in sessions I understand what they’re saying. Obviously, speaking it fluently is a bit difficult at the moment but I’m picking it up slowly but surely. Moving abroad is different for individuals and it depends on their personality. My situation is that I’ve always been away from home since I was 11. It’s about how you handle situations by yourself. There’ll be many days when it’s difficult. It’s not for everyone. But it’s a good option. You’ve just got to make sure you get the decisions right if you do make the move<br /><br />Ronaldinho was the main guy I used to watch on YouTube. But I liked <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> quite a lot and <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a> when they were playing for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.

Of course. football will be my first love forever<br /><br />Before a game, probably listen to my music, and because I know everyone’s watching, especially for the fans, especially if it’s cold, I don’t want them to just come and support us. I want them to go home smiling and be happy that they came out to the end and watched us win. I’m just trying to be a winner and have that winning mentality every game I go into<br /><br />Personally, I think when we go in front, just to keep our focus, because our focus lacks in that area of the field. When we score, they score straight away, and they get back into the game - I feel like we need to be stronger in that, but other than that, I feel like we play very good football. We connect well, we get great opportunities to score. It’s about keeping that winning mentality to the last whistle</p>
