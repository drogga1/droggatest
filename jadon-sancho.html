  <p><b>[Jadon Sancho has admitted his favourite player is Neymar]</b> Growing up, my ­favourite player was Ronaldinho. That speaks for itself, really. He was such a great player and always played with a smile. Now it’s Neymar, because he’s just different. He takes the mickey out of people. Obviously it’s not good but he’s just being himself, he’s expressing himself and I love that. People are maybe not scared about doing what he does, but they just wouldn’t do the things he’s doing. I just think when you are different you stand out more and I like when ­people stand out because it’s something different, an individuality on the pitch that you just don’t see every day.<br /><br />I think I can be a role model to people growing up. OK, I’m only 18 but age is just a number. If you’re good enough, why not? In England especially, footballers don’t leave the country until they are at least 22. I would say to anyone, ‘Don’t be afraid to follow me and make a move like this’. You are here for one reason and that’s to make it as a footballer. So when they come along you have to take your chances, otherwise you can’t succeed. You can’t be your best if you don’t take chances<br /><br />People ask me why Dortmund - a place where I don’t speak the language. But they play a lot of young players and they have faith in a lot of young players, and that’s really good when you are ­trying to develop as a player. That’s one of the main reasons I came. Plus it’s a big club in a big league, so why not?</p>

  <p><b>[Jadon Sancho says it was ‘crazy how many clubs wanted me’ as he prepared to leave Manchester City]</b> Why Dortmund? It speaks for itself: youngsters get opportunities. You’ve got to thank Dortmund, because it’s unheard of for a team that gets 80,000 fans at every home game to put so much faith in youngsters. It was crazy how many clubs wanted me - it shows how well you’re doing, but I always felt Dortmund was right for me. Of course, it was a big risk. I wasn’t guaranteed playing time, and I had to prove I was good enough to fit in with their side. A few people weren’t sure when I first told them about Dortmund, but I felt this was the best journey for me. Just try it, you know? I like trying new things, so it didn’t really faze me. A few asked me, ‘What if it doesn’t work out?’ but I never thought about that. And look at how it’s worked out now<br /><br />Everyone’s said I exploded in 2018 and, honestly, that’s how it feels. It’s been the best year of my life. If you’d told me a year ago that I’d be talking to you now, I’d have thought you were crazy</p>

  <p><b>[Jadon Sancho sounds warning to fellow Brits seeking to emulate his success at Dortmund]</b> I feel young players are looking to go away now because they are seeing my success - but it’s not easy. People think that because I am doing so well but everyone’s journey is different. Mine was just to come out here and to work on me. I couldn’t speak for other young players but they are probably giving it a thought now. I felt at the time I needed something different. Borussia Dortmund were the club I chose. I thought, ‘This will be my new home and I’ll work very hard to prove myself’</p>

  <p><b>[Jadon Sancho says that he is inspired by Christian Pulisic]</b> The club had shown with a player like Christian Pulisic that they were going in the right way, playing youngsters and giving them a chance. He came from the same situation as me, leaving his family behind. He was so young, and he was brave enough. America is a lot further away than England and he’s taken a bigger step than I have done. How he’s handled that, what he does on the pitch, his mentality <b>[towards]</b> football, it’s just crazy. The passion he has. I admire him.<br /><br />He’s an outstanding player, I really do look up to him. Him going away from home shows that you have to do things to get out of your comfort zone, sometimes. I feel it’s worked for him and it’s working for me now, because we’re both staying focussed and keep training hard.</p>

  <p><b>[Jadon Sancho has warned Tottenham that they will not have it easy against Borussia Dortmund]</b> I watched the games last season. Unfortunately we lost. I wasn’t at the away game, but I was at the home game when we lost and they are a good side. I feel like we have improved since last season, so it won’t be the same match as last year. I think it will be more difficult for them, especially as they have some big players <b>[Harry Kane and Dele Alli]</b> missing out. So it’s going to be a tough one<br /><br />It was mainly Harry Winks who I talked to in the squad. We were both new - I was new and he was kind of new. He welcomed me and I’m good friends with Harry now, we’ve stayed in contact. There was a few conversations after the draw with me, Dele Alli and Harry, just saying ‘see you soon’ and ‘it’s going to be a good match’. Obviously they feel they’re going to win, but we feel we’re going to win</p>

  <p><b>[Sancho following in Ronaldinho’s footsteps]</b> I can’t really speak for everyone, I can only speak on my situation really. My situation was that I just wanted to play football. I’ve always wanted to be a professional footballer, make people watch me and say ‘woah’, like how I used to watch Ronaldinho and go ‘wow, I want to be like him one day’. Hopefully, I could become that level one day and players will look up to me and say wow.<br /><br />My role model was Ronaldinho. The reason behind that is how he just beat people with ease and did things that no one else was doing at his time. That’s why it was him<br /><br />There’s a lot of good players I’ve played with. Raheem Sterling will have to be one. Marco Reus is definitely one. There’s a lot of great players I’ve played with. If I don’t say them, I feel like they’ll be touched<br /><br />Reus, his case is that he’s helped me mature as a player, he can tell when I’m having my game and I’m not. You can see, when he talked to me after I scored against Frankfurt, he was saying ‘Relax, be yourself, you have nothing to lose, you’re playing well so far.’ Frankfurt was a big game and I was a bit nervous and you could tell I was a bit off it but eventually I got into the game. Off the pitch as well, we have a lot of fun together, we talk a lot and chill together. That’s what’s so good about our relationship, on the pitch and off the pitch<br /><br /><b>[Asked to name the best players in the world not called Messi or Ronaldo]</b> Neymar and <b>[Kylian]</b> Mbappe. It speaks for itself, their numbers are crazy. Especially Mbappe, he’s doing very well especially how young he is. He’s setting the tone for every youngster in the world and every youngster should be looking up to him because he’s one crazy thing at his age. He’s won Young Best Player, the World Cup and he’s still young so there’s lots more he can win if he keeps doing his thing</p>

I’m grateful that I’ve got them around me telling me I’m not doing enough - there’s the likes of Mbappe doing crazy things at PSG. They are the kind of people I need to compete with as he’s so young and so am I. That always pushes me when I see Mbappe and Marcus Rashford doing well because I know they are probably looking at me and seeing what I’m doing and it’s probably pushing them. It’s good to see other young players doing well.</p>

Thank you very much. Now I’ve just got to keep working hard. This is not the end of it<br /><br />I feel like that should be every player’s goal. Obviously, I dream of winning the Ballon d’Or, given the likes of those who have won it previously, like Leo Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, <b>[Luka]</b> Modric and Ronaldinho. All these greats have won it, so I feel like that should be a big inspiration to everyone in the world that plays football</p>

Dusseldorf are a very tough side to play against so we’ll wait and see what happens<br /><br />The first half was very good and we got the two goals. In the second half we needed to keep the same character as we did in the first. We need to work on that during the week in training and show better character. I felt like we were forcing the play a lot when we had the ball. In those situations we need to keep calm and relaxed<br /><br />I don’t think it’s a question of maturity. It’s excitement.

  <p><b>[<a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> star Jadon Sancho has aired his frustration at EA Sports once again, this time for getting his hairstyle wrong in the new <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> game]</b> My tattoo has to be in the next part of <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. In addition, EA should take a closer look at my hair to get my hair done better. Because actually my hair has a transition on the sides, but not in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> 20. That bothers me when I see it in the game<br /><br />I always look immediately for my rating in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>. This year my rating should have been better - especially my passing value. That’s why on Twitter I complained to EA. But I’m sure the number will increase over the course of the season. Of course it’s very important to me. I don’t like to see <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> fall come up short with my ratings. But my numbers speak for themselves: if you look at what I did last season, how many assists I gave, that does not fit in with my rating in FIFA<br /><br /><b>[The former <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> academy star revealed his strategy when it comes to the Ultimate Team mode, saying he tries to get his friends on his side]</b> First I try to buy my friends: <a href="reiss-nelson.html">Reiss Nelson</a>, Marcus Edwards, generally many players from England. Of course, I also get my card as fast as possible and all my team-mates from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>. But that’s not always easy, because a few players are too expensive for my team in the beginning. When I play Ultimate Team, I just look at the strength of the players. I don’t care about chemistry, so <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> should work on that in my opinion: the chemistry should not be decisive. There’s a big difference <b>[from real life]</b>, it’s not a game after all. When a new player joins the team, it always takes a few weeks for him to get used to the new environment and the system.</p>

  <p><b>[England star Jadon Sancho reveals <a href="marco-reus.html">Marco Reus</a> <a href="marco-reus.html">Reus</a>’s <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> warning]</b> The players at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> give me loads of advice because they’re so experienced. <a href="marco-reus.html">Marco Reus</a> is a great player and he keeps telling me that I need to keep working hard in training because someone can take your place at any time. I really listen to that because I believe what he says. There’s always someone below you who wants to take your position. If you work hard week in and week out it makes it hard for them to get picked instead of you. Football’s very competitive and you can’t afford to slacken off<br /><br />Every foreign player who comes to England has to learn English. Spanish players find it different to home. I felt like I’d enjoy adapting and learning a different language. I’ve picked up the training terms really well. When everyone’s speaking German in sessions I understand what they’re saying. Obviously, speaking it fluently is a bit difficult at the moment but I’m picking it up slowly but surely. Moving abroad is different for individuals and it depends on their personality. My situation is that I’ve always been away from home since I was 11. It’s about how you handle situations by yourself. There’ll be many days when it’s difficult. It’s not for everyone. But it’s a good option. You’ve just got to make sure you get the decisions right if you do make the move<br /><br /><a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> was the main guy I used to watch on YouTube. But I liked <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> quite a lot and <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a> when they were playing for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.

  <p><b>[Jadon Sancho hopes he can play football every day until he turns 100 years old]</b> I just love football. You can’t really take that out of me - I just love the game, and love the sport. Of course. football will be my first love forever<br /><br />Before a game, probably listen to my music, and because I know everyone’s watching, especially for the fans, especially if it’s cold, I don’t want them to just come and support us. I want them to go home smiling and be happy that they came out to the end and watched us win. I’m just trying to be a winner and have that winning mentality every game I go into<br /><br />Personally, I think when we go in front, just to keep our focus, because our focus lacks in that area of the field. When we score, they score straight away, and they get back into the game - I feel like we need to be stronger in that, but other than that, I feel like we play very good football. We connect well, we get great opportunities to score. It’s about keeping that winning mentality to the last whistle</p>
