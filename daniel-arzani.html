  <p>[Eight months since injuring his ACL on debut for <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>, Australian attacker Daniel Arzani is determined to leave a more lasting impression in Scotland] I’ve set my eyes on next season being a big one for me. A lot of people have been saying I have potential … but at the end of the day there’s still a lot unproven. Right now my main focus is just getting back from this ACL injury and feeling good. For me (Rodgers’ departure) doesn’t change anything. It was a challenge for me to play under <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> at the beginning - his mindset was to have his attackers defend a lot. It’s not an easy team to break into.<br /><br />[The Socceroo did however stress that other young Aussies shouldn’t dismiss the A-League as a stepping stone] Obviously I hadn’t played a lot of games before I went away but I also felt like I had achieved as much as I wanted to achieve in the league there. Not achieve maybe, but I felt like if I had a really good season the next year I’d be in the same position as I was. I see a lot of young players now saying ‘I can’t get game time in the A-League, I’m gonna go overseas’ but if you can’t play in the A-League what are you going to do over there. When I was coming out of the AIS I had a lot of offers to go overseas…we went to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>….Schalke, <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. It was never really a decision for me as I wanted to break into the A-League first</p>

  <p>[While Daniel Arzani ended 2018 on the sidelines following an ACL injury, it was a breakthrough year for the Australian] When we played France, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> and <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> were there and they’re just normal people. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>’s big, like real big, but they’re still just normal people. That was the weirdest thing for me.<br /><br />[Working under now departed coach Warren Joyce, the pacey attacker believes his breakthrough had a lot to do with the Englishman] I think for me Warren was unbelievable and I think he was for a lot of the young players as well. He’s tough as nails and he really takes the young players aside and tells them they have to do extras. He really gets you motivated and gets you going<br /><br />[Arzani revealed every A-League club, but the two in his own city, were interested in him before he signed for Melbourne City] I had like a half offer from Sydney … Wanderers weren’t that keen. All the other clubs I had offers from except the two clubs I wanted to go to - the Sydney clubs. City were pushing really hard to sign me</p>

  <p>[Approaching full fitness after injuring his ACL on debut for <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> last year, Daniel Arzani has revealed positive early talks with new coach <a href="neil-lennon.html">Neil Lennon</a>] I’ve talked a little bit with the new gaffer and, as everyone knows, he’s really passionate about <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. For me, <a href="neil-lennon.html">Neil Lennon</a> is always asking about my rehab and my fitness. The gaffer telling you he wants you back, that’s great to know that he’s keen to get me back in the team. There are a lot of great players here. But, equally, for me, my focus is on myself. I can’t wait to, hopefully, make a mark on the season ahead.<br /><br />[After breaking out in 2018, Arzani ended the year on the sidelines] I’ve had a lot of ups and downs. For me, signing the contract here at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> after the World Cup last year was a high, playing my debut was a high, and obviously my ACL injury was a real low. Getting injured like that when you come to a new club, on your debut, that’s gut-wrenching. When you’re in the gym, you wonder if it will ever get the same again. But it gets better every single day. I’m really excited going into the season</p>
