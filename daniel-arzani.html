  <p>[Approaching full fitness after injuring his ACL on debut for Celtic last year, Daniel Arzani has revealed positive early talks with new coach Neil Lennon] I’ve talked a little bit with the new gaffer and, as everyone knows, he’s really passionate about Celtic. For me, Neil Lennon is always asking about my rehab and my fitness. The gaffer telling you he wants you back, that’s great to know that he’s keen to get me back in the team. There are a lot of great players here. But, equally, for me, my focus is on myself. I can’t wait to, hopefully, make a mark on the season ahead.<br /><br />[After breaking out in 2018, Arzani ended the year on the sidelines] I’ve had a lot of ups and downs. For me, signing the contract here at Celtic after the World Cup last year was a high, playing my debut was a high, and obviously my ACL injury was a real low. Getting injured like that when you come to a new club, on your debut, that’s gut-wrenching. When you’re in the gym, you wonder if it will ever get the same again. But it gets better every single day. I’m really excited going into the season</p>
