<blockquote>
  <p>[Frank Bernhardt points to his hands being tied behind his back as the main reason why Vietnam U22 were able to hand a 3-0 defeat to Malaysia U22] I think that Vietnam was much better than us. They were faster and more precise with their passing. We had a little bit of problem with speed at the beginning after 37 seconds already 1-0, so the system already a problem if you go behind. Vietnam deserve to win the game.<br /><br />We are missing 6 players who would be first choice today. Either the clubs don’t release or they are injured. I had to replace them and this is not easy to have 19 year old guys and they bring directly in their first match that they play, the quality that we need. That is not a problem with one federation, it’s a general problem when the league is running. There are different reasons and this was also the situation why I couldn’t get more than 18 players together. It’s really a difficulty for me to get the players that we need to compete in a better way. For sure we need preparation time for the tournament. We need also all players that can cover all positions. Today we had two midfielders in defence and we can see today that doesn’t work. There are a lot of things that didn’t work today and it’s not something that we can fix in a day or week<br /><br />It is not a shock. It’s a clear picture that our fitness level are not what is needed for international matches. It is also a problem that we can’t gather them before the match. Some came after their league matches while some met us at the airport itself. This is not the perfect preparation for an international match</p>
