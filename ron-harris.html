  <p><b>[Ron Harris, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s iconic hard man on <a href="george-best.html">George Best</a>]</b> <a href="george-best.html">George Best</a> was the best player I ever attempted to kick. The fella was just superb. There are a lot of skilful players out there today, but he was in a different league. Years ago you could tackle from behind; football was a really tough, physical game. But now, if you give someone a bit of a kick, or a whack, the media make a real song and dance over it. Best would have a field day if he could see what it was like today</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata may find himself stuck behind Olivier Giroud in the Chelsea pecking order]</b> <b>[Giroud]</b> seems to link up better with Eden Hazard. The other lad Morata is desperate for goals. He’s had some good opportunities and missed them, and when sometimes when the luck is going with you, you can mishit a shot and it goes in. This fella seems to miss some unbelievable chances and I just feel he’s lacking in a bit of confidence at the moment. The one that seems to be thriving with Eden Hazard is Giroud.<br /><br />I think if Chelsea finish in the top four and make the Champions League, that would be quite a good season because you’ve got a new manager coming in. No disrespect but if you ask the club or the players if they would like to play in the Champions League or this Europa - and the same with the supporters - I’m sure they would plump for the Champions League. If they do manage that, that would be a good start for the manager<br /><br />When you look at the track record over the last 10 years, they only seem to stay a couple of seasons and then they seem to fall out and leave. It would be nice for Sarri to do a stint and win a few things for the club. I think that, without being disrespectful to him, a lot of the Chelsea supporters wouldn’t have known who Sarri was until he came here. So obviously he’s on trial as much as one or two of the players he’s brought in. He seems to have bought wisely at the moment and things seem to be going ever so well for him</p>

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri has a month to avoid a precarious position at Chelsea]</b> That’s for the powers that be <b>[but if I were in charge]</b> I would most probably have a chat with him and say ‘you’ve got until the end of the month to put things right and if not, you’re obviously in a precarious position’. The knives are out for the fella at the moment but it’s up to him now to get the players to rally round. Whether he can do that remains to be seen because they’re playing Manchester United in the cup, the League Cup final coming up and four or five games in the next couple of weeks so I think he needs to put it right otherwise he will be walking.<br /><br />If you look at their last two away performances, they’ve conceded 10 goals. In football, if you leak goals like we’re doing - we were doing it even before those games and I don’t think we look sound enough defensively - you don’t win matches. One of the biggest losses that Chelsea have had is John Terry. John was a leader on the field and he organised things. That doesn’t seem to be happening on the field at the moment. Once you start losing goals, you don’t win matches. Now, they’re going to have a battle to finish in the top four<br /><br />I would think that when you think what he did last year, he was head and shoulders ahead of anyone else. But looking at him playing at the moment, it’s like me, a defender who never crossed the halfway line playing as a striker. He looks totally out of the role he played last season. I think everybody can see that but, obviously, the manager sees different things.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> defender Ron Harris believes that while the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> board may give <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> time if he is appointed]</b> If you look at the top-class managers who have been there, they don’t seem to last more than two years. <b>[But]</b> if Frank did decide to come, I think things would change a little bit and they would give him some time, especially if the transfer embargo comes into force. The question is would <b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> supporters]</b> be happy if it takes two or three years to bring these <b>[young]</b> fellas through? No disrespect to the players out on loan, there is a big, big difference between playing in the lower divisions and having to come and play in the Premiership. As much as some of the lads have done ever so well at Derby on loan, I think it is a different ball game. I’m not knocking sides in the lower divisions, but there are half a dozen tremendous sides in the Premiership. Sometimes supporters can get very impatient</p>
