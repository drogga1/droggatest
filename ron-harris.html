  <p><b>[Ron Harris, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s iconic hard man on <a href="george-best.html">George Best</a>]</b> <a href="george-best.html">George Best</a> was the best player I ever attempted to kick. The fella was just superb. There are a lot of skilful players out there today, but he was in a different league. Years ago you could tackle from behind; football was a really tough, physical game. But now, if you give someone a bit of a kick, or a whack, the media make a real song and dance over it. Best would have a field day if he could see what it was like today</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> defender Ron Harris believes that while the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> board may give <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> time if he is appointed]</b> If you look at the top-class managers who have been there, they don’t seem to last more than two years. <b>[But]</b> if Frank did decide to come, I think things would change a little bit and they would give him some time, especially if the transfer embargo comes into force. The question is would <b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> supporters]</b> be happy if it takes two or three years to bring these <b>[young]</b> fellas through? No disrespect to the players out on loan, there is a big, big difference between playing in the lower divisions and having to come and play in the Premiership. As much as some of the lads have done ever so well at Derby on loan, I think it is a different ball game. I’m not knocking sides in the lower divisions, but there are half a dozen tremendous sides in the Premiership. Sometimes supporters can get very impatient</p>
