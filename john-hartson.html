  <p><b>[Arsenal’s interest in Brendan Rodgers is understandable]</b> Brendan is a man in demand, and rightly so. He worked in England for five or six years and had success at Swansea and Liverpool. He then came up to Scotland and has delivered unbelievable glory in his 20 months at Celtic. That has put him in the limelight, and he has been linked with a number of jobs. When you see a club such as Arsenal being linked with him, then I can see where they are coming from. That said, I worked for Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, and I have total respect and admiration for the man. I’m not comfortable about his potential replacements being spoken about when he is still in the job.<br /><br />However, whether they eventually see Brendan, or anyone else, as their next manager - and whether that be this summer or two years from now - then Arsenal would be able to offer a salary in excess of £8m a year. There would also be a transfer budget of more than £150m. That is bound to be attractive to many, many people. But we are dealing with speculation here. Only Brendan knows what he’d like to do this summer, and beyond. My feeling is that he will stay at Celtic for at least one more year. I think he will want to stay to try to achieve eight titles on the trot. He will maybe then review his position. But he also has a long-term contract with Celtic, and I don’t imagine he will be in any rush to leave. Only time will tell</p>

  <p><b>[Steven Gerrard has been warned that taking the reins at Rangers will see him inheriting a dire and embarrassing side]</b> Pep Guardiola couldn’t do that. Rangers are dire. They were embarrassing in the semi-final, their most senior players were embarrassing. Sunday <b>[in a 5-0 defeat to Celtic]</b>, they were embarrassing. It’s a mismatch at the minute. Rangers are in turmoil, on and off the pitch. They need serious investment. They need a lot of things. Celtic are flying on and off the pitch. They are a long, long way behind. Steven Gerrard will look at that and he’ll say, if he takes Rangers, ‘I can only go one way, and that’s up’. They can’t get any worse. And that’s why if he took the job I don’t think it would do him any harm. He is going to a great club with huge backing, fans-wise.<br /><br />It’s up to Steven whether he wants to wait another four years and work with the young players at Liverpool. Maybe he might get an opportunity to manage the Liverpool first team, there are no guarantees, if Klopp decides to go away. I see it as a wonderful opportunity. He can only take them up, he can’t make them any worse. I think there will always be a place at Liverpool for Gerrard, so if he fails drastically like the last two managers, <b>[Graeme]</b> Murty and <b>[Pedro]</b> Caixinha, then I don’t think it will damage him too much. Because Pep Guardiola couldn’t improve Rangers at the minute. I don’t think they have the quality within that group</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United and Tottenham have been warned that Kieran Tierney would cost more than £20 million]</b> £20m from Bournemouth? Give me a break. I’m not having that. I wouldn’t be entertaining that for a second. First things first. Celtic don’t want to sell and the boy doesn’t want to go. Second of all, how high he goes is entirely up to him. I won’t be the first person or last to say this but Kieran is a player who has the potential to go all the way to be the very top in the game - and I mean the very top. But only if he makes that call himself. There will always be offers on the table if you are playing as well as he is. That’s good for him, it shows just how much he is progressing and the fact that so many clubs are continually keeping tabs on him will tell you the esteem with which he is held.<br /><br />I know how happy and how settled he is at Celtic. Who is to say that he doesn’t buck the trend and decide to be a one-club man? It’s no-one else’s decision to make other than his<br /><br />He reminds me very much of a young Stuart Pearce. He has everything; pace, athleticism, strength, he can cross, he can score, he can defend. Physically he has really worked since he first broke into the Celtic team to work on his stamina and on his strength, and he has got the rewards for that</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Tierney’s many suitors, including Manchester United and Tottenham, have been warned]</b> I have been wracking my brains for a while now and just the other day I eventually came up with an answer. Let me explain. In all my time associated with Celtic, as a player, former player and now supporter, my old team-mate, a decent centre-forward as it so happens, is the only one I can think who was/is as loved as Kieran Tierney. Now that is one compliment to give to the kid from Motherwell. I got a lot of love from the fans. So, too, Neil Lennon, Stan Petrov and right now Scott Brown is an icon and rightly so. But KT really is ‘one of our own’. KT is the hero. He is the fan on the pitch. Had he not been brilliant at football, he would be standing in the corner with all his pals. Is it any wonder, in my view, that no Celtic player has been idolised since that Swedish bloke. He loves Celtic. Everyone knows that. He said just recently that if he could stay at the club for the rest of his career then his dreams would come true. Ah, but you just know what it coming. But. There is always a but. Put yourself in his shoes. Everton will come in with a serious bid, and Tottenham have been mentioned as well, and the lad has a big decision to make. Brendan Rodgers himself said he would never stand in his player’s way if a club met the valuation, which I see as £25 million-plus, and his wages would be as much as esven times what he’s on now - and that’s hardly peanuts<br /><br />Of course Tierney could play down there. That isn’t even up for debate. I have him down as just about the best left back in the country, and by that I mean Britain. At £25m he would be the most expensive Scottish player ever. The money swirling around England is ridiculous, but this is about the right fee for such a talent. The big question now is: what will he do? I would stay at least until the Champions League qualifiers were done and then after that … one or two more seasons and then I’d go. Time is on Tierney’s side. His price tag is only going to go up. He could play with Celtic for another year, gain some more experience, and then make the move we all knew would come. He might go. If he does, good luck to him. He will get a big club, a big pay rise and he’s already part of Celtic folklore. However, it is worth repeating that there is nowhere better to play than Celtic Park. Ask anyone lucky enough to pull on that jersey. The Premier League is one hell of a temptation. But Celtic is a hard place to leave</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal are way behind their rivals in the transfer market and Premier League title race]</b> Arsenal fans are going to have to be patient for a couple of seasons, not demanding such success because I believe they’re still way behind in the market for the best players in the world, I really do. I think I share a lot of opinions even with their own fans. But they’ve appointed Emery, he’s got a very impressive CV behind him in terms of the Europa League. I think they need to be a bit patient with him and I believe in time he’s got the capabilities if he’s given the funds to add to the group they’ve got. But they’re still a long way from signing the best players in the world, as when they come up, when the best players in the world become available, they’re never in for them. They’re never in for them. Why aren’t they in for Hazard? Why aren’t they in for Willian? Why aren’t they in for these big players that would probably cost £80m? I don’t think they’re prepared to go there.<br /><br />I still think they need to spend. I don’t think they’re anywhere near the quality of a Liverpool or a Man City. What are Arsenal playing for, are they playing for a top-four place and a cup run? They can’t win the league with this team. I just think you look at Chelsea who have got a few issues, you look at their top three players - are they going to be at the club? <b>[Thibaut]</b> Courtois, Hazard and Willian - all linked with big moves away. It’s huge for the new Chelsea manager to deal with before his team even kick a ball. You’ve got Liverpool, look how strong they are with their front three. For me, Liverpool and Man City, Man Utd, they’re not going to be happy with finishing second, <b>[Jose]</b> Mourinho’s going to go again. So, I still think Arsenal are in a bit of a transition. I think it’s going to take a bit of time for Emery to put his stamp on the club</p>

  <p><b>[Brendan Rodgers will not leave Celtic anytime soon for a return to the Premier League with either Newcastle or Leicester]</b> I don’t care if Newcastle are looking at him and thinking that he might be the man if they part company with Rafa Benitez or if Leicester are thinking that he might be a better option than Claude Puel. In terms of money, both of these clubs could blow Celtic entirely out of the water, both in terms of what they can offer on a personal level and on a transfer budget. But that isn’t what it is about for Rodgers<br /><br />I think Brendan has his heart set on being the man to deliver the ten. I don’t think he would ever say that publicly and nor do I think that he will really focus too much on anything other than ensuring Celtic get to eight this season, but the bottom line for me is that he is motivated and happy at his work<br /><br />It was interesting that he made the point about the board standing still again in the aftermath of the weekend win over Hibs. For me that is a little reminder as the January window approaches that he expects to be backed in terms of the players that he wants to bring into the club. I think he will get what he wants</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s transfer policy is holding them back from challenging for the title]</b> In terms of the title, there’s going to have to be some money spent, they must back Emery in the transfer market. You know Man City are going to go in for the best players on the planet. Arsenal don’t do that. Liverpool do now, they just spent £60m on a goalkeeper, £75m on Van Dijk, £50m on Keita - and they’ve got three strikers that are incredible. Right through their spine, they are superb. No disrespect to Arsenal, if say for argument’s sake, a Gareth Bale becomes available <b>[they won’t go in]</b>. I know he’s ex-Spurs and it may not happen. But if a top player like that became available and he’s £95m with £40m wages over the next four years, will they go in for him? They might not. But someone like City would and they have. It’s going to take investment, time with Emery and backing from the football club for Arsenal to come close to challenging again.<br /><br /><b>[Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool are by far the strongest clubs in England]</b> The football they play and the players that they have, most teams are playing for third. Chelsea, Tottenham, <b>[Manchester]</b> United. They won’t admit it but deep down they’re wishing they had a <b>[Sergio]</b> Aguero or a <b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne. 	How far are Arsenal away? I think they’re a few years behind in terms of challenging for the title</p>

  <p><b>[Brendan Rodgers has been warned that Leicester are nowhere near Celtic]</b> I see the attraction of Leicester. They are very wealthy. They play in one of the top leagues in the world and there would be money to spend. But I would still argue that in terms of clubs, Leicester are nowhere near Celtic. And I say that with the greatest respect. And I know I have said it before, but for me it is vital for Brendan to leave a legacy at Celtic. He can be the man not just to take them to 10-in-a-row but to 11, to 12, to 13, to 14 … if the board go on and back him this summer then it could be anything. There could be no let up to just how dominant Celtic are in a domestic sense.</p>

  <p><b>[Emery exceeding all post-Wenger expectations at Arsenal]</b> Well they’re in the quarter-final of the Europa League, where they’ve got an opportunity, if they do win it, of getting in the Champions League. They’re in prime position, it’s in their own hands in terms of they’re currently fourth. So it’s in their own hands in terms of qualifying for the top four. Who would have thought it at the start of the season with replacing Arsene Wenger? Yes, he came in and had a great career in terms of what he did at Sevilla. But I think the Arsenal fans will be delighted with the job he’s doing right now.<br /><br />There’s an awful lot more possibilities when you’ve got two strikers. They occupy basically four defenders. Over the years, the last 10 years or so, that’s not been the case. These two have got tremendous pace. They love playing with one another, there’s almost a telepathic link up with them. They look for one another and they can finish when they get the opportunities. I’ve almost been frustrated. Emery has been a little bit reluctant to play these two together</p>

It is a different culture and a different league altogether and a big chance for him. Technically he is very good and he covers more ground than any other player.

  <p><b>[Comparisons to Gareth Bale are unfair on Daniel James]</b> If James ends up at a big club, then it’s up to him to make sure he doesn’t simply disappear. It’s down to his heart and whether he can cope. At 19, I went to ­ Arsenal. I wasn’t sure how it was going to go, but you have to have that bit of ­determination. If you have a good desire and work ethic to improve, then, with the top coaches and being surrounded by ­top-class players, you will. But it’s unfair to start comparing him with ­Gareth Bale, just as it was when Gareth was compared to Ryan Giggs when he first broke into the Wales team. Ryan had 13 Premier League winners’ medals, while Gareth was just starting out. Now it’s Gareth who has four Champions League winners medals - and Daniel is just in his infancy. I wouldn’t want to put any added pressure on him. He has a good family around him. He seems a level-headed lad and I think he will thrive.<br /><br />If they <b>[Swansea]</b> are offered in excess of £20 million for Daniel, then it’s difficult to turn down. It would also be hard to deny the boy the ­opportunity of playing for a ­Manchester United. He was very close to going to Leeds on the final day of the January transfer ­window for £10m. But I believe Swansea pulled the plug on the deal at the last minute because they thought, at that price, it was a steal. The transfer was almost over the line. I believe his parents were at Elland Road with the lad, but Swansea then told Leeds the deal was off. It wasn’t very nice for Daniel because he had probably pinned his hopes on joining Leeds, who then looked like they were on their way to the Premier League. The way things have developed could be better for both ­Swansea and the player. From the club’s point of view, the transfer fee will at least be doubled - while Daniel could join one of the ­Premier League’s top clubs. He is a special ­talent and very, very quick. He runs with the ball, can beat a man and can finish - I watched him score for Wales in only his second game, the winning goal against Slovakia. Ryan Giggs, the Wales ­manager, obviously believes in him. That was ­fantastic for his confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Karamoko Dembele has the potential to be the best of all]</b> It must have been four years ago when I first heard the name Karamoko Dembele. The word from Celtic back then was that a 12-year-old boy in the academy was one of the best they had ever seen. He was smaller than all of his team-mates but had pace, tricks and a touch. I was intrigued. Celtic as a club did their best to keep a lid on him. Too often, young players get ridiculously hyped up which puts unnecessary pressure on them. However, it proved impossible for the academy staff to hide away such a talent. He played for the development team at 13, a story that went around the world. He scored goals for Scotland at youth level. He was given a professional contract at 15. These are not things which happen all the time. And after making his Celtic debut on Sunday at, gulp, 16 years and three months, everyone can see why so many have been excited by Dembele from the first moment the scouts clapped eyes on him.<br /><br />Now, he is 16. We can’t get too excited, says a man with a column about him, because he’s really only starting out. But I can see him playing more first-team games next season. Lenny <b>[Neil Lennon]</b> didn’t put him on as a gimmick. He deserved to be there. Dembele showed great maturity in his first 45 minutes of senior football. His team-mates were keen to get him on the ball because they know how good he is. I watched him playing for the Under-18s at Morton a few weeks ago and he was almost kicked off the park. They doubled up on him because the Morton players knew that allowing him a run at them was not the best plan of action. The Celtic academy is producing some good players, that’s great to see, with Dembele, <b>[Michael]</b> Johnston, following Kieran Tierney, Callum McGregor and James Forrest. This lad might be the best of all. We shall see. But he has one hell of a chance</p>

They were a goal down, they bring on <b>[Lucas]</b> <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Torreira</a> - a defensive midfielder - when you’ve got Pepe and <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a> on the bench. I want to see <b>[Pierre-Emerick]</b> <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> play down the middle. You’re 2-1 down, he’s staying on the right-hand side when he’s a centre-forward and the one who’s going to get you a goal. All in all, very disappointing and on the back of that performance, <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> … They’ve got be starting to ask serious questions of his job now.

The interesting thing for me is, do they earmark a manager and give <b>[Emery]</b> a bit of time in charge, while they look and speak to other mangers and try and get somebody in? Or do they go interim? To a <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> or <a href="steve-bould.html">Steve Bould</a>, who is still at the club, while they search for a new boss. There are still a couple out there. You are almost thinking now, is Emery the right man to make the players better, make the team better? And I am not sure he is.</p>

  <p><b>[John Hartson says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> need to follow the lead of arch-rivals <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and get a proven manager in place]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> can’t afford to dally, to pussyfoot around or give <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> a chance. He may be a favourite with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans as a player but to manage <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> you need a bit more about you and a bit more experience. There are good managers out there. Go after somebody. Be proactive. Do what <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> have done by bringing <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> in straight away. If you’re going to sack a manager, bosh - go and get another one in. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> need direction, they need leadership, they need a freshness and they need somebody to get hold of that dressing room because it’s like a sinking ship at the minute<br /><br /><b>[He added, with <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a>, <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> and <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Massimiliano Allegri</a> among the names in the frame]</b> A lot of managers will fancy the job because it’s a huge challenge.

  <p><b>[Hartson slams ‘unprofessional’ <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> after meek Europa League elimination]</b> Defensively I questioned <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> and <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Mustafi</a> before the game. Are they good enough to take <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> any further, win competitions, into the Champions League? Again tonight they’ve conceded from two corners</p>

  <p><b>[John Hartson says <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> could star at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> for another four years]</b> It’s happened so many times over the years that they’ve allowed good players to run their contracts down and leave for next to nothing. These players are worth a lot of money if they are tied down. So there’s a decision to make on <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>, because if they are going to sell him his best worth is in the summer with a year left on his contract. It’s a big call for <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> to make so early in his <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> tenure<br /><br />No European football could affect the likes of <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>. The best players want to be in the Champions League and he’s a world-class striker. His work-rate is brilliant. He chases lost causes, technically he’s excellent and he scores goals. He’s 30 now, but the way players look after themselves with all the sports science at their disposal these days I expect him to play for some time yet. I feel the shape he’s in he could be a top striker for the next four years at least. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have lots of good youngsters - <b>[Joe]</b> Willock, <b>[Gabriel]</b> <a href="gabriel-martinelli.html">Martinelli</a>, <b>[Bukayo]</b> Saka and <b>[Eddie]</b> <a href="eddie-nketiah.html">Nketiah</a> - and that’s why it’s so important to tie <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> down to help them<br /><br /><a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> will get a couple of transfer windows to try and get them back to where they want to be and I’m sure he’ll be in the market for defenders who defend properly this summer. <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> and <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Shkodran Mustafi</a> are two players you wouldn’t hang your hat on to keep clean sheets and you need those solid defensive foundations to make the Champions League and win cups</p>
