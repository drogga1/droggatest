  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger’s reluctance to spend big on the likes of Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann has been questioned]</b> If he does stay he needs to go after the big players and he needs to make Arsenal competitive again in these next two years. But he never does seem to be in for the big, big players. We now know that this summer Griezmann will probably move from Atletico Madrid and he’s going to cost you £85m and he’s going to cost you £250,000-a-week. We know that Arsenal won’t sign him but they’ve got to. That’s where they need to be because the Chelsea’s will and the Manchester United’s will and the Manchester City’s will. But I just feel pay the wages because it would be a crying shame if Arsene Wenger was to leave and somebody was to come in as the next manager - not even half the nous that Wenger has, not half the knowledge - and he spends £300m overnight. What a crying shame that would be. So if the money’s there why doesn’t he just go and spend it?</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal are no longer good enough to challenge for major honours]</b> I worked under Arsene Wenger and I’ve always sort of been in the camp of ‘Arsene Wenger’s great, he’s done fantastic, the Champions League qualifications, the money that he brings into the club…’, but I just think now it’s time for him to go. It hurts me to say that because I like Arsene Wenger. But last night <b>[against Palace]</b> you would call that performance inept. There was a lack of leadership, lack of togetherness. The players are playing as individuals, they don’t look like a team. There’s a lack of fight and that’s four <b>[away]</b> losses on the trot for Arsenal, that’s the first time in 20-odd years that’s happened to Arsene Wenger<br /><br />Why aren’t they challenging at the very top? It’s because I don’t think the players are good enough. I think there’s a huge expectancy on Arsenal to be challenging but when you look at some of the players who are taking the field for them, I just don’t think they’re up to it. I just don’t think they’re at the standard or the level of a team that are capable of winning the Premier League. The expectation of some of these players is through the roof, and it shouldn’t be because they aren’t up to it. And they fact they went out of the Champions League 10-2 to Bayern Munich, that just goes to show the quality of the player that Arsenal are putting onto the field</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have so much to do before they can land the likes of Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappe]</b> Why would Griezmann come to Arsenal over any of those other teams? In the current climate, whether it’s Arsene’s fault or the people above him, Arsenal is not your first destination if you’re Antoine Griezmann, if you’re Kylian Mbappe. That’s what the problem is right now. It’s not realistic that Arsenal can get them, there’s so much that can be done before they can go in for those players</p>

  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger should splash the cash on star turns such as Romelu Lukaku and Virgil van Dijk to appease Arsenal fans]</b> I think there will be protests if he stays. I think a lot of the supporters want to see a change at Arsenal. That being at the top - the manager. But what would appease the supporters is if he brought in some really big names and he makes a statement then by saying, ‘Well, we’ve got a strong enough squad’.<br /><br />Say, for instance, Romelu Lukaku becomes available at Everton, £60m, whatever it is. Van Dijk for example, £50m. Arsene, the fans are saying, ‘Please be in for these players’. Don’t be £5m out, blah, blah, blah, whatever it is</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale is a super phenomenon who could win Real Madrid the Champions League final in a split seconds even short of full fitness]</b> Gareth Bale, representing Real Madrid, we don’t know if he’s going to start, but if Gareth is 75 per cent fit, I would start him because he’s that type of player that can produce moments of brilliance during games. In a split second he can win the game for you and I think his manager, Mr Zidane, will fully appreciate that. When Gareth is 100 per cent fit, he’s a super phenomenon. If he’s 90% fit, he’s a phenomenon, he’s that good. It’s fantastic for Cardiff to showcase the biggest club game in world football and I think it’s the best two teams throughout the competition that meet in the final.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal need to follow Manchester United’s lead and sign big players without Champions League football]</b> Their priority this summer is to be in for big players. It’s difficult attracting big names, the biggest names in football when you’ve not got Champions League of course. But Manchester United were able to attract them when they didn’t have Champions League. They brought in the likes of Ibrahimoivc, Mkhitaryan, one or two others<br /><br />It’s going to be difficult keeping hold of <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez but I think from Arsene Wenger’s point of view, I’ve not really got a problem with Arsene Wenger staying on as Arsenal manager. He is a terrific manager, a brilliant man, I was fortunate to have worked with Arsene Wenger during my time at Arsenal. But I really want to see him in for the big names that become available in the world of football, I mean the real top, top class players<br /><br />That’s what Arsenal need to challenge and challenge for title honours, of course they just won the FA Cup. I just feel that they need to go in for the big, big players which become available just to make them competitive next season in terms of challenging for the title, because that is what the supporters want</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic full-back Kieran Tierney has emerged as Manchester United’s number one target]</b> I’m hearing he’s Manchester United’s number one target. But why on earth would Brendan Rodgers sell Tierney right now? If I’m Brendan Rodgers, I’m saying to <b>[Jose]</b> Mourinho, ‘Let him have another season here, keep your £25-30m for now, he’s got Champions League football, he loves playing for Celtic’.<br /><br />Give him another year, 18 months at this level until he becomes more of a man, more established, more mature physically, then in 12-18 months’ time, there is no doubt Kieran Tierney will go on and play for one of the top three or four clubs in England, and become one of the best left-backs in Europe.<br /><br />I have every confidence in Kieran Tierney to become a top, top player. He is a great player now, but he can only get better</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal are likely to miss out on a top-four finish again so will need Europa League success to reach the Champions League]</b> I think a top-four place is a big ask for Arsenal, I really do think that. What with Manchester City spending so big, Liverpool as well. Chelsea, and Manchester United under Jose Mourinho of course, are a lot of people’s favourites for the title. But Arsenal can adopt Manchester United’s attitude to the Europa League last season.<br /><br />Mourinho said from the outset he thought it was the best way in for United - he was almost telepathic how he called that. Ajax hadn’t won an away game all the way through the competition, so it was almost as if United absolutely breezed the final it in a strange type of way. United had a couple of tricky away games, but they won it at a canter. I think Arsenal have to take it seriously. In the Europa League, they’re probably favourites to win it behind AC Milan<br /><br />They’ve lost two game in the Premier league already, they go to Chelsea on Sunday where they’ve not won since 2011, so that could be three loses in their first five games. I know they’ve got this great record with qualifying for the Champions League - but last season was a wake-up call. They needed to do a bit more in the transfer window. They brought in Alexandre Lacazette but needed another defender</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s interest in Brendan Rodgers is understandable]</b> Brendan is a man in demand, and rightly so. He worked in England for five or six years and had success at Swansea and Liverpool. He then came up to Scotland and has delivered unbelievable glory in his 20 months at Celtic. That has put him in the limelight, and he has been linked with a number of jobs. When you see a club such as Arsenal being linked with him, then I can see where they are coming from. That said, I worked for Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, and I have total respect and admiration for the man. I’m not comfortable about his potential replacements being spoken about when he is still in the job.<br /><br />However, whether they eventually see Brendan, or anyone else, as their next manager - and whether that be this summer or two years from now - then Arsenal would be able to offer a salary in excess of £8m a year. There would also be a transfer budget of more than £150m. That is bound to be attractive to many, many people. But we are dealing with speculation here. Only Brendan knows what he’d like to do this summer, and beyond. My feeling is that he will stay at Celtic for at least one more year. I think he will want to stay to try to achieve eight titles on the trot. He will maybe then review his position. But he also has a long-term contract with Celtic, and I don’t imagine he will be in any rush to leave. Only time will tell</p>

  <p><b>[Steven Gerrard has been warned that taking the reins at Rangers will see him inheriting a dire and embarrassing side]</b> Pep Guardiola couldn’t do that. Rangers are dire. They were embarrassing in the semi-final, their most senior players were embarrassing. Sunday <b>[in a 5-0 defeat to Celtic]</b>, they were embarrassing. It’s a mismatch at the minute. Rangers are in turmoil, on and off the pitch. They need serious investment. They need a lot of things. Celtic are flying on and off the pitch. They are a long, long way behind. Steven Gerrard will look at that and he’ll say, if he takes Rangers, ‘I can only go one way, and that’s up’. They can’t get any worse. And that’s why if he took the job I don’t think it would do him any harm. He is going to a great club with huge backing, fans-wise.<br /><br />It’s up to Steven whether he wants to wait another four years and work with the young players at Liverpool. Maybe he might get an opportunity to manage the Liverpool first team, there are no guarantees, if Klopp decides to go away. I see it as a wonderful opportunity. He can only take them up, he can’t make them any worse. I think there will always be a place at Liverpool for Gerrard, so if he fails drastically like the last two managers, <b>[Graeme]</b> Murty and <b>[Pedro]</b> Caixinha, then I don’t think it will damage him too much. Because Pep Guardiola couldn’t improve Rangers at the minute. I don’t think they have the quality within that group</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United and Tottenham have been warned that Kieran Tierney would cost more than £20 million]</b> £20m from Bournemouth? Give me a break. I’m not having that. I wouldn’t be entertaining that for a second. First things first. Celtic don’t want to sell and the boy doesn’t want to go. Second of all, how high he goes is entirely up to him. I won’t be the first person or last to say this but Kieran is a player who has the potential to go all the way to be the very top in the game - and I mean the very top. But only if he makes that call himself. There will always be offers on the table if you are playing as well as he is. That’s good for him, it shows just how much he is progressing and the fact that so many clubs are continually keeping tabs on him will tell you the esteem with which he is held.<br /><br />I know how happy and how settled he is at Celtic. Who is to say that he doesn’t buck the trend and decide to be a one-club man? It’s no-one else’s decision to make other than his<br /><br />He reminds me very much of a young Stuart Pearce. He has everything; pace, athleticism, strength, he can cross, he can score, he can defend. Physically he has really worked since he first broke into the Celtic team to work on his stamina and on his strength, and he has got the rewards for that</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Tierney’s many suitors, including Manchester United and Tottenham, have been warned]</b> I have been wracking my brains for a while now and just the other day I eventually came up with an answer. Let me explain. In all my time associated with Celtic, as a player, former player and now supporter, my old team-mate, a decent centre-forward as it so happens, is the only one I can think who was/is as loved as Kieran Tierney. Now that is one compliment to give to the kid from Motherwell. I got a lot of love from the fans. So, too, Neil Lennon, Stan Petrov and right now Scott Brown is an icon and rightly so. But KT really is ‘one of our own’. KT is the hero. He is the fan on the pitch. Had he not been brilliant at football, he would be standing in the corner with all his pals. Is it any wonder, in my view, that no Celtic player has been idolised since that Swedish bloke. He loves Celtic. Everyone knows that. He said just recently that if he could stay at the club for the rest of his career then his dreams would come true. Ah, but you just know what it coming. But. There is always a but. Put yourself in his shoes. Everton will come in with a serious bid, and Tottenham have been mentioned as well, and the lad has a big decision to make. Brendan Rodgers himself said he would never stand in his player’s way if a club met the valuation, which I see as £25 million-plus, and his wages would be as much as esven times what he’s on now - and that’s hardly peanuts<br /><br />Of course Tierney could play down there. That isn’t even up for debate. I have him down as just about the best left back in the country, and by that I mean Britain. At £25m he would be the most expensive Scottish player ever. The money swirling around England is ridiculous, but this is about the right fee for such a talent. The big question now is: what will he do? I would stay at least until the Champions League qualifiers were done and then after that … one or two more seasons and then I’d go. Time is on Tierney’s side. His price tag is only going to go up. He could play with Celtic for another year, gain some more experience, and then make the move we all knew would come. He might go. If he does, good luck to him. He will get a big club, a big pay rise and he’s already part of Celtic folklore. However, it is worth repeating that there is nowhere better to play than Celtic Park. Ask anyone lucky enough to pull on that jersey. The Premier League is one hell of a temptation. But Celtic is a hard place to leave</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal are way behind their rivals in the transfer market and Premier League title race]</b> Arsenal fans are going to have to be patient for a couple of seasons, not demanding such success because I believe they’re still way behind in the market for the best players in the world, I really do. I think I share a lot of opinions even with their own fans. But they’ve appointed Emery, he’s got a very impressive CV behind him in terms of the Europa League. I think they need to be a bit patient with him and I believe in time he’s got the capabilities if he’s given the funds to add to the group they’ve got. But they’re still a long way from signing the best players in the world, as when they come up, when the best players in the world become available, they’re never in for them. They’re never in for them. Why aren’t they in for Hazard? Why aren’t they in for Willian? Why aren’t they in for these big players that would probably cost £80m? I don’t think they’re prepared to go there.<br /><br />I still think they need to spend. I don’t think they’re anywhere near the quality of a Liverpool or a Man City. What are Arsenal playing for, are they playing for a top-four place and a cup run? They can’t win the league with this team. I just think you look at Chelsea who have got a few issues, you look at their top three players - are they going to be at the club? <b>[Thibaut]</b> Courtois, Hazard and Willian - all linked with big moves away. It’s huge for the new Chelsea manager to deal with before his team even kick a ball. You’ve got Liverpool, look how strong they are with their front three. For me, Liverpool and Man City, Man Utd, they’re not going to be happy with finishing second, <b>[Jose]</b> Mourinho’s going to go again. So, I still think Arsenal are in a bit of a transition. I think it’s going to take a bit of time for Emery to put his stamp on the club</p>

In terms of money, both of these clubs could blow Celtic entirely out of the water, both in terms of what they can offer on a personal level and on a transfer budget. But that isn’t what it is about for Rodgers<br /><br />I think Brendan has his heart set on being the man to deliver the ten. I don’t think he would ever say that publicly and nor do I think that he will really focus too much on anything other than ensuring Celtic get to eight this season, but the bottom line for me is that he is motivated and happy at his work<br /><br />It was interesting that he made the point about the board standing still again in the aftermath of the weekend win over Hibs. For me that is a little reminder as the January window approaches that he expects to be backed in terms of the players that he wants to bring into the club. I think he will get what he wants</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s transfer policy is holding them back from challenging for the title]</b> In terms of the title, there’s going to have to be some money spent, they must back Emery in the transfer market. You know Man City are going to go in for the best players on the planet. Arsenal don’t do that. Liverpool do now, they just spent £60m on a goalkeeper, £75m on Van Dijk, £50m on Keita - and they’ve got three strikers that are incredible. Right through their spine, they are superb. No disrespect to Arsenal, if say for argument’s sake, a Gareth Bale becomes available <b>[they won’t go in]</b>. I know he’s ex-Spurs and it may not happen. But if a top player like that became available and he’s £95m with £40m wages over the next four years, will they go in for him? They might not. But someone like City would and they have. It’s going to take investment, time with Emery and backing from the football club for Arsenal to come close to challenging again.<br /><br /><b>[Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool are by far the strongest clubs in England]</b> The football they play and the players that they have, most teams are playing for third. Chelsea, Tottenham, <b>[Manchester]</b> United. They won’t admit it but deep down they’re wishing they had a <b>[Sergio]</b> Aguero or a <b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne. 	How far are Arsenal away?

And I say that with the greatest respect. And I know I have said it before, but for me it is vital for Brendan to leave a legacy at Celtic. He can be the man not just to take them to 10-in-a-row but to 11, to 12, to 13, to 14 … if the board go on and back him this summer then it could be anything.

Who would have thought it at the start of the season with replacing Arsene Wenger? Yes, he came in and had a great career in terms of what he did at Sevilla. But I think the Arsenal fans will be delighted with the job he’s doing right now.<br /><br />There’s an awful lot more possibilities when you’ve got two strikers. They occupy basically four defenders. Over the years, the last 10 years or so, that’s not been the case. These two have got tremendous pace. They love playing with one another, there’s almost a telepathic link up with them. They look for one another and they can finish when they get the opportunities. I’ve almost been frustrated.

If you have a good desire and work ethic to improve, then, with the top coaches and being surrounded by ­top-class players, you will. But it’s unfair to start comparing him with ­Gareth Bale, just as it was when Gareth was compared to Ryan Giggs when he first broke into the Wales team. Ryan had 13 Premier League winners’ medals, while Gareth was just starting out. Now it’s Gareth who has four Champions League winners medals - and Daniel is just in his infancy. I wouldn’t want to put any added pressure on him. He has a good family around him. He seems a level-headed lad and I think he will thrive.<br /><br />If they <b>[Swansea]</b> are offered in excess of £20 million for Daniel, then it’s difficult to turn down. It would also be hard to deny the boy the ­opportunity of playing for a ­Manchester United. He was very close to going to Leeds on the final day of the January transfer ­window for £10m. But I believe Swansea pulled the plug on the deal at the last minute because they thought, at that price, it was a steal. The transfer was almost over the line. I believe his parents were at Elland Road with the lad, but Swansea then told Leeds the deal was off. It wasn’t very nice for Daniel because he had probably pinned his hopes on joining Leeds, who then looked like they were on their way to the Premier League. The way things have developed could be better for both ­Swansea and the player. From the club’s point of view, the transfer fee will at least be doubled - while Daniel could join one of the ­Premier League’s top clubs. He is a special ­talent and very, very quick. He runs with the ball, can beat a man and can finish - I watched him score for Wales in only his second game, the winning goal against Slovakia. Ryan Giggs, the Wales ­manager, obviously believes in him. That was ­fantastic for his confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Karamoko Dembele has the potential to be the best of all]</b> It must have been four years ago when I first heard the name Karamoko Dembele. The word from Celtic back then was that a 12-year-old boy in the academy was one of the best they had ever seen. He was smaller than all of his team-mates but had pace, tricks and a touch. I was intrigued. Celtic as a club did their best to keep a lid on him. Too often, young players get ridiculously hyped up which puts unnecessary pressure on them. However, it proved impossible for the academy staff to hide away such a talent. He played for the development team at 13, a story that went around the world. He scored goals for Scotland at youth level. He was given a professional contract at 15. These are not things which happen all the time. And after making his Celtic debut on Sunday at, gulp, 16 years and three months, everyone can see why so many have been excited by Dembele from the first moment the scouts clapped eyes on him.<br /><br />Now, he is 16. We can’t get too excited, says a man with a column about him, because he’s really only starting out. But I can see him playing more first-team games next season. Lenny <b>[Neil Lennon]</b> didn’t put him on as a gimmick. He deserved to be there. Dembele showed great maturity in his first 45 minutes of senior football. His team-mates were keen to get him on the ball because they know how good he is. I watched him playing for the Under-18s at Morton a few weeks ago and he was almost kicked off the park. They doubled up on him because the Morton players knew that allowing him a run at them was not the best plan of action. The Celtic academy is producing some good players, that’s great to see, with Dembele, <b>[Michael]</b> Johnston, following Kieran Tierney, Callum McGregor and James Forrest. This lad might be the best of all. We shall see. But he has one hell of a chance</p>

I would say at this moment in time he has better delivery but Kieran is a better defensive player. Kieran gets low and defends well and he can also play as wing-back if needed. I watched Robertson when he was playing for Dundee United when I was covering the game and he was good. He went down to Hull and his career fizzled out there but <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> took him for £10m and now he is on fire</p>

  <p><b>[John Hartson says Delusional Emery on the brink at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> That interview to me sounded a bit delusional. It sounded as if he’s hiding from the reality of his team, they are just not quite good enough, the players are not performing to the levels that they should be. I also think, yes we criticised the fact at 2-1 down they didn’t bring <b>[Alexandre]</b> <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a> or <b>[Nicolas]</b> Pepe on, because you know what, if they had done while they’re chasing the goal, he’s probably worried that <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Frankfurt</a> break away and make it embarrassing. They were getting through <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defensively, so he was probably worried more about strength and shoring up defensively rather than going and getting an equaliser.

  <p><b>[John Hartson says <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> could star at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> for another four years]</b> It’s happened so many times over the years that they’ve allowed good players to run their contracts down and leave for next to nothing. These players are worth a lot of money if they are tied down. So there’s a decision to make on <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>, because if they are going to sell him his best worth is in the summer with a year left on his contract.

He’s 30 now, but the way players look after themselves with all the sports science at their disposal these days I expect him to play for some time yet.
