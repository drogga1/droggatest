  <p>[Selangor centre back Ugo Ukah was sent off for headbutting teammate Bunyamin Umar in their 2016 Super League encounter against Sarawak in Kuching] It’s a question of adaptation. I had just arrived to a new country, I needed to meet and know the people. This kind of incidents happen everywhere in every league, it’s normal and it also involves the drive to win games. I remember we drew in the match, missed many chances, and were getting a bit frustrated. But everything is well now, we have good team spirit.<br /><br />We’ve come here to win, to do our best… we’re going to take three points back home to Selangor</p>

  <p>[Nigerian centre back Ugo Ukah is having a sterling season with the Red Giants] Statistically, we are the second best [defensively] in the league after JDT. If it weren’t for the match against PKNS FC [which ended in a 5-3 win to PKNS] where we conceded many goals, I think we would be first now. We’re happy. Although we’ve had to adapt to a different formation, as previously we played with four defenders and now it’s three in the back, it’s a bit different but we’re enjoying it. We feel that [playing] with full backs, now it’s like playing with five defenders. We’re solid, it’s very difficult to find space against us. As long as we keep it like this and try to perform well upfront, score goals and create chances, I think everything will be good.<br /><br />That was a [late] afternoon game, and when you usually play in the evening it’s a bit different in terms of the schedule of the day, what you have to do to prepare for the game. We started very well to score immediately, and I feel we took our foot off the pedal and relaxed a little bit, and PKNS converted the chances they had. It’s that kind of game where you go into it trying to do your best, but things just don’t work out<br /><br />We’ve had some problems in the beginning of the season, a change in management and losing some players who were important to us. We’ve had to rebuild everything very quickly, and credit to the management and the coaching staff, they managed to put together a team, give them shape and purpose. We play hard every game, and I believe we’re doing fine<br /><br />…everything is well now, our team spirit is good. We lost some good players, but the players who are here this season are doing their best and I can say we’re happy. We are trying to reach the target set by the management and our own personal targets, so far so good<br /><br />I think we can make it, you must believe in the quality and in yourself. There have been some games when we thought we were second best, but when things did not go our way, we still showed spirit and courage. We have the quality to do that, we need to perform our best every game, mentally, physically and technically. We are trying to work on that mental aspect, and I’ve seen some results. For example in the game against Pahang [2-2 league draw in April]. Although Pahang were the favourites, we dominated the game. They equalised late in the game, and it was from an offside position too. In football you have bad days and such, but I feel with the shape that we are in now, we have been doing our best to achieve that target</p>
