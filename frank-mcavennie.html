  <p><b>[Frank McAvennie on himself]</b> It was funny because there were no goals being shown on TV. So my life was alright because although most of the football fans knew who I was, the general public didn’t really know what I looked like. Of course, that all changed. I went on the Terry Wogan show. I went on Wogan because I was the top goalscorer in Europe - I think it was - at that time and I had blasted on to the scene. It really did change my life. I played football the next day. But the enormity hit me on the Sunday. I’ll never forget it. I met my mother at Heathrow <b>[Airport]</b> because I’d got her a flight to Australia to see my brother, who was living there. She was flying down from Glasgow. So I parked the car and went into the airport. Then all of a sudden I had a load of ladies surrounding me for my autograph. And it got a bit chaotic. In the end, someone from British Airways took me through because I was getting mobbed. It was bizarre. But that was the moment of realisation when I thought, ‘Wow. I’ve made it’</p>

  <p><b>[Former Hammers frontman Frank McAvennie believes the development of Declan Rice will be better served at Manchester United]</b> I wouldn’t expect him to move on. I don’t think he’s ready for the big clubs yet, or so-called big ones. I think he’s doing wonderful <b>[at West Ham]</b>. He started at centre-half and now he’s a great foil for the captain Mark Noble. I think West Ham have got some wonderful players in midfield like Felipe Anderson, Andriy Yarmolenko and Manuel Lanzini. I just think they’ve got firepower in midfield but they need someone up front, a figure that is going to take them forward. Rice sits there in the middle and he will be there for England and West Ham for many years, I’m hoping.<br /><br />He doesn’t have to go anywhere with the money West Ham pay their players now. If he wants to go to Man United for trophies, they might be a bigger club but they’re not going to win any trophies in the foreseeable future</p>

  <p><b>[Former Scotland international Frank McAvennie thinks <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Gilmour</a> &amp; <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a> can form great midfield for Scotland]</b> <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Gilmour</a> is class. He is really a class talent. He has been fighting for games at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for some time. When I went to <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, I came to England to play against the best. That’s what he has done by leaving Scotland and choosing <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He is doing magnificently in midfield. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> is giving him a chance and I don’t think too many others would have given him a chance.<br /><br />It’s brilliant for a young manager to give young players a chance. I think in a couple of years that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> could be a team to be reckoned with. I think they are a bit too young to challenge this year or next year but I am looking for the year after that when that talent matures.<br /><br />Steve Clark is a friend of mine and manages Scotland but I will still say, if he doesn’t put him in the Scotland squad then I will be surprised. He might be young and new but he bullied those <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players, then he did it again to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>.<br /><br />I was watching him and thinking this is incredible and then I was so proud to be Scottish. Credit to Rangers for bringing him through as well. Good luck to him and I hope he keeps playing well, gets in the Scotland team and dictates the play. If <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> plays alongside him then we can have a great midfield with a big lad in there too. The Celtic boys have tried to do well for Scotland but we have not got to any tournaments or even come close to it. These young boys have to have that chance to do it now.</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd and Chelsea-linked <a href="declan-rice.html">Declan Rice</a> told to sort his life out by <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> icon McAvennie ahead of big-money move]</b> I hope <a href="declan-rice.html">Declan Rice</a> sorts his life out. There are a lot of rumours about him going and I am not sure if he will stay this summer. Look what he did to Ireland. He could not make up his mind. I do not think he will be a stalwart for England over the next few years because they have got a lot of players coming through. Yes, Declan is playing every week but he might think that he has to go to a big club and shine to cement his place in the England side, but if he goes they will be getting big money for him.</p>
