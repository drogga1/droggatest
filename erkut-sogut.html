  <p><b>[Arsenal star Mesut Ozil’s agent has hit out at those that he perceives have made the German playmaker a scapegoat following the 5-1 thumping at the hands of Bayern Munich]</b> Bayern had 74 percent possession. How can someone in the No.10 position create chances if you don’t have the ball? In these games people usually target a player who cost a lot of money and earns a lot of money - that is Mesut. But he can’t be always be the scapegoat. That’s not fair<br /><br />Football is a team sport and Arsenal are not performing well as a team. Eleven players were on the pitch but Mesut was singled out for criticism. Was he the reason that Arsenal conceded five goals? It started before the match, throughout the week leading up to the game. People started discussing: ‘Should he play? Should he be dropped?’. It was as if everyone knew Arsenal would not make it through and we needed a scapegoat. This is not right. You win as a team and you lose as a team<br /><br />I don’t agree that Mesut has not had an impact on big matches. What about the win at home to Chelsea this season and Manchester United the year before? What about the games for Germany against Italy and France at Euro 2016? People are always saying Mesut is not fighting or tackling, that he has poor body language, but that is how he is. Believe me, he is desperate to succeed. If it doesn’t work, he shows his anger and expressions. Was his body language an issue when Arsenal were playing well? He is not someone who runs around aimlessly and tackles just so everyone thinks he is fighting. If it doesn’t make sense to run somewhere he will keep that power for the next run</p>

  <p><b>[How Mesut Ozil’s agent aims to transform the world of football agents through education]</b> I always did business law and sports law, but before my internships I had access to Harun Arslan <b>[agent of Joachim Low]</b>. That was my first step into the business. He’s also from Hanover and represented many players at that time. I didn’t want to be a criminal lawyer or family lawyer. I loved sports and played football at that time. I had a lot of <b>[football]</b> talent but my family never pushed me to sports - they always pushed me to education. My father never watched a game of mine. Even when people talking about my football talent, he said: ‘My son has to study and become a doctor or lawyer.<br /><br />I know where I come from. I always look back and know what kind of childhood I had. I tell all my clients they have to do charitable things. When you’re earning millions you have more than anyone else who would love to be in your position. Without giving, you will not get more. If you don’t share, you will not grow<br /><br />After six months the secretary phoned me and said he wants to meet you, he needs something. I went back to Hanover and he had dealings with one of the football federations, there were letters going in and out. I said I could try and help. I had no previous experience but I told him I’d give everything to do it. I worked on it day and night and it went well for him as he won the case.<br /><br />That was my entry into the business. He <b>[Arslan]</b> was a mentor for me. Our ways split but then we met again after a couple of years. I started to feel what sport business was like and while I was in Turkey I did stuff for him as a runner<br /><br />I’m born in Germany, I grew up in Germany and feel it’s my home but I have never felt German as a nationality or character because I never get the feeling that I’m part of them. It starts at 18 when you don’t get into the nightclubs because you’re Turkish. I go with my same friend from school, his name is Stefan and the other Is Tomas - I don’t get in. I didn’t have access to the nightclub or bar in my city because I’m Turkish and ‘might cause trouble’<br /><br />When I was studying law one of the judges who was sitting on the commitment to choose the judges of the future said to me very openly: ‘You should change your name if you want to become a judge in this country.’ He said if you are not twice better than the German name then you will not get that position<br /><br />The motivation for studying is from my family to give back to them and look after them. It’s something very special for me. I’m living here for four years - I feel more British than I do German and it shouldn’t be like that<br /><br />My work ethic is more German but my background is Turkish so I’m in the middle of two cultures. I always took the great things of both cultures and it’s a positive thing to have different cultures to learn. It’s an amazing thing. You have to give up everything and assimilate yourself to become one of them. We integrate but don’t assimilate. That’s what Polish people or others do in Germany - but Turkish people can’t do that because our culture and religion are different<br /><br />If you bring non-educated people somewhere, then it’s difficult to integrate them as they’re even stronger with their culture background. In the past, they didn’t need them to talk the German language as they just cleaned and went home. It’s changed now and now we’re the fourth or fifth generation<br /><br />I talked to her <b>[Duygu]</b> so many times. I went through the processes of high school, university, masters and a doctorate. He <b>[Mesut]</b> knows I have a different perspective on that because of my experiences. I have done the same with my own sister, who is also a lawyer and studying in Bristol. She is finishing her masters thesis and I helped with many aspects - all the mistakes I made, she avoided<br /><br />If I could go back in time and I had the financial opportunity I would have gone to England or America to study because of the language and the opportunities. I’ve made it happen for my sister. Education opens the door to the world. If you’re not educated, if you don’t speak different languages or a broad-minded nature then you will be easily influenced to others opinions<br /><br />I would love to sit with educated people on one table and talk about a possible deal rather than someone who is talking about escorts and how we can give managers money back somehow, third parties or accounts in Switzerland.<br /><br />What I love is to teach others and that’s why I started teaching during my masters. In the agents business, people don’t like to give knowledge to others because they keep for themselves. If young kids go for an internship in a big agency they don’t show them anything, they just sit there and bring the tea and coffee. They don’t see any contracts and they don’t go into meetings. I do it the other way round. It’s good for the business and myself if there are educated guys and girls coming into this business.<br /><br />Sports is a billion-pound business which is growing every day. There are so many areas in sport where people can contribute. It’s very difficult from the outside because of nepotism at clubs and agencies but I try to tell students they can do it. The motivational part is so important and I always give both - motivation and knowledge - at the same level. I give them examples and tell them stories of what I’ve done and tell them the people in the business today are not better than them - they just came to that place because they worked hard and believed in themselves.<br /><br />The best thing about being a lawyer is having knowledge about contracts. Even if you don’t know certain things, you can learn them quicker. You have an advantage but you have to know how to use it.<br /><br />Some agents are not lawyers but they have very good lawyers next to them. As a person, I will approach a club or player’s family as a lawyer. It assures people that I know what I’m doing and gives them a better feeling than someone coming with a Rolls Royce - something which could give a bad impression to a poor family<br /><br />I will never have more than 10. I say no more than yes to many players. Some agencies have 50 young players but I prefer quality over quantity. It can still be lucrative if you do your job well and believe in yourself. In no other business do you make money as quick as in the football business but that’s why it’s tight and the people who are in the business don’t want anyone to get into it. You need to be patient and never let people say you can’t do anything<br /><br />In 15 years, I see myself as a professor at a university where I’ll be able to teach all the things I’ve learnt during my career. We’re writing a series of books and I hope to publish the first one in March 2018. They’re about how to become a sports agent and it explains different pathways into the business. There’s nothing like that out there right now and I felt that students need something to read to see how they can get into the business. Working with managers, sporting directors, youth players and how to register as an agent. A basic book for anyone to read but especially good for the upcoming agents as the first step<br /><br />There are 24 series of books on a range of topics: sports agents and media; how to approach newspapers, magazines; when to get a lawyer or not; how to create your network in the media.<br /><br />Sports agents and contracts is one of the key books that someone has to learn. Sports agents and families is another key book that someone should learn. For example, with family, how to get a client and keep the client and develop the relationship, bringing them to the next step. The first step going to pitch; second step talking to him or the father, friends. Then, making a contract with them, creating things with a player, contacting sponsors.<br /><br />One book is just working with sponsors - what kind of sponsors are working in sports, how do you approach and meet marketing directors. The other one is how to work with youth players, you can’t do certain things and transfer them. How do you get sports players into business?<br /><br />Sports players and charities too. For example, Charlie is going to the home game as a guest of Mesut with his mother for his birthday. You have to talk to the families and to the club to arrange this. On top of that there are topics on fashion, social media, YouTube channels, Weibo and how to merchandise the social media of the football player to make money.<br /><br />I’ve arranged to create an online education platform for agents. They will be able to go onto the website download some papers, documents, contracts and ask questions on there. My goal is one day that there will be an education programme to become a sports agent which takes one year as a masters programme. I think there will be a three-year bachelor course one day as there is so much you have to learn - law, charitable stuff, media, contracts. You need two or three years to learn everything. I hope to have weekend seminars in London ‘how to become a sports agent’, which I have previously done in Germany and Turkey<br /><br />There are ways to get into the business which I teach as well. How to get an internship at a football club or in sports marketing companies. There are lot of ways to get into the business and to meet people. The motivational part shows as well. You have to be proactive - they’re not coming for you.<br /><br />Most don’t get into the business because they don’t believe they can. If you believe in it then you will try to find ways how to. A lot of young people get desperate and get out as the main agents in the business won’t show them the way. I want to show them the way and teach them how to become a lawyer and then they can approach players by themselves<br /><br /><b>[On February 21, 2014, police were called to Ozil’s home after a photographer claimed he had been struck by Ozil’s car as the player was trying to exit his driveway]</b> It was my first experience with the paparazzi. It was after the Bayern game, when Mesut missed a penalty. He was very upset and they <b>[paparazzi]</b> were waiting right in front of the house. While we were driving out, we saw the photographer put his hand on the wing mirror, push his arm against it and said ‘Ow!’ We couldn’t believe it and thought he was joking.<br /><br />But the police even made Mesut an alcohol test and they checked the cameras on the street. The photographer then sold the story to the papers at a time when Mesut wasn’t playing well. But this is how it is with Mesut: some people love him; some hate him. He’s a very polarising footballer but you have that with a lot of footballers<br /><br />I was watching the game and Bayern had 77 per cent possession. They were controlling the game and Mesut was playing in the No.10 position. We were never in that position in the game. He was picked out as the scapegoat. Why are the defenders conceding five goals then? If we can’t win in Munich, then we don’t lose. There’s no excuse for collapsing - when you play in Munich you play compact and defensively. We played so openly and I just said that he didn’t play well like the rest of the team, but why did the defence concede five goals?<br /><br />But the main target right away was Mesut Ozil. I felt that I had to protect my client. I thought about making a statement the whole night because I felt a feeling that I had to take the pressure off, which was the right thing to do at that time. Criticism is fine when the players play badly but that was used as an excuse for the poor team performance. But, in this world, even if you get down, then you get up again because nobody gives you anything for free</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil’s agent has launched a scathing attack on Martin Keown]</b> I think that Martin Keown feels that just because he used to play football, it gives him the right to attack the current generation of stars. Perhaps he just wants to remain relevant, or maybe it is due to jealousy? Is he envious about the money and exposure that current footballers have - I don’t know. But to sit there and criticise, and criticise, and criticise, time and time again, it’s getting a bit boring, in all honesty. He was an Arsenal reserve so left for Everton and Aston Villa because he wasn’t good enough. He returned to Arsenal but was still a reserve - always in the shadow of Adams/Bould/Dixon/Winterburn and then Campbell/Toure/Lauren/Cole. His behaviour towards <b>[Ruud]</b> Van Nistelrooy at Old Trafford brought shame on Arsenal, he will say it showed his passion when really it was bad sportsmanship.If Mesut, or any other player in this era were to act like that, they would bring great shame upon themselves and their club.<br /><br />In the 2004 Invincible season, Arsene Wenger let him play the last minute vs Leicester to qualify for a winner’s medal. Otherwise he would not be an Invincible because he didn’t play enough games. He wasn’t a real part of the team. Even Keown’s team-mate Ray Parlour said publicly he would have killed Wenger if he did not let him come on the pitch against Leicester. This is again representative of the behaviour against Manchester United - he claims passion, whilst it is really aggression<br /><br />He spent time helping coach the defenders at London Colney some time ago but then it stopped. Why would it stop if he was so good and knew so much about the game? Was it that Arsene Wenger, the players and staff did not want him there? Since then, he has remained an outsider from the club - he has very little knowledge of the internal events at the club, and is in no position to comment with such confidence. Does he have access to medical records… no. He spent many years criticising Wenger. Then it is announced Wenger is leaving and Keown starts to say nice things about Wenger - and after the Burnley game he had the audacity to go on the pitch with the real, and loyal, legends like Robert Pires. He questions Mesut’s loyalty, but can’t stick behind his own arguments - how can his opinion be trusted or validated? On the same programme, even a former Tottenham player <b>[Jermaine Jenas]</b> said Mesut is not in the team to defend. Jenas said he watched Mesut for Real Madrid and Germany and he is in the team to create chances and assist the goals - why when he comes to Arsenal do people think he should completely change the style of play that has earned him so much success. This style of play has earned him more international success than most ever. With 89 caps for Germany <b>[in what some would say is a golden era for the national team]</b>, he has won the most prestigious trophy in football. Keown achieved very little in his 43 caps for England<br /><br />Arsenal will finish the season having scored 54 league goals at the Emirates; their joint-highest tally of home goals in a Premier League campaign, along with 2004/05. So attack is no problem. The problem is defence. How is this the fault of Mesut? Have you looked at how Mesut’s statistics compare to other Arsenal players? Maybe you should do that because you speak badly of him. Why is Mesut the only player Keown criticises? Yet similarly, he is loved by a strong majority of Arsenal fans across the world? When you are a small name compared to all the other football pundits on TV and radio like Thierry Henry, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, is it simply a coincidence that you decide to repeatedly criticise the biggest name in the team? This harks back to the aforementioned points about jealousy and remaining relevant. Did you criticise Mesut with so much passion at a time when the fans were in pain after losing to Atletico because you knew it would give the fans a scapegoat and make you look like a hero who cares the most about Arsenal? They sang your name in the stadium so you must be happy with that. You said that Mesut was not loyal and would run down his contract and leave the club. Good prediction - he signed a new contract. Talking about loyalty and dedication, he has played throughout the season against medical advice. This has been kept hidden from the public, but when you’re attacked so viciously, it deserves a mention. We are responding to you not because your words hurt us but because they are wrong. You cannot break us as you cannot influence the fans and people at the club, all of whom love Mesut. Mesut wants to lead this club forward while you try to divide the club to keep yourself in the public eye and relevant with stupid, incorrect comments. You joke Mesut will have an ‘emotional breakdown’. Do you think it is funny to joke about mental health?</p>

  <p><b>[Ozil’s agent Dr Erkut Sogut reveals how to become a football agent]</b> I realised from the last 10 years that I’ve been in the business how difficult it is to go into a certain football club because someone is standing in front of the door.<br /><br />It gives a good overview about the general business and how to break through in the business. There a lot of ways to get into the business but they have to learn to see how it works. That’s why the book is not very difficult to read. After every chapter we have an expert opinion, which makes things even easier for readers to understand. In one chapter there’s Pere Guardiola saying something, the other chapter Ilhan Gundogan, the agent and uncle of Ilkay Gundogan saying something, then my mentor Harun Aslan is saying something about how to work with coaches. In another chapter, you will find Jorg Neubauer discussing the history of agents, how it developed. It’s really interesting for someone who is outside the business and wants to get a first overview<br /><br />I realised more and more it’s not about the agents. It’s about the guys inside the clubs who allow these agents to get in and out as they’re running a club. The problem is not the agents, there will be bad agents who are not good for their clients, but really dodgy stuff is coming from the clubs. Because the clubs just allow it. That’s why I want educated people thinking long term. Even people inside the clubs will change. The guys will change in the next five to 10 years so more educated people who really want to do a good job can come in<br /><br />How to Become a Football Agent: The Guide’ also touches on investing in life after football. A good agent will seek financial advisers, an accountant and help their clients maintain a similar level of financial freedom once they retire from the game. Sogut’s Family and Football agency represents a multi-stranded company which focuses on keeping family members of the players ‘inside’. There are agents who just do deals and disappear and there are agents who really look after their clients with everything. That’s why I separate these two categories of agents. Either you’re just a deal broker who leaves the player to one side and only appears when there is a contract renewal or deal to be done. Or you do what we do. That’s why we have fewer clients and work directly with the families together. That’s why we call ourselves ‘Family and Football’. Every family member is involved. We work directly with the family members. We have very few players and they are all quality players. That’s why we can give them a really good service with everything. We can focus on them. I don’t believe in an agency with 100 players. How can you give them the services? It’s impossible. It’s just a factory. That’s why we can have time for our clients to find ways and investments to make money after their career. We don’t just leave it to any wealth management and say go and have a meeting.<br /><br />You have to imagine the family is looking after the boy their whole life from the birth, bringing him to the training ground every day and then when he turns 17, suddenly from the left-hand side an agent is coming in saying: ‘I’ll do the deal,’ taking 100 per cent commission and the family is still reliant on the player. They have to ask the son for money. I don’t think that is really fair in my opinion. I think some family members realise that. That’s why we have a lot of family members today acting as agents and that’s only going to increase. They realised they can do it by themselves. They can work with agents together, with a lawyer together and I think that’s what will happen in the future<br /><br />Personally I want more educated people in the business, more transparency in the business, I want more that clubs are working with the right agents. I want more education for agents, an exam for agents. Tomorrow anyone can become an agent but there is no education or knowledge and that’s the danger for that business as well. A good idea could be an exam or educational programme controlled either by the football federations or by FIFA itself that gives some education for someone who wants to get into the business. What I believe is in the future we will have many more lawyers and educated people with backgrounds in university who will run the business</p>

  <p><b>[Ozil’s agent offers stunning response to ‘foolish’ criticism from Bayern president Uli Hoeness]</b> The comments of Mr Hoeness miss the point completely, as they have absolutely nothing to do with football. He is trying to divert attention away from the real issue, the issue of racism and discrimination in Germany, which is resurging once again within everyday German society. As Mesut said in his statement, he accepts reasonable and fair criticism of his football, and deals with that as part of the job. However, Mr Hoeness cannot even provide any actual evidence to back up his foolish statements that are clearly exaggerated. In this case, the stats are clear. Twenty-three goals, 40 assists - which is a German record - and five-time German player of the year - three of which come after 2014.<br /><br />He claims that Mesut has been a ‘ghost’ for years, but what ‘ghost’ wins all these awards and has this much success? Mesut created more chances in the 2018 World Cup per 90 minutes than any other player, but, of course, he singles him out for criticism. As the president of Bayern Munich is it not best to focus on the performance of his own players seeing as eight of the Germany team play for the club. If Mesut is such a bad player, what does this say about his opinion on Joachim Low, Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho? These are three elite managers who praise Mesut as one of the best in his position. It is laughable that he thinks he is more qualified to judge footballing abilities than these people, with fabricated statistics.<br /><br />It is obvious that his comment about Mesut not making any tackles is completely made up and false. But, just so everyone knows, in both the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Euros, Mesut won over 65 per cent of duels per game, moreover he was the most important player in the games against France and Italy in 2016, again making a complete mockery of his ludicrous comments.<br /><br />The facts speak for themselves and anyway who is he to speak about Mesut in this way? These lies are cheap, stereotypical and baseless comments - made without any foundations - that allow hurtful news to spread. Mr Hoeness, we will not waste any more time or energy talking about a subject clearly you know nothing about. Not only is he a disgrace to yourself, but also and more importantly a shame to German football and the people of Germany.<br /><br />Hoeness has very conveniently attempted to direct the conversation to football. You will have noticed that Mesut’s statement did not place great focus on football and anyway he accepts football-related criticism. The real issue is that which was previously mentioned - the resurgence of the racism and indiscriminate scapegoating he has been subjected to.<br /><br />He has shown the courage and bravery to speak up for all of those who are unfairly treated in Germany. Immigrants, Muslims and more. These are people he does not represent. Hoeness is clearly one of those people who is not able to face the issues that are in front of him, and is the one hiding behind false stats.<br /><br />Hoeness is no better than the people Mesut mentioned in his statement, as he has purposefully ignored this wider point. And has done so on purpose. Hoeness knows what he is doing. Issuing crazy comments about Mesut’s football, he thinks, it will create a big reaction and will cover the real issue. The issue he and many in Germany are scared to confront, an issue he would prefer to sweep under the carpet because he can’t face the uncomfortable truth. He shows the depth of his character and his true personality by ignoring this and making idiotic comments about football. Well, I will not let him succeed. Mesut has given everything for Germany on and off the pitch - contributed more to the country than he could ever dream of</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil snubbed crazy offers from Asia in order to stay at Arsenal]</b> We had some really big offers from Asia, there were some crazy offers. But for Mesut, money was by no means the biggest factor. Money is definitely one important thing to consider, but people must remember that footballing ability is just one aspect of a contract negotiation. The commercial impact of a footballer is crucial nowadays. Mesut has the biggest social media following of any player in the Premier League and I just read that his shirt numbers were the largest at the club. At the end of the day, this is all information that has to be taken into consideration. So, the commercial side is very big with a player like Mesut, who has played in different countries and was the No. 10 of the national team, where he won the World Cup. His market is worldwide. The club makes money out of these players as well, but it came down to what was in his heart. We were free to sign with other clubs and in the end Mesut loves the club.

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil’s agent has refuted rumours that the Arsenal star could leave the club]</b> I would prefer not to speak publicly about Mesut’s situation, but given the recent speculation linking him with a move away from Arsenal, I do feel it is important to provide some clarity so we can end this and focus on football. Mesut signed a new contract last January because he saw his future at Arsenal and nothing has changed in his mind. He wants to stay for the duration of that contract and maybe even longer.<br /><br />Mesut is 100 per cent committed to Arsenal Football Club. He loves the club, shares its values and does not want to be anywhere else. He is proud to wear the shirt and honoured to represent Arsenal on and off the pitch. He takes his responsibilities - including being selected as one of the captains this season - very seriously and has a great relationship with his team-mates, the staff and fans.<br /><br />In the last year, there has been enormous upheaval for everybody at the club and the first half of this season has not been perfect for Mesut. He has suffered from injuries and illness, and is working hard to adapt to the different system employed by head coach Unai Emery. This may take time, but Mesut will give everything he has to help make it work and bring success to Arsenal<br /><br />People might say I only have Mesut’s best interests at heart, but this is not true. I also represented Arsenal in his contract renewal and in other deals, too. This information is publicly available and I am acutely aware of my professional duty on this front. I do want the best for my client, of course, but I want the best for Arsenal as well. Mesut has faced criticism and obstacles throughout his career, but he has always responded and behaved in a positive and dignified manner. He does not feel the need to speak personally because he is focusing all of his efforts on getting fully fit, improving his form and consistency, and letting his football do the talking<br /><br />Mesut joined Arsenal in 2013 and has therefore been a part of the club for longer than most of the current playing squad and even many members of staff. Over those five-and-a-half years, he has shown total commitment and professionalism. He has not spent long periods injured and maintained a high level of performance, as the statistics show. Despite what some may say, he understands the fabric and expectations of the club better than most.<br /><br />Unless you are on the inside and privy to what happens on a daily basis, it is best not to speculate. In every journey there are highs and lows, but it is important to consider the bigger picture rather than simply making knee-jerk judgements without proper context. The speculation around Mesut’s future has not come from him or us and is unfortunate because the situation is clear: his future is with Arsenal, end of story</p>

  <p><b>[Erkut Sogut says <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> will honour <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> contract &amp; could sign another]</b> At the moment, we don’t even talk about it, because he still has one-and-a-half-years left. He still has 15 months to go. Until then, he will stay at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, for sure. He will stay until the end of his contract. There’s no chance he’ll leave<br /><br />And he will have probably 100 million followers on the social media side at that time, his marketing will be bigger by that time. And he’s 32 so he can still go and play in top-level football for the next two or three years<br /><br />I look at every option, I need to maximise and get the best contract for him. The options are coming in now. Maybe he will stay and have a new contract with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. Maybe he has a good end to the season and good next season and the club offers him a new contract. It’s down to the club in the end, not to me or Mesut. If the club is not giving him an offer then he can’t stay. If he gets an offer from the club he will consider it.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>’s agent tells <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players to reject 30% wage cut proposal]</b> It is not easy for everyone but it’s time for the clubs to talk directly to the players and their representatives to solve this problem. This is what we are lacking right now. And the one thing that can be done is a deferral. That is a start, to say, ‘Let’s defer these payments to the end of the year or next year’. That is something players and clubs can agree quickly, so the clubs know they will have no cash problems and go on for the next three months. A deferral is a protection for everyone. I wouldn’t recommend agreeing a cut today because I don’t know tomorrow if the league will be played, if clubs will get TV and sponsorship money. What the exact financial impact is on the clubs, we can see three to six months later - but we can’t see it today</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="jamie-carragher.html">Jamie Carragher</a> says <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>’s wage cut refusal a huge PR own goal]</b> If a club is asking players to take a material pay reduction, a cut, or a deferment then the club is likely to need to really be transparent about its financial circumstances in order for players to make an informed choice about the extent they should be expected to assist the club through the coming months. It is not enough for a club to present a proposal to one member of the first-team squad and then ask them to go to the rest of the squad and get their consent to do it. That is not how individual contract negotiations should take place. A club may even ask a first-team manager to negotiate with players and this may influence some, particularly younger players or those on the fringe who fear there might be personal repercussions for him if he does not agree. In those circumstances it could be questionable that any consent from the players would be legally binding anyway as some players are not in a position to give true consent if they are under pressure to do so<br /><br />You might hear 20 per cent, 30 per cent. It’s not enough to say a percentage. It’s more the club really needs to explain why this percentage. What other measures have the club considered and implemented? Will the club reduce or increase its transfer budget? If so, by how much? Will the clubs be capping the salaries of new signings? Will the directors or senior management also be taking pay reductions during the period? If so, in what way? Will the club be ceasing all dividend payments to shareholders and if so, for what period? The players need to know about that. The players are entitled to know what will happen if they don’t agree. What will happen if I say no? Is this a genuine choice for the player or is there sanctions?</p>
