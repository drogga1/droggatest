  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil’s agent has launched a scathing attack on Martin Keown]</b> I think that Martin Keown feels that just because he used to play football, it gives him the right to attack the current generation of stars. Perhaps he just wants to remain relevant, or maybe it is due to jealousy? Is he envious about the money and exposure that current footballers have - I don’t know. But to sit there and criticise, and criticise, and criticise, time and time again, it’s getting a bit boring, in all honesty. He was an Arsenal reserve so left for Everton and Aston Villa because he wasn’t good enough. He returned to Arsenal but was still a reserve - always in the shadow of Adams/Bould/Dixon/Winterburn and then Campbell/Toure/Lauren/Cole. His behaviour towards <b>[Ruud]</b> Van Nistelrooy at Old Trafford brought shame on Arsenal, he will say it showed his passion when really it was bad sportsmanship.If Mesut, or any other player in this era were to act like that, they would bring great shame upon themselves and their club.<br /><br />In the 2004 Invincible season, Arsene Wenger let him play the last minute vs Leicester to qualify for a winner’s medal. Otherwise he would not be an Invincible because he didn’t play enough games. He wasn’t a real part of the team. Even Keown’s team-mate Ray Parlour said publicly he would have killed Wenger if he did not let him come on the pitch against Leicester. This is again representative of the behaviour against Manchester United - he claims passion, whilst it is really aggression<br /><br />He spent time helping coach the defenders at London Colney some time ago but then it stopped. Why would it stop if he was so good and knew so much about the game? Was it that Arsene Wenger, the players and staff did not want him there? Since then, he has remained an outsider from the club - he has very little knowledge of the internal events at the club, and is in no position to comment with such confidence. Does he have access to medical records… no. He spent many years criticising Wenger. Then it is announced Wenger is leaving and Keown starts to say nice things about Wenger - and after the Burnley game he had the audacity to go on the pitch with the real, and loyal, legends like Robert Pires. He questions Mesut’s loyalty, but can’t stick behind his own arguments - how can his opinion be trusted or validated? On the same programme, even a former Tottenham player <b>[Jermaine Jenas]</b> said Mesut is not in the team to defend. Jenas said he watched Mesut for Real Madrid and Germany and he is in the team to create chances and assist the goals - why when he comes to Arsenal do people think he should completely change the style of play that has earned him so much success. This style of play has earned him more international success than most ever. With 89 caps for Germany <b>[in what some would say is a golden era for the national team]</b>, he has won the most prestigious trophy in football. Keown achieved very little in his 43 caps for England<br /><br />Arsenal will finish the season having scored 54 league goals at the Emirates; their joint-highest tally of home goals in a Premier League campaign, along with 2004/05. So attack is no problem. The problem is defence. How is this the fault of Mesut? Have you looked at how Mesut’s statistics compare to other Arsenal players? Maybe you should do that because you speak badly of him. Why is Mesut the only player Keown criticises? Yet similarly, he is loved by a strong majority of Arsenal fans across the world? When you are a small name compared to all the other football pundits on TV and radio like Thierry Henry, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, is it simply a coincidence that you decide to repeatedly criticise the biggest name in the team? This harks back to the aforementioned points about jealousy and remaining relevant. Did you criticise Mesut with so much passion at a time when the fans were in pain after losing to Atletico because you knew it would give the fans a scapegoat and make you look like a hero who cares the most about Arsenal? They sang your name in the stadium so you must be happy with that. You said that Mesut was not loyal and would run down his contract and leave the club. Good prediction - he signed a new contract. Talking about loyalty and dedication, he has played throughout the season against medical advice. This has been kept hidden from the public, but when you’re attacked so viciously, it deserves a mention. We are responding to you not because your words hurt us but because they are wrong. You cannot break us as you cannot influence the fans and people at the club, all of whom love Mesut. Mesut wants to lead this club forward while you try to divide the club to keep yourself in the public eye and relevant with stupid, incorrect comments. You joke Mesut will have an ‘emotional breakdown’. Do you think it is funny to joke about mental health?</p>

  <p><b>[Ozil’s agent Dr Erkut Sogut reveals how to become a football agent]</b> I realised from the last 10 years that I’ve been in the business how difficult it is to go into a certain football club because someone is standing in front of the door.<br /><br />It gives a good overview about the general business and how to break through in the business. There a lot of ways to get into the business but they have to learn to see how it works. That’s why the book is not very difficult to read. After every chapter we have an expert opinion, which makes things even easier for readers to understand. In one chapter there’s Pere Guardiola saying something, the other chapter Ilhan Gundogan, the agent and uncle of Ilkay Gundogan saying something, then my mentor Harun Aslan is saying something about how to work with coaches. In another chapter, you will find Jorg Neubauer discussing the history of agents, how it developed. It’s really interesting for someone who is outside the business and wants to get a first overview<br /><br />I realised more and more it’s not about the agents. It’s about the guys inside the clubs who allow these agents to get in and out as they’re running a club. The problem is not the agents, there will be bad agents who are not good for their clients, but really dodgy stuff is coming from the clubs. Because the clubs just allow it. That’s why I want educated people thinking long term. Even people inside the clubs will change. The guys will change in the next five to 10 years so more educated people who really want to do a good job can come in<br /><br />How to Become a Football Agent: The Guide’ also touches on investing in life after football. A good agent will seek financial advisers, an accountant and help their clients maintain a similar level of financial freedom once they retire from the game. Sogut’s Family and Football agency represents a multi-stranded company which focuses on keeping family members of the players ‘inside’. There are agents who just do deals and disappear and there are agents who really look after their clients with everything. That’s why I separate these two categories of agents. Either you’re just a deal broker who leaves the player to one side and only appears when there is a contract renewal or deal to be done. Or you do what we do. That’s why we have fewer clients and work directly with the families together. That’s why we call ourselves ‘Family and Football’. Every family member is involved. We work directly with the family members. We have very few players and they are all quality players. That’s why we can give them a really good service with everything. We can focus on them. I don’t believe in an agency with 100 players. How can you give them the services? It’s impossible. It’s just a factory. That’s why we can have time for our clients to find ways and investments to make money after their career. We don’t just leave it to any wealth management and say go and have a meeting.<br /><br />You have to imagine the family is looking after the boy their whole life from the birth, bringing him to the training ground every day and then when he turns 17, suddenly from the left-hand side an agent is coming in saying: ‘I’ll do the deal,’ taking 100 per cent commission and the family is still reliant on the player. They have to ask the son for money. I don’t think that is really fair in my opinion. I think some family members realise that. That’s why we have a lot of family members today acting as agents and that’s only going to increase. They realised they can do it by themselves. They can work with agents together, with a lawyer together and I think that’s what will happen in the future<br /><br />Personally I want more educated people in the business, more transparency in the business, I want more that clubs are working with the right agents. I want more education for agents, an exam for agents. Tomorrow anyone can become an agent but there is no education or knowledge and that’s the danger for that business as well. A good idea could be an exam or educational programme controlled either by the football federations or by FIFA itself that gives some education for someone who wants to get into the business. What I believe is in the future we will have many more lawyers and educated people with backgrounds in university who will run the business</p>

  <p><b>[Ozil’s agent offers stunning response to ‘foolish’ criticism from Bayern president Uli Hoeness]</b> The comments of Mr Hoeness miss the point completely, as they have absolutely nothing to do with football. He is trying to divert attention away from the real issue, the issue of racism and discrimination in Germany, which is resurging once again within everyday German society. As Mesut said in his statement, he accepts reasonable and fair criticism of his football, and deals with that as part of the job. However, Mr Hoeness cannot even provide any actual evidence to back up his foolish statements that are clearly exaggerated. In this case, the stats are clear. Twenty-three goals, 40 assists - which is a German record - and five-time German player of the year - three of which come after 2014.<br /><br />He claims that Mesut has been a ‘ghost’ for years, but what ‘ghost’ wins all these awards and has this much success? Mesut created more chances in the 2018 World Cup per 90 minutes than any other player, but, of course, he singles him out for criticism. As the president of Bayern Munich is it not best to focus on the performance of his own players seeing as eight of the Germany team play for the club. If Mesut is such a bad player, what does this say about his opinion on Joachim Low, Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho? These are three elite managers who praise Mesut as one of the best in his position. It is laughable that he thinks he is more qualified to judge footballing abilities than these people, with fabricated statistics.<br /><br />It is obvious that his comment about Mesut not making any tackles is completely made up and false. But, just so everyone knows, in both the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Euros, Mesut won over 65 per cent of duels per game, moreover he was the most important player in the games against France and Italy in 2016, again making a complete mockery of his ludicrous comments.<br /><br />The facts speak for themselves and anyway who is he to speak about Mesut in this way? These lies are cheap, stereotypical and baseless comments - made without any foundations - that allow hurtful news to spread. Mr Hoeness, we will not waste any more time or energy talking about a subject clearly you know nothing about. Not only is he a disgrace to yourself, but also and more importantly a shame to German football and the people of Germany.<br /><br />Hoeness has very conveniently attempted to direct the conversation to football. You will have noticed that Mesut’s statement did not place great focus on football and anyway he accepts football-related criticism. The real issue is that which was previously mentioned - the resurgence of the racism and indiscriminate scapegoating he has been subjected to.<br /><br />He has shown the courage and bravery to speak up for all of those who are unfairly treated in Germany. Immigrants, Muslims and more. These are people he does not represent. Hoeness is clearly one of those people who is not able to face the issues that are in front of him, and is the one hiding behind false stats.<br /><br />Hoeness is no better than the people Mesut mentioned in his statement, as he has purposefully ignored this wider point. And has done so on purpose. Hoeness knows what he is doing. Issuing crazy comments about Mesut’s football, he thinks, it will create a big reaction and will cover the real issue. The issue he and many in Germany are scared to confront, an issue he would prefer to sweep under the carpet because he can’t face the uncomfortable truth. He shows the depth of his character and his true personality by ignoring this and making idiotic comments about football. Well, I will not let him succeed. Mesut has given everything for Germany on and off the pitch - contributed more to the country than he could ever dream of</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil snubbed crazy offers from Asia in order to stay at Arsenal]</b> We had some really big offers from Asia, there were some crazy offers. But for Mesut, money was by no means the biggest factor. Money is definitely one important thing to consider, but people must remember that footballing ability is just one aspect of a contract negotiation. The commercial impact of a footballer is crucial nowadays. Mesut has the biggest social media following of any player in the Premier League and I just read that his shirt numbers were the largest at the club. At the end of the day, this is all information that has to be taken into consideration. So, the commercial side is very big with a player like Mesut, who has played in different countries and was the No. 10 of the national team, where he won the World Cup. His market is worldwide. The club makes money out of these players as well, but it came down to what was in his heart. We were free to sign with other clubs and in the end Mesut loves the club. I put everything to him and he just said, ‘This is my home, I want to be here’.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal stuck with overpaid Ozil as transfer window closes]</b> I would prefer not to speak publicly about Mesut’s situation, but given the recent speculation linking him with a move away from Arsenal, I do feel it is important to provide some clarity so we can end this and focus on football. Mesut signed a new contract last January because he saw his future at Arsenal and nothing has changed in his mind. He wants to stay for the duration of that contract and maybe even longer. Mesut is 100 per cent committed to Arsenal Football Club. He loves the club, shares its values and does not want to be anywhere else. He is proud to wear the shirt and honoured to represent Arsenal on and off the pitch. He takes his responsibilities - including being selected as one of the captains this season - very seriously and has a great relationship with his team-mates, the staff and fans.</p>

  <p><b>[Erkut Sogut says <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> will honour <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> contract &amp; could sign another]</b> At the moment, we don’t even talk about it, because he still has one-and-a-half-years left. He still has 15 months to go. Until then, he will stay at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, for sure. He will stay until the end of his contract. There’s no chance he’ll leave<br /><br />And he will have probably 100 million followers on the social media side at that time, his marketing will be bigger by that time. And he’s 32 so he can still go and play in top-level football for the next two or three years<br /><br />I look at every option, I need to maximise and get the best contract for him. The options are coming in now. Maybe he will stay and have a new contract with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. Maybe he has a good end to the season and good next season and the club offers him a new contract. It’s down to the club in the end, not to me or Mesut. If the club is not giving him an offer then he can’t stay. If he gets an offer from the club he will consider it.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>’s agent tells <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players to reject 30% wage cut proposal]</b> It is not easy for everyone but it’s time for the clubs to talk directly to the players and their representatives to solve this problem. This is what we are lacking right now. And the one thing that can be done is a deferral. That is a start, to say, ‘Let’s defer these payments to the end of the year or next year’. That is something players and clubs can agree quickly, so the clubs know they will have no cash problems and go on for the next three months. A deferral is a protection for everyone. I wouldn’t recommend agreeing a cut today because I don’t know tomorrow if the league will be played, if clubs will get TV and sponsorship money. What the exact financial impact is on the clubs, we can see three to six months later - but we can’t see it today</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="jamie-carragher.html">Jamie Carragher</a> says <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>’s wage cut refusal a huge PR own goal]</b> If a club is asking players to take a material pay reduction, a cut, or a deferment then the club is likely to need to really be transparent about its financial circumstances in order for players to make an informed choice about the extent they should be expected to assist the club through the coming months. It is not enough for a club to present a proposal to one member of the first-team squad and then ask them to go to the rest of the squad and get their consent to do it. That is not how individual contract negotiations should take place. A club may even ask a first-team manager to negotiate with players and this may influence some, particularly younger players or those on the fringe who fear there might be personal repercussions for him if he does not agree. In those circumstances it could be questionable that any consent from the players would be legally binding anyway as some players are not in a position to give true consent if they are under pressure to do so<br /><br />You might hear 20 per cent, 30 per cent. It’s not enough to say a percentage. It’s more the club really needs to explain why this percentage. What other measures have the club considered and implemented? Will the club reduce or increase its transfer budget? If so, by how much? Will the clubs be capping the salaries of new signings? Will the directors or senior management also be taking pay reductions during the period? If so, in what way? Will the club be ceasing all dividend payments to shareholders and if so, for what period? The players need to know about that. The players are entitled to know what will happen if they don’t agree. What will happen if I say no? Is this a genuine choice for the player or is there sanctions?</p>
