  <p><b>[Newcastle Jets duo Mateo Poljak and Andrew Nabbout have underlined the importance of beating Western Sydney Wanderers as they battle for A-League finals spots]</b> Our main objective is to make that top six and Wanderers are definitely one of our opponents that are closer to us and we need to break away from them. So it’s a big opportunity for us to break away from them and consolidate that top-six spot.</p>

  <p><b>[As Melbourne Victory captain Mark Milligan raised the 2014-15 A-League championship trophy, Andrew Nabbout could be seen smiling and celebrating on stage]</b> It’s always difficult for a young player trying to break through because it’s a club with such big expectations. Any coach is going to put out their strongest 11 to win every week because that’s what is expected and I accepted that. It kind of made me work harder and keep pushing for a spot, but it wasn’t to be unfortunately.<br /><br />I took a couple of weeks off to rest the body but I was waiting for something to come up. I thought a club would have been interested at that point. But unfortunately come the end of October when the new season started there was nothing on. I had a week-long trial with the Mariners which I thought went really well but unfortunately nothing came of it<br /><br /><b>[The unique move to Malaysia saw Nabbout hit top form in a weaker league]</b> It was a good experience for me because I gained a lot of confidence. The league wasn’t as good as the A-League but it helped me strengthen my attacking game.<br /><br />It helped me realise what my strengths were and work harder on them every week and it was a good league to do that because the standard wasn’t as high as Australia<br /><br />This time around <b>[at the Jets]</b> I know not to be complacent because at some points I kind of got a little bit comfortable at Victory. They brought in players I didn’t know what to do cause I wasn’t playing as much as what I was. I took everything I learned about myself in Malaysia, everything I learned in my last year at Victory about not being complacent and working that extra little bit to get ahead - and so far at Newcastle it’s worked<br /><br /><b>[Nabbout has pundits calling for a Socceroos selection]</b> It’s on the back of every player’s mind. It’s a chance to put yourself in a shop window for the World Cup and of course that’s going to be playing on my mind especially as my name has been mentioned before. If I keep playing the way I have been playing recently and hopefully keep going the rest of the season like this then if the call comes, it comes, and I’ll be more than ready and happy to take it. Until then it’s club football and it’s number one on my mind</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle Jets star Andrew Nabbout says new coach Ernie Merrick has changed the club’s fortunes through the attacking football mentality he has brought to the team]</b> The attacking mentality that Ernie’s brought has completely changed the dynamic for the team. We play a lot more exciting football and we are very adventurous going forward, which is really good because we have the players to do so. I think he has given us that real emphasis on attacking and really being on the front foot.<br /><br />He has given the attacking players the freedom to roam around in the front third. No matter what time in the game we are always switching positions such as the winger coming inside and someone taking his place out wide. As you saw against the Wanderers the other day, our full backs were pretty much playing as wingers, which meant their wingers were playing as full backs. We had them on the backfoot the whole game. That’s what we have been doing the whole season and that’s really the mentality Ernie has brought and we’ve all bought into that..<br /><br />I love playing at AAMI Park - the crowd is always unbelievable so it will be good to go back there. I love the stadium, I love the atmosphere the fans bring and you know it’s going to be a really good game. Coming up against <b>[the Victory]</b> last time, everyone wrote us off. Hopefully this weekend we can start on the front foot again and really get at them</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle Jets gun Andrew Nabbout believes it’s hard for young players to make the grade at his ex-club Melbourne Victory because of the expectation]</b> For any young player it’s always going to be difficult at a club of Victory’s size because they have to win every week. The year that I got less game time at Victory was the year they won the championship and you saw the quality attacking players at the club then. Any coach is going to put out their strongest 11 to win every week because that’s what is expected and I accepted that. But it’s going to be tough for any young player as you have seen by a lot of the young players who have left there<br /><br />My time at Victory was obviously tough as a young player not getting any game time. When they brought in players I didn’t know what to do cause I wasn’t playing as much as what I was. This time around <b>[at the Jets]</b> I know not to be complacent because at some points I kind of got a little bit comfortable at Victory. I took everything I learned about myself in Malaysia and worked that extra little bit to get ahead - so far at Newcastle it’s worked<br /><br />It wasn’t so much payback. There is no bad blood between me and anyone at the club. Sometimes it’s good to prove to yourself that even though things didn’t work out before, that you deserve to be where you are.</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos striker Andrew Nabbout determined to overcome injury]</b> They say the second time is a little bit quicker. I will be right…it’s fine now, there is no pain. I’ll start rehabbing it and see how we go from there. When I landed on it, it was in an awkward position and popped out - nothing I haven’t felt before. I have always got positive thoughts on my mind. Hopefully if I rehab it quick enough, anything can happen, I rehabbed pretty quick from the last on.</p>
