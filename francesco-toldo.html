  <p><b>[Inter Goalkeeper Francesco Toldo Retires From Football]</b> I have decided. I will stop playing. I will stop playing football. This is the first time I have said this officially, and so I am emotional. My holidays this year will be very long in the sense that I will stop playing football. But, despite this, I will continue to stay withing the club and co-operate with Inter Campus, seeking to increase the club’s high image<br /><br /><b>[Toldo played second fiddle to Julio Cesar since his arrival five years ago, but he insists he was happy to take a step back and remain with the club, rather than leave]</b> I think that the group has been correct with regards to everyone and honest with each other. As a result victories started to arrive and they have done the environment well. Therefore the personal situations were cast aside for the best of the group<br /><br /><b>[The 38-year-old, at the club since 2001, said he would not organise a farewell match]</b> No, I will not have one</p>

  <p><b>[Former Inter goalkeeper Francesco Toldo says <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> boss <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> is the best manager I have worked under]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is the best coach I have worked under. He has, of course, certain qualities and something more compared to other coaches. Despite playing less than 10 games in <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s two seasons at <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a>, Toldo praised the manner in which the Portuguese manager dealt with the players. In order to win this trophy you have to the right human, psychological and technical qualities and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> does.<br /><br />To win the treble last season is quite an amazing achievement and only a few teams over the world will be able to say the same thing. He made the difference for us and we had this great understanding between the coach and the players, and the fans with the team<br /><br /><b>[When asked about whether he felt <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, who masterminded <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s 1-0 victory over <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in the Copa del Rey final last week, was unfairly accused of sending out teams to play negative football]</b> It might be that some matches require this strategy, but as well as I know <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, I know that he will go for victory from the start against Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[Former Inter goalkeeper Francesco Toldo says The criticism directed at Julio Cesar is excessive]</b> The criticism is certainly excessive. I believe Julio is still a great goalkeeper who can be relied upon for a long time. Right now he is just struggling with some fitness problems</p>

  <p><b>[Francesco Toldo does not believe Italy are among the favourites to win Euro 2016]</b> It’s going to be tough for Italy. We are below other teams given the general situation now in Italy, not only in terms of sport. To be honest, I don’t see one single player standing out for us. At this moment we don’t have a leader. However, Italy is a country full of resources. <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> has done a great job, we have good young prospects. This is our hope.<br /><br />The youngsters need to listen to their coach, they’ve got the talent and the qualities. They need to be self-confident and that will make a difference. But it is the team that is important. A single player can’t make the difference nowadays. In modern football you have to play as a team for 90 minutes, otherwise you have no chance.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gianluigi Buffon</a> is likely to be an important figure for Italy at the Euros and Toldo feels they will struggle once the <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> shot-stopper retires from international football]</b> Gigi has cast a big shadow, it’s difficult to envisage a keeper other than him in goal. It has happened in the past with Dino Zoff. In Italy, we have some new goalkeepers, but they need to prove themselves at international level</p>
