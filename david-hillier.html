<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil is really happy at Arsenal]</b> I don’t understand how the situation’s got to this stage. First of all, I’ll say that Mesut Ozil, if you are privy to some of the videos and the training ground stuff that I see, the way that he is with the lads and the way that he conducts himself - it’s like none of this is happening to him. He’s really happy and all the players are happy with him and the staff and the managers are all happy with him.<br /><br />I don’t think there’s an issue with Mesut’s game. I think the issue is when he’s left out of the side so many times, he then starts to lose his consistent level he was playing at. So every time he comes back into the side, like coming back into the side <b>[off the bench against Southampton]</b>, whenever he gets on the pitch he’s expected to do something so special to warrant a place in the side the next game. He can’t say: ‘I’ve played the last 12 games, I’ve had eight good, three average and one bad.’ He hasn’t got that in the locker, so he’s putting himself under pressure every time. It’s not just him putting himself under pressure. The crowd are putting him under pressure, the manager, his players around him. All inadvertently because they want him to do so well.</p>
