  <p>[The man who has been tasked with ensuring the PSV academy delivers on that ambition is Ernest Faber. He was born and raised in Eindhoven and enjoyed a lengthy spell in the first team himself] PSV are like a family to me. I started here when I was 12 and I’m now 47. I was a youngster when PSV had players like Romario and Ronaldo. The club had the ability to sign big stars at the time. But now there is such a big difference when it comes to the money, you have to spend. The amounts of money that are being spent are too much for a club like PSV. I think the process to take the academy to the next level already started around 2007 or 2010. They put a program in place and every head of academy since has been adding new levels to that<br /><br />[That change of focus already paid off when a certain Memphis Depay graduated from the academy and eventually made his first-team debut in 2011-12] You look at players like Memphis or other players who took the same route. They’re playing in the first team already when they’re 16 or 17. You get playing time, you get experience on a high level, you fight for the league title, you play in the Champions League and you’re playing cup finals. You get the space to develop yourself. You need that experience to go to the big leagues because over there you are still a young player even when you are 23<br /><br />[In August they will be opening a brand-new building at De Herdgang that should further support their biggest talents] We have made a big investment into a high-tech building with the latest innovation to support and develop the players more and better than we have been able to do in previous years. Everything is being taken care of for the players. They get nice clothes, nice shoes, everything is there in the dressing room. Everything is being looked after</p>
