  <p><b>[Argentina left-back Nicolas Tagliafico has said his side want to take the pressure off superstar Lionel Messi ahead of their Copa America campaign]</b> It is hard to play against him and a plus watching him in your team. We must work hard to avoid overloading him with pressure and allow him to enjoy things.<br /><br /><b>[The 26-year-old admitted that winning the Copa America will be difficult for his side]</b> We will try to play a great Copa America but we are not thinking about being champions. We want to show our best version. We all have the dream of becoming champions but we are in a transition stage and the ultimate goal is not being the champions, but creating a good group for doing everything possible to be champions<br /><br /><b>[Tagliafico is another of those coming off an impressive club campaign with Ajax]</b> Together we decided to stay one more season and leave next season if it has to happen. We are now one of the strongest teams in Europe after reaching the Champions League semi-final. I am so happy in Amsterdam, the people love me and I feel so good. So it is good to keep enjoying one more season and let’s see what happens in a year<br /><br /><b>[One player who is not staying in Amsterdam is <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a>]</b> Frenkie has huge qualities and he is so intelligent on the pitch. Frenkie will have success for sure in Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolas Tagliafico hailed Messi’s desire]</b> I am lucky enough to have been in the same team as Messi before and his desire is what impresses me the most. He keeps wanting to come back and keep trying, it’s incredible. He is the same as he was at the World Cup, he is calm, relaxed and has the same desire as ever</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolas Tagliafico responds to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> links and hints at summer <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> exit]</b> It was always my goal to play in the best competitions, at a top club. <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> is a great club, but the Eredivisie is not a great competition. You must always have dreams. The preparations will start in August for around two months. But whether or not I’ll leave… It’s all uncertain.<br /><br /><b>[Ajax is a great club, but the Eredivisie is not a great competition. You must always have dreams. The preparations will start in August for around two months. But whether or not I’ll leave… It’s all uncertain]</b> I’m trying to think about my condition, to stay fit as possible in case I go to another club. I’m standing on the sidelines. Maybe I’m on <b>[Barcelona’s]</b> list, but there is nothing concrete. You must stay calm. I’m also trying to stay calm. If something happens then I’ll talk with my agent</p>
