  <p><b>[Ajax defender Nicolas Tagliafico will not be disrespectful to his current club]</b> I am enjoying life and football. We are privileged as footballers. Our work is something fascinating and something we love to do. I enjoy playing for the national team and my club. I can’t think of what’s coming, that’s disrespectful to my club.<br /><br />It’s great that they talk about me, because that means things are going well. But I can only focus on the present. Friday we <b>[Argentina]</b> have to beat Venezuela and that’s what counts</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolas Tagliafico has opened the door for a possible summer move to Arsenal]</b> I think in the summer it could be a natural time to take the step. But I try not to think about taking that step just yet because we have many important games to focus on. Yes, it’s flattering <b>[the links to English clubs]</b> because I think it’s the most competitive league. When you are a child, the target is to come to Europe and play in a top league like the Premier League. I came to Ajax because of the philosophy, the style of football and the club.<br /><br />I could have gone to Betis in Spain, but I knew that at Ajax I would learn and improve which made it the best step - and it’s happened as I predicted. It was the perfect moment to come to Europe, it was late because I was 25, it’s late for a player. It was tough to take the decision, but I needed to take a risk. We’ve had this same plan for a long time. It’s a club that is used to selling young players so we know we have to rebuild every now and then. But this year especially was one of the best years because the squad and the players which got together was really good and the players, the staff and the fans are together. We’re on the same path like a family.<br /><br />We will have the same determination that we had against Real Madrid, this time against Juventus. We know it’s really tough, they are a great team and, on top of that, they have great players like Cristiano Ronaldo. With our tools, now well-known by everybody, we can play without fear again to get another big result against Juventus. We are fearless. We went to Madrid determined to enjoy ourselves. It was our best game we’ve played this year. It was perfect. The first game was almost perfect even though the result was not good but the second game was amazing. Just amazing. Now, against Juventus, we need another perfect game, but why not? I think it was one of the best moments in the last decades for Ajax. We have to make the most of it, enjoy it because I believe we can carry on making history</p>

  <p><b>[Argentina left-back Nicolas Tagliafico has said his side want to take the pressure off superstar <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> ahead of their Copa America campaign]</b> It is hard to play against him and a plus watching him in your team. We must work hard to avoid overloading him with pressure and allow him to enjoy things.<br /><br /><b>[The 26-year-old admitted that winning the Copa America will be difficult for his side]</b> We will try to play a great Copa America but we are not thinking about being champions. We want to show our best version. We all have the dream of becoming champions but we are in a transition stage and the ultimate goal is not being the champions, but creating a good group for doing everything possible to be champions<br /><br /><b>[Tagliafico is another of those coming off an impressive club campaign with <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>]</b> Together we decided to stay one more season and leave next season if it has to happen. We are now one of the strongest teams in Europe after reaching the Champions League semi-final. I am so happy in Amsterdam, the people love me and I feel so good. So it is good to keep enjoying one more season and let’s see what happens in a year<br /><br /><b>[One player who is not staying in Amsterdam is <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a>]</b> Frenkie has huge qualities and he is so intelligent on the pitch. Frenkie will have success for sure in Barcelona</p>

He keeps wanting to come back and keep trying, it’s incredible. He is the same as he was at the World Cup, he is calm, relaxed and has the same desire as ever</p>
