  <p>[Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim has come out and criticised his opponents for the post of Malaysian FA [FAM] president post] Be smart, as a General who served in the Indian Army once told me, ‘Never underestimate the power of a politician who is desperate, willing to do or say anything to keep their job as they will manipulate the innocent minds for their own personal interest’.<br /><br />[When asked about the difference between him and his opponents] They are nice people. Myself on the other hand, I’m arrogant. But the difference between us is that they need the money, the position, and then kill your dreams. I have the resources to fulfill your dreams<br /><br />[when asked about the first thing he would say on his first day in the office at the FAM headquarters] No wonder hell is empty. Everyone’s here<br /><br />For now I don’t do much thinking because I’m busy working hard to purchase a foreign football club maybe in Europe if it is His [God’s] will, and I’m busy with my job in Johor. And I’m an arrogant person, I’m not qualified. The qualified ones are only politicians, ministers with honesty, wise about football and full of integrity</p>

  <p>[FAM presidential candidate Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim wants Malaysian fans to meet him in Kuala Lumpur next week for a discussion] …they should give football back to the people. Again, I will elaborate further on this matter but not now. …But know this, what I will do will be something the football fans in Malaysia will never forget it. I do not need a long time to do it, but they will never forget it. Whatever I do, I do it for the people. Not for myself, it is common knowledge that football is not my bread and butter. …I won’t be able to accomplish it alone. This is not a one man show, and if I were to do it, it will be with the people. This is the time for us to improve and move forward together. Stay united as one and then implement the ideas and policies together with the common aim to further develop the football of our nation.<br /><br />I’ll will be coming to KL next week to represent my father at the Rulers Conference. I would like to take this opportunity to invite all fans across the nation to come to see me and ask me anything they want. They can take this opportunity to voice out their current disappointments or rather anything they want and I will give them my point of view and solutions. I’m not afraid to face the fans, nor am I nervous because I know what I’m doing. I know what I’m about to do and I’m very confident that we will get results<br /><br />I would only like to speak to people who really want to improve football and I believe those people are the fans. I’m prepared to be the voice of the fans, representing the fans to further develop and improve football. I am here to serve you and this is the chance for you to tell me what you want and I will do the best I can to get it done.<br /><br />I know there are a lot of state affiliates who will be supporting Tan Sri Anuar Musa under the instructions from the Youth and Sports Minister</p>
