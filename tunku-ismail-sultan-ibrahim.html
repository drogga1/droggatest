  <p><b>[Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim has come out and criticised his opponents for the post of Malaysian FA <b>[FAM]</b> president post]</b> Be smart, as a General who served in the Indian Army once told me, ‘Never underestimate the power of a politician who is desperate, willing to do or say anything to keep their job as they will manipulate the innocent minds for their own personal interest’.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the difference between him and his opponents]</b> They are nice people. Myself on the other hand, I’m arrogant. But the difference between us is that they need the money, the position, and then kill your dreams. I have the resources to fulfill your dreams<br /><br /><b>[when asked about the first thing he would say on his first day in the office at the FAM headquarters]</b> No wonder hell is empty. Everyone’s here<br /><br />For now I don’t do much thinking because I’m busy working hard to purchase a foreign football club maybe in Europe if it is His <b>[God’s]</b> will, and I’m busy with my job in Johor. And I’m an arrogant person, I’m not qualified. The qualified ones are only politicians, ministers with honesty, wise about football and full of integrity</p>

  <p><b>[FAM presidential candidate Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim wants Malaysian fans to meet him in Kuala Lumpur next week for a discussion]</b> …they should give football back to the people. Again, I will elaborate further on this matter but not now. …But know this, what I will do will be something the football fans in Malaysia will never forget it. I do not need a long time to do it, but they will never forget it. Whatever I do, I do it for the people. Not for myself, it is common knowledge that football is not my bread and butter. …I won’t be able to accomplish it alone. This is not a one man show, and if I were to do it, it will be with the people. This is the time for us to improve and move forward together. Stay united as one and then implement the ideas and policies together with the common aim to further develop the football of our nation.<br /><br />I’ll will be coming to KL next week to represent my father at the Rulers Conference. I would like to take this opportunity to invite all fans across the nation to come to see me and ask me anything they want. They can take this opportunity to voice out their current disappointments or rather anything they want and I will give them my point of view and solutions. I’m not afraid to face the fans, nor am I nervous because I know what I’m doing. I know what I’m about to do and I’m very confident that we will get results<br /><br />I would only like to speak to people who really want to improve football and I believe those people are the fans. I’m prepared to be the voice of the fans, representing the fans to further develop and improve football. I am here to serve you and this is the chance for you to tell me what you want and I will do the best I can to get it done.<br /><br />I know there are a lot of state affiliates who will be supporting Tan Sri Anuar Musa under the instructions from the Youth and Sports Minister</p>

  <p><b>[Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim has criticised JDT fans who demand instant success]</b> I would like to congratulate and thank the Boys of Straits and the loyal fans that have been standing by us since 2013 compared to the few fans and unofficial pages that they have just shown up after we became champions.<br /><br />Those fans seem to only know how to make unreasonable and unrealistic demands. They only know how give negative remarks without realising that the key to our success is unity. These fans more often hide behind excuses and they do not give us any constructive criticisms but instead pointing finger and playing the blame game<br /><br />This year we took <b>[a]</b> different approach and set different targets. We added six to seven new and young players who had to adapt to our system. This year, the target is to finish top four in the league and QF for the FA Cup. We have achieved our target for the FA Cup<br /><br />We are playing with a local striker as opposed to our competitors who depend heavily on their foreign strikers. A number of fans claim that Mario did a better job. But they have forgotten the players that Mario had. Even he admitted that he does not think he would have been able to achieve anything with our current squad</p>

  <p><b>[Crown Prince of Johor, Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim, ‘TMJ’, was officially installed as the new President of Football Association of Malaysia]</b> Congratulations to all that won today but they shouldn’t be too comfortable. What is important is that we are aware of our responsibilities and the trust given to us. Football belongs to the people and we are serving them. I call upon everyone here to be mindful of their integrity, professionalism and dedication towards their job.</p>

  <p><b>[Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim wasted no time in getting down to work after being confirmed in his new position]</b> I need to clean my house first before I do anything. Everybody has to follow my momentum and pace. I’m a young man and I like to get things done. But I’m not worried about that because I’ll my people everywhere and I’m very hands on.<br /><br />The fans <b>[are the biggest challenge]</b>. The fans want to win the world Cup and that is the biggest. The football has been in a slump for 30 years and we have to be realistic. I’m gonna be with the team, the coaches, the players and we’re going to fight for it. The target is to improve the system so that in long term we can have a very good football nation in terms of systems and structures that are in place</p>

  <p><b>[New Football Association of Malaysia president Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim has declared Olyroos coach Josep Gombau could be a long-term target for the Malaysian national team]</b> I like a lot to be honest with you, Australia’s Under 23 coach, which is Josep Gombau from Barcelona. I like him a lot. I’ve been looking at him and following him. I like how he changed the ideology and philosophy of the game in Australia, which was played very differently before, and this is a positive thing. I have short-term plans and I have long-term plans but first we have to do one step at a time.</p>

  <p><b>[The Malaysian FA will not continue their pursuit of former Johor Darul Ta’zim head coach Mario Gomez]</b> I was informed that Mario Gomez has denied asking for a high salary. We offered him USD25,000 but he asked for USD40,000. Isn’t he asking for more than what we have offered? No problem, we will look for another individual who really wants to be the Malaysia coach.<br /><br />I have set a policy whereby the foreign <b>[head]</b> coach <b>[at the national team]</b> must be assisted by a local coach. Isn’t Tan Cheng Hoe currently a good local coach? I’m trying to find the best partnership for the national team but the fans are saying ‘don’t take him’, ‘pick someone else’. We started the project and asked for a shortlist of names, and Tan Cheng Hoe was listed and seen as the best coach at the moment. Isn’t picking the best to lead the national team our priority? Do you all really love the national team? And do you all really want changes? What do you all actually want?<br /><br />I will always do my job because I am not a person who only talks within social media but doesn’t contribute at all to the development of national football. Good luck Malaysian football, good luck Malaysian football fans</p>

  <p><b>[JDT owner then launched into a tirade against those he claimed as resistant to change and prefer to stick to the status quo]</b> Success is not impossible, but changing such a mindset is like a battle. In the past everyone demanded for changes, wanting this and that. Now changes are being done and we know the internal causes and problems. We know how we want to change the structure, know what needs to be improved, and at the same time, other teams need to be professional. There are teams that cannot be taken action against for committing offences because of their close relationships with the exco, who were voted by them into current positions. So, it has made the exco afraid of taking any action<br /><br />If we need to be considerate of everyone’s feelings, then Malaysian football will not go anywhere. If we still cannot change the mindset and need to care about friends’ feelings, where punishment cannot be dished out despite breaking rules and regulation, then we can forget about changes. For 30 years you complained about not being able to voice out on anything and not knowing about the association’s latest news. Now that you know about it, you still want to complain</p>

  <p><b>[The new Malaysia head coach will be hired on a short-term basis]</b> When FAM pays off what it owes to the teams, they should pay off their debts quickly. If not we will take immediate action <b>[against them]</b>. After this don’t give excuses that you can’t because of FAM.<br /><br />Once they receive the money, I hope they can settle everything in two weeks’ time. We can’t give them three months’ time every single time. This has been going on for so long<br /><br />This is the last time that I’m going to supprt <b>[them]</b> and give time, if it still happens then in the future I will take immediate action. I don’t want this to happen again. Among the punishments that can be taken are points deduction, fine and even relegation<br /><br />We have a few candidates that we are looking at, definitely still a foreign coach. Therefore we do not rush because the budget that we have is very very small, FAM has no money. We have to approach these coaches, tell them our budget, for how long we can sign them, and we will see who is interested the most. We definitely will pick the candidate who is most suitable for the time being, for this short period of time<br /><br />Josep Gombau is interested but not now, because of his commitment with the Australia national team. But for a long-term plan, he is the most suitable candidate, but maybe in the future<br /><br />That is up to Kedah, when Kedah want to let him leave and when he wants to leave. That is up to him and up to Kedah, not up to us <b>[FAM]</b>. FAM is open to any suggestions that ease the clubs and assist them</p>

  <p><b>[Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim has urged all football associations to settle their debts after FAM has dispersed the money to each team]</b> We have dispersed RM500,000 to every participating Super League team and RM250,000 to every participating Premier League team. A total of RM9 million has been paid by the FAM to the 24 teams last night despite the FAM itself facing financial problems.<br /><br />I urge the money given is spent wisely by each team and it is my hope that they can all operate efficiently. I don’t want to hear any more excuses of salaries not being paid because the FAM still owes them money. Should there be any teams that still fail and refuse to settle any outstanding players’ salary, drastic actions will be taken</p>

I want a detailed investigation to be done and a decision to be made this week. The FAM needs to ensure everyone involved in Malaysian football that it carries out its duties with full integrity.<br /><br />If any individual is found conducting poor matches, punishment will be issued and that referee will need to be rested. I also want to highlight that if he’s found guilty of corruption, the referee will need to be banned for life. I have also given all names and details of referees and FAM staff to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission <b>[MACC]</b> so that the authorities can observe and ensure no corruption within the FAM</p>

  <p><b>[FAM President retains concerns over Malaysia’s Asian Cup qualifier in Pyongyang]</b> As you may know, the Malaysian government has discouraged the Harimau Malaya from traveling to North Korea to play the match due to the ongoing ‘diplomatic row’. However, to date the government has not issued a travel ban, just a travel advisory, and that is not a strong enough reason for the Asian Football Confederation <b>[AFC]</b> to switch the original match venue to a neutral one.<br /><br />As president of the Football Association of Malaysia <b>[FAM]</b>, I view things very seriously when it comes to the safety of our national players and officials. So this being the case, it is difficult for me to allow the players and officials to travel to Pyongyang<br /><br />If the FAM does not allow them to travel to Pyongyang to play the match, North Korea will be awarded a 3-0 win. Added to that, we will also be fined up to US$50,000 and will be eliminated from the qualifying stages of the Asian Cup<br /><br />But what is more worrying is that there is a good chance that Malaysia will be disqualified from all future AFC matches.The question now is what do we do? Truthfully, I would like the match to be played at a neutral venue for the sake of the players’ safety<br /><br />Another big worry is that I have been reliably informed by several coaches who visited North Korea before the present row that the situation in the hermit nation is very bad. I’m also very concerned about the safety assurance regarding the accommodation provided and the food<br /><br />According to the information I have received we need to bring our own food due to the possibility of sabotage. Another big concern is the issue of refereeing because if there are decisions going against the North Koreans, there is the possibility that the safety of match officials will be affected and that will surely put them under pressure<br /><br />Taking all this into consideration, and after weighing the pros and cons, as President of FAM, I am definitely not in favour of the team traveling to North Korea, but ultimately the final decision rests with our government and the Sports Ministry. For me, the safety of the Malaysian people is of the utmost importance. We must always put the people’s safety first no matter the situation. This is what the Malaysian government and our football fans want above all else</p>

  <p><b>[Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim has revealed one of the most overlooked reasons for the recent appointment of Nelo Vingada as Malaysia head coach]</b> The reason that it is the best decision is his track record, CV and experience.<br /><br />Football in the country, along with its long-dormant football association, we are not yet a mature footballing country. We haven’t made the correct decisions for a very long time. For now, in hiring the national team head coach, he needs to not only lead the national team and the players, but we also need him to develop local coaches. And that is why I believe that Nelo Vingada is the right choice</p>

  <p><b>[Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim today shed light on the transfer of Mohammed Ghaddar from Kelantan to the reigning Super League champions]</b> JDT taking Ghaddar is the most correct and smartest decision at this point in time. Therefore Ghaddar is the right call because he has shown that he can perform and he’s a proven quality in the league. JDT as a club would not pay RM5 million for a player that is already 32 years old. I know the actual value and it is not that figure that has been rumoured. The actual price to me is a reasonable one for a player who is currently the top scorer<br /><br />As this is the mid-season transfer window, it is expensive to find a player from outside the league. Not only that, that player will also have a short time to acclimatise to the league. We will only sign an expensive import in December when they have two months to prepare with the team<br /><br />We will have another signing this season from Spain who will play in midfield. That will be announce in due course</p>
