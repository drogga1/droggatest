  <p><b>[Greece Coach Otto Rehhagel Confident Ahead Of Ukraine Clash]</b> We don’t have the luxury of being able to call on all of our players as we have some key men missing. Players such as Giourkas Seitaridis and Vasilis Torosidis are unavailable. But I have confidence in my squad <b>[…]</b> But we will see how we will play when the time comes. They have to go out on the pitch, show their skills and play beyond their limits</p>

  <p><b>[The veteran coach, despite having won Euro 2004 with the Pirate Ship, will be making his first appearance on the sidelines in a World Cup match]</b> Some things take their time. I’m pleased to take on such a huge challenge, and everything comes in due course. Things don’t repeat themselves in life. Ta panta rhei, as we say in Greece: everything is flowing.<br /><br /><b>[Looking ahead to his opponents, he said]</b> South Korea are very far and strong - we saw them play twice in Austria, and they are very disciplined and tactical. It will be an interesting match tomorrow to see how they handle their strategies… Tactically speaking they have learned a great deal. In 1962 (as a player) I travelled through Asia and my team beat local ones 6-0, 7-0 and more, but those days are long gone<br /><br />Asian teams have caught up greatly. They have movement that we Europeans can’t match. They run like panthers. They’re very clever tactically. We all know what football is right now and that’s down to you (the media) as you sent it around the world. As Asian teams learn well and are very disciplined, I’ve told my guys: ‘if you think for a fraction of a second that you can afford not to pay attention then you will be punished - badly’<br /><br /><b>[On his own role as a veteran coach, Rehhagel was cheerfully philosophical]</b> Will my heart beat a little faster at the World Cup? My heart is going to be beating for a long time so of course it beats harder. I’ve done so much in my life so far but I’m so pleased to be here. It’s great to be in South Africa - it’s a fantastic country and the people are very happy to have this wonderful tournament here. Of course tomorrow my heart will beat faster as we face a tough opponent, and of course we want to win. You wouldn’t be human if that didn’t set your heart racing</p>

  <p><b>[World Cup 2010: Otto Rehhagel Admits Greece Were Second Best Against South Korea]</b> We could have taken the lead, but we failed to score, and then we had a set-piece against us which resulted in the first goal. We weren’t careful enough. We were all there, but we didn’t clear the ball. We knew the Koreans would be very fast and would run the extra mile to get the ball. We tried to overcome that, but we never really got into the game. We were unlucky in a couple of situations towards the end of the match, but it was a deserved victory for South Korea</p>

  <p><b>[Legendary coach Otto Rehhagel has sung the praises of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> boss <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>]</b> Jurgen’s career is unique, just wonderful. I was worried that he would not lose a football game! Jurgen can inspire his players - and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has a lot of money. But he has also made the right choices with the players he has signed. I can’t say where his career will end. He is still young and he will grow. The English championship is now important to him. He can do anything in the future. He could be the national coach, coach at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> - anything he wants. All doors are open to him. I couldn’t score goals from the bench and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> can’t either. but if you have an absolute say, you can put your team together. Jurgen has the absolute say in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He knows how to strengthen his team</p>

  <p><b>[They stunned the world, however, with a 1-0 win over the hosts in the final that will go down as one of sport’s biggest ever shocks]</b> The Greeks have made football history. There are always surprises. Remember North Korea beat Italy in the 1966 World Cup in England? This time we are the surprise.</p>
