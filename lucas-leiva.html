  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> midfielder Lucas Leiva has lavished praise on fellow summer signing <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a> as his sensational debut season continues]</b> Torres is improving all of the time. He’s getting better and better and he’s very important to the team. With Torres on the pitch you know you’ve always got a good chance to score a goal and that’s important for the confidence of the team, to know that he is there. He doesn’t miss many chances and he’s had a great season. Hopefully we will score as many or more goals next season and we can get closer to the title. It was important to win, especially with it being the last game in front of our fans. We’d like to be closer to the title, but we’ve had a good season. We’ve only lost once at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> in the league, but I think the draws have been key. We have been on a great run, winning a lot of games recently, and we need to keep going and try to finish with a win against Tottenham<br /><br /><b>[The Brazilian believes Nando is not the only one improving, as he is satisfied with his own contribution and rate of progression in his first season at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>]</b> I was pleased to start today. Today was my 31st appearance and I think I am improving all of the time. It was really difficult to lose the semi-final, especially because we played well, but we need to forget that now and think about next season. We cannot change what’s happened now and we just need to try to finish this season well with a win against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Leiva has seen his Liverpool future called into question]</b> The situation is not great. It is not something I want for my future to have not many games but at this moment I have to deal with this and try to find a solution when I have the chance. I have to be professional, think about the team and see what is going to happen. I don’t want this for my career, especially at my age. I’m not close to retiring and have many years ahead of me. Of course there are always rumours but today the best place for me to be is Liverpool. I cannot say about tomorrow. The manager has been very good to me and we have a very open relationship so it is nothing I am worried about. You want to play - we get paid to play - but I just try to be professional and help as much as I can and when I have the chance do my best. That is the only thing I think everyone asks. It is not something I want for my future to not play much, especially at this time of my career, but at this moment I have to deal with the situation and keep working. It has been a special season already and we have a chance to win trophies and that is something I’ll consider as well</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Leiva is open to staying on at Liverpool but admits no decision on his future will be made until the summer]</b> There is no doubt about my commitment to Liverpool, I just need to wait until the end of the season, work hard and make a decision together with the club. I have been here long enough and if the time comes for me to go somewhere else I think I will leave with the feeling that I did everything I could. I am getting to the stage of my career where I think I can help a lot, off the pitch of course, but on the pitch as well. Playing time <b>[will play a part]</b>, I wouldn’t like to just be around. I feel I have many years that I can still play at the top level. I need to analyse and see what is best for me and the club and then I am sure we will make a decision together.<br /><br />I don’t really know what will happen, I just need to focus on the last five games. The last few games I have played I feel very good. I have played centre-back and midfield, so I give some options to the manager and when he needs me I always try to deliver. We have a lot to play for and it depends on us. It is in our hands. I want to finish the season a high</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Leiva’s 10-year spell at Liverpool has ended with the Brazilian completing a reported £5 million switch to Lazio]</b> Liverpool as a club and Liverpool as a city is a unique place. I think it’s different from everywhere. The fans are a big part of the club, probably the most important part of the club, and without them Liverpool wouldn’t be the same club I would say. Thank you for all the support, especially in difficult times, that’s when it means a lot. We all know that Liverpool fans are really special and they were always here for me. I’ll always be watching and supporting Liverpool and for sure I’ll be back, in the city to visit friends and watch games in the future.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s blocking of Barcelona’s advances in a protracted Philippe Coutinho chase came as no surprise to former Reds star Lucas Leiva]</b> Liverpool is not a seller, Liverpool is a buyer. That’s basically it. There are companies that supply, there are companies that buy. Liverpool are not a team that sells their stars easily. It’s obvious that every club ends up selling some great players, but at Liverpool that’s not so natural.<br /><br />I did not leave earlier because there was no agreement between the three parties involved, Liverpool, the club concerned and myself. I had opportunities to go to Turkey, others even to Italy, but my relationship with Liverpool was always very strong, so everything was always done by mutual agreement, there was never a fight or impasse. Now, with the possibility of Lazio, the conversation lasted only five minutes. It was my time to leave, it was good for everyone. Liverpool understood and realised that I deserved a new challenge.<br /><br /><b>[On his standing at Anfield]</b> I do not know if I am an idol, it’s very complicated. If you talk to any fan of Liverpool, you will hear different opinions regarding Lucas the player, but Lucas the man will always be analysed in the same way, everyone will say that I gave my best for the shirt. The image left behind was very positive.</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Leiva is planning to further endear himself to the Liverpool faithful by taking his place in the away end when the Reds face Roma in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final]</b> I’m still thinking about it, but I’m hoping I can go to the Liverpool end and watch the game - and maybe take some of my friends and my son. We still follow Liverpool a lot, we watch every game and I hope they can get to the final.<br /><br />It will be a great night, for sure. For the players, a good experience. It’s a big game, a semi-final. It maybe won’t be that different from some games that I experienced with Liverpool - the Europa League, that game against Dortmund and then Villarreal. I’m looking forward to it and I’ll be supporting Liverpool for sure<br /><br />They are full of confidence of course after the win against Barca. Fair play to them because they played really well and I think they deserved it. The boost that gave them is massive. But in the city, one side will be supporting the Reds - the Lazio fans - because they don’t want to see their rival going to the final of course, but the other side of Rome is really excited, so it is going to be a big, big semi-final and let’s see what is going to happen. I would say Roma is a very aggressive team. They play a Premier League style of play I would say. They press very high and they have some quick players. They also have <b>[Edin]</b> Dzeko and he is a big player for them. Liverpool will know him very well. We can expect a very good semi-final, but I think Liverpool have all the tools and the power to win because we could see against Manchester City how strong Anfield is. Having a good result in the first game could be the key as well for the second game here in Rome</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Leiva believes it is only a matter of time before <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> breaks his record]</b> <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> will pass <b>[my games record]</b> easily, as he is playing over 50 games a year. I’m happy with that as he is an incredible guy<br /><br /><b>[In joining <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> from Gremio in 2007, Lucas found the period of adjustment to being in England quite challenging]</b> It was really difficult at the beginning in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It was a slow adaptation, luckily there was a lot of Spanish players playing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, my manager, <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafa Benítez</a> was Spanish too, so their Latin personality helped me a lot as I didn’t speak English at the time. My first and second years were really hard, at times I thought it wasn’t going to work out, but slowly things changed, I started accomplishing things. I was adapting myself. After learning the language you feel better not only in the club but also in the city</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> midfielder Lucas Leiva says he and his team-mates were never in doubt that <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> would become one of the world’s best players]</b> Well, I remember a few moments of Trent. I remember he came with us to play in a friendly game and I think he was 16. He was very shy and Brendan <b>[Rodgers]</b> was in charge. I remember he wasn’t comfortable but we could see he was at a different level, I would say, for his age, his quality on the ball. So after he started to train with us in the first team he waited patiently, but we were sure that he would be a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> player and he would be one of the best players in the world. I was sure because you just could see on a daily basis how many qualities he had, his crosses and his passing. He is just a complete full-back<br /><br />Of course, he still has to improve a lot but he’s already done amazing seasons. I think the last two seasons he has been a star player. Trent is a good boy, he’s a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> boy and we can see how much he enjoys playing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I always try to help the young players - I think it’s important to make them feel comfortable and after it’s up to them to learn and improve.</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Leiva has no regrets over <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> exit after growing unhappy at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>]</b> The year after I left, we lost in the <b>[Champions League]</b> final. I met the boys here in Rome <b>[for the 2018 semi-final]</b>. But, of course, <b>[to win it]</b> I was really happy, to be honest. My son, my family, we are <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans now. It’s a great achievement and I’m just really happy because so many people there I am still in touch with and still care a lot about. Of course, you always think, ‘Had I waited one more year … ‘ but, to be honest, I wasn’t happy. When you are not happy it makes no sense so, to be honest, it’s better I see <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> winning and I’m happy as well playing. As a fan I’m really happy. Of course, I would like to have won it but I won it as a fan, let’s say<br /><br />I learned a lot with him, a lot. I played centre-back; I wouldn’t say I wasn’t happy but it’s not my position, but I learned when you work hard you have to be patient, something that my career at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was always like this - patience, keep proving, keep going and don’t give up. With Jurgen it was always the same. He treated me with respect, and especially when it was the time for me to move on and he was really good. He gave me confidence and the freedom to choose to move to Italy. We are still in touch. We send messages. I learned a lot and he’s a guy that is very open, very honest and that’s really important as well</p>
