  <p><b>[Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio has given each player who may make his World Cup roster a personalized training plan for the build-up to the tournament, an act that has frustrated Porto coach Sergio Conceicao]</b> This is absolutely ridiculous. Ridiculous. What specific work are you doing in a week or eight days of preparation? Here we have physiologists, nutritionists and trainers who prepare individual plans for every player. We have a specific plan for every player.<br /><br />I don’t know what goal he had in saying this. You can’t forget that of the four Mexican players, Corona was the best on the field, Layun had an assist and Herrera scored a goal. He would be better off saying thank you to Porto for the players.</p>

  <p><b>[Porto manager Sergio Conceicao again has criticized the Mexico national team]</b> Clubs normally are the ones harmed by the national teams. The three Mexican players went to the squad in perfect conditions to play a football game, but all three came back with injury issues. For the rest of the tournament, how is it going to be? He’s defending the players for the World Cup, which is in a month and a half, but Porto FC is the one that pays the players’ salaries. I don’t understand.<br /><br />Honestly, I think it was good sometimes to open a little bit about how the dynamic is in the life of a club. In the case of FC Porto, it’s like the mechanics of Formula 1. We prepare everything in detail: we worry about sleep, recovery, with all the variations that could be important for a player to be at his peak physically. We spend all year with the players, we have a deep knowledge of each one and I don’t think a coaching staff that is with the player for three days knows him as well as we do. We have not received any messages from anyone, even though there has been good communication between the medical department of the Mexican team and ours</p>

  <p><b>[Hector Herrera made me rethink having a Mexican as captain]</b> I had the chance to tell this story before. Before I joined the club, and, knowing FC Porto, I asked myself, ‘Why was a Mexican player the team captain?’ But then I started working with him and I understood why, as he is a great professional. He was linked to one or two less positive moments, but he is an extraordinary man, a wonderful professional and he creates a great mood. He is a true captain and I am happy for him.<br /><br />It was a hard match. Highly competitive for both teams, but we knew it would be like this. We knew that, in a set piece or an individual play, any player could change the match. Both teams had their chances and, fortunately, we scored from one. We believed until the end that we could win here, knowing it would be hard. We are happy, but it’s not over yet. There are four finals to go, and we can’t make mistakes. It’s a very important victory, one that brings us closer to our objective, which is the title. That is our objective for the season. Tonight, we have to be happy with this victory, as it was very important, but we can’t lose focus</p>

It thrills me to be able to return to Rome and relive the unique moments I shared with the Lazio fans, but right now I’m only thinking about this game..<br /><br /><b>[The coach did, however, answer Francesco Totti, who claimed that Roma had received a lucky draw]</b> Maybe he doesn’t like me because I won here six times in a row</p>

During the match, it may be that we’ll switch to a different strategy. We’re prepared for a difficult game. We know that regardless of the way Italian teams think, Roma concede lots of goals.</p>

  <p><b>[Sergio Conceicao, a coach whose value is rising thanks to Porto’s fine European form]</b> I’ve heard you constantly ask this question, about whether it will be about revenge against Liverpool. No, it’s not about revenge, it’s a game of football. What happened last year was last year, end of story. We didn’t do things that we wanted to do, and the opponent was very clinical in what they did. We look at Liverpool as a very strong team.<br /><br />I think it’s possible to win here. We’ve prepared for the game to win, that’s what we’ve worked towards and we have to work very hard. That’s what we want from this game</p>

  <p><b>[Porto vs Liverpool]</b> I like the way Liverpool play. Sometimes, they are the best team in the world. We have to work for defensive organisation and we are 100 per cent focused and aware of what our opponents are doing. It is not difficult to analyse Liverpool, but it is difficult to counteract because they have so much individual and collective quality. They’re great!<br /><br />There is no greater motivation than to be competing in a quarter-final and to make a historical turnaround. We have a two-goal deficit to make up against a very strong team who are quick on the break. Getting the attacking balance right is fundamental</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> boss Sergio Conceicao on return after coronavirus]</b> It will be different to play without a crowd. It will be like being without the condiments to make a good salad. Eating a salad without oil, vinegar and salt is not the same. We have to go in there with the same desire, as if we had a packed stadium with the support of the fans. It’s going to be different, that’s for sure. The incentive that gives a boost to the player, I think is missing. Even the whistles are missing. It’s not the same thing, but we have to look at the situation and the recommendations and face things as they are<br /><br /><b>[Conceicao said his players kept up their hard work]</b> We never stopped. We didn’t go on vacation, we were working all the time. Every day we had work and that in that in itself demonstrates the desire and hope that we had for the league to resume, so that on the field we could show what we are and that we want to be the best team on the pitch. I hope the momentum carries on. When the stoppage occurred the team was well, had won important games, we had recovered some points in the table which were essential in the fight for the main objected</p>
