    <meta name="description" content="When healthy and available, John Brooks may still be the best center back in the USMNT pool. He has been vital to the team's success in recent years, that catastrophic performance against Costa Rica in World Cup qualifying aside. This season, Brooks' presence has been just as vital for Wolfsburg, who are noticeably better when the defender is on the field. Brooks has featured in 21 of Wolfsburg's 36 competitive games this season and, when he is available, Wolfsburg have been one of the league's best defensive teams. Only RB Leipzig and Bayern Munich have conceded fewer than the 30 goals allowed by Wolfsburg, and the statistics show that Brooks has been one of the Bundesliga's best in terms of aerial duals won and completed passes out of the back. As a result, Wolfsburg sit sixth in the league with plenty of hope for a late push while the club has also sealed a spot in the round of 16 in the Europa League.">
