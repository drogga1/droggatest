  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> academy prospect Joshua Bohui has accused <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> of unfair treatment during his time at Old Trafford]</b> It was difficult because I was facing - I’m not going to say abuse - but some unfair treatment by the manager at the time. I was getting frustrated by the way he was treating me: some of the words he was using, I felt it was unnecessary and it was something I mentioned several times to the club. I rejected the offer<b>[s]</b> because I didn’t believe I was going to break into the first team with the way I was treated. They weren’t really looking at me<br /><br /><b>[Bohui did travel with <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> squad for their pre-season tour of the United States in the summer of 2018]</b> It was a great experience going on tour. You get to see what it’s like to actually be a first team player: the fanbase is incredible <b>[…]</b> so much of it is unbelievable and makes you grateful for all of this. But while I was out there, it was difficult for many of the youngsters to get some minutes - even on the tour. From then, it was a wake-up call that if you can’t even get minutes on pre-season tour to express yourself, then how is it possible to get any type of game time throughout the season? I didn’t think I had a chance<br /><br /><b>[Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has, after succeeding <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, given more opportunities to home-grown talents. Bohui is, however, not convinced that the likes of <a href="angel-gomes.html">Angel Gomes</a> and <a href="tahith-chong.html">Tahith Chong</a> will be able to fulfil their potential if they remain on the books at Old Trafford]</b> It’s a tough one because they’re golden players for United. It’s a big step for them, but whether they move on or go out on loan, they need to play games. Unless there’s a clear pathway to play games at Man United - which is difficult - I’d say to go out on loan and learn the roots of football. Especially with Tahith, who is a similar player to me, direct and quick. Maybe a league like Holland would suit him: going out and playing 50, 60 games per season, that could work for him. But I’ll support them whatever decision they make, just like they supported me with my decision to come to Holland</p>

  <p><b>[Former academy graduate Joshua Bohui says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> didn’t have <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> style]</b> When Jose was there, there were no opportunities for me, Mason <b>[Greenwood]</b>, Angel or <b>[Tahith]</b> <a href="tahith-chong.html">Chong</a>, but now Ole’s in charge there’s a different vibe and spirit around the place. It was not that Jose did not treat me well, which some in the media speculated, it was just that there didn’t seem to be a clear pathway for me under him. On the training ground, he never spoke to me about what I had to do better and, sometimes, I could not understand what he wanted. I also felt that he was not approachable. If I knew I had done well in a training session, he was not there to be supportive - it was the same if I knew I had to improve on something<br /><br /><b>[Mourinho was relieved of his duties by United in December 2018, with his departure coming as no surprise to Bohui]</b> It was better for the whole club - United have a style of play which he was not bringing, so he had to be replaced<br /><br /><b>[Despite having terms on the table and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> out of the door, the 21-year-old forward believes he took the right decision in leaving England]</b> I was playing Under-18s and Under-23s football, but I was at an age where I felt I needed to be playing senior, first-team football. I wanted that step up and that experience of playing first-team football</p>
