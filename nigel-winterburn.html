  <p><b>[Arsenal at the centre of England’s tentative new era]</b> It’s difficult to say whether there’s been a conscious effort or it’s simply that the players have become available. It’s probably just the right players at the right price and Arsenal being able to secure them in the market. Arsene would probably say he’s always wanted a core of English players, but before he maybe felt those players weren’t available.<br /><br />It will help reinforce the values and traditions of Arsenal at the football club, because I believe that in England you do need that English core. And it can only be positive when you’ve got players in the national side at big clubs. The way Arsenal play will eventually help the England team, because the one thing they haven’t been great with over the last few years is possession of the football and penetration<br /><br /><b>[On Jack Wilshere’s critics]</b> It’s very harsh to say he’s not been at his best when he’s picked up so many injuries. It would be almost impossible for anyone to progress and I’m sure he’s very frustrated. Jack knows he’s always going to get that focus on him until he gets back to his best, but if he plays 40 games this season there’s no doubt in my mind that he’ll be back to the form people were judging him on two or three years ago<br /><br /><b>[The future of the national side seems bright]</b> We’ve entered a new era with a lot of young players, some exciting ones as well. Roy Hodgson has to develop those players and give us some exciting football to look forward to. If he can’t then the next manager will come in and we’ll try again. But what we have to do is stick with the young squad we’ve got, and hopefully we’ll see another couple of players breaking through. What excites me is the attacking talent we’ve got. I think - I hope - we’re starting to turn the corner with England</p>

You knew you had to get close to him, because he didn’t need to take you on. You’d see, a lot of the times, in attacking areas, that <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a> would be in front. So you’d think, ‘well, where is <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a>?’, because he’d drop behind. He knew then he could control the football, he could use his array of passing and could drift into the center of midfield where you couldn’t mark him. But then when he did drift wide, he’d drift wide and drop slightly back, so you were not in contact with him. When the ball came to him, he was whipping those balls in before you made contact with him</p>

  <p><b>[Talk of a potential swap deal involving Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez and Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero has been branded a minefield]</b> It’s a minefield. But I can see where that link would come because they want a high-quality centre-forward and Aguero is certainly that. I don’t know with two high value players how easy it’ll be. I can’t remember when this sort of deal has actually happened in the past. Contract lengths are different and club’s valuations of players can change. I just wonder whether Arsenal have taken the view ‘if you keep pestering Sanchez, we’ll start talking about your players.<br /><br />Would Sergio Aguero even want to come to Arsenal? Then you’re talking about involving agents with a swap deal and seeing how that all works. I think there’s a little bit of mind games going on</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal star Nigel Winterburn believes that Theo Walcott would be a great fit beside Andy Carroll at West Ham]</b> The problem for Theo is that Arsenal switched the system at the end of last season and that system doesn’t suit him, not at Arsenal anyway. Theo will think that if Arsenal are trying to limit his game time, he’ll feel like ‘where do I fit in? Is it time for a new challenge?’. I think when players of that quality become available, it’s natural to say that they would say they are interested. West Ham playing with two up front including Carroll with Theo, I can see that working very well. Then you also have the option of playing him off the striker or playing right or left, so you’re getting a fair bit for your money. The problem for Theo at Arsenal is where do they see him playing if they stick to a back three or back five?<br /><br />I think Arsenal have stated that they would like to keep Giroud, but they might need to review the situation depending what happens in the summer. He’s probably looking at his age and thinking ‘I need to be playing and I want to make sure that I’m part of the French squad’. I think he’s done a very good job and I just wonder whether Arsenal want a little bit more mobility going forward. He found himself on the bench at the end of the season and he obviously wouldn’t want that to happen.<br /><br />It’s again whether the player feels that he is going to play enough games or is it time to make the break? I think there would be a lot more offers from abroad if he did move from Arsenal. He might also be settled in London and if that is the case, West Ham have a good link with Arsenal and if he wanted to stay in London that could be a good opportunity for West Ham to get a very good striker. I could see it happening but you have to think whether the player believes he is capable of playing for a top-six club and West Ham are not a top-six club. It’ll be a case of whether West Ham can convince the player to join them</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil boasts unbelievable ability]</b> Ozil’s got unbelievable ability, but maybe he frustrates people because he drifts in and out of games. There’s no doubt that his position is number 10 behind the striker, and Emery could fit him in the system he wants to play. But last weekend <b>[against Bournemouth]</b> shows it doesn’t matter who you are, if you don’t fit the system to face the opposition, you’ll be on the bench or not in the squad. Anybody has got a chance of playing provided they’re in the right frame of mind and in good form. It keeps players focused and playing to the best of the ability every week.<br /><br /><b>[Winterburn added on the Spurs clash]</b> I think he’ll be starting, as it’s at home. We’ll probably switch to a back four and Ozil will play behind the striker, it’s a straight choice between Ozil and Ramsey. Particularly with Aaron’s contract situation. I look forward to seeing the team sheet, as I can’t predict Emery’s team sheet or formation<br /><br /><b>[On Laurent Koscielny]</b> I think it’s going to be difficult to bring Koscielny back in, he has been Arsenal’s outstanding defender since he joined. He had a bit a dip in form last year, but that could have been injury related. For a player with such a big injury, you have to watch his progress in reserve games and training. The big test will come when he returns to the first team and how he copes in the first team. If he comes back in the condition that he’s capable of, he’ll be the main defender in this Arsenal team. But they’ve coped well, with Rob Holding stepping up and <b>[Shkodran]</b> Mustafi mentioning the benefit of new training drills. There is positive signs and he won’t be rushed back. Unai Emery will pick on form, we’ve seen with other players who’ve missed out. I don’t think he’ll come back in and Mustafi or Holding will drop out. If everyone’s fit and in good-form, Emery might have a problem. But, Emery will always pick on form and with a focus on the opposition he’s coming up against</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez isn’t suited to Manchester United’s style of play]</b> I didn’t think Alexis Sanchez’s style of play would suit United, he’s a free spirit and you have to know how to deal with him. He’s got undoubted ability, but I wasn’t quite sure the way he plays would fit in to the Mourinho way. I look back at Sanchez for Arsenal, and there’s something not quite right with him at United, and it will be interesting to see how the situation will develop. It will be interesting if he stays and plays a major part for the club or whether he looks for a new challenge, but he’s not hit the level of performance from his time at Arsenal.<br /><br />It’s looking more and more likely Aaron Ramsey will be a free agent, so he’ll be linked with a whole host of clubs. He’ll have a major decision to make and there’ll be five or six teams interested. He’ll be thinking about what’s the right move for him. It doesn’t surprise me the top teams are looking at him. You talk about the freedom of contracts, which frustrates supporters, but it will happen more and more with players<br /><br />A lot of people would say it’s a good time to go to Old Trafford. They are struggling to produce top level performances at home, and when you struggle, players will start to feel anxiety and if you haven’t scored early it transmits into the crowd and frustration from the supporters. If Arsenal take the lead, they could ask serious questions of Man United</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have to find some money from somewhere]</b> Obviously, I don’t know the nitty gritty runnings of the football club but looking from the outside it almost seems to me that Arsenal want to be a self-funding club, and I’m thinking that if we want to get back to challenging Manchester City, Liverpool, Manchester United - who are going to spend more money, and Chelsea who will probably spend again - then we’re going to have to find some money from somewhere. But we’re going to find ourselves in this frustrating period where we’ve made some progression but we’re still a way off challenging for the title again<br /><br />Is the money there? That’s the question we want to know because if you hear from the manager that we can only get a loan signing in January then that doesn’t suggest to me that there is lots of money around unless what they’re saying is January is not the right time to go out and buy, let’s see what happens and we’ll be back in the market for the start of next season. I could understand that. That would make sense. But we’re not hearing that. It’s a guessing game with Arsenal and we’ll just have to wait and see<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on what the rest of the season holds for the Gunners]</b> I’d like to see, and I hope it will happen but I’ve no idea, is that coming into the last five games we’re in a position to get into that top four. I think it is fourth position. I think that is as realistic as we can be. I don’t see us being able to get any higher than that with the teams around us. So, if we were to snatch that fourth place, that would be some progression but then we would need to see that progression the following season. From an Arsenal point of view, from a supporters’ point of view, we just want to see some progression and eventually getting back to challenging for the title, but how long that is going to be is a question I wish I could answer for you!</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal will find life very, very difficult if all they can offer Unai Emery is loan deals and £10 million signings]</b> I think if Arsenal have had the spending power that Chelsea have had with <b>[Roman]</b> Abramovich in charge, then we may have seen something different. But I just want to see what Unai Emery can achieve. The one thing he needs to do is have some backing of the club with some money.<br /><br />If we’re going to look at loan signings and £10m, £15m players then I think we’re going to find it very, very difficult. I want to see where this manager can take the football club, I think that’s the most important thing. I’m all about supporting the manager that comes into your club. I want to watch how he works, I want to see him at least have a chance with some of the money that could become available. If he doesn’t have any money become available then he’s going to have a very, very hard job.<br /><br />But let’s see if he gets some money, let’s see where we are in a year’s time, in two years’ time, if he’s still in charge of the football club and then we can make that assessment of him. We can’t just dismiss the manager that’s just come to the club.</p>

  <p><b>[Unai Emery has been credited with ushering in an exciting new era for Arsenal]</b> We’re in a new era for Arsenal. Since Arsenal have moved to the new stadium, they’ve found it very difficult to compete. Yeah, they’ve won FA Cups, but in terms of Premier League titles, it’s just non-existent. As a club we’re looking to try and get back among the elite, and I think it’s going to be very diffucilt for Arsenal to do that. Arsenal supporters realise we’ve got a long, long way to go. We’re seeing different scenarios with Unai Emery: team selections, formations, substitutions at half-time. But the more important thing is it looks like the team are together and there’s a driving force there. There’s a good feeling around the stadium which was not there last season.<br /><br />Wenger still believes that he can drive a team to be league champions, whether that be in the Premier League or somewhere else. I’m a little surprised that he’s not back in yet. That puts a little bit of doubt into my mind</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal haven’t got a vast amount of money to spend]</b> I’d still like to see a pacy attacking wide player coming into the club, potentially another midfield player and there is a lot being said about the need to re-strengthen in defence, but I think Unai Emery may be looking at the likes of Rob Holding, who had a fantastic six months and then picked up a serious knee injury. He was coming through and looking very, very consistent. It’s just a case of where Unai Emery feels he needs to strengthen. Everyone will say that defensively Arsenal haven’t been great again this season but it’s not just about the defence. It’s about when Arsenal do concede how quickly they get played through the lines. I’m quite excited about what’s going to happen to Arsenal next season and I’m very intrigued to see where Emery thinks Arsenal need strengthening. But my own thoughts are a wide player and another midfielder. Potentially another centre-half but I can’t see much more than that coming into the club because we’re hearing that Arsenal haven’t got a vast amount of money to spend.<br /><br />You can’t have such fantastic home form and then away form that has been dreadful. Unai Emery has got to look at that. The other teams around them will re-strengthen - apart from Chelsea who have that transfer embargo. It may go to arbitration but we shouldn’t be looking at what is happening with Chelsea. We should be looking at what is happening at Arsenal and I think two or three players - on top of the ones that are already going - may leave. Then they will need to replenish the squad to make them stronger next season</p>

He can also play wing-back so he gives you that option as well.

It is a bit worrying at the moment because we seem to be linked with quite a few players, but there’s nothing happening at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> legend Nigel Winterburn has urged the club to strengthen in defence ahead of the new season]</b> My worry is that if you look over the last couple of seasons the away form has been poor and the goals conceded has been 51 against both times in the league alone. That tells you that something isn’t working. The problem they have now is that <a href="rob-holding.html">Rob Holding</a>, Callum Chambers, <a href="sokratis-papastathopoulos.html">Sokratis Papastathopoulos</a>, <a href="laurent-koscielny.html">Laurent Koscielny</a>, <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Shkodran Mustafi</a> and Konstantinos Mavropanos are all centre-halves and that is making it difficult to bring in another one because the squad in top-heavy with them.

No doubt, Mkhitaryan is a talented player but he’s going to struggle to hold down a regular position when everybody’s fit<br /><br /><b>[Another of those hoping to see regular game time is <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a>]</b> With the quality that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s attacking options, <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> isn’t guaranteed to start week in week out for the club. We didn’t see the real <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> last season, perhaps he couldn’t adapt to the intensity of <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>’s training sessions but we were limited to cameo performances scattered across the season. To get the best out of <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>, he needs to start in the Number 10 position, he is wasted out wide. He needs to be given the freedom where he can make those killer passes in the areas that he can make a difference.<br /><br />There is no doubt that when <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> is on top form he is a brilliant player - he just doesn’t show this consistently. This season, <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> now has other players in the squad that can challenge him. The likes of Dani Cabellos and <a href="joe-willock.html">Joe Willock</a> will be pushing for that starting position and Emery is going to have a real headache squeezing in all that talent - it’ll be fascinating to see what Emery does. What’s certain is that Emery is a big personality and isn’t afraid to make big decisions even if that means dropping <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> from the starting 11<br /><br /><b>[With <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> no longer considered to be the main man for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, Winterburn claims that mantle has been passed to a free-scoring frontman]</b> Without a shadow of a doubt, <b>[Pierre-Emerick]</b> <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> will be <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s most important player this season. You saw from the <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> game, he had very few opportunities to score but the one real opportunity that he got, his composure and finishing was perfect. If he stays fit, he’s going to have a huge season again for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, and will certainly be challenging for the Golden Boot again. It gives the team a huge lift when you know you’ve got a goal-scorer in your team. He is similar to <a href="ian-wright.html">Ian Wright</a> in that sense. As a team, we knew that if you can keep a clean sheet, then Wrighty will usually pop up with a goal. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> is looking like that at the moment for this current side, which is great for the club</p>

He’s got to find a way for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to be competitive, particularly at home, because their away form is nowhere near good enough.

They’ve got to stem the flow of attacks from the opposition, and they’re giving away far too many opportunities far too easily. Emery needs to find a solution very quickly because you can’t keep conceding two or three goals and hope to win games</p>

He’s got five captains and he can easily do that. I don’t agree with five captains and I don’t like this ‘vote for your captain scenario’. The manager should pick the captain. I find having five captains very, very bizarre. This has all put <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> in a very difficult situation and he’s got to deal with it quickly, he can’t let it linger on<br /><br />If <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> backs <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a> he’s going to realise what supporting <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is all about. If the fans don’t agree with him the manager himself his going to come under increasing pressure.

If he doesn’t start well or he makes him captain, you’re waiting then for that reaction from supporters, and you need you supporters with you.

  <p><b>[Nigel Winterburn has warned <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> against rushing into any transfer deals in the winter market]</b> We’ve been talking about <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> addressing a problem position at centre-half for three or four seasons now, but I guess it’s down to the manager to decide where he thinks it’s most vital to improve the squad. What money has he got to spend? Can he get the right players in January? It can be very, very difficult in such a short window. If I’m honest, I don’t see <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> doing a lot of business this month, but it’ll be interesting to see what <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> does.<br /><br />They’ve been linked with a lot of players over the course of the last year and centre-half is still a priority. My feeling is that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> shouldn’t bother with another short-term fix, they’ve got to use their money more wisely. I think it was obvious that <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> was never <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s first-choice transfer target last summer.

We know he’s got a lot of ability on the ball, but now he’s showing quality when he’s on the back foot too. But I think <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> need to concentrate on getting that back four tighter together, as well as the protection in front of them. At the moment, I think <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> is going to have to work with what he’s got</p>

When you’re looking to bring players in for the first team or even the squad, you have to be careful<br /><br />You want to keep all the best players you got, you want to work with them and play with them. Unfortunately, players are earning massive amounts of money now and if they want to force a move they will. I’m more interested in the players that come to the club.

  <p><b>[Nigel Winterburn says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> won’t get £80m for <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> &amp; face big call]</b> I hope <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> will be an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> player next season but they have a decision to make. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have never been a big spending club. His contract’s up next season and they’re not going to let someone run down their contract again, although they’ve got little opportunity if he wants to do that. If the indication is that he’s not going to sign, they may have to take the opportunity and say ‘right, we’re going to take £40 million or whatever’.<br /><br />I don’t think they’re going to get 70 or 80 that they’re talking about with a year left for a player that’s coming to 31 years of age. For me, it’s more important whether the player wants to stay, who comes calling in the summer, and do <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> take the risk or can they convince him to sign a new contract? At the moment, it’s so difficult to call<br /><br />I don’t think there is a case where <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> will leave in the summer. I think <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> has said ‘I’m staying, I’m seeing out my contract’. And <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> offered him the deal. He’s not going to be forced out the door if the club don’t want him.<br /><br /><a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>’s performances have improved. There’s no doubt about that. But, again, if you want to see a 90 minutes performance from <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>, you’re going to be disappointed. He’s not that type of player. He’s in the game for 10 minutes, he might then disappear for a bit, but then he comes back into the game. But if you give him enough of the ball and he will create something for you. But is that enough for the current manager, and can he do a bit more defensively?<br /><br />You’re never going to get <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> tackling, but can he get into positions to slow the opposition down or go and press properly when the manager wants you to press? I think that’s the questions that will be asked from <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> to <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>, to suggest whether he plays more regularly and what involvement he will have next season, which for me is more intriguing</p>
