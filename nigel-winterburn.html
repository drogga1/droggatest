He knew then he could control the football, he could use his array of passing and could drift into the center of midfield where you couldn’t mark him. But then when he did drift wide, he’d drift wide and drop slightly back, so you were not in contact with him. When the ball came to him, he was whipping those balls in before you made contact with him</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have been informed that £20 million would be a ‘fair price’ for Celtic defender <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a>, but Nigel Winterburn fears that the Gunners’ transfer budget may not stretch much further]</b> I think somewhere closer to £20m or £22m is probably going to seal the transfer for Arsenal if they’re realistic about securing the player’s services. Also, it makes a big difference if the player himself has indicated to the club that it’s a move he really doesn’t want to turn down: the chance to come and play in the Premier League. I think when you’re talking Premier League prices now, £20m doesn’t seem a lot of money. So I think it’s a fair price for a young player that has undoubted ability and could progress even further. It seems a realistic fee to me when you’re talking about <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> allegedly paying £50m for <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a>. That puts it into perspective a little bit more.<br /><br /><b>[Winterburn concedes that reports of a £45m budget for Unai Emery are slightly concerning]</b> I feel the Arsenal squad really needs a good shake-up. Slightly worried about the situation with the amount of money available to spend, and depending on Unai Emery’s situation - whether he wants to go to a back four, if he does Tierney would be a good addition. He can also play wing-back so he gives you that option as well. Rather than looking at individual players, I’m interested to see who ends up at the club when pre-season comes around and what they can do. It is a bit worrying at the moment because we seem to be linked with quite a few players, but there’s nothing happening at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend Nigel Winterburn has urged the club to strengthen in defence ahead of the new season]</b> My worry is that if you look over the last couple of seasons the away form has been poor and the goals conceded has been 51 against both times in the league alone. That tells you that something isn’t working. The problem they have now is that Rob Holding, Callum Chambers, <a href="sokratis-papastathopoulos.html">Sokratis Papastathopoulos</a>, <a href="laurent-koscielny.html">Laurent Koscielny</a>, <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Shkodran Mustafi</a> and Konstantinos Mavropanos are all centre-halves and that is making it difficult to bring in another one because the squad in top-heavy with them. That makes it especially frustrating that we can’t find a partnership consistent enough to at least propel us towards a top four position<br /><br /><b>[<a href="laurent-koscielny.html">Koscielny</a> refused to travel with their team for the pre-season tour of the U.S., a decision which angered and confused the 55-year-old]</b> I had a couple of run-ins with <b>[former Arsenal manager]</b> <a href="george-graham.html">George Graham</a> during his time there, but I never, ever refused to play in a game of football or refused to travel. <b>[<a href="laurent-koscielny.html">Koscielny</a>]</b> should have sought out a chat with the manager while they were away on tour and got that message back to the board as to why he was so unhappy with the situation. I think we’re all guessing why he was so upset. He may have thought there was a deal on the table and with the injuries he’s had maybe he feels like he’s put his body on the line for the club. It’s such a shame that it looks like ending on a sour note for <a href="laurent-koscielny.html">Koscielny</a> and it really shouldn’t be like that</p>

  <p><b>[Nigel Winterburn says Missing out on a deal to bring <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> back to the Premier League from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is no blow for Arsenal]</b> don’t consider Arsenal missing out on <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> as a blow because I don’t think that it was ever realistic. Some of the figures that were bandied about, I’ve read that the deal could be worth up to £40 million, would have been an incredible investment from Arsenal for a loan deal and something that just cannot happen. He’s a terrific player, I think he would enhance most squads, but I don’t see it as a missed opportunity, because I was never convinced it was an option<br /><br /><a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> would have been a safer signing than Nicolas Pepe, as he is proven in the Premier League but I can only tell you who would have been the better signing come the end of the season. Pepe is not as well known on these shores as <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a>, so it’s hard to know if he can produce similar results to what we have come to expect from <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> at <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>. However, from the bits that we have seen of him, we know that Arsenal have a very exciting player on their hands. As a supporter, I would have liked Arsenal to have signed both players!<br /><br />The Premier League is the most brutal league in the world, especially for defenders, but <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> is a sensational signing and will have no problem settling in. He is a young player who has gained huge experience at Celtic, he has also played Champions League football so will be used to the quality of football. At the end of the day, I’m less worried about what a player has done before; I’m more interested in what happens when they come to your football club. Tierney fits the bill and is someone that will give Arsenal plenty of width and defensive skills down the left-hand side. He has been a player that Arsenal have courted for most of the transfer window, so I’m delighted that Arsenal have got the transfer over the line<br /><br /><b>[Winterburn added on Arsenal’s window as a whole]</b> I’m more excited at this season’s prospects than I have been for a number of years. The last two years, particularly the away performances, have been nowhere near good enough for Arsenal for a Premier League side who consider themselves to be a top-four team. The signings Arsenal have made have reinvigorated the club, now we need the new players to deliver on the pitch!</p>

  <p><b>[Nigel Winterburn claims Arsenal should be looking to sell <a href="henrikh-mkhitaryan.html">Henrikh Mkhitaryan</a> to a European team this transfer window]</b> Arsenal should look to sell Mkhitaryan to a European team this transfer window. When everyone is back fit for Arsenal, Mkhitaryan is going to struggle to get any game time at all during the season. Mkhitaryan looks a frustrated figure, nothing seems to be working out for him on the pitch - his passes are misplaced, his shooting is off and he can’t beat his man. His performance against <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> on the opening game of the season wasn’t good enough, especially when you’re playing at the highest level. No doubt, Mkhitaryan is a talented player but he’s going to struggle to hold down a regular position when everybody’s fit<br /><br /><b>[Another of those hoping to see regular game time is Mesut Ozil]</b> With the quality that Arsenal’s attacking options, Ozil isn’t guaranteed to start week in week out for the club. We didn’t see the real Ozil last season, perhaps he couldn’t adapt to the intensity of Unai Emery’s training sessions but we were limited to cameo performances scattered across the season. To get the best out of Ozil, he needs to start in the Number 10 position, he is wasted out wide. He needs to be given the freedom where he can make those killer passes in the areas that he can make a difference.<br /><br />There is no doubt that when Ozil is on top form he is a brilliant player - he just doesn’t show this consistently. This season, Ozil now has other players in the squad that can challenge him. The likes of Dani Cabellos and Joe Willock will be pushing for that starting position and Emery is going to have a real headache squeezing in all that talent - it’ll be fascinating to see what Emery does. What’s certain is that Emery is a big personality and isn’t afraid to make big decisions even if that means dropping Ozil from the starting 11<br /><br /><b>[With Ozil no longer considered to be the main man for Arsenal, Winterburn claims that mantle has been passed to a free-scoring frontman]</b> Without a shadow of a doubt, <b>[Pierre-Emerick]</b> <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> will be Arsenal’s most important player this season. You saw from the <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> game, he had very few opportunities to score but the one real opportunity that he got, his composure and finishing was perfect. If he stays fit, he’s going to have a huge season again for Arsenal, and will certainly be challenging for the Golden Boot again. It gives the team a huge lift when you know you’ve got a goal-scorer in your team. He is similar to Ian Wright in that sense. As a team, we knew that if you can keep a clean sheet, then Wrighty will usually pop up with a goal. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> is looking like that at the moment for this current side, which is great for the club</p>

Last season he had a lack of funds. He had a group of players that needed to be changed, and it wasn’t really his team. Now we’re seeing a lot more players that he’s brought into the team. He’s got to find a way for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to be competitive, particularly at home, because their away form is nowhere near good enough. He’s got to find a formation and a system that isn’t going to give so many chances away.

They’ve got to stem the flow of attacks from the opposition, and they’re giving away far too many opportunities far too easily. Emery needs to find a solution very quickly because you can’t keep conceding two or three goals and hope to win games</p>

He’s got five captains and he can easily do that. I don’t agree with five captains and I don’t like this ‘vote for your captain scenario’. The manager should pick the captain. I find having five captains very, very bizarre.

What money has he got to spend? Can he get the right players in January? It can be very, very difficult in such a short window.

He’s not going to be forced out the door if the club don’t want him.<br /><br /><a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>’s performances have improved. There’s no doubt about that. But, again, if you want to see a 90 minutes performance from <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>, you’re going to be disappointed. He’s not that type of player. He’s in the game for 10 minutes, he might then disappear for a bit, but then he comes back into the game. But if you give him enough of the ball and he will create something for you. But is that enough for the current manager, and can he do a bit more defensively?<br /><br />You’re never going to get <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> tackling, but can he get into positions to slow the opposition down or go and press properly when the manager wants you to press? I think that’s the questions that will be asked from <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> to <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>, to suggest whether he plays more regularly and what involvement he will have next season, which for me is more intriguing</p>
