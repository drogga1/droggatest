  <p><b>[Savo Milosevic has admitted he expects to lose his job on the back of the disastrous campaign and echoed Nemanja Matic’s thoughts]</b> Reading between the lines of Curcic’s statements after the Czech game, one could see that he is on the brink of stepping down and I am in the same boat with him.<br /><br />I have asked for support and patience for the players for the past eight months but their lack of commitment is quite simply indefensible</p>

  <p><b>[Savo Milosevic anticipates tough World Cup for ‘talented’ Serbia]</b> The qualification for the World Cup that we achieved was very important. Because, as you say, it’s been six years since we played in a major tournament. Now we will be in a complicated group and it will not be easy. We have Brazil with us, and you know everything Brazil represents. And the other two will be hard to beat as well. Switzerland are an experienced team. They participate regularly in these tournaments. As for Costa Rica, they are like all the teams of South or Central America. There is a lot of fervor and they will be difficult to maneuver past. It will not be easy, but I think we have the talent to get good results. At least against the Swiss and Costa Ricans. I believe and I know we have a squad with enough talent. I don’t know if it will be enough to qualify, but I know we are well armed. But, you never know in football. There is no guarantee<br /><br />Krstajic’s experience? It could be a problem. But we must settle him. He was an important player. He played World Cups. As a coach, he only started recently. It’s not ideal, yes. Because he doesn’t have much experience as a coach. However, you have to trust him. Because he also has lots of talent. He knows the country and all our players. The players have respect for him. And that can also be positive. I think it should be fine for him</p>

  <p><b>[Savo Milosevic has said <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> recruit <a href="luka-jovic.html">Luka Jovic</a> is a goal machine every big club in the world needs]</b> <b>[It’s]</b> definitely not going to get bigger than this. It’s going to be tough for Luka, it will be difficult, but he possesses such a great quality of scoring goals. He is a goal machine. It’s a big club <b>[where]</b> there is a lot of pressure and it’s important how he is starts. He is still young but psychologically, if he can handle the pressure of a big club, things will be good for him. He is a player that every big club in the world needs. Those players with a capacity to score 25-30 goals a season, there isn’t many of them. He is definitely one of them<br /><br />I believe they will be a little bit patient with him because of his age, but not too much, Madrid are a big club and they won’t wait a long time. Luka scored 25-30 goals last season and I believe Madrid are bigger with better potential. Madrid will create chances and if Luka starts well and collects confidence from the beginning, things could go in the right direction immediately<br /><br /><b>[Headlined by <a href="luka-jovic.html">Jovic</a>, <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>’s Andrija Zivkovic, <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht</a> recruit Dejan Joveljic and <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> winger Nemanja Radonjic, Serbia bowed out in the group stage after three losses - including a humiliating 6-1 defeat to Germany]</b> It’s very difficult to answer in one response, I need two days to explain everything. In the process of making the football players at 10-18 years of age, we are far behind big countries. We need to improve in all aspects, physically especially, sports medicine - those things are very important. Tactically and technically, we need to improve our process. Our system is too old. People working in the system, they don’t understand what it is needed in modern football. So, we are behind and it’s exactly what you see when you see our teams, we have talented players but many things missing</p>

  <p><b>[Partizan win Belgrade derby in front of 25,000 fans]</b> I thank the fans for their fantastic support and it was great to grind out this win in front of a full house. Having that kind of support was absolutely imperative today. It was great to see a near-capacity crowd after such a long barren spell. I think we did pretty well in a very tough match and reaffirmed that when the going gets tough, the tough get going. It was tense, tempers flared here and there but no one crossed any lines and credit to Red Star too for their sportsmanlike behaviour</p>
