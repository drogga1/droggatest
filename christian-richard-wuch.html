<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Germany coach Christian Richard Wuch eyes qualification from the group stage of the FIFA U-17 World Cup as their primary target]</b> It is a historical moment not only for India but for us as well. We want to make it through from the group stage and that’s our expectation <b>[for now]</b>. This is good for the team. We have many players who played the youth league in Europe which is like a Champions League for the youth teams. <b>[Leipzig’s]</b> Eric <b>[Majetschak]</b> is one of these players who played against Istanbul around three weeks ago. Every game against international or World Cup teams is a great development for the players.<br /><br /><b>[On the grass issue]</b> I cannot explain. The players have a little problem with the grass <b>[in Goa]</b> while playing the ball but we are getting used to it and it will get better for us<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the Indian weather]</b> We have come to India on the 1st of October. It <b>[the weather]</b> is not like Europe but after five or six days I think we have acclimatised ourselves to the weather<br /><br /><b>[Christian Fruchtl could not travel with the team this time as his club Bayern Munich refused to release the player]</b> I think the reason why Christian <b>[Fruchtl]</b> stayed in Germany is logical. Manuel Neuer is injured. After talking to the coaches of Bayern, it is natural that we don’t get the player to the World Cup because the club needs him</p>
