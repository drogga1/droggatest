<blockquote>
  <p><b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> told Man Utd fans are ‘100 per cent behind’ him]</b> The supporters are 100 per cent behind the manager. It was a woeful performance. That happens, but when you are a Manchester United player you can’t saunter around casually, you’ve got to work harder than the opposition. That didn’t happen <b>[at Goodison Park]</b> and it didn’t happen in the two Wolves games <b>[2-1 defeats in the FA Cup and Premier League]</b>, you’ve got to want it more than the opposition. When you put the Manchester United shirt on, you’ve got to give everything. Ole understands that, and the supporters are 100 per cent behind the manager, and he shouldn’t have to apologise to us as supporters<br /><br />What is clear is the squad isn’t fit for purpose and that goes to the very top, to Joel Glazer and the Glazer family. When Sir Alex and David Gill were here, they structured the profile of the squad properly. Manchester City have the two guys from Barcelona <b>[sporting director Txiki Begiristain and chief executive Ferran Soriano]</b> doing that particular job and I think going into the future, we expect more from the Glazers. At Old Trafford, we expect to win trophies and we expect a certain level of performance and a squad that can do that. You’ve got to spend money, invest wisely, you’ve got to get a balance and a blend between the youth system and the players that you bring in. The last three managers have failed <b>[in that]</b>, because they perhaps haven’t had the amount of support they should have from the top, or with the players and the profiling. I think Ole understands that and has a vision of Manchester United that is totally in step with the supporters. Now it is up to the Glazers to match that.</p>
