  <p><b>[Sokratis Papastathopoulos’s father on a move to Arsenal]</b> There was interest from United but he had to wait until July for them. United have a very good relationship with Dortmund, the teams talked but Sokratis chose to go to Arsenal. Arsenal had talked two years ago but I don’t know why he didn’t sign. He is going to a higher level, the world’s most competitive league and I believe he will do very well. Sokratis is in his last year at Dortmund. This was a major reason <b>[for completing the move]</b> He is happy, he is in England at the moment and will be doing what he has to do, the typical things, everything will go well, he is happy, he is changing.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have announced the signing of defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos from Borussia Dortmund for a fee in the region of €19 million]</b> It’s a beautiful moment and I’m very happy that I will be here for the next years. Arsenal is one of the three biggest teams in the Premier League and one very big club. It has a lot of fans and a very big history. Like I said before, I’m very happy that for the next years I will be here to help the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Sokratis Papastathopoulos can aid Arsenal’s defensive philosophy]</b> If a player makes a mistake off the pitch, we have a duty to help him so that does not happen again. And if you address Auba: Of course, he was not on time. But we also have to see what he has done for this team over the past four and a half years. The rules must of course be respected. But the most important thing is to solve such problems within the group without drama.<br /><br /><b>[He was forced to respond to claims from Bosz’s assistant Hendrie Kruzen that his on-field displays had let Dortmund down]</b> It is unnecessary to answer. I’ve played at Borussia Dortmund for four and a half years, I’ve played more than 180 games for BVB. And I have always given everything. I will give my answer on the pitch. Of course, criticism is never nice. But it only affects me when it is justified. I do not consider this criticism justified</p>

It’s a little bit <b>[strange]</b> but it’s also very beautiful that I’ve come to one team but I also have two players who I was together with for a lot of years. I know them both very well and I’m very happy.<br /><br /><b>[On himself]</b> I’m a normal defender who likes to defend.

What he showed in his last year in Dortmund, he was one of the best in the Bundesliga. I think he can also be one of the best here in the Premier League.</p>

  <p><b>[There was only one team on the pitch during Arsenal vs Spurs]</b> I think today we were much better. We lost our concentration for 10 minutes after 30 minutes of the game. In the first half and second half we were much better and could have scored more goals. I think today there was only one team on the pitch. It was tough. The derbies are like this. It was very important for us that we won but it’s more important the next game. If we want to continue and believe we have to play like this in the next games. We need to improve sometimes but today we were much better. If you see the game they did just two things. Maybe we also have to be in these two situations when we conceded. I speak about everyone in general. After our penalty we also had chances to score. It’s very good that when we go down that we continue <b>[to fight]</b>. We played much better than the beginning and I’m very happy that the points are coming because sometimes you play very good and the points don’t come. I hope that we continue on this road. I think it was the best performance of the season. Today was a great atmosphere, a very good game - I like it, I’m very happy that I played in a game like this.<br /><br /><b>[On Harry Kane]</b> He’s a very good player, of course. He’s one of the best strikers in the world - but not today<br /><br />I’ve known Aubameyang for more than five years. He’s a great player and in the Bundesliga he scored more than 25 goals every year so he’s a very good player. It’s good that maybe sometimes we speak for the other <b>[players]</b> so we’re more concentrated and do our work. Auba is a good player and if you have a good team next to you then it’s not as difficult<br /><br /><b>[On Lucas Torreira and Granit Xhaka]</b> Lucas is a very good player also and a very good guy. I think he’s also very important for our team. It’s the same for Granit, they know when they have to go and when they have to stay which makes it more easy for us at the back. I think it’s good <b>[playing three at the back]</b>. It’s something new because this team doesn’t usually play with three at the back. We don’t have to find excuses, we are professional players, we are at this level and when the coach says we have to play with four, three or five we have to be there<br /><br />He <b>[Emery]</b> is very happy. It’s very good because he speaks a lot to us every day. All the stuff with the work and video analysis is very good for the players and helps us a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil remains very important to Arsenal]</b> He played very good. Mesut is a fantastic player and when he is fit he is one of the most important players of the team. Of course, when something is not going good, everybody is there to criticise but we have to see also what Mesut did in the last years for this team. All the team, all the players are behind him and we need a good Mesut to go <b>[forward]</b> because we know that he is very important for us. He was sick, he had some problems, but after he came back for training, it was the same situation as me: when I was injured and I came back, it is not that I have to play from the first game in the first XI. Now he is good. He did well yesterday and I hope in the next games he will go <b>[forward]</b> like this. He enjoys <b>[himself]</b> and we enjoy that he is with us. But when you are injured, it is difficult. Also, I feel in the first 10 minutes, I feel like a fish out of water yesterday as I was out for one month. Mesut is very important, he is a very good guy and we need him.</p>

It’s not about how we play. It’s also that we, all, everybody, believe that we can do it. This is very important for the team, for the spirit. Everyday in training we know that we are there and it’s very important for us. We win together, we lose together, we are one team. And we have to go on like this in the next games. It’s very important for us and for our manager that we take one of the four positions so that next year we are in the Champions League<br /><br />I think that we had in the beginning of the year a lot of injured players. Of course it was a new team, new coach, new manager, new things. Every game, every month that is coming, I think that we will be much better. Now that it’s coming to the end. Every point counts and every minute we have to give 100 percent</p>

  <p><b>[Sokratis reveals Arsenal dressing room anger]</b> We didn’t play good. It was a really bad game from us. The first 20 minutes was good but we lost some easy balls and we knew that on the counter-attack they are a very good team and we paid for this. For 20, 25 minutes we had the control of the game, the possession of the ball but they played very good at what they do, the counter-attack, and we were not there. They had three or four chances and scored three goals. After that it was very difficult for us to change the game.<br /><br />All the players take responsibility. We are not stupid. We know that we didn’t play good. It is not the problem of the coach, the system, it is nothing. It is just us. This was a bad moment for us. It is not time to have excuses. We have to look forward: three games more. We need to win all the games and get nine points and we’ll see if we can be in the top four<br /><br />If we face <b>[it]</b> like this, we will lose. It is another difficult game. We know that we have to take the points <b>[at Leicester]</b>. Three games, nine points. I trust 100 per cent my team and the players and I think we can do it. It is not about mentality, it is about nothing. We won two games in the last ten days away from home <b>[before Wolves]</b>. We have to be in the best four teams in the Premier League and then after to win also the Europa League. We cannot wait only for our one chance. We have two chances and we have to fight for both</p>

  <p><b>[Sokratis has hit back at Arsenal’s critics after the Gunners bounced back from their Premier League misery]</b> I hear that everyone speaks about the system, the manager. The manager tries every day to give the best to us, to the team. We want to to play in the Champions League. This is the point, our manager and the staff behind him help us every day <b>[to do that]</b>. We work a lot with the training, the video, we analyse everything and I hope in the end we are right.<br /><br />I think the critics are good to hear, to improve, but they do not touch us mentally. We are a big family and we are all together, we stay all together. Of course, when you play at a team like Arsenal and you lose three games you hear critics and you have to improve. We are here to give the best for the club, for the fans and for ourselves also. I think that the biggest point is that we have to stay focused. In one week, for example, <b>[Laurent]</b> Koscielny makes a mistake or I make a mistake or <b>[Shkodran]</b> Mustafi the same, Nacho <b>[Monreal]</b> too, we are people and not robots<br /><br />I came here because I would like to play in the Champions League, I didn’t come here to play in the Europa League. At this moment I believe and I think only this - to play in the Champions League. We can go to the final and win the Europa League. I think we deserve <b>[to be in the Champions League]</b> of course. Last week was not good, but we have to think that okay, three games we played really bad - but also we have to think what we did over the whole eight months. It is not about three games putting everything out. This is football. You can win, you can lose<br /><br />They have two very good strikers, I don’t know how many millions of euros they cost. If you make even the slightest mistake at this level players like that can take advantage of that<br /><br />In training I think it is more easy. You give them one and they go inside. I am happy that I train every day with these players. Every player believes and wants to play in the Champions League next year and to go to the <b>[Europa League]</b> final but there is still a lot of work to do. There are still 90 minutes left. I think we have given a good response to the last three games that we were very bad in, now we have to keep this form for Sunday and next week</p>

For example, I am 31 and I don’t have a lot of personal achievements - my best achievement is if this team win.

Last week it was a clear penalty, they didn’t use VAR and we lose the game. This week, it was a goal. I watch again and Calum did nothing. We lose three points. Of course, we also made mistakes, we can speak about those mistakes, why we conceded and why we didn’t score. We can discuss about a lot of things, but last week and this week, if the VAR is used better we have four points more. And if we had 19 points today it’s a different thing. Of course, we have to improve, we have to work and do better things. But we have also to watch what happened. VAR for me is a good solution, but the referees have to use it every time.

  <p><b>[Sokratis: Beat <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> &amp; <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> could explode into life]</b> Of course, it is a very difficult game. Sometimes, these are games where you can explode. We need one good game in our home to explode<br /><br />You have to have quality but to show the quality you have to first show intensity, win the duels, be organised. The team has quality, but to show the quality you have to do the dirty work. If you do the dirty work and you’re organised, you can win. But first of all, you have to work on intensity, pace and organisation</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defender Sokratis relishing life under <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> after <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> win]</b> We have started again, I think we have a lot of space to improve. The second half we didn’t play like the first but I think every game we are getting better. The fun is back!<br /><br />I think it was great. We were great in the first half and showed a maturity in the second. We have to be honest and admit physically we are not ready, but you have to show heart and this team is ready to change a lot of things. We showed that today and we are going to do big things in the future. <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> is a great coach, he was a great player. I think he can improve every player. And in life when you are happy results can be different. If you work with happiness and believing what you are doing it is totally different. Our season started very bad but things can change</p>

  <p><b>[Sokratis Papastathopoulos is eager to point out that defenders are not robots as his form at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> casts doubt over his future at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a>]</b> Football has changed a lot in the past 10 or 12 years. When I started football, I was in Italy. I was in Greece first, but afterwards I made the step to Italy. It was not so necessary to play out from the back and because of this, you also didn’t concede a lot of chances or a lot of goals.<br /><br />Now, every team, or most, has to start from the back and exchange a lot of passes to arrive in the opposite area and to score. The more passes and more things you do, you also have more risk inside. For this, it’s more beautiful football, but also the teams concede more goals because the players are not robots. Everybody makes mistakes.<br /><br />That’s why being a defender these days is very difficult. I think it is one of the most difficult positions. Maybe you don’t have to run like a midfielder, but every mistake that you do is a very hard mistake for the team, so you pay very expensively. But I still love being a defender. And for me, the part I enjoy most is when you can defend well like a team, to control the game, to fight for every ball and every duel.<br /><br />Every day is the one you have to show to everybody that you have a strong mentality and also your qualities in the game and mentality, especially to win. We have had some difficult moments this season and we know we need to improve, but we have the quality to do it. We just need the confidence<br /><br /><b>[Sokratis added on his role in a bigger picture at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a>]</b> To be one of the best defenders, you need to have everything to be complete. It’s about focusing on the game very well, pace, power, technique also, to control the game from behind. It’s also important to be a winner and to be a winner, your mentality has to be at a high level every day. In every game, every training session, every duel, you have to win it. If that means we keep the zero in the defence, then I’ve done my job<br /><br /><b>[He considers <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> rival <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> to set the standard in the modern era]</b> What <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> did last year was something very difficult for every defender to do. Last year for him was perfect, especially for all the people close to him who helped him a lot. He was very good and it was a good year for him. With the way football is going in front, especially when everybody thinks about offensive players and how they can score more, I think the defenders need to start getting more credit</p>

  <p><b>[Sokratis curses <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s VAR luck after seeing <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> sent off at Palace]</b> VAR is there to help the referee. I didn’t show a good reaction but we are disappointed because we haven’t had a lot of luck. It wasn’t against VAR or anything<br /><br />If we watch the game again, we are disappointed because we played much better than them and had the chances to win the game. The first 35 minutes we played very good and did what our manager asked. In the next 10 minutes and first 10 minutes of the second half, we lost the mentality and structure</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defender Sokratis says VAR must be respected now it is has been established in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> Of course when you lose the game from the VAR, sometimes you are disappointed. But I am not the special man who can say if the VAR is good or not. I think the VAR is there to help the referees. It’s the first year that VAR is in England. Of course it will improve, everybody expects it will improve in the years. We have to be respectful<br /><br /><b>[Focusing on the incident which saw <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> dismissed against <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>]</b> I’ve said already that VAR is there to help the referees. I think this year we are unlucky because VAR in three or four games can be better for us. I’m not thinking about the game on Saturday, but about the game at home against Palace and at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>. But in the end it’s not something where I criticise the VAR. The VAR I think is good because it’s there to help the referees<br /><br />At the end I think the point was not bad because with football today with 10 players is very difficult. But if we watch all the game, we are disappointed because I think that we play much better, especially the first 35 minutes when we played really good, we did what the manager asked from us and what we’d worked on the last few days. We switched off for the first 10 minutes of the second half and of course we conceded an unlucky goal because until that moment I think they’d had maybe only one shot. After the red card it was difficult. We had to fight more, to show more spirit and we had to give everything. In the end, one point I think we are not happy with, but it’s not also the worst</p>

Now we understand that first when you have three things (trophies) to fight for and lose one that last year you made the final in, it’s hard. The first thing the manager said to us is that this game finished and we have to look forward. We still have a lot of games in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but it is difficult and this year we didn’t start very good</p>
