  <p><b>[Sokratis accepted full responsibility for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s collapse at <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> and apologised to his team-mates in the changing room after the game]</b> I think that I cost the game for the team. It was my mistake for something simple that I don’t have to do. I think this was why we lose the three points. I don’t want to speak about others. It was my mistake and this cost the game. Nothing else. The other guys tried their best. I didn’t have to do this mistake. Without my mistake, we would take the three points<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he had apologised for his error, which came when <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were trying to play out from a goal-kick]</b> Of course. I apologised because I cost the game for the team and I have to work harder. I know up to this moment I didn’t have a mistake, I didn’t do nothing. Everything was near too perfect. But defence is no risk and it was my mistake<br /><br /><b>[From the moment Cleverley took advantage of Sokratis’ error, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> had little answer to the constant wave of attacks that <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> unleashed as the second half wore on. An equaliser seemed inevitable and it finally arrived when Luiz tripped Pereyra with 10 minutes remaining, the third penalty <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> had conceded in their last three games]</b> We didn’t have the same pace in the second half as in the first half. But if we didn’t do these mistakes, I don’t think we draw. Of course they had other chances to score more, but if we didn’t make these mistakes then nothing happens</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal captain <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a> has found support from team-mate Sokratis Papastathopoulos, who says that Switzerland international is deserving of the role]</b> Granit has been here for many years so I don’t find a reason as to why he shouldn’t be the captain. We have five ‘captains’ and everybody has to accept this and be together. ‘m happy because I know the guys who are captains will do very well for the team. Of course, if I want to say something, I have experience and everyone respects it. So, of course the captain is important, but as the coach said, it’s also important that the other players keep the atmosphere in the club very good. There are a lot of things Granit does behind the scenes. When you get on the pitch for your 90 minutes, it all comes from the week before and I think that he and all the other players work really hard for the team<br /><br /><b>[He urged the support to be patient with the team, despite a 15-year drought without winning the league]</b> For me, I can understand because the fans wait a lot of years to win something. They have to understand that we are here, we give 100 per cent and then the first time they win, we win also. For example, I am 31 and I don’t have a lot of personal achievements - my best achievement is if this team win. Of course, they have to be emotional but also they have to know that we are here and we going to give more than 100 per cent</p>

  <p><b>[Sokratis has blasted <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s use of VAR after complaining it has robbed <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> of four precious points in the past week]</b> In a league like <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the best league in the world, the VAR has to be used in a better way. Last week it was a clear penalty, they didn’t use VAR and we lose the game. This week, it was a goal. I watch again and Calum did nothing. We lose three points. Of course, we also made mistakes, we can speak about those mistakes, why we conceded and why we didn’t score. We can discuss about a lot of things, but last week and this week, if the VAR is used better we have four points more. And if we had 19 points today it’s a different thing. Of course, we have to improve, we have to work and do better things. But we have also to watch what happened. VAR for me is a good solution, but the referees have to use it every time. I believe <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is the best league in the world so everything has to be perfect<br /><br /><b>[Goals from Sokratis and David Luiz had put them in a commanding position inside 10 minutes, but Palace reduced the deficit when VAR awarded them a penalty for a foul by Chambers on <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a>. <a href="jordan-ayew.html">Jordan Ayew</a> then levelled with a back-post header early in the second half and the visitors held on for a point, despite some late pressure from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> which saw <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a> go close twice]</b> We had a lot of chances to close the game, but we didn’t close it. The first goal they scored was a penalty, until then they didn’t have a chance. The second half we had one unlucky moment, after that we had enough chances. We had to score more. I think we were unlucky</p>

For me it’s important that <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> first has to score, he has to do his work. The captaincy or who has this <b>[armband]</b> on the pitch, I don’t think it is very important. He is a very good guy, but who has the captaincy is not very important. It is important that all the team is good in the dressing room. We are like a family. In the end who brings to the pitch the captaincy is the last thing<br /><br /><b>[Emery’s side are winless in four matches in all competitions]</b> It’s a very big game, a game we have to win. Of course we have a lot of games in front and if we see last year we were there but in the last seven games, we didn’t win one. The other teams were six, seven points behind us but in the end they were in front. We need to be consistent all year, not only one month. <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> is in a very good moment, they’re a very hungry team. You can see this.

Sometimes, these are games where you can explode. We need one good game in our home to explode<br /><br />You have to have quality but to show the quality you have to first show intensity, win the duels, be organised. The team has quality, but to show the quality you have to do the dirty work. If you do the dirty work and you’re organised, you can win. But first of all, you have to work on intensity, pace and organisation</p>

The second half we didn’t play like the first but I think every game we are getting better. The fun is back!<br /><br />I think it was great. We were great in the first half and showed a maturity in the second. We have to be honest and admit physically we are not ready, but you have to show heart and this team is ready to change a lot of things. We showed that today and we are going to do big things in the future. <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> is a great coach, he was a great player. I think he can improve every player. And in life when you are happy results can be different. If you work with happiness and believing what you are doing it is totally different. Our season started very bad but things can change</p>

  <p><b>[Sokratis Papastathopoulos is eager to point out that defenders are not robots as his form at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> casts doubt over his future at Emirates Stadium]</b> Football has changed a lot in the past 10 or 12 years. When I started football, I was in Italy. I was in Greece first, but afterwards I made the step to Italy. It was not so necessary to play out from the back and because of this, you also didn’t concede a lot of chances or a lot of goals.<br /><br />Now, every team, or most, has to start from the back and exchange a lot of passes to arrive in the opposite area and to score. The more passes and more things you do, you also have more risk inside. For this, it’s more beautiful football, but also the teams concede more goals because the players are not robots. Everybody makes mistakes.<br /><br />That’s why being a defender these days is very difficult. I think it is one of the most difficult positions. Maybe you don’t have to run like a midfielder, but every mistake that you do is a very hard mistake for the team, so you pay very expensively. But I still love being a defender. And for me, the part I enjoy most is when you can defend well like a team, to control the game, to fight for every ball and every duel.<br /><br />Every day is the one you have to show to everybody that you have a strong mentality and also your qualities in the game and mentality, especially to win. We have had some difficult moments this season and we know we need to improve, but we have the quality to do it. We just need the confidence<br /><br /><b>[Sokratis added on his role in a bigger picture at Emirates Stadium]</b> To be one of the best defenders, you need to have everything to be complete. It’s about focusing on the game very well, pace, power, technique also, to control the game from behind. It’s also important to be a winner and to be a winner, your mentality has to be at a high level every day. In every game, every training session, every duel, you have to win it. If that means we keep the zero in the defence, then I’ve done my job<br /><br /><b>[He considers <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> rival <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> to set the standard in the modern era]</b> What <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> did last year was something very difficult for every defender to do. Last year for him was perfect, especially for all the people close to him who helped him a lot. He was very good and it was a good year for him. With the way football is going in front, especially when everybody thinks about offensive players and how they can score more, I think the defenders need to start getting more credit</p>

I didn’t show a good reaction but we are disappointed because we haven’t had a lot of luck. It wasn’t against VAR or anything<br /><br />If we watch the game again, we are disappointed because we played much better than them and had the chances to win the game. The first 35 minutes we played very good and did what our manager asked. In the next 10 minutes and first 10 minutes of the second half, we lost the mentality and structure</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal defender Sokratis says VAR must be respected now it is has been established in the Premier League]</b> Of course when you lose the game from the VAR, sometimes you are disappointed. But I am not the special man who can say if the VAR is good or not. I think the VAR is there to help the referees. It’s the first year that VAR is in England. Of course it will improve, everybody expects it will improve in the years. We have to be respectful<br /><br /><b>[Focusing on the incident which saw <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> dismissed against Crystal Palace]</b> I’ve said already that VAR is there to help the referees. I think this year we are unlucky because VAR in three or four games can be better for us. I’m not thinking about the game on Saturday, but about the game at home against Palace and at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>. But in the end it’s not something where I criticise the VAR. The VAR I think is good because it’s there to help the referees<br /><br />At the end I think the point was not bad because with football today with 10 players is very difficult. But if we watch all the game, we are disappointed because I think that we play much better, especially the first 35 minutes when we played really good, we did what the manager asked from us and what we’d worked on the last few days. We switched off for the first 10 minutes of the second half and of course we conceded an unlucky goal because until that moment I think they’d had maybe only one shot. After the red card it was difficult. We had to fight more, to show more spirit and we had to give everything. In the end, one point I think we are not happy with, but it’s not also the worst</p>

Now we understand that first when you have three things (trophies) to fight for and lose one that last year you made the final in, it’s hard.
