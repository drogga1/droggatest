We’re convinced of their qualities and their potential for development and hope they settle in quickly to life at the campus.</p>

  <p><b>[Lasse Gunther: Bayern’s rapid teen sensation earning <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a> comparisons]</b> I don’t think it helps any talent if they are compared to a world-class player in the early years. The fact that Lasse draws parallels with Arjen is difficult to avoid due to his style of play. Lasse particularly impresses with his speed and dynamism. He really is exceptionally fast for his age.<br /><br />He can athletically prevail against the U-19 defenders. He is a very good finisher. He shoots hard and precisely with both his left and right foot. In order to play football cleanly at his pace, he has to be even more precise and focused. He learns better in the U-19s because he has stronger opponents there. He can’t just put the ball in front of him and run away from opponents<br /><br />You can see what kind of rumours there are at Bayern, but it is certainly too early to think about it <b>[a first-team debut]</b>. There is still a long way to go. Lasse is a good boy from a down-to-earth family. He is very ambitious and determined, which is also shown by the fact that he wants to graduate from high school</p>
