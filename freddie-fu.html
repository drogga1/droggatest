<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Zlatan Ibrahimovic could have stayed at Manchester United and played more next season]</b> Right now, he can play in the Premier League if he wants to. But the new season is starting in MLS, so if you’re going to make a move you’ve got to do it now. He could still play there at United. He’s very intelligent, not your usual football player. He is very skilful, not just physically but also he can make things happen. I think if he stayed he would’ve played more next year. But he is 36, it’s one of those things. Zlatan had been talking about it for a long time, that the MLS had been trying to get him for a number of years. After his injury and recovery, maybe it was just time to move. It would have been a hard decision but I know a lot of teams team tried to woo him, not just LA Galaxy, but all over Europe too. They did all want him. But he’s been in Europe all his life.<br /><br />He and the coach <b>[Jose Mourinho]</b> get along well. He liked Manchester United, he’s a hero before the injury. His idea was to see if we can go back and win more titles, especially the Champions League. After United lost to Sevilla, I think his decision, in my opinion, was that maybe that was it. This is my feeling. United won’t be able to catch up with Manchester City in the Premier League either. Maybe they can win the FA Cup which is good but not as good as the Champions League<br /><br />I don’t know what he wants to do with his life, but Los Angeles gives him more opportunities, like David Beckham. He’s got many endorsements and other things like that. I think he’ll be great on the pitch. Soccer is not as big in America but I think with him, he will elevate it to a level much like Beckham and other people did, like Pele many years ago. He is one of those characters. I think the games with LA Galaxy will be featured on television more now</p>
