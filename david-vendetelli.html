<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Record signing Alexandre Lacazette is happy despite being benched for two of Arsenal’s biggest Premier League clashes of the season, according to his agent David Vendetelli]</b> Our way of working is to relativise things: 11 matches, nine starts. Of course, it’s not nice to see that he didn’t start that match, but it was - as Arsene Wenger explained - for tactical reasons. He’s learning. Alex needs to have calm around him. He’s happy, and Arsenal are too with his work. It’s not because a player doesn’t play, even though it’s two important games of course. He would have preferred to have played them.<br /><br /><b>[Alan Shearer went a step further in calling for Lacazette to confront Wenger over his absence]</b> When you’re outside the club, I can understand the questions. I understand, but I think Alex isn’t complaining about his playing time, even if he would prefer to start games like those against City or Liverpool. But he talks to the manager, the staff - there’s no problem. Afterwards, there’s a choice made. You can’t, every time your player doesn’t play, even if it’s Alexandre Lacazette, knock on the door or pick up the phone and talk to the manager. No, no, it’s not time yet. Everything is fine</p>
