  <p>[West Ham have completed the signing of <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> midfielder Pablo Fornals for a reported fee of £24 million] He [Fornals] is a player we have monitored closely for some time, having seen him make excellent progress as a young midfielder in one of the best leagues in the world. I personally have followed his career since he was a youth player with me at Malaga, and I know we have signed an incredible professional and an incredible character. This is something that is very important for us at West Ham United now - not only a very good player but also a very good person with a good mentality.<br /><br />To represent Spain as a full international at the age of 20, and then to have made over 150 appearances in La Liga by the age of 23, is a sign of great quality and character. He joins us as a young player still with many years ahead of him, yet with strong experience and already proven at the very highest level. We believe that his style and ability perfectly complements the midfielders already at the club, and we are very pleased to have secured his signing so early in the summer. Now he will go to Italy to play for Spain in the Under-21 European Championship, where we hope he will have success before coming to London. We look forward to seeing the impact he will have in a West Ham shirt, and believe that he has all of the qualities required to become a big success in the Premier League</p>

  <p>[West Ham have completed the club-record signing of Eintracht Frankfurt striker Sebastien Haller for a fee reported to be worth an initial £40 million plus add-ons] It is no secret that we have been in the process of identifying a top class striker to add to the squad this summer, and much work has gone on behind the scenes to ensure that we were in a position to act once the right opportunity became available. Sebastien is a player we have been watching closely for some time - he has always been a key target and someone who myself, Manuel Pellegrini and <a href="david-sullivan.html">David Sullivan</a> were very keen to bring to the football club</p>

  <p>[West Ham have completed an £8 million deal for Albian Ajeti from FC Basel, with the Swiss striker penning a four-year contract that includes the option for a further two seasons] We are very happy to welcome Albian to West Ham United. He is another very young player who we believe can have a big future at the club. Our scouts have watched him many times and given very good reports. He is an aggressive, quick striker who likes to play in the box. He has scored a lot of goals, both for Basel and the Switzerland national team at a number of levels, and we feel he is ready to make this big step with West Ham. Our approach this summer – not counting the experienced goalkeepers who have arrived – has been to sign young players who have their best years in front of them and can have a good impact. We believe Albian is ready to perform from the beginning, but we also think that an international player of 22 years old can improve greatly working with us. We wish him all the very best in his career at London Stadium</p>
