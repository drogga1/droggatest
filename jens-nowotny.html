  <p><b>[Former Bayer Leverkusen defender Jens Nowotny has hailed the performance of <a href="iker-casillas.html">Iker Casillas</a> in the 2002 Champions League final]</b> We were superior and made a great game. But that night <a href="iker-casillas.html">Iker Casillas</a>’s star rose. He could have gone behind his goal and we would still have hit him!<br /><br />We could keep up with the Galacticos. Not only with Real, that season we beat <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, we knocked <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> out of the competition. We had no reason to admire other players<br /><br /><b>[The former defender admits that the game has changed significantly since his playing days]</b> Everything is marketed somehow. Spanish cup finals take place in Saudi Arabia, international tournaments are inflated so that more and more teams can participate. There is only higher, faster. That is the basic idea of the free-market economy. Both the players and the bosses take part in this. It is about money. The most honest in modern football in my opinion is the ultra, the die-hard fan who would do anything for his club. If a player scores a goal for Leverkusen in his last game and kisses the logo and then scores for Bayern in the next game and kisses the logo again, I find it morally questionable. But maybe it’s just an honest way to say: ‘I don’t give a sh*t what logo is on my chest. I play here because of the money</p>

  <p><b>[Former Germany international Jens Nowotny says <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> should carefully consider his future movement]</b> He is on the way to becoming a world-class player. He has huge potential. Another year in Leverkusen would certainly not hurt him. For his personal development as a player and as a person it would be good for him to be in an environment in which he feels comfortable - and that’s the case in Leverkusen. Otherwise he would not have already spent 10 years at the club. To fulfil his potential, the next step is very, very important. He has to ask himself questions: are there clubs where he can develop if there is a possible change? Or are there only clubs where he has to arrive and function as a finished player? On the one hand, you need coaches like <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> or <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>, who can take him further. On the other hand, such a coach also has to work for a club where he is allowed to develop<br /><br />He could develop at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, but he would have to win his chance to play first and foremost. That works better for some clubs than for others. For a young player, <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> may be better than <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in terms of club and environment<br /><br />The hype that has arisen around Kai brushes off him. His character and environment are not so receptive to praise</p>
