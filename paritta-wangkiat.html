<blockquote>
  <p>Friday’s lecture by army chief Gen <a href="apirat-kongsompong.html">Apirat Kongsompong</a> <b>[at the Kittikachorn auditorium of the Royal Thai Army headquarters]</b> has left many people stunned. It’s not just because his speech on right-wing extremism branded some academics and politicians as ‘the left’ and people with implanted ‘communist chips’. But it is also because his emotional 1.5-hour lecture, which reflected his views on politics and young people, has raised widespread concern that it will deepen and prolong the ongoing political polarisation which has already been fuelled by the army and its interventions in politics<br /><br />He accused ‘communist’ politicians and ‘extreme left’ academics of orchestrating a conspiracy and driving information warfare. They used social media to brainwash young people while spreading propaganda and fake news, he said. He claimed these tactics are similar to those which he said have stirred the ongoing protests in Hong Kong which have been led by young people.<br /><br />Despite neither providing evidence nor identifying those whom he accused, some people actually bought into his claims and threw their support behind him. But his speech has brought about strong rebukes too, particularly from young people who have stormed social media platforms with their disapproval and ridicule of his messages<br /><br />The young netizens use of social media to make their political voices heard could have reminded many of the night before the March 24 election when the hashtag toe laew luaek eang dai, literally translated as ‘We’re grown-ups now and can choose for ourselves’, trended at the top of the Thai-language version of Twitter.<br /><br />During the build-up to the election, many ‘adults’ made a point about the possibility that young people would be influenced or misled by propaganda or certain political parties. That resulted in the popularity of the social media hashtag among young voters who wanted to make it known that they had their own thoughts and could form their own judgement<br /><br />The origin of communism stems from a desire to create a utopian classless society with common ownership of the means of production – a counterattack against the 19th- century exploitation of the labour by the greedy capitalist class.<br /><br />But the thinkers who influenced communist ideology, including Karl Marx, did not leave a blueprint for building that utopia. It was some world leaders who interpreted communism and put it in practice. Many ended up with failure as experienced in Maoist China and Stalin’s Soviet Union. They failed to distribute wealth, and instead propelled abuses of power, corruption and the oppression of freedom<br /><br />…This was obvious in Thailand during the lead-up to the Oct 6, 1976, massacre of student protesters at Thammasat University. Before that day, state propaganda had accused them of being ‘communists’, giving a pretext for far-right paramilitaries and state security forces to attack and kill them. There has been no precise death toll from that day, but it is likely that over a hundred lost their lives.<br /><br /> The student protest was made against the return of a former military dictator and anti-communist, Thanom Kittikachorn, to Thailand, following a three-year self-imposed exile in the United States and Singapore as a result of a previous public demonstration<br /><br />… in South Korea’s Jeju Island where thousands of people taking part in the 1940s popular uprisings were jailed or accused of being communists. The evidence showed they were massacred in prisons across the country … Historically, a fear of communism has been associated with extreme violence committed by both states and citizens. It has been used to inflame citizens’ political polarisation and incite hatred<br /><br />Gen <a href="apirat-kongsompong.html">Apirat Kongsompong</a>’s anti-communist sentiment seemed to have its own reason. He told the audience on Friday that his late father Gen Sunthorn Kongsompong, who numbered among the 1991 coup makers, was ‘shot by communists’ when he was on a helicopter flying over Ratchaburi in 1972. His father’s left foot was injured. But he survived</p>
