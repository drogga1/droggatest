  <p><b>[Real Sociedad legend Roberto Lopez Ufarte says <a href="martin-odegaard.html">Martin Odegaard</a> is cut from the same cloth as former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> star <a href="xabi-alonso.html">Xabi Alonso</a> and could go on to fill the boots of <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a> at Santiago Bernabeu]</b> I think he has his head screwed on and he knows why he came here: to show people, to show that he has a lot of ability and that he is waiting for a spot to open up at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. These are just my thoughts, but possibly in the next year when <a href="luka-modric.html">Modric</a> leaves. Possibly, as he has said many times, he is here for two years. They might leave him here because it’s down to the club who pays him, which is not just <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a> but Real Madrid<br /><br />If you ask anyone who the most important players at La Real are, they will say Odegaard, <b>[Alexander]</b> <a href="alexander-isak.html">Isak</a> and <b>[Mikel]</b> Oyarzabal but Odegaard will always be in first place. He has almost all of the tools to play in midfield. We won’t just speak about his technique, which is exquisite, and he knows the exact moment when he has to do something and when to give the ball but what also stands out is his recoveries and pressures. Because the first to put the central defenders under pressure is him. If you pushed me to find one, maybe he holds onto the ball a bit much but they are at the right moments when he thinks the best thing to do is hold onto the ball to let his team-mates get free, but he is a player with talent, he knows what is best for him and for the team above all.<br /><br />I won’t say he reminds me of <a href="xabi-alonso.html">Xabi Alonso</a>, who impacted things in a different way during his time, but at the same time he was a midfielder who did these racking passes that stood out, and yes, he has many similar things and he isn’t too far off Xabi.</p>
