<p>: 2019 08 05
The completion of a swap deal involving <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s Danilo and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>’s <a href="joao-cancelo.html">Joao Cancelo</a> has edged ever closer as the Brazilian has now agreed personal terms with the Italian champions. The former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> full-back will earn a basic salary of €4 million (£3.7m/$4.5m) per year, plus additional bonuses if certain sporting criteria are met</p>

<p>: 2019 08 06
<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> full-back Danilo has arrived in <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> to undergo a medical ahead of his move to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. Danilo will have his medical on Wednesday before he signs a five-year contract with the Italian champions worth €4 million per year.</p>

<p>: 2019 08 07
<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> will send €28 million and the Brazilian defender Danilo to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> for <a href="joao-cancelo.html">Joao Cancelo</a>, who moves to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> after just one year in Turin</p>

  <p><b>[Danilo is motivated to become a better player at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> with the help of former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> team-mate <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>]</b> I spoke to him before coming here. I said to him that I wanted to take the number seven jersey, but it was already taken. He spoke very highly of <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and to play with him will be an extra motivation. I found a very motivated and happy <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. He spoke about the club like a family and this was reassuring to me. It was great to hear such things<br /><br /><b>[Danilo made the switch to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> at a time of transition for the Italian champions, who brought in ex-Chelsea and <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> boss <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> as <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Massimiliano Allegri</a>’s successor]</b> <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> has a very particular style. He likes to command play. <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are two different teams who are difficult to face. I like his style of play very much and I am ready to learn and evolve every day. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> has asked me to be very attentive in the defensive phase of the game, and that I am free to express my potential. I don’t think I’ll have difficulty adapting to what he is asking for. I know that defending is very important in Italy, but I am 28 years old and open to learning anything that I need to become a better player<br /><br />Every moment is important to help forge you as a player. Although I didn’t play the way I wanted to, these years were fundamental and will help me have the right mentality here at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. The first impressions have been good. I have been welcomed warmly and I feel great being here these first few days. There were already discussions with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in the past, but I believe that this is the right moment to be here</p>

  <p><b>[Danilo sees <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> boss cut from same cloth as <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> chief]</b> <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> is very different to Manchester. The fans are much more passionate, they stop you in the street. I like it, they come across more affectionate and motivated. I’m gradually getting to know the city and I feel good. I’ve already realised that the cuisine here is spectacular. In Manchester, I only had a handful of options to eat well. In Italy, instead, the culinary culture is extraordinary. We must be careful not to gain any weight! In <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the game is much more intense, there’s no comparison. In Italy, instead, it’s much more tactical and positional. It forces you to think more.<br /><br /><a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> has modern ideas, he likes to keep a high defensive line and he wants us to keep the ball. In this regard, it wasn’t a big change for me and I feel perfectly at ease. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> and <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> are very similar in many ways, especially in their meticulous approach to tactics and movement. They thoroughly study opponents and the moves needed to predict every single situation.<br /><br />It was all extremely mechanical at City, working on every step and every inch. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>, on the other hand, is a bit more elastic, giving more freedom to individual initiative. In any case, their models are the same and it takes time to get used to. It took two years with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>. I think this <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, despite not being with them for long, are doing well and are on right track</p>

  <p><b>[Danilo says <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> team-mate <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> has joked with him that Brazil would have five more World Cup wins to their name had he hailed from the South American nation]</b> I have known Cris since <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and now it’s very nice reuniting with him at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. He has an eye for detail and that, along with his natural quality, makes it impossible that he wouldn’t be reaping the results that he has been. If he played for Brazil, we would have five more World Cups by now, he jokes<br /><br /><b>[He has no regrets at having opted to secure a switch to the Spanish capital, with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> having been spurned in favour of their Clasico rivals]</b> I must confess, at some point I had to stop and think about it. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> has shown a lot of interest, so I called my dad and asked him, ‘Pop, if it was you, where would you go?’. And he answered, ‘If it was me, I’d go to Madrid. They look like a more serious club <b>[to work for]</b>’. And, taking his life perspective into consideration, I thought, ‘Well, this helps a lot. It’s decided, then’. Then we settled that I was going there. And it was very nice, it was a very pleasant experience</p>
