  <p><b>[Danilo: How did Real Madrid manage to convince Juventus to buy €32m flop?]</b> The media pressure is the largest in the world, without doubt. An error, no matter how small, goes viral. A mistake becomes very great even if it is very small. And, of course, when you do something good, it is also very great.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have confirmed the signing of Danilo from Real Madrid in a £26.5 million deal]</b> I am very, very happy to be joining Manchester City. There has been strong interest from other clubs, but it has always been my ambition to play for Pep Guardiola. As soon as I heard of his interest, I knew immediately I wanted to be a City player. I can’t wait to get started and I’m looking forward to getting to know my new team-mates over the coming weeks.</p>

  <p><b>[Danilo says it was a straightforward decision to snub Chelsea and join Manchester City after speaking to Pep Guardiola]</b> It happened very fast, I was training with Real Madrid, Pep called me and I was very motivated to make this change and start to work with him. <b>[Zidane tried to convince me to stay]</b> but I was sure I needed to change. I needed to think a bit more about myself and find a place where I had more options. It wasn’t a difficult decision to choose City over Chelsea. The moment City called me and Pep called me, I knew what I had to do.<br /><br /><b>[Danilo was part of the Real Madrid squad which won back-to-back Champions League titles]</b> I have no doubt we can win the Champions League, that’s why I chose this team. In all the teams I played for in my life, the objectives have always been the same. I’m going to try my best to adapt as soon as possible. I see the potential in this side and I am going to do my best</p>

  <p><b>[Danilo revealed the reigning Premier League champions have taken confidence from Liverpool’s recent draw with West Ham]</b> It was good for us and everyone in the dressing room knows that. But if we don’t do our job it will not be enough. So, we are a bit happy but knowing we have to do a bigger job. You have to play your game and play for another result. Sometimes you play before or after <b>[your title opponents]</b> and you have to try and put in the same performance every game. If you stay calm and keep focused then you can win the title.<br /><br />It was a disaster for us dropping points at Newcastle but the season is long. There’s lots of games to play. Liverpool are doing well but if you keep going and win games then you can come back</p>

  <p><b>[Why Man City defender Danilo is dreaming of facing Porto in Champions League final]</b> I hope so, it would be very special. I play for City, I am very grateful to be in the Premier League and to work with this technical team. We are in a fantastic moment, fighting for everything. I would like to have another Champions <b>[League winners medal]</b>, but it would be special.<br /><br />I talk a lot with Gabriel Jesus and Ederson, who play for me at Manchester City, and they do not understand how I like Porto so much. I told them: you’ll be there and you’ll see. The cleaning staff, the security guards treat us with a lot of affection, as if we were a family member. That’s why Brazilians feel so good here. When I went to Manchester City I thanked him for continuing to wear blue. I identify myself, I hope the two can succeed and meet in the final<br /><br /><b>[Danilo thinks they can beat City’s Premier League title race rivals]</b> Liverpool have a very strong team, they are doing an incredible season, they have a trio in the attack that works very well, but Porto is Porto, it is able to surprise, to find strength where it does not exist and has a lot of quality</p>

I said to him that I wanted to take the number seven jersey, but it was already taken. He spoke very highly of <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and to play with him will be an extra motivation. I found a very motivated and happy <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. He spoke about the club like a family and this was reassuring to me. It was great to hear such things<br /><br /><b>[Danilo made the switch to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> at a time of transition for the Italian champions, who brought in ex-Chelsea and <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> boss <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> as <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Massimiliano Allegri</a>’s successor]</b> <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> has a very particular style. He likes to command play. <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are two different teams who are difficult to face. I like his style of play very much and I am ready to learn and evolve every day. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> has asked me to be very attentive in the defensive phase of the game, and that I am free to express my potential. I don’t think I’ll have difficulty adapting to what he is asking for. I know that defending is very important in Italy, but I am 28 years old and open to learning anything that I need to become a better player<br /><br />Every moment is important to help forge you as a player. Although I didn’t play the way I wanted to, these years were fundamental and will help me have the right mentality here at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. The first impressions have been good. I have been welcomed warmly and I feel great being here these first few days. There were already discussions with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in the past, but I believe that this is the right moment to be here</p>

  <p><b>[Danilo sees <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> boss cut from same cloth as <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> chief]</b> <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> is very different to Manchester. The fans are much more passionate, they stop you in the street. I like it, they come across more affectionate and motivated. I’m gradually getting to know the city and I feel good. I’ve already realised that the cuisine here is spectacular. In Manchester, I only had a handful of options to eat well. In Italy, instead, the culinary culture is extraordinary. We must be careful not to gain any weight! In <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the game is much more intense, there’s no comparison. In Italy, instead, it’s much more tactical and positional. It forces you to think more.<br /><br /><a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> has modern ideas, he likes to keep a high defensive line and he wants us to keep the ball. In this regard, it wasn’t a big change for me and I feel perfectly at ease. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> and <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> are very similar in many ways, especially in their meticulous approach to tactics and movement. They thoroughly study opponents and the moves needed to predict every single situation.<br /><br />It was all extremely mechanical at City, working on every step and every inch. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>, on the other hand, is a bit more elastic, giving more freedom to individual initiative. In any case, their models are the same and it takes time to get used to. It took two years with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>. I think this <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, despite not being with them for long, are doing well and are on right track</p>
