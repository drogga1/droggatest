  <p><b>[On Harper Beckham]</b> <b>[Harper]</b> said to me the other day: ‘Mummy, I think I want to play football’ - dagger through the heart. I have three boys who want to play football, come on, let one of them want to be in fashion!</p>

  <p><b>[David Beckham pursued Victoria Adams after meeting the Spice Girls singer at a charity football game in London in 1997]</b> I didn’t really know who he was. I was never into football. He was always with his mom, dad and sister while a lot of the footballers were at the bar getting drunk. I could sense right from the start that David was a gentleman, and very family-oriented, which is important because I’m the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[David and Victoria Beckham’s first child was born four months before their wedding in 1999, Brooklyn Joseph Beckham, who reportedly was named after the place where he was conceived]</b> It was when we were in Marbella that we came up with the name Brooklyn. We already knew he was a boy and so I knew he could end up a footballer, so it had to be a name that was a bit blokey. I had always liked the name Brooke and then we suddenly thought about Brooklyn.</p>
