  <p><b>[Former Japan coach <a href="takeshi-okada.html">Takeshi Okada</a> wanted by clubs at home and in China]</b> <a href="takeshi-okada.html">Okada</a> is an experienced coach; he led Japan to two World Cup appearances. We know some clubs are trying to find a new foreign coach for next season, so we recommend <a href="takeshi-okada.html">Takeshi Okada</a> to you. He is also recommended by the <b>[Japanese Football Association]</b>. If <a href="takeshi-okada.html">Okada</a> coached a Chinese club, it would help the Chinese <b>[Super League]</b> reach Japan. It would also help us in gaining interest from Japanese companies</p>

  <p><b>[A Chinese Super League club were prevented from breaking the world transfer record by new rules prohibiting an influx of foreign players]</b> A string of big-money transfers in recent months have struck a nerve with high-ranking leaders who took charge of Chinese football. They took particular exception to those deals completed at the beginning of the year.<br /><br />The Chinese football association <b>[CFA]</b> was told to come up with new regulations to curtail the irrational investment on foreign players. To make matters worse, the Chinese national team had suffered a miserable run of results in the World Cup qualifiers, which prompted those high-ranking leaders to conclude that money is not being well-spent<br /><br />As a matter of fact, a CSL club was about to complete the signing of a foreign player for a stunning transfer fee of €120m, if it were not for the new restrictions. The CFA were warned that the football market would be utterly ruined if the shopping spree goes on. And it’s worthing mentioning that even some state-owned enterprises are burning money without any restraints, which sets a really bad example. For all the negatives though, new regulations are the only and the most effective treatment to cure the illness of abnormal investment</p>
