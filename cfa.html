  <p><b>[A Chinese Super League club were prevented from breaking the world transfer record by new rules prohibiting an influx of foreign players]</b> A string of big-money transfers in recent months have struck a nerve with high-ranking leaders who took charge of Chinese football. They took particular exception to those deals completed at the beginning of the year.<br /><br />The Chinese football association <b>[CFA]</b> was told to come up with new regulations to curtail the irrational investment on foreign players. To make matters worse, the Chinese national team had suffered a miserable run of results in the World Cup qualifiers, which prompted those high-ranking leaders to conclude that money is not being well-spent<br /><br />As a matter of fact, a CSL club was about to complete the signing of a foreign player for a stunning transfer fee of €120m, if it were not for the new restrictions. The CFA were warned that the football market would be utterly ruined if the shopping spree goes on. And it’s worthing mentioning that even some state-owned enterprises are burning money without any restraints, which sets a really bad example. For all the negatives though, new regulations are the only and the most effective treatment to cure the illness of abnormal investment</p>

It is understandable that that both parties are eager to win, and it’s quite normal to have disputes. However, to the best of our knowledge, the incident is not as serious as people think. Shanghai SIPG had delivered all the evidence relevant to the case to Guizhou Zhicheng, who will decide if they will take further action. Basically, an agreement has been reached between the two parties.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea attacker Oscar has been banned by the Chinese Football Association for inciting a brawl]</b> Oscar’s immoral foul, which sparked a massive bust-up on the pitch, has had a huge negative impact on China’s professional football leagues. The CFA alway attaches great importance to the issue of discipline, taking great pains to root out the violent fouls and other unsportsmanlike behaviour. Hopefully disciplinary offences would be severely punished by all clubs and efforts shall be made to maintain the order of the games and protect the development of football.</p>

  <p><b>[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Diego Costa were just two of the star names heavily linked with moves to the Chinese Super League recently]</b> In the summer transfer window 2017, clubs that spend less than 45m yuan <b>[€5.8m]</b> on foreign players or 20m yuan on domestic signings leverage fee will not be subjected to a player-transfer leverage fee. However, those clubs need to pay an equivalent amount of their spending into a special account, which will be opened to develop their own youth academy. A plan will be submitted to the CFA to ensure that the funds are used exclusively for its designated purpose.<br /><br />Clubs that spend 45m yuan or more on foreign players or 20m yuan on domestic signings will have to pay an equivalent amount into the ‘Chinese Football Development Fund’, which is established to support the development of young players, the promotion of grassroots football and charitable infrastructures, and the nation’s strategy on revitalization of football. If clubs sign players on loan from foreign clubs, and the loan fee is less than the transfer fee paid initially by the parent club, they will also be required to pay the leverage fee based on the earlier transfer fee</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea ‘persona non grata’ in China over Kenedy’s offensive posts]</b> On July 22nd, Chelsea Football Club experienced the warmth and friendliness of Chinese fans at the National Stadium. However, we were surprised and disappointed that one day prior to the match, one of our young players, Kenedy, posted messages on his social media account that caused great offence and hurt the feelings of the people of China.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even though he quickly deleted the messages and apologised, and the club also apologised via our Chinese social media channels, the damage had already been done. Chelsea Football Club once again solemnly and sincerely apologises<br /><br />Kenedy’s actions were a mistake that he will learn greatly from. His behaviour does not represent the entire team and does not align with the club’s high expectations and strict requirements of its young players. He has been strongly reprimanded and disciplined<br /><br />Everyone at Chelsea Football Club has the utmost respect and admiration for China and loves our Chinese fans. It is because of this that the negative impact we have seen over the last two days has left us shocked and saddened. Once again, we sincerely apologise for the hurt caused to our Chinese fans as well as to the Chinese people<br /><br />The match was a great cultural exchange event between China and Britain and the club is extremely grateful to China for its hospitality, which has brought us closer together in friendship. We very much hope to build on our strong relationship with our Chinese fans and friends, joining hands firmly with China in future for further cooperation<br /><br />We offer this apology with utmost sincerity. We have listened carefully to the criticism and will use the lessons learnt over the last two days to improve our processes in future</p>
