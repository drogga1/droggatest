  <p><b>[Former Japan coach <a href="takeshi-okada.html">Takeshi Okada</a> wanted by clubs at home and in China]</b> <a href="takeshi-okada.html">Okada</a> is an experienced coach; he led Japan to two World Cup appearances. We know some clubs are trying to find a new foreign coach for next season, so we recommend <a href="takeshi-okada.html">Takeshi Okada</a> to you. He is also recommended by the <b>[Japanese Football Association]</b>. If <a href="takeshi-okada.html">Okada</a> coached a Chinese club, it would help the Chinese <b>[Super League]</b> reach Japan.
