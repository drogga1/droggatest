  <p><b>[Wesley Sneijder has been accused of urinating on a couple’s car following reports the former Ajax and Real Madrid was arrested last week]</b> Half the neighbourhood was shocked by loud noises. My husband and I also looked out of our window to see what happened. We saw someone on a car, a man, I didn’t recognise him. A lot of police arrived and they even brought a dog. It was not an easy arrest and also not friendly. The car is 10 years old, but for us it is very valuable.<br /><br /><b>[A few days later, reports emerged that Sneijder was allegedly the man arrested for the incident]</b> Whether you are a footballer or not, you can’t damage someone else’s stuff. He also p*ssed on it. We only knew him from football. We then heard that both he and his management denied that he had done this. That makes us angry now. It’s okay to be drunk, but you shouldn’t bother others with that. You keep away from stuff owned by someone else. Couldn’t he have just apologised and bought some flowers? It is annoying, but in the more than 50 years that we have lived here I have never experienced anything like this. I hope he learns from it</p>

First of all, yes we are not together anymore for a while now. No we are still not divorced yet. I made a lot of mistakes in our marriage. But that’s nobody’s business. That Yolanthe is still so good to me I respect so much. She takes care of our son every day AND ME even though we are not together<br /><br />Second of all she doesn’t need anything from my part because she has her own. The Turkish press wrote she wanted 19 million and I gave her 15?! Haha you guys are getting crazier every time. If people would only know how the reality is. People without brains will always believe what they read. Just so you all know: Yolanthe didn’t ask me for anything and I will not ask her for anything. We don’t need each other’s money.
