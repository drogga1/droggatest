  <p>[Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard would be a big gamble, if he is appointed Rangers manager] Yes, Gerrard is an Under-18s coach, a phenomenally talented player for club and country, and won the Champions League and UEFA Cup. But, in management terms, he is very inexperienced. It is a big gamble.</p>

  <p>[Steven Gerrard has been backed to handle the challenge of ending Celtic’s title dominance if he takes the Rangers job] There is no doubt that the first time he walks into that group, I can guarantee you that he will have respect from the players. Every manager or coach has to start somewhere in the game and you are just looking for that club to take a chance on you and have that bit of faith in you.</p>

  <p>[Rangers manager Steven Gerrard has been backed to win trophies in the future] I wouldn’t be too worried. You’ve got to give him the time. He’s had two transfer windows and it’s hard when you’re in that position to get players out as hard as it is to get players in. I would imagine come the summer there’ll be more activity as long as the board back him and the team will look stronger. The recruitment has been pretty good so far but it’s a massive transfer window for him and his staff come this summer<br /><br />If they can keep hold of Alfredo Morelos then that would make a massive statement to the fans as well. I think the future looks good, although there’ll be a lot of Rangers fans hurting at the moment<br /><br />They’ve got to be looking at Celtic and closing that gap. They’ve still got to play them twice, there’s nine games left so there is a lot of points up for grabs and they just need to get back to winning games. They’ve got to be looking to mount a challenge this season but they can’t afford to let the season fizzle out. Some fans will already be unhappy with the expectation levels at the club so it’s up to the players to give the fans and the manager a little bit of something back</p>
