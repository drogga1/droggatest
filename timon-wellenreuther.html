<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former Schalke goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther says Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in the world]</b> Playing against Cristiano Ronaldo was something very special. For me, he is the best player in the world. His runs and his power are incredible. Also in the games against me, you have unfortunately seen that he is freezing cold and always on the spot. Although I saved some balls off of him, in the end he scored twice<br /><br /><b>[The 23-year-old is now playing in the Eredivisie with Willem II]</b> Once you’ve played Champions League, you’ll want to go there again someday. The Champions League is like a drug. So I hope that I can continue my hard work and that in the next few years there will be some more international games<br /><br /><b>[Wellenreuther acknowledges he’d love to return and play in the Bundesliga in the future]</b> I am German and have always dreamed of playing in the Bundesliga. Nothing has changed to this day. It is one of the best leagues in the world<br /><br /><b>[Wellenreuther is open to the idea of playing all across Europe]</b> Especially the Premier League has a tremendous appeal. I do not know a player who cannot imagine playing there someday. After gaining experience in La Liga 2, I also know how strong and attractive La Liga is. Ultimately, it depends on whether you feel comfortable in the whole club, you believe that you can achieve something together. That is definitely the case in the Netherlands at the moment</p>
