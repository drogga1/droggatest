  <p><b>[Denmark national team coach Age Hareide on <a href="kasper-dolberg.html">Kasper Dolberg</a>]</b> He’s very relaxed. I think it takes a lot to impress him. Jon Dahl Tommasson, my assistant, says even if you put a naked woman in front of him he will not respond. He’s so focused<br /><br /><b>[Hareide described <a href="kasper-dolberg.html">Dolberg</a> as]</b> a rare specialist who needs little opportunities to score, and shows signs of a classic scorer</p>

  <p><b>[Age Hareide speaks after securing World Cup qualification with a 5-1 win in Dublin thanks to a <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> hat-trick]</b> I was surprised, Ireland gave a lot of space in the centre of midfield for <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a>. Thank you very much for giving him space. He is always fantastic on the ball, works hard for the team, an inspiration for all the lads around him. That’s the difference between the sides. He’s in the top ten players in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Age Hareide talks about star midfielder <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>]</b> I think he is a type that can adapt to anything. Give him a ball, then the ball will speak for him wherever he is. Christian is a type that just gets better from dealing with better football players. When looking at the players that play centrally for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, ​​none of them are better than Christian. <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a> came from <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, and he was not as good as Christian</p>
