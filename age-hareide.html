  <p><b>[Denmark national team coach Age Hareide on <a href="kasper-dolberg.html">Kasper Dolberg</a>]</b> He’s very relaxed. I think it takes a lot to impress him. Jon Dahl Tommasson, my assistant, says even if you put a naked woman in front of him he will not respond. He’s so focused<br /><br /><b>[Hareide described <a href="kasper-dolberg.html">Dolberg</a> as]</b> a rare specialist who needs little opportunities to score, and shows signs of a classic scorer</p>

  <p><b>[Age Hareide speaks after securing World Cup qualification with a 5-1 win in Dublin thanks to a <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> hat-trick]</b> I was surprised, Ireland gave a lot of space in the centre of midfield for <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a>. Thank you very much for giving him space. He is always fantastic on the ball, works hard for the team, an inspiration for all the lads around him. That’s the difference between the sides. He’s in the top ten players in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen is better than Luka Modric]</b> I think he is a type that can adapt to anything. Give him a ball, then the ball will speak for him wherever he is. Christian is a type that just gets better from dealing with better football players. When looking at the players that play centrally for Real Madrid and Barcelona, ​​none of them are better than Christian. Luka Modric came from Tottenham to Real Madrid, and he was not as good as Christian.</p>

  <p><b>[Kasper Schmeichel is being heavily linked with Chelsea]</b> He is in the top three. He was perhaps the best goalkeeper at the World Cup. He has also shown earlier, especially in that season when Leicester won the Premier League, that he is at the top. So, I want to say that Kasper is in the top three. Kasper’s attitude is getting better every single time. That’s why he gets better and better. I think he could be even better. He has also gained a lot of experience gradually and he always works hard.</p>

  <p><b>[Republic of Ireland vs Denmark]</b> <b>[Eriksen]</b>’s a good player, an important player for us, but we haven’t focused on him not being there but on the players who are here. We may have to play a different way without him but we have shown we have a lot of good players in Denmark. We don’t want being without Christian to be an excuse after the game. We need to show ourselves and do our best.<br /><br />It’s a lot better than playing friendly matches and it gives you a chance to play against the top teams the next time if you get promoted - that’s very interesting. It’s usually very hard to get games against teams like France, Spain and Germany, teams who attract huge crowds</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham attacking midfielder Christian Eriksen will start for Denmark]</b> Christian will play from the start tomorrow. The intention is that he’s going to play. In this case, we have to sort of nurse him as much as possible. That means he probably won’t be staying on for 90 minutes.<br /><br />The group is finished <b>[and]</b> we’re top of the group. Now it’s a game to play to get better. We have to use every international game we can to get better and to look at our squad and see how everybody performs</p>
