  <p><b>[Former Ghana international Prince Opoku Polley has waded into the Black Stars’ 1992 Africa Cup of Nations captaincy saga, saying defender Anthony Baffoe should have rejected the armband for the final clash with Cote d’Ivoire]</b> To be honest, I was not expecting to be named Black Stars captain. I remember we had a team meeting and <b>[head coach]</b> Otto Pfister announced that Anthony Baffoe was going to captain the team. This is how it got to me. This is something very interesting I am going to tell you now. People thought Abedi, maybe because we were roommates <b>[influenced the decision]</b>. He <b>[Abedi]</b> never ever mentioned anything about captaincy to me. I can assure you. To set the records straight, I saw an interview from <a href="anthony-yeboah.html">Anthony Yeboah</a> when he said that his manager called me to speak to <b>[Ghana’s]</b> management that I should hand the captaincy to him. Nobody called me. This is not true. This is exactly what I can tell you. I remember Alhaji Maikano, the team manager, came to me and said there were rumours going on and I said whoever wanted to take the captaincy should come and take it. I’m not keen on the captaincy</p>
