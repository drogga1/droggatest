  <p><b>[<a href="psg.html">PSG</a> right-back Gregory van der Wiel has also lauded Ibrahimovic’s influence, saying his team can always rely on the former <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> man to deliver]</b> He always scores for us. It doesn’t bother him that everyone is expecting him to score. <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> is world class. As a team-mate and a football fan, I enjoy what he does every time. It’s really nice to have a striker like him in your team. But we’re getting used to his exciting goals!</p>

  <p><b>[Fenerbahce defender Gregory van der Wiel has been revealed as the target of a business scam, in which the Netherlands international was swindled out of $4.5 million]</b> One month after I arrived in Turkey, I met Ümit Akbulut, a businessman. He offered me a business offer. I trusted him. He wanted to earn money for us in four months. I then asked him what happened to our companies. He said: ‘Give me $600,000 and forget the money. Because this is Turkey and you can’t start anything’. He scammed me! This has affected my football career and my personal life.</p>

  <p><b>[Ümit Akbulut denies all wrongdoing and claims Gregory van der did not stick to his part of the deal, and therefore did not see a return on his initial investment]</b> When Gregory first came to Turkey, he had some trouble with the club. I recommended him to do some charity work, like visiting sick children or posting something related to Turkey via his social media accounts. He asked me to promote his brand and I arranged a meeting between him and Floyd Mayweather’s manager. They reached an agreement for about $4.2 million. He was supposed to go to three different countries for the promotion and Floyd shot a special video for him also. We haven’t shown it yet.<br /><br />Then there were some trouble between Turkey and Netherlands, so we decided to postpone that tour. That’s when Gregory started to ask his money back. I said ‘We can change the date but we can’t give you your money back because this is how the showbiz is!’. So these claims are completely false</p>

  <p><b>[New Toronto FC defender Gregory van der Wiel has hailed the professionalism and mentality of Major League Soccer]</b> I always wanted to play in MLS. I’ve been many times to this side of the ocean and what I’ve picked up is that the mentality, how the people live with their sport, the professionalism, here is way different from Europe. I think on this side it’s 10 years ahead.<br /><br />I’m tired <b>[of being]</b> judged by the way I look, the way I live my private life, the pictures I post on Instagram. I’ve always been a person who works hard, always had the mentality to be a top player. The last two years I got judged and sidelined by things other than my football qualities. I wanted to be in an environment where it was different. I’m already feeling, my first week, that it is a totally different world: you get treated well, everything is well arranged … this is everything I hoped for. I need to get my pleasure back. That will come; I have no doubt<br /><br />I met somebody there, influential, and I wanted to invest some money, like I’m still doing to this day. I like to do things on the side of football to be smart about my money, but it was not a smart move. I trusted somebody and in the end, I never saw my money back</p>
