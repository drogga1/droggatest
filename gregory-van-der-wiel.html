  <p><b>[<a href="psg.html">PSG</a> right-back Gregory van der Wiel has also lauded Ibrahimovic’s influence, saying his team can always rely on the former <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> man to deliver]</b> He always scores for us. It doesn’t bother him that everyone is expecting him to score. <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> is world class. As a team-mate and a football fan, I enjoy what he does every time. It’s really nice to have a striker like him in your team. But we’re getting used to his exciting goals!</p>

  <p><b>[New Toronto FC defender Gregory van der Wiel has hailed the professionalism and mentality of Major League Soccer]</b> I always wanted to play in MLS. I’ve been many times to this side of the ocean and what I’ve picked up is that the mentality, how the people live with their sport, the professionalism, here is way different from Europe. I think on this side it’s 10 years ahead.<br /><br />I’m tired <b>[of being]</b> judged by the way I look, the way I live my private life, the pictures I post on Instagram. I’ve always been a person who works hard, always had the mentality to be a top player. The last two years I got judged and sidelined by things other than my football qualities. I wanted to be in an environment where it was different. I’m already feeling, my first week, that it is a totally different world: you get treated well, everything is well arranged … this is everything I hoped for. I need to get my pleasure back. That will come; I have no doubt<br /><br />I met somebody there, influential, and I wanted to invest some money, like I’m still doing to this day. I like to do things on the side of football to be smart about my money, but it was not a smart move. I trusted somebody and in the end, I never saw my money back</p>
