  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois was impressed with how Chelsea handled the absence of Diego Costa]</b> Yes of course. We have the quality to replace Diego. He is important for us, but if he is not there for one game, we know that we can handle it. There is obviously a different way of playing because against Huth and Morgan there is no point in giving long balls to Eden, Willian and Pedro. But I think we did well and the early goal helped us to control the game and early moments. Him <b>[Alonso]</b> and Victor had a lot of time in the box at the second post. It is good that they feel the moment to go and score goals. It is very good for us.<br /><br />Just to see that we won 3-0, it shows that we don’t stop and the loss didn’t effect us. Everybody hoped we’d drop points, so that was very good. The most important thing is we go to Anfield with the biggest gap possible. Today was a game that, if I was sitting at home <b>[like our rivals]</b>, I’d be thinking they’re playing Leicester away and could drop points. For us to win here was a big boost and now we want to do the same against Hull so we have the gap at Anfield and there everything can happen. Hopefully we can win another 13 times in a row, but we will see. We have to go game by game and that’s best for us. Obviously if you’re at the top, you have the pressure of wanting to keep that gap. Thankfully for us we are there, we are seven point clear. The pressure is more on the other teams than us, but obviously we have to keep winning our games. Obviously we are in a good moment, things are going well. Last year we were having a rough time and it was harder to get things in our favour. So we will try to keep the momentum and just win our games</p>

  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois says that Chelsea is a happy place to be despite news of a clash between Diego Costa and manager Antonio Conte]</b> Yes. We are very happy, everyone is happy at Chelsea at the moment. If you are in first place with a seven point lead, it helps. It helps that you are winning, it helps in the way you’re working and helps everybody accept the way of working. The mood is very good, everyone trains very hard during the week. When we win like Saturday, we get a free day on the Sunday and it is obviously a nice feeling. Diego didn’t train since Tuesday and the manager had a plan in his head. We trained very well and we knew what to do. We played the same against Bournemouth as well. I don’t think it <b>[Diego’s absence]</b> is something that will effect us, but I think we did well again, with the guys up front. That’s good for us.</p>

  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois has sought to bring an end to the rumours suggesting he could be lured away from Chelsea]</b> I have never felt so good since I arrived in Chelsea. On the field, I am good, I make the decisive stops when it is necessary. Sometimes I have just one or two to do. Against Hull, it was a little more at the weekend. But otherwise, I try to always be ready to help the team. My game has also improved a lot in the last two seasons. I sometimes have a few moments that are very difficult to manage but I’m doing well. I feel very confident right now. I like that we are asked to attack the ball and go forwards in any circumstances. There’s a good atmosphere in the group. Lots of jokes and banter but we work hard and we enjoy it.<br /><br />Some players are more concentrated on what they will do after their football career and want to make sure their lives are financially settled. I prefer to play in big teams earn a little less money and win trophies</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois admits to feeling sorry for Manchester City counterpart Claudio Bravo]</b> I feel sorry for Bravo, because he’s been a very good goalkeeper for Barcelona and Chile, but he’s under pressure a lot and is lacking confidence. You get to a point where you feel every shot will be a goal. Last season when I was conceding lots of goals it started eating me up. It’s good to have a goalkeeper that’s good with his feet, but it’s more important that he’s good with his hands and makes saves. We play from the back as well, but when I see there’s pressure I will play a long ball to <b>[Marcos]</b> Alonso, <b>[Victor]</b> Moses or Diego <b>[Costa]</b>. City will always try to play, even when they’re under pressure, which is very risky.<br /><br />I’m playing as an outfield player too now, which is great. At Atletico Madrid my job was just to hit long balls forward, but here we play out from the back more so it’s important to practise my ball skills. It started last year when I was injured. I couldn’t dive properly during my rehab so did a lot of work on my feet as well. And when I was suspended after the red card at Man City I joined in with the team and worked a lot on ball possession in midfield, which was really good. I’m often the spare man switching sides - the neutral guy - so have to be quick and alert. My skills have improved a lot. I play in midfield, left back, as a striker. I’ve scored a lot of goals in training, but not in a match yet!</p>

  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois admits he is striving for perfection at Chelsea]</b> I want to improve myself to reach a higher level. I think I am on a very good level, but I know that I can improve myself. I think in everything you can improve. Everything you can improve every day and search for perfection and that is what I will try to do. When I was in Belgium, I played a lot of balls short. At Atletico Madrid, the trainer preferred only long balls, so you forget to play short a little. So maybe that might be the biggest point of improvement.<br /><br />It is good if you have a manager who is demanding a lot. You have to be at your top every week, and that is what makes you champions. If you have a manager who is not demanding then sometimes you relax and you lose games</p>

  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois believes that Jose Mourinho employed both mind-games and dirty tactics against Chelsea on Monday at Stamford Bridge as Manchester United were knocked out of the FA Cup 1-0]</b> They made a lot of fouls and they were very hard. This was in the style of Mourinho but I think that Ander Herrera paid the price for his team-mates because I think Phil Jones made a fifth foul on Eden Hazard and then Herrera made another foul on him seconds later. Then the referee must give a yellow card and, unfortunately for Herrera, he already had one. United tried to get into our minds, with the fouling and kicking to try to destabilise us. They are the mind-games that they tried to play - they get that from their manager.<br /><br />We didn’t fall into their trap, we played our game and did it our way - as we have been doing for six months or so. We did it well. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find another goal and finish it earlier, but I think it is good to go to Wembley and the mission is to go to the final and win it<br /><br />We didn’t know beforehand about United’s aggression. You can expect Manchester to play one of two ways. They can play their footballing way but, obviously, without Anthony Martial and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, then they can play a different game. That’s what they did and I think they tried to defend well. In the beginning, we could see how they were playing and we have players with football intelligence who can handle that. I think the last time we played them, they didn’t expect us to be so good. When we played it was the beginning of playing 3-4-3 and obviously they came with a plan to put Matteo Darmian and Phil Jones on Willian and Eden. So it was hard to find the space, but after that we did<br /><br />I feel good, I am having a very good season. I don’t even think I had one save in the beginning. I just passed from the back and got ready for that one moment. It was a crucial save. When we were attacking so much, you always have to take care because he’s fast. The others have to take care because you can make a mistake and when he was one-versus-one with Cahill, you can think that there’s a big possibility that he can pass him and shoot. So I was just ready to see whether he went left or right. He went on his left and I was in a good position. I was good on my feet and could make a good save. I think my position was very good, which made it hard for him to score.<br /><br />I think both teams will find the semi-final tough. We beat them at home and they beat us away. I think they are a top side as well. It is nice for the English league to see four top teams in the semi-finals. I don’t think it is often that happens in the previous years so it is a big game for us</p>

I do not think many people with a torn ligament already play after a week and a half.<br /><br /><b>[The Belgium international added on his showing against Spurs]</b> When I had to kick the ball against Spurs, there was a bit <b>[of pain]</b>. Obviously I had to stand on my right foot which was not easy at times. But when you play with adrenaline, you feel good and you forget. I will get more treatment like I have for the last week - where I was with the physios from 10am in the morning till 5pm in the evening at Cobham. Tuesday won’t be a problem. I’m getting better every day, so hopefully soon I will be able to play without a strap <b>[on the ankle]</b><br /><br />I did not want to ask for a substitution after five minutes, so I pulled out. I watched the first half in the directors’ box but I had to go to the team coach to have a lie down on my own. I fell asleep <b>[and missed the second half]</b> as I was feeling so bad. I took a couple of days off and did not eat a lot. But I felt good against Spurs.

  <p><b>[Courtois hoping Chelsea avoid Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez]</b> Alexis is a guy with a lot of quality. If you see all the games from last season there is a lot of danger coming from him. He has a very strong shot, he is quick. He has the technique. He is important for them but Arsenal have a lot of players with quality. So they will miss him but I think they have a lot of players with that quality to replace him. I think they have bought a good new striker <b>[in Alexandre Lacazette]</b>.<br /><br />I’d prefer if he <b>[Sanchez]</b> doesn’t play because he is a good player! But we cannot only look to him. For example in the FA Cup Final <b>[Arsenal beat Chelsea 2-1 in May]</b> they missed some defenders and everybody thought they would be bad. But Per Mertesacker played a great game that day. So you cannot look to the team as one player or another player. It will be a difficult game regardless but I hope for the same outcome as the friendly last week.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea goalkeeper Courtois mocks Tottenham fans for Wembley atmosphere]</b> It feels a bit different because obviously their home ground is not this one. They have the capacity now to bring a lot of fans into the stadium. If they make more noise it would be better for them but in the first half, if you have to put some noise over the speakers to make some atmosphere, I don’t think it is working very well. In the second half they were pressing and 70,000 people started to wake up and there is obviously more than the 40,000 at White Hart Lane. The only difference is that they are more separate from the pitch than at White Hart Lane, when you feel more pressure when they are pressing and the pitch is smaller, that is probably better for them.<br /><br /><b>[Courtois believes Chelsea were boosted by the opportunity to play Wembley]</b> Wembley is an amazing stadium. These stadiums make you want to play even better, it is like a Champions League game where you can rise above yourself. I think those stadiums make that and all the teams that come here, instead of being impressed, they will give more so for Spurs it won’t be easy but if they have their fans, with 80-90,000 people they can make it difficult for a lot of teams</p>

But after all I think Chelsea did a good job and I think we have a good squad to face the season.<br /><br />He is ready, he is doing well and is ready to play. But we cannot forget he was injured for four months, he had surgery. You cannot expect - if he plays on Saturday, which is up to the manager - if he gets minutes you will see his quality but maybe he is not at his top form like he was last season and you cannot forget that. You have to go little by little I think. We are excited to have him back and I was happy to have him on the pitch with me against Gibraltar and Greece. I hope we can see the best Eden Hazard very soon</p>

It is good to face Arsenal now.<br /><br />Everybody is healthy, Eden <b>[Hazard]</b> is getting into his best form again. We are doing well. After the bad first half against Burnley, I think all our performances have been good. We have shown good spirit, good football and good wins most importantly of all.<br /><br />Obviously against Arsenal it will be a big game. They had a few bad matches, but won comfortably last weekend. Let’s see what they do in the Europa League, but they will probably rest some guys. For us and for them it’s a big game because we are third and obviously want to close the gap and take points off Arsenal as well.

Our midfield is very good, we have strong players.<br /><br />I don’t know if we miss him but obviously, if you see we have two injuries in the midfield then obviously you could say we missed Nemanja. He is a quality player who is doing well at Manchester United. That’s not my decision to make <b>[about selling him]</b>. Those are questions that you need to ask to the people who made that happen. I think that if a player nowadays wants to go to a team, the player has a strong will to join another team, it is hard and you cannot just ignore him and say you can’t leave. Then you have a disappointed player who maybe won’t play at his best. For us, you have given another player to another big teams. These are the choices made in football. He is a quality midfielder but hopefully we can show that we are better on Sunday<br /><br />This season we are conceding more chances than we did last year.<br /><br />We have to try to get that extra step in, that extra per cent to stop actions, not be 90 per cent. Maybe with a lot of games, sometimes you maybe go a bit less. Obviously it is different to last season. Injuries have been coming and not at a good time. We know how important N’Golo is for us, he is the guy that brings a lot of balance into the team. But we can’t push him to play if he doesn’t feel ready. Danny <b>[Drinkwater]</b> was also out for a long time as well. It means Tiemoue Bakayoko and Cesc Fabregas have played a lot of games in midfield and obviously that goes into their legs and it is harder for them to keep up the pressure, especially against the midfield three like Roma had last night</p>

  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois has more honours won with Atleti than he with Chelsea and his father Thierry admits that Madrid proved the making of his boy]</b> At Atletico, it was his first experience abroad and he became a ‘man’. He learned to live on his own and got a new language. He made new friends in a new culture and it made him an international person. For sure, he had a great time in Spain. He won lots of titles; La Liga, Europa League, Copa del Rey, Super Cup. He adopted the Spanish mentality: the way of living, going out late for dinner, living outside in the sun. He led a quieter existence.<br /><br />Thibaut would like to win the Champions League. With Atletico, he was very close to winning it before. And, with the Belgian Red Devils, his goal is to maybe one day win a World Cup or European Championship. They twice reached the quarter-final. Next year at the World Cup in Russia, the final or more <b>[is possible]</b> and obviously he would also like to be the best goalkeeper of the tournament.

We are a good team and we are going to try everything to get far in the Champions League.<br /><br />Atletico are a difficult team to play, and we could have scored more goals but <b>[Jan]</b> Oblak had a great game, they are also dangerous at set pieces and they scored the goal for us. It’s hard for them, it’s a team that has come a long way in this tournament in recent years, but if I’m honest, from my point of view as a Chelsea player, they can still reach the quarter-finals or semi-finals.

  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois is determined to remain at the top of his game until his late 30s]</b> Everyone knows how much and how hard we train. If I hope to continue goalkeeping until I am 36 or 37 then you have to think about how I train. For Buffon, I hear he trains less on the field and he is more focused on keeping his muscles strong. When I see how Mark Schwarzer, at 41, was able to train here then you see what is possible. Those are things I have picked up. There were maybe certain times where I maybe went a little lighter on certain things. Then you think: ‘No, I’ve got to do more.’ If I have a little injury problem or a hamstring niggle then I think I might need to do some more stretching or do some more preventive exercises. I think that’s very important in football and that was perhaps a habit that was underappreciated in our sport in the past.<br /><br />TV companies now expect more and more football. For example, last year we had a World Cup qualifying match on June 13. If UEFA is a bit smarter then they would put that game in March. That’s because we had a friendly match against Russia in late May or early June, we were then able to play a friendly match, and everyone had five weeks off. If we play the World Cup final, we will have only two or three weeks of rest. That means your body can not relax at all. If you look at the NBA, eight months 82 games. The guys who play the finals will play the final in June, but only begin again in October<br /><br />I have already won the League Cup. That’s a nice trophy but the FA Cup has more prestige. As a player, you always want to win prizes. I think I played a good season. Sometimes there were bad moments but overall I have had good matches. I feel good and I think I did well in the last match. I don’t think the final will define my season, but of course it is nicer to end the campaign on a high with a trophy. You always go to the finals with the feeling that it is 50-50. Last year against Arsenal, everyone thought we were the big favorite but a final is always different. The only advantage I have is that I’m used to playing this kind of games. Guys with less experience might have more nerves. But a final is always a final and it is always difficult. I’m always looking forward to playing<br /><br />Romelu has no secrets. Everybody knows him. He is strong, fast and has a good shot. I know his strengths and weaknesses, but in a match anything can happen. It is difficult to follow his movement. He is important for Manchester United so hopefully we can keep him out of the game<br /><br />If we don’t think we can win it, we should not go to a World Cup. If you are going to it then it is to go all the way, not to end up in the last 16 or the quarter-finals. That is our ambition. Everyone wants to go for it. It is also the time to do that. But you have plenty of countries that want the same thing</p>

They always go after him for the same things: golf, the language <b>[…]</b> I want to see him go out and give an interview in Spanish because he speaks very well in the dressing room with lots of teammates and he understands it very well. But it’s his thing if he prefers to speak English, it would only be to stop people saying these things <b>[about his Spanish]</b> and they can see that he’s very devoted</p>

We are two points behind <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, so it’s still possible we can be champions. So it’s unfortunate if the season is cancelled. For example, in France there were two teams that were relegated, they maybe could have saved themselves, they won’t like that. In Netherlands, no team will be crowned champions, no team is being promoted or relegated. It’s unfortunate for guys from the second tier who couldn’t go up. So if they decide this morning to stop the competition and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are named champions, I also wouldn’t find that completely right. The coach of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> wouldn’t find that logical. They drew against us once and lost once, so we showed them that we are the better team, but we’re still two points behind, so I don’t really agree with that. In England, I could understand if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> became champions. I can understand if they made them the champions. What do you do with those that are supposed to go up and down? I think the economy, the tv money plays a big role in that.

So, Wednesday test day to see if we are infected. Then, in theory, next week we can go individually, but that doesn’t mean training. That depends on what the club and the government decide. The only sure thing at this point is that we will be tested this week</p>

If we play the 11 remaining matches then I am confident that my team can win the league<br /><br />It was good to go back to training a little. But it was weird, different, but feeling the grass and training is better than nothing<br /><br />I think that Thibaut, everything that happened on the field of play, never affected him in a decisive way. He was aware that he wanted to improve his performances and somehow be at his natural level. I have watched it with great pride. To see Thibaut have to continue working and reach the level he has reached is because he is perfectly prepared to be in <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s goal. The easy thing would have been to throw in the towel or start blaming third parties when you’re in such a difficult situation. Thibaut did the opposite. He showed great maturity, great self-criticism, to the point of becoming essential at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. There are no goalkeepers like Thibaut in modern football. It has been a source of pride to see him grow so much on a human level and give the level he has given this season</p>

  <p><b>[Adrenaline junkie Courtois refreshed &amp; raring to go after <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> lockdown]</b> We’re dealing pretty well with it. It’s always nice to spend some time at home with your family, but you start getting a bit bored after a few weeks. You want to go back, to train and to play. <b>[I was training at home on]</b> the treadmill, weights, those sorts of things. Luckily I have a garden and I can also work out outside. On my first day of training, after two months, it felt like coming back after a week and I hadn’t lost anything. So that was good, and that’s why I feel prepared for what’s coming. Of course, there’s a protocol we have to follow. The first week more than anything was a bit weird. At least I was training with the goalkeeping coach but he couldn’t shoot or pass or anything. So that was a bit strange to start with but then we got used to it. The goalkeeping work I’ve been doing has been the same as I’ve been doing for the last 11 years as a professional so luckily that hasn’t really changed. We’re really looking forward to playing games in training, 11 against 11, everyone smiling, without these problems. But we’re going bit by bit.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I’ve rested for two months, which is almost impossible the rest of the time. There are never two months during the season where you aren’t exposed to that constant stress and adrenaline. Which is cool, too, because being a football player and playing in stadiums and playing those big games, the adrenaline and the pressure in your body is addictive and we like it. It pushes you to perform better. But having two months to rest a little bit and to work on your body in order to improve your physical condition has been of great help.</p>
