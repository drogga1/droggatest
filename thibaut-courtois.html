We struggled to get into the game at the start and then we didn’t have luck on our side. We hit the woodwork three times and then the goalkeeper also deserves credit. Athletic try to frustrate you and the referee followed their game. They are two points lost, but we have to keep going. We have ended 2019 well in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>.

With some you have better relationships and you talk more. He was a partner and there was always a try to help us both. The fact is that it no longer helped me.

  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois happy to have <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> back in <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> lineup]</b> Celta didn’t come forward often. Overall we have defended well and with a good organization. In the end we left a good Santi Mina unchecked &amp; he scored it. Little by little <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> will catch up again after three months out, he is a player who is worth a lot to us. We must try to work well. <b>[We are]</b> annoyed because it’s a draw and two dropped points are worth a lot here. It was a complicated game and we received a goal very early. The second half we started strong and we quickly scored both goals. Celta are technical and they have proven it</p>

  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois believes <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s decision to press <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> as they played out from the back paid off in El Clasico]</b> Against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> you can play in two ways: get into the area and defend or press and risk as they play out. We did the latter very well and winning a Clasico is always good. At 0-0 in the first half it was important not to concede any goals. When it was my turn I made good saves, like against Arthur and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. Then in the second half we were better and made the difference<br /><br />We are ahead but we can’t forget that there are 12 games left. Next we visit <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a> and if we want to win <a href="laliga.html">LaLiga</a> we have to win there too. After our last results, we have continued to work well. I think we played better in those games but we didn’t win. Football is about small details and this time we got the win with the help of our fans. That is key and they have been incredible</p>

  <p><b>[Thibaut Courtois says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> should not be crowned <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> champions should the season be cancelled because <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> proved they are the better team]</b> Of course I’d love to finish the season. We are two points behind <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, so it’s still possible we can be champions. So it’s unfortunate if the season is cancelled. For example, in France there were two teams that were relegated, they maybe could have saved themselves, they won’t like that. In Netherlands, no team will be crowned champions, no team is being promoted or relegated. It’s unfortunate for guys from the second tier who couldn’t go up. So if they decide this morning to stop the competition and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are named champions, I also wouldn’t find that completely right. The coach of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> wouldn’t find that logical. They drew against us once and lost once, so we showed them that we are the better team, but we’re still two points behind, so I don’t really agree with that. In England, I could understand if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> became champions. I can understand if they made them the champions. What do you do with those that are supposed to go up and down? I think the economy, the tv money plays a big role in that. It’s difficult.<br /><br /><b>[Courtois is not sure when he will be back on the training field, but expects to be called in for testing on Wednesday]</b> It looks like we’ll be tested on Wednesday - technically it’s not confirmed until they officially let me know that I can come. So, Wednesday test day to see if we are infected. Then, in theory, next week we can go individually, but that doesn’t mean training. That depends on what the club and the government decide. The only sure thing at this point is that we will be tested this week</p>

  <p><b>[Courtois denies saying <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> should win <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> title over Barcelona]</b> At no point did I say that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> had to be declared champions. If the league ends, we’re in a better position even if we lost to <b>[Real]</b> <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a>. If we play the 11 remaining matches then I am confident that my team can win the league<br /><br />It was good to go back to training a little. But it was weird, different, but feeling the grass and training is better than nothing<br /><br />I think that Thibaut, everything that happened on the field of play, never affected him in a decisive way. He was aware that he wanted to improve his performances and somehow be at his natural level. I have watched it with great pride. To see Thibaut have to continue working and reach the level he has reached is because he is perfectly prepared to be in <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s goal. The easy thing would have been to throw in the towel or start blaming third parties when you’re in such a difficult situation. Thibaut did the opposite. He showed great maturity, great self-criticism, to the point of becoming essential at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. There are no goalkeepers like Thibaut in modern football. It has been a source of pride to see him grow so much on a human level and give the level he has given this season</p>

  <p><b>[Courtois: <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> will keep fighting to win La Liga]</b> Everyone is looking forward to restarting <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and keeping fighting to win it. We couldn’t wait to be back at training after two months, being together as a team and despite it being a bit different, it is always nice to come back to Valdebebas to have training. Training at home is different, but I think everyone did well, everyone did what the coach has said and everyone keeps fit, everyone is pretty strong.<br /><br />Goalkeepers were lucky because we were allowed to do training with the keepers coach last week. This week, allowing small groups, team-mates can shoot at us, at least, and you feel it is a real session</p>

  <p><b>[Adrenaline junkie Courtois refreshed &amp; raring to go after <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> lockdown]</b> We’re dealing pretty well with it. It’s always nice to spend some time at home with your family, but you start getting a bit bored after a few weeks. You want to go back, to train and to play. <b>[I was training at home on]</b> the treadmill, weights, those sorts of things. Luckily I have a garden and I can also work out outside. On my first day of training, after two months, it felt like coming back after a week and I hadn’t lost anything. So that was good, and that’s why I feel prepared for what’s coming. Of course, there’s a protocol we have to follow. The first week more than anything was a bit weird. At least I was training with the goalkeeping coach but he couldn’t shoot or pass or anything. So that was a bit strange to start with but then we got used to it. The goalkeeping work I’ve been doing has been the same as I’ve been doing for the last 11 years as a professional so luckily that hasn’t really changed. We’re really looking forward to playing games in training, 11 against 11, everyone smiling, without these problems. But we’re going bit by bit.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I’ve rested for two months, which is almost impossible the rest of the time. There are never two months during the season where you aren’t exposed to that constant stress and adrenaline. Which is cool, too, because being a football player and playing in stadiums and playing those big games, the adrenaline and the pressure in your body is addictive and we like it. It pushes you to perform better. But having two months to rest a little bit and to work on your body in order to improve your physical condition has been of great help.</p>

I didn’t see anything and in the end if you don’t see the ball and it goes by so fast it won’t give you time to react. It is an offside position. It may be right or not, but it prevents seeing it. That is what the VAR is for and I think the decisions have been clear<br /><br /><b>[Courtois was happy to collect three points]</b> The key was to win. We know that it is always difficult to play here. It is a great team that fights to enter Europe</p>
