<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former Liverpool, Tottenham and England forward Paul Stewart has accused a youth coach of sexually assaulting him from age 11 to 15]</b> He told me Barry was doing it to kids on a team we played. I think I was 12 or 13, he was trying to infer it was normal. I have never met Andy Woodward, but I read <b>[his story]</b> at work and when I saw it, it was like reading my own life story. It brought a lot of issues up for me, and wanted people to know how difficult it was to come forward.<br /><br />One day, travelling in the car, he started to touch me. It frightened me to death, did not know what to do, I tried to tell my parents not to let him in but I was only 11. From then, it progressed to sexually abusing me, he said he would kill my mother, my father, my two brothers if I breathed a word about it. And at 11 years old, you believe that. The mental scars led me into other problems with drink and drugs. I know now it was a grooming process. The level of abuse got worse and worse</p>
