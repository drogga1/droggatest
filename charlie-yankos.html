<blockquote>
  <p><b>[July 7 1988 as the Socceroos hosted the Selecao at the Olympic Park Stadium. And the 0-1 defeat to Australia served as a confidence boost to the unfancied hosts]</b> Before the tournament a lot of people didn’t believe in our ability at all. They all thought the Gold Cup tournament was going to be contested between Argentina and Brazil. At that point in time, we had to start believing in ourselves a little bit more. We played our first game against Brazil and although we lost 1-0 in Melbourne, we played exceptionally well and felt very comfortable. I think people after that thought these guys can go okay.<br /><br />We were the minnows, there were a lot of part-timers and there was a lot of expectation that Argentina were going to kill us. For us to go out there and be very, very competitive and come out with a result like that was something extremely special for every player</p>
