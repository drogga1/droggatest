  <p><b>[Kasper Schemichel feels angry that the VAR has gone against Denmark twice in his side’s first two games of the World Cup in Russia]</b> I think it dominated the game in its own way. I think it is an exceptionally harsh decision. I don’t know what else Poulsen can do in that situation. He is jumping so his arm is going to be slightly raised and it is headed onto his arm from half a metre away so I don’t know how you can give that but the referee unfortunately saw it differently. If you are going to be giving stuff like that then you are going to be facing a lot of penalties in general. I think work is needed on VAR, I don’t think it is where it should be at the moment. I think in time maybe it can work but that’s two games in a row where we have come on the bad end of a VAR decision. I think we had a situation with Andreas Cornelius where he tried to stay on his feet. He is probably too honest and he should have had a penalty himself, but he is an honest guy and he tries to stay on his feet. That’s maybe a situation where the VAR could have helped the referee. The free-kick on Yussuf Poulsen leading up to the corner kick that they got where the penalty was. Someone needs to tell the referee that was a bad decision.<br /><br />It will be a very tough game and we are going to have to be better than we were today. I thought we did okay, we started the game well. We dominated the game and we lost a bit of momentum but I am sure we will be ready</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Maguire has been heavily linked with Manchester United]</b> I don’t think it’s going to be his year, I think it’s going to be his decade. Over the next 10 years or so, when he is going to be hitting his prime, he is going to be one of the best defenders in the world. He’s got absolutely every attribute you could possibly want in a defender. He’s an exceptional football player, very intelligent, he can see a pass and pick it out, positionally he’s very astute and very clever. He’s a big lad so on set-pieces, both for and against, he’s a threat and for me Harry can go as far as he wants. He was Player of the Year here last season, Players’ Player of the Year, so that says everything about his level last season. His work ethic, his attitude, I’m in no doubt that he’s going to kick on this season and then he’s going to be established as one of, if not the best defender in the Premier League.</p>

  <p><b>[Record-breaking deals for Alisson and Kepa Arrizabalaga have seen goalkeeper transfer fees pushed ridiculously high]</b> I think generally transfers are ridiculously high at the moment. It was only a matter of time before goalkeepers would get in on the act, because a good goalkeeper can be the difference between winning the league and not winning the league. That’s the market at the moment. I think the Neymar transfer was pivotal to everything. Prices became very inflated and from there it was always going to reach every position. You saw it with Virgil van Dijk <b>[who joined Liverpool for £75m in January]</b> and now with Alisson - the market value has really gone up high.</p>

  <p><b>[What happened in the helicopter crash involving Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha?]</b> You changed football. Forever! You gave hope to everyone that the impossible was possible, not just to our fans, but to fans all over the world in any sport! Not many people have done that. When you signed me back in 2011 you said to me we would be in the Champions League within six years and we would do great things. You inspired me and I believed in you. You made me feel like nothing was impossible. Without and your family, all this, everything we did together, everything we achieved would never have happened. You gave me experiences that only happen in fantasy. You literally made my dreams come true.</p>

  <p><b>[Kasper Schmeichel says the memory of seeing the helicopter crash that killed Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha will stay with him]</b> I was on the pitch and I waved him off. It is something that will stay with me, unfortunately. I saw it all happen. It’s not a nice memory but I’ve had all the support that I need. The club has been great and everybody has received the support that they needed<br /><br />It was tough. But we wanted to do it for the chairman and his family. We wanted to be together about this, because we’ve all lost what feels like a family member. He brought everybody here and none of this - the memories, this family he’s built, the culture he’s instilled - would be here without him. When he took over this club it was in a pretty precarious situation, and to build what he has is quite amazing. It’s one thing building a team and a club that can perform on the pitch, but we’re more proud of the family that he’s created and the feeling he’s instilled in everybody being welcome</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City’s Ederson is ahead of David de Gea and Alisson]</b> I would say Ederson along with <a href="marc-andre-ter-stegen.html">Marc-Andre ter Stegen</a> and Jan Oblak are the three best goalkeepers in the world and have been for a while for me. The way Ederson plays is so brave. To dare to play like that is bravery and it also enables City to play with a much higher press. They are able to really press because they know any ball in behind he will sweep up. His bravery in daring to be in those positions, knowing the slightest mistake will cost his team, that’s proper goalkeeping for me and I think he has been the best goalkeeper in this league for a while.<br /><br /><b>[Schmeichel expressed confidence in Leicester’s ability to cause an upset]</b> So much depends on us on Monday. We are in a position where we can affect the title race. I think Manchester City will do it in the end but I think they will have to lose to us first and then Liverpool will have to lose to Wolves! It’s really tough to call. We are going there for our job. We are going for seventh so we are going to win. We can’t use the past <b>[winning against City in December]</b> for too much. They are a great side and they are going for the top prize and when you are going for that, knowing from experience, you get into a groove and you grind out results and they will look to do that. We had a good result last week. It will be an interesting game. It will be tough for us but we will try and find some ways to make it tough for them</p>

If we need someone to kick off about something, he’ll be the angry man. He tends to keep himself to himself - he’s not the lairy one on WhatsApp.</h4>
