  <p><b>[Leicester City’s Kasper Schmeichel fuming after <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> penalty]</b> I think <b>[the decision]</b> was a bit tough. We were in the game until the referee had to make himself a hero. Then we lost our composure. <b>[Former <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> referee and current pundit]</b> Dermot <b>[Gallagher]</b> will be on Sky saying it was a great decision. Caglar had less than a millisecond to react. He is desperate to give it, once he does, they are never going to turn it over<br /><br />They are the best side in the world along with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>.

  <p><b>[Leicester City will not use government furlough scheme during coronavirus crisis]</b> We’ve been through so much together and come through every challenge stronger as a group. This will be no different. We’re here to support each other through the immediacy of this and, when the dust settles and the world is ready for football to return, we’ll be there, picking up where we left off, driving the club forward</p>

  <p><b>[Kasper Schmeichel has revealed that his favourite <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> referee is <a href="mark-clattenburg.html">Mark Clattenburg</a>]</b> I used to love <a href="mark-clattenburg.html">Mark Clattenburg</a>. No bullsh<em>t - he’d tell you to f</em>ck off if you were being a d*ck.<br /><br /><b>[The striker in 2016 said that among his traditions before a game are three cans of energy drink and a double espresso]</b> The port has stopped now, but that was his tradition. It worked for him. He’s never set foot in a gym. In training, sometimes he couldn’t hit a barn door. In games, he just flips a switch and does his thing. If we need someone to kick off about something, he’ll be the angry man. He tends to keep himself to himself - he’s not the lairy one on WhatsApp.<br /><br /><b>[Schmeichel was full of praise for <a href="nigel-pearson.html">Pearson</a> as a man and a coach]</b> He treats every single player like his own kids. We owe Nigel a great deal. So much of the infrastructure of the club is what Nigel put in place. He gets invested in people. He’s got a really soft, gentle side to him that you really don’t see. He adores and loves football - it’s all the circus around football that gets to him - all the media talk. He just wants to be a coach - he wants to be out on the pitch doing what he does. He’s an unbelievable ballroom dancer. I’ve seen him on stage, he’s good. He can do the splits. We’d won the league. He was happy. Everyone was dancing and he just did the splits. Everyone was like, ‘Woah?! Where did that come from?!’ Really interesting character</p>

  <p><b>[Kasper Schmeichel recalls <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> title party at <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a>’s house]</b> I was at home with my family. Through the run in, I hadn’t watched a single one of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s games. So I went with my wife, kids and brother in law down to the village to go for dinner to try to block it out - I left my phone at home.<br /><br />I went to the lounge and <a href="gary-cahill.html">Gary Cahill</a> scored so I told myself to stay calm. Then <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> equalised but the last few minutes were torture. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> had a late free kick that <a href="willian.html">Willian</a> was going to take, which he passed into the corner, and the relief when he did that was unbelievable. It was pride, joy and pure ecstasy. I can’t describe it.<br /><br />I celebrated with my family, who I wanted to be with, because they had been with me through the whole journey. A lot of the lads were at <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a>’s house so when we were done at home I drove to Jamie’s and we got on it from there.<br /><br />For <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, it was incredible and we wanted to see what was happening in the town so we drove into town and four or five days later, Vards put a few pictures in our group asking who the cars parked at his house belonged to, because no one had been to claim them</p>

  <p><b>[Kasper Schmeichel reveals what Esteban Cambiasso was like at Leicester City]</b> He was amazing. Honestly, I loved him, he was brilliant. What a player, and what a guy. He was basically a manager already. Even on the pitch, he was changing tactics and things like that, he was class. The way he was, the way he behaved, the way he looked after himself, you could tell there was a reason he’d been 10 years at such a big club <b>[Inter Milan]</b>. Like I say, I really enjoyed playing with him, but he was the first name that came to my mind when asked about ‘Parched.’</p>

  <p><b>[Kasper Schmeichel talks about the finer points of goalkeeping]</b> <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a> changed the game completely, probably back in about 2010 at the World Cup. He had been playing as a sweeper keeper before but it was something completely new to see it to that extent for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and for Germany. Both his coaches, <a href="joachim-low.html">Joachim Low</a> and Pep Guardiola; they utilised the fact that he was brave enough to do that. And they utilised that by getting their counter-press so effective because they knew any time they lost the ball, they could counter-press so hard and if they didn’t get a ball in over the top, <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Neuer</a> was there to sweep and get play going again high up the pitch. He very much changed the game and changed the expectation of what’s required from goalkeepers</p>
