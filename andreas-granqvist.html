  <p>[Andreas Granqvist told his team-mates that they could shave his head if they made it to Russia] I thought they’d forgotten. But John [Guidetti] and Vigge [Victor] Lindelof shaved it off straight away!<br /><br />There is such incredible joy and pride in what we’ve achieved. Many people had already counted us out when we drew France and Netherlands in the qualifiers. But we’ve produced many upsets and now most will take us seriously<br /><br />[Germany certainly have no other choice] It’s quite amazing. It’s only the second match and Germany were the big favourites ahead of the tournament, so us being able to knock them out, I don’t think a lot of people would have expected that<br /><br />We’ve played a number of big games, not least the play-off against Italy, which we handled very well. France away was another good one. So, we’ve compiled our own experience. There’s no need for fear. We’ve showed that we’re able to withstand heavy pressure</p>

  <p>[Veteran defender Andreas Granqvist says he is flattered by rumours linking him with a surprise move to Manchester United] I know that there is a lot of interest for me. United is incredibly flattering but I have not heard anything concrete yet. I still do not want to exclude anything. If, for example, a big club comes with something in January, then we’ll see</p>

  <p>[Andreas Granqvist is 99.9 per cent sure that he will not be making a shock move to Manchester United during the January] With 99.9 per cent certainty, we can kill the speculation here and now. It would be quite sensational, but I don’t think it will happen. Then I do not know if I want to. It’s with Helsinborgs I want to be.</p>
