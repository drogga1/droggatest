<blockquote>
  <p>[Manchester City are not assured of winning this season’s Premier League title despite having shown a more ruthless streak] I don’t believe this season’s title race is a foregone conclusion. Guardiola won’t either. Football has proven too many times that hiccups happen. Jurgen Klopp, Maurizio Sarri and Mauricio Pochettino are all fantastic coaches with excellent teams and resources to compete. You can bet Jose Mourinho, a serial winner in his career, won’t be taking this lightly… whatever he says publicly. This City team are exceptional but it’s not over yet.<br /><br />It may seem ominous but the difference I’ve seen in Manchester City this season is that Pep Guardiola is more hard-bitten. In previous years you could argue he let his purist principles get in the way. City had to play total football even if it came at a cost. Against Liverpool at Anfield, where they have struggled a few times, I saw Guardiola set up in a tactical manner which respected Liverpool’s strengths on the break. Against Manchester United on Sunday with the score at 2-1, he brought off Sergio Aguero and added Ilkay Gundogan to gain extra control. Last season, that may not have been the case. but in both instances this time City benefited. There’s an edge, perhaps a more ruthless nature about them. They absolutely hate being beaten</p>
