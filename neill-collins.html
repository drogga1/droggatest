  <p><b>[Neill Collins says Comparisons between <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> and Harry <a href="kieran-maguire.html">Maguire</a> are unfair]</b> He’ll be compared to Van Dijk but I think Van Dijk was the final piece of the jigsaw at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, whereas I’d argue Harry is one of the first pieces in this jigsaw at United, which is a really big ask. They’ve not got a great side, and I think Harry’s got a lot on his shoulders, but he is up there with the best in the world in that position and, as they improve as a team, I think he will go from strength to strength. Maybe these players have to go to a Southampton or <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> to really prove themselves to the big clubs but he definitely ended up costing United a lot more money<br /><br />I think the biggest compliment you can pay Harry is he improves year after year. He has excelled in every environment he’s been put in. It’s almost abnormal how strong he is – and damn right it hurts when he catches you. His feet are massive. He must be a size 16 or something. And when he stands on your foot… He’s so powerful that when he comes towards you with the ball you’re thinking, ‘I’m not tackling that!’</p>
