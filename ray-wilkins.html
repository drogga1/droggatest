  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>]</b> It’s not only on the field that John has the qualities every club desires. It’s off the field too. He leads the club, leads the players in that dressing room wonderfully well and always has done</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>]</b> When you take the work ethic the guy’s got, it’s no fluke. The guy works so hard day in day out. It’s first class. When you’ve consistently scored goals and played the way he has for so many seasons you have to say he is world class. He has this ability to get forward but the ability to get back and defend as well. Every day in training he does this. He works so hard - he trains as he plays. He is a credit to the game and a fantastic athlete</p>

  <p><b>[Ray Wilkins spent three years in Milan and set a British record when he moved from <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> in 1984 for £1.5million]</b> It was an immense time for me. The game was played more like an international than a league game, like a game of chess where you had to pit your wits against the best</p>
