  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>]</b> When you take the work ethic the guy’s got, it’s no fluke. The guy works so hard day in day out. It’s first class. When you’ve consistently scored goals and played the way he has for so many seasons you have to say he is world class. He has this ability to get forward but the ability to get back and defend as well. Every day in training he does this. He works so hard - he trains as he plays. He is a credit to the game and a fantastic athlete</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea legend Ray Wilkins says he will sell his season ticket if Antonio Conte’s side part with Eden Hazard this summer]</b> I would imagine Mr Abramovich would not even consider any offer that comes in. You cannot replace him. If they sell him I’ll give up my season ticket. He’s that important.<br /><br />It looks a very good front page, but that’s about as far as it goes. For Chelsea to lose Hazard, who is one of the five best players on the planet, they would have to replace this guy and he is irreplaceable at this moment in time. He’s a wonderfully gifted footballer and why would Chelsea want to give him up? I don’t see there’s any money out there. Roman Abramovich has an enormous amount of money himself. I couldn’t give a monkey’s what they offer. Chelsea wish to be the best club on the planet and they’re heading in the right direction. What they’ve done over the past 10-12 years has been nothing short of phenomenal, so if you want to be the best why sell the best? They’ll never get there if they sell Eden Hazard, who has been absolutely brilliant</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United are on the verge of completing their first signing of the summer with Sweden international Victor Lindelof agreeing to a reported £30.75 million deal]</b> We’ve got young Keane has done exceptionally well at Burnley, we’re looking to bring him back at Manchester United for £28m, all of a sudden Lindelof is 30 <b>[million]</b>. Now, when we bring someone in from Europe, it always starts with a three. This guy has done nothing. Absolutely nothing. Yet Keane has played a season exceptionally well in the Premier League, but we’re talking £25m. This guy’s coming in at £32m, £33m. Can he do it? We know Keane can, yet we’re prepared to spend…It always starts with a three, or a four, or a five. No one gets anything cheap from Europe because it’s the Premier League.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea midfielder Ray Wilkins has slammed the club’s decision to sell Nemanja Matic to Manchester United]</b> It’s the worst decision I’ve ever seen. You’ve got a guy here who was paramount to Chelsea along with Kante in the middle of of the pitch, winning the title with Chelsea the year before and all of a sudden you’ve sold him to one of - or the biggest - rivals we have. I say we because I am a Chelsea supporter so I’m speaking from the heart when I speak. I just could not see that for the life of me. Why would we let Nemanja go there?<br /><br />He’s been outstanding for us and you’ve seen in the short period that he’s been there <b>[at Man Utd]</b> how he’s allowed Pogba to basically do what he wants. I just couldn’t see that piece of business at all.</p>

  <p><b>[David Luiz saw red against Arsenal as the thought of tangling with Sead Kolasinac led him to wet himself]</b> It was an atrocious tackle. He either wants to hurt Kolasinac, or he’s afraid. I’ll go for the latter. He saw him coming towards him and thought, ‘wow, this fella is a giant’ and he basically wet himself. Kolasinac went to the floor, his boots never came off the ground, he just went for the ball. If Luiz had done that there would have been nothing wrong. It’s on the halfway line for goodness sake</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea assistant Ray Wilkins has slammed some of the Blues’ recent transfer dealings]</b> The selling of Matic to Manchester United as far as I’m concerned was an absolute disgrace, because that should never have happened. He <b>[Matic]</b> is going to be the difference between Manchester United winning and Manchester United not winning this year<br /><br />Chalobah went for £6m. I can’t quite see that at £6m. I don’t really see the differential between Bakayoko at £40m and Chalobah at six. I can’t see £34m difference between the two guys. Chalobah just comes back from the Under-21 European Championships and all of a sudden he is bombed out for £6m. £34m comes in and we sell the best holding midfield player in the country <b>[Matic]</b> to one of our biggest rivals. I can’t really see how that happens</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil is not good enough to wear the Arsenal No.10 shirt]</b> He is not a great player so why should he wear 10? Why should he nick that off Jack? I think the word ‘great’ is used far too often. I don’t think he has ever been a great player. You see him in the Premier League week in week out, he’s a good player, he’s a very good player. He’s been a fantastic player. I don’t think he is a great player.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United are unlikely to take Mesut Ozil from Arsenal but Chelsea forward Willian fits the Jose Mourinho mould]</b> I would have sold Ozil in the summer, the same with <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez - it’s embarrassing. I find it quite sad that the club have allowed <b>[Arsene]</b> Wenger to take the stance of not selling them, potentially costing the club £120 million in fees that they’re now not getting.<br /><br />Mesut Ozil won’t go to Old Trafford because he doesn’t have the work ethic that Mourinho looks for in his players. I actually see Willian as being the likely player to head to Old Trafford. Jose is an enormous admirer of Willian and he would be a special signing for United, but I pray that Chelsea don’t let him go.<br /><br />Ozil needs to go back to Germany, enjoy his football again and get around the pitch as he likes doing. In the Premier League, you’re expected to work hard defensively for your team, and I don’t think Mesut does that enough. Against Spurs, he was excellent in doing that, tracking Christian Eriksen, but he needs to do that every game, it can’t be one game in 20.</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski would be the perfect January addition for Chelsea]</b> When you’re Chelsea, or any top club for that matter, you’re always looking for Champions League calibre players, most of which are already playing for teams in the competition and therefore are registered and won’t be able to play in European competitions for you. You have to look at teams who have had the unfortunate situation of dropping out of Europe.<br /><br />It would have been lovely to see Bayern Munich knocked out and Robert Lewandowski come to Chelsea but that’s unlikely to happen. He’s a player I’d love to see come to Stamford Bridge. Unless they pull a gem out of the bag, it’s a difficult to window to play in.<br /><br />I agree with Frank’s comments. I think they need another striker of quality. <b>[Michy]</b> Batshuayi is not my cup of tea. I’d have had <b>[Tammy]</b> Abraham or <b>[Dominic]</b> Solanke on the bench instead. I would put <b>[Eden]</b> Hazard up alongside Morata and go for it. They would give teams absolute hell. If you release Hazard of all defensive duty, he will cause havoc in the opposition half.</p>

  <p><b>[John Terry would be an ideal candidate to inherit the managerial reins at Chelsea in the near future]</b> Why not? They took a chance with AVB all those years ago. Why not give it to them and let them have a bash at it? They know the club inside out, they are absolutely adored by everybody at the football club and it can only be a good thing that those two are given half an opportunity<br /><br />When you have been a top, top footballer, you understand the mentality of the top, top player. I look at Roy Keane. I thought he would be a fantastic manager but when he went down the leagues, I would imagine that Roy couldn’t accept the fact that someone couldn’t pass the ball from here to the wall and he would get rather annoyed by it. The lower you go down, the more repetitive it becomes, so stay where you are used to and what you know because you know the mentality of the player you are dealing with. John should go in at a top, top Championship club or Premier League club</p>
