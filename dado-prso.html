  <p><b>[Former Croatia Star Dado Prso Lauds <a href="slaven-bilic.html">Slaven Bilic</a>’s Impact On National Team]</b> This is a really good side, with a national coach who has chosen the right staff. <a href="slaven-bilic.html">Bilic</a> has talented and special people around him.<br /><br />He will be able to leave with his head held high, because whoever eventually succeeds him will be able to relax in the knowledge that <a href="slaven-bilic.html">Bilic</a> has created something special. He has created a style of play and brought through previously unknown youngsters who are improving all the time. We have to congratulate <a href="slaven-bilic.html">Bilic</a> for everything he has done<br /><br />It is simple, we need six points. We must be on our guards because six points may seem easy to get on paper, but teams like Georgia can surprise you. We have to watch out, they are a good side and we respect them, but nonetheless our objective is six points</p>

  <p><b>[The former Croatia international striker expects the <a href="fa.html">Three Lions</a> to flop in Russia]</b> I don’t believe Portugal can repeat their Euro success and England will do nothing, as always. I am impressed with <b>[Raphael]</b> <a href="raphael-varane.html">Varane</a> too, how he is becoming a big player and doesn’t make the mistakes he did before.<br /><br /><b>[Prso, who spent eight years on the books at Stade Louis II in his playing days]</b> Today I admire <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, even before <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> and <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> arrived. They are both exceptional players but I am not sure <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> will reach Ballon d’Or level, while <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is one step above. Character is most important and when you have that, along with talent, you have <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. But to have only one of those two things is not enough.</p>
