  <p><b>[Arsenal legend Campbell leaves Macclesfield after just eight months]</b> Macclesfield Town can confirm that after eight months with the club and successfully leading us to League Two safety last season, we have mutually agreed to part ways with manager Sol Campbell. This has been conducted in the most amicable of ways and there has been total transparency between the club and Sol regarding the challenges which face lower league clubs such as Macclesfield Town. We have a very competitive squad in place, as demonstrated by our opening games of the new season and this certainly bodes well for the future.<br /><br />Sol’s passion, drive and football knowledge will always be remembered at the Moss Rose with fondness and he has issued the following statement in light of the above. We will be making a further announcement on the appointment of a new coach as soon as possible. Finally, we would like to thank Sol for his time at the club - not only in helping us retain our League Two status, but also for installing a winning mentality which we now hope to build on</p>

  <p><b>[Macclesfield Town players and staff say their mental health has suffered as a result of tumultuous season]</b> Although we have to respect the outcome of the recent EFL vote regarding how points per game should be calculated, this further exemplified the fact that our ultimate fate will be determined far away from the field of play. This is despite the fact that we won more than double the amount of games as our closest rivals and amassed fourteen more points than them on the field of play. In our opinion, this compromises the premise of sporting integrity and further penalises those who are the true victims of this heart-wrenching tale most - the players, the staff and our wonderfully loyal fans. We feel like our own mental health has been disregarded at every turn and this has manifested itself in respect of the fact that many of our players and staff have had to battle and continue to battle, with tangible and often debilitating symptoms of mental illness.<br /><br />Fundamentally, the triggering of our mental wellbeing struggles has been down to the way we have been treated by the club in general - there is no getting away from that. Nobody is saying that as a club we haven’t made mistakes over the past 12 months, clearly we have and monumental ones at that<br /><br />Yet it is also accurate to state that this has been compounded by the actions of others, who are seemingly doing everything that they possibly can to remove us from the League. After all we have been through and continue to go through, all we ask now is that sporting integrity is upheld and the previously forgotten voices of all those who have suffered so acutely and in ways which we will never adequately be able to articulate, are finally heard</p>

  <p><b>[Macclesfield could yet be relegated to the National League after they confirmed the English Football League had appealed against a two-point penalty which kept them just above Stevenage]</b> Macclesfield Town are both shocked and profoundly disappointed to confirm that the English Football League has decided to appeal against the outcome of an independent disciplinary commission, in respect of misconduct charges levied against the club. These charges relate to the payment of player salaries in March 2020 and have previously been examined by the relevant commission on two separate occasions<br /><br />On June 19, 2020, the commission ruled that the club was to be deducted a further two points from the 2019/20 League Two table, as well as imposing a £20,000 fine ‘subject to the EFL, in its absolute discretion, considering whether to waive, defer or repay the same in the light of the business plan required’. This matter will now be referred back to an independent disciplinary commission once again, where we will vigorously refute the perceived notion that the commission’s previous judgement was in any way invalid</p>
