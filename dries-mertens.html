  <p><b>[Napoli ace Dries Mertens has admitted that money is important to him]</b> My father drove a bus in Anderlecht and he took me to training every day in Brussels from when I was 11 to 18. I have so much respect for when my parents did. They did not raise me talking about money and I would have disappointed them if I went to China. My dad reads everything about me. He is very proud and I want them to be even more so.<br /><br />My friends tell me I would have gone mad if a pass had not arrived perfectly. But maybe at the end of the month when you check your bank balance you would calm down. If I had been a substitute, like last season, I would have gone and chosen the money. We weighed up the pros and cons, my wife read testimonials from people of who live there, and you about the smog and it doesn’t seem like a healthy atmosphere. So I decided to say no, and I can tell you it’s difficult to refuse such an amount. My children and even my grandchildren would not have had to worry about their future. We hear players saying that they’re signing for the adventure, but no-one believes them<br /><br /><b>[Asked if a big contract is important to him]</b> Of course, even if it sounds a bit much. We see crazy amounts going around. But it’s just reality. But I want to have freedom to choose what I want to do. I’m not going to lay about after my career. My wife will work, too. If I decide to spend a month in Australia, I don’t want to have to worry about airline tickets or the fact a fast trip is more expensive. I’m sorry, but I’ve been working hard for this. I’d like to get to know the world because we travel a lot without seeing anything - except from hotels and pitches</p>

  <p><b>[Dries Mertens is finally proving he can be key to Napoli’s future]</b> I’m basically only playing one of every two games. That’s sometimes irritating. I like it when you’re in good form, you keep going and everything works out well. With our busy schedule I understand you can’t play every game, but one match in two is, I think, too little even if I have to accept that too.</p>

After a season like that, I am super happy at my club. I didn’t want to leave. There was also interest from Chelsea and other clubs, but, in my head, there was never any intention to change clubs. I am happy at Napoli</p>

  <p><b>[His most recent effort, against Lazio last Wednesday with Mertens beating a back-peddling Thomas Strakosha with an expertly-weighted, first-time chip from an acute angle wide. It bore an uncanny resemblance to Maradona’s iconic strike against the same opposition in February 1985]</b> Mine was further out, so I get extra credit! I just turned around, saw the goalkeeper was getting slowly back to his line and that there was a small gap, so I said to myself: ‘Go for it’!</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku has improved a lot]</b> He has improved a lot. People are laughing at his control but he’s a boy who after training takes 20 balls and continues to train. I respect him a lot for that.<br /><br />Everyone is going to think about Eden Hazard. But I’m going to say Jan Vertonghen. He is very technical for someone tall <b>[and playing in a]</b> defensive position</p>

  <p><b>[Dries Mertens has hinted that he will leave Napoli as a free agent in 2020]</b> In one year I finish my contract in Naples so maybe then. Why did I reject a move before? I just preferred to stay in Europe for my development. I was still on the bench at the beginning in Naples, then I started to play and I wanted to enjoy my moments. I worked so hard to get into the team and I didn’t want to leave - that would have been too easy. I spoke a lot with <b>[Axel]</b> Witsel and <b>[Yannick]</b> Carrasco and they are actually quite positive about the football there. I spoke to Carrasco <b>[recently]</b> and he said he’s getting used to it and his team is getting more points. At the beginning he said he didn’t know how to find his place in the team, but now he’s feeling better. With Axel, even though he’s moved away, he said he still enjoyed his time.</p>

  <p><b>[Napoli attacker Dries Mertens has suggested that Anfield’s fear factor is exaggerated]</b> My strongest memory is that they have a sign saying ‘This is Anfield’ and everyone was talking about it, so I was thinking it’s very big, you know. I came through the tunnel and I asked, ‘Where is the thing?’ and they said you missed it and I hadn’t noticed it. So, in the second half, I’m looking at this small thing and asking, ‘Is this so special?’<br /><br />Football in Italy is crazy and the people are very crazy, too, so I think we are used to it. For me, it will push me to a different level, these are the nights we want to play</p>

  <p><b>[Dries Mertens insists Arsenal are not much stronger than Napoli]</b> Arsenal is not really strong, certainly not much stronger than us. We need to understand that we are normal footballers and we are doing really well, the fans must not say that we are doing badly. We are doing well, we are second in the league, have left the Europa League only now and went out of the Champions League by one goal. Today it seemed impossible to score, then if you do not score immediately and they do, it changes everything.</p>

All those we buy must be at the top level and therefore someone like James would be welcome to aim even higher. He could make the difference. I think we need to buy great players to raise the level of the team. We already have a strong squad, but if we want to win something, we need to buy in order to raise the level. That is clear</p>

  <p><b>[Dries Mertens told <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> they must back up their 2-0 victory over <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in Tuesday’s Champions League opener]</b> We gave everything and ran so hard. When you take three points at the end of a game like that, it all feels good. It doesn’t mean anything to beat the Champions League holders unless we keep going. We saw <b>[Group E rivals]</b> Salzburg beat Genk 6-2, they are also a strong team so we have to do well in the next game too. Last season we also did well and beat them 1-0 here. I think we prepared well as we knew what we had to do. We didn’t have enough of the ball in the first half but we gave our all. We lost last season at Salzburg in the Europa League so will not take them for granted. We also have Lecce this weekend and saw that they just beat Torino</p>
