  <p><b>[Dries Mertens speaks about his goal in his team’s 4-1 over Lazio]</b> They made me watch <a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a>’s goal, it was harder for him, so let’s leave the comparison. It’s thanks to my team-mates if I’m able to score goals like that. I am not <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>, I’m not <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>, I’m just Dries and I’m happy with that</p>

  <p><b>[Mertens future hint involves free agency and China]</b> You never know. In one year I finish my contract in Naples so maybe then. Why did I reject a move before? I just preferred to stay in Europe for my development. I was still on the bench at the beginning in Naples, then I started to play and I wanted to enjoy my moments.<br /><br />I worked so hard to get into the team and I didn’t want to leave - that would have been too easy. I spoke a lot with <b>[Axel]</b> <a href="axel-witsel.html">Witsel</a> and <b>[Yannick]</b> Carrasco and they are actually quite positive about the football there.<br /><br />I spoke to Carrasco <b>[recently]</b> and he said he’s getting used to it and his team is getting more points. At the beginning he said he didn’t know how to find his place in the team, but now he’s feeling better. With Axel, even though he’s moved away, he said he still enjoyed his time</p>

  <p><b>[Dries Mertens tells about his first experience playing at Anfield]</b> My strongest memory is that they have a sign saying ‘This is Anfield’ and everyone was talking about it, so I was thinking it’s very big, you know<br /><br />I came through the tunnel and I asked, ‘Where is the thing?’ and they said you missed it and I hadn’t noticed it. So, in the second half, I’m looking at this small thing and asking, ‘Is this so special?’<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he felt a special atmosphere when he played at the ground, he replied]</b> They had a special price for children, so maybe not</p>

  <p><b>[Napoli forward Dries Mertens praises Hazard following his move to Madrid]</b> I’m happy for him, it’s a good step forward. He’s already one of the best players in the world, and now he has to take advantage of his opportunities to become the best of all</p>

  <p><b>[Dries Mertens said Napoli must buy new and ‘top level’ players if they want to dethrone Serie A champions Juventus]</b> I just want to say that I see other teams are buying a lot, we’ve signed Kostas Manolas. All those we buy must be at the top level and therefore someone like James would be welcome to aim even higher. He could make the difference. I think we need to buy great players to raise the level of the team. We already have a strong squad, but if we want to win something, we need to buy in order to raise the level. That is clear</p>

  <p><b>[Dries Mertens told <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> they must back up their 2-0 victory over <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in Tuesday’s Champions League opener]</b> We gave everything and ran so hard. When you take three points at the end of a game like that, it all feels good. It doesn’t mean anything to beat the Champions League holders unless we keep going. We saw <b>[Group E rivals]</b> Salzburg beat Genk 6-2, they are also a strong team so we have to do well in the next game too. Last season we also did well and beat them 1-0 here. I think we prepared well as we knew what we had to do. We didn’t have enough of the ball in the first half but we gave our all. We lost last season at Salzburg in the Europa League so will not take them for granted. We also have Lecce this weekend and saw that they just beat Torino</p>
