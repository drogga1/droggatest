  <p><b>[Geelong’s A-League bid has unveiled its advisory board as they continue to work towards winning a licence]</b> They all have different skill sets and abilities but the one common thing is that these are all people that love the game. That not only want this club to work and to be successful for the region but they want what’s good for the game in general.<br /><br />We want to be very strategic about it. We don’t want to turn up one week and then have nothing to say for three months, so there will be rolling announcements<br /><br />I do believe once a club in this region is established, I think they’re really going to have that same level of support as the <b>[Western Sydney]</b> Wanderers do. We can already judge by the amount of requests and contact via Facebook etcetera - people are already designing strips, designing logos, throwing out names that we should the club. The response has been nothing short of phenomenal, which really gives us a lot of heart</p>

  <p><b>[Victoria Patriots hope to build and own a football-specific venue in Geelong if they win an A-League licence rather than play at Simonds Stadium]</b> We’ve made it very clear from day one that we want this region of western Victoria to have a purpose-built, boutique football stadium. It really will be a huge revenue stream potentially for the club if we can get that right. It is fundamental to our club being successful in the long term.<br /><br /><b>[Horvat has claimed a new stadium built for a Geelong-based A-League club would provide immense economic benefit to Victoria’s western region]</b> <b>[Populous’]</b> ability to not only build four stands but to actually do studies and engage the region and the community to make it a real economic space is something that they’re excellent in. That’s what is really exciting about it.</p>

  <p><b>[spokesperson for Geelong’s bid Steve Horvat indicating his group will keep patiently working on developing their proposal and building a new club]</b> One way or the other, it really doesn’t affect us. I think we’re moving on with whatever the timeframe is. Obviously, FFA has known of our intentions for a long time and whether it’s this month, whether it’s in six months. You know, whether the expansion is delayed for another 12 months or what have you - because time is creeping up on everybody - it doesn’t matter because we’re in it for the long haul.</p>
