  <p><b>[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion attacker Viktor Gyokeres has commented on being linked with Swedish side giants Malmo]</b> There was nothing that I thought about it and nothing that reached me personally. It was mostly the newspapers, so I read it too. I had no contact with them, but it was fun that they seemed interested according to the information. They are a big club in Sweden</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton loan striker Viktor Gyokeres makes scoring return in <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>]</b> Nuremberg had a good chance in the first half. But we worked hard and they didn’t create too many other chances. We got into the game in the second half and I was pleased to get my goal. I’m happy that I was able to help the team get three points.</p>
