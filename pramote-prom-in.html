  <p><b>[18 injured as 2 roadside bombs rock Thai south]</b> The first bomb was a grenade thrown into the area outside the SBPAC office fence to draw people out. Then a car bomb about 10m from the first explosion went off. This was hidden in a pick-up truck which the perpetrators parked near the fence. Eighteen are wounded and no one died</p>
