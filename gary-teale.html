<blockquote>
  <p>[Gary Teale says John McGinn could thrive at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> if a £50 million move is made] At first you’re surprised when you see £50 million and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. But then you take time to reflect and digest it and there’s nothing to say why he couldn’t go and do it. He’s thrived on every chance and there’s no reason to say why, if he got that opportunity at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, he wouldn’t thrive in that atmosphere<br /><br />It would be a big ask for John to go in there but Man United are at a stage where they’re looking to rebuild. People of my generation probably still think of Man United under Sir Alex [Ferguson] winning everything. John probably isn’t at the level of player they had in those days but just now Man United are looking to bring in players after not doing what they’d hoped to do since Sir Alex. So you never know, John could perhaps be part of that rebuilding job. In the Premier League nowadays figures like £50 million are bandied about as if it’s nothing. You ask yourself if John is worth that and initially you think no. But the market dictates things there and if it comes along, then great. He’s a great lad, he’s wholehearted and he gives everything in every training session and every game so he deserves anything he gets</p>
