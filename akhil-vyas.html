<blockquote>
  <p><b>[An AST survey in March saw 89% of members vote for Arsenal to end Wenger’s contract when his position was set to be reviewed this summer]</b> Eighty-nine per cent said it was time to go but when we got the survey analysed independently there was so much respect for him. There was a lot of ‘I think he’s done great and ‘I’ll always be in awe of him but I think it’s time for a new change because things have run its course’. That kind of gets misreported but when you dig deeper quite a high percentage were still full of respect for him.<br /><br />We finished second to Leicester in the title race two years ago but we weren’t really in it, it was because Spurs imploded. Finishing outside the top four for the first time last season opened a lot of eyes. The FA Cups have obviously been fantastic and you can’t belittle them, but in terms of the league and Champions League we haven’t looked anywhere near competing let alone winning. Nothing lasts forever, the world is changing. Sir Alex Ferguson had to leave one day, Pep Guardiola left Barcelona. The new continental structure with Raul <b>[Sanllehi]</b>, Sven <b>[Mislintat]</b> and Huss <b>[Fahmy]</b> is where most clubs are going, but could Wenger work in that? Probably not, just because for 22 years he hasn’t. If the continental structure is starting to sign players for you like <b>[Pierre-Emerick]</b> Aubameyang - who was cup tied and Wenger knew he might be off in the summer - but it made sense for the club going forward. When people start to interfere even in a positive way that can sometimes be the trigger.<br /><br />From a personal point of view he once said that he when leaves Arsenal he’ll buy a season ticket, get a red and white scarf and come and watch Arsenal. I hope he does because he’d be great as a fan and an unofficial consultant for the club to talk to. He’s still got great knowledge of the game, players will still look up to him, when he leaves he’ll stay in contact with them. When Kolo Toure failed a drug test the first person he messaged was Arsene Wenger and you can see that happening. Ultimately, it’s how he feels but he could also do a great job at FIFA or UEFA, he’s always got great opinions on football and he can do<br /><br />I was pretty sure on having someone experienced in for a couple of years but I think I’ve changed my mind a little bit. You look at Ozil, Ramsey and Aubameyang, players like that who are all at their peak now. It’s someone who is going to get the best out of them. Is it going to be someone experienced or someone younger you take the risk on? It’s always been the Arsenal style to take risks. Wenger hadn’t won a league title, Graham, Terry Neill, Stewart Robson, Bruce Rioch - a lot of them hadn’t won anything. Someone who gets the best out of players and demands respect and can get the best out of the team right now <b>[is needed]</b>. That’s the most important thing</p>
