<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Reims goalkeeper Edouard Mendy has underlined the importance of a full team effort in allowing him to match Manchester City custodian Ederson and Liverpool shot-stopper Alisson]</b> The stats don’t lie. But it’s a bit like an attacker. If he scores 20 goals, we only remember him. For goalkeepers, it’s the same. The statistic belongs to the team. We’ve done a great job since coach David Guion arrived <b>[in summer 2017]</b>. Last season, we also kept a lot of clean sheets. We’re continuing to do what we did but at a higher level, so it’s very positive.<br /><br />I’m going step by step. The longer the season goes on, the more goals I set myself. I must continue to gain experience and to be the best player for my team. I must always push myself. I wouldn’t say I surprise myself because I work to be successful each weekend. If I didn’t work during the week, I’d say I’m a thief and I don’t deserve what’s happening to me, but that’s not the case. I work hard to be successful. When I am, it’s good and I’m happy. And when I’m not, I’m disappointed. I put it behind me quickly and get back to work so it doesn’t happen in the next game<br /><br /><b>[a 5-0 loss against PSG]</b> The mistake was human. There were two solutions: either I could lose my head or I could take the game as an apprenticeship for playing at the highest level, which is what I did. It’s about learning, you have to be open and learn from your mistakes</p>
