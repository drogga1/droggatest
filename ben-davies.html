  <p><b>[Ben Davies says that the team has let both manager <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> and their supporters down with their performance against Colchester United following their horrible Carabao Cup third-round defeat]</b> It’s horrible. It’s a trophy, a good chance to pick something up and we’ve let it slip at the first hurdle. The manager didn’t need to say anything afterwards. In the dressing room, we were all as disappointed as him. We let him down, we let the club down. We weren’t terrible. We just didn’t seem to click, didn’t put anything together. We have to win these games. We have to show we’re a better side than this. It’s a tough feeling right now. We just have to apologise to the supporters, too. We let them down. They travel with us everywhere and they’re first-class. We need everyone behind us now to help us push on through this difficult time<br /><br /><b>[Asked what it was that went wrong for his side]</b> It’s difficult to put your finger on at the moment, there’s a lot of emotions flying around. It hurts a lot. No disrespect to Colchester, but we should be coming here, showing them we’re the better side and winning. We really need to look at ourselves and go again. This is a big learning curve for us. It’s one where we really have to take a long hard look at ourselves and make sure these kind of results don’t happen again<br /><br /><b>[Speaking on their next match, against Southampton in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, Davies stated that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> were under no illusions as to the importance of picking up three points]</b> It’s a huge game for us. We need to start getting that winning feeling back because it seems a long way away after losing games like that</p>

  <p><b>[Totthenham defender Ben Davies believes that players must band together to help victims of abuse like <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a>, even if they play for fierce rivals as he and the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> captain do]</b> I spoke to a psychologist we had at Wales and he said that footballers are really in a melting pot of anxiety when their performance is critiqued by millions of people every game. It’s not like if you work in a shop that your performance will get judged by millions.<br /><br />It’s a stressful environment. I get it if players get down and if players have evenings when they are struggling. That is normal and it’s something that needs to be spoken about more. All you can do if it’s your team-mate is try to help. But as far as someone like <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> is concerned, when you read, he is struggling or maybe needed counselling, nobody wants to see that. Rivalries aside, if we could help him out, we would<br /><br /><b>[Davies and his team-mates face <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> on Sunday and then Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League on Wednesday]</b> The next two games are good opportunities to win. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> have amazing players but are a bit stop-start at the moment. It’s a good opportunity for us to go there and show what we can do. Red Star is the same. It’s a game we want to be winning. We believe we can win. If we can overcome these two challenges, it will be a good bit of momentum going forward</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham left-back Ben Davies admits the club’s decision to sack <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> has come as a big shock]</b> I didn’t really know about it obviously until after the game. But it was a big shock, he’s been amazing to work with for the last five years and it’s a shame to see him go</p>

  <p><b>[Ben Davies says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has been great for Tottenham]</b> I think he’s been great for the club, having someone of his stature and calibre coming to the club really gives everyone a lift. To have someone like him believe that this club can win things then it’s a dream manager to have. If he’s putting his trust in us then we can only give everything to him and put our trust in him. Personally for me, it’s been quite tough. I got injured in his first game. The next few weeks after that is when players look to make the best impression they can. I can’t say a bad word about him though because throughout my time out injured he was in constant contact with me. He gave me so much support and made sure that when I came back I was right. For me, he’s been brilliant<br /><br /><b>[Davies added on how <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> has organised regular virtual training sessions to keep squad fitness levels high]</b> These are not normal times and you don’t know what you’re going to get from people, but what I can see on Zoom everybody is giving him everything they can. It’s difficult times but to have someone like him, who is there every day, making sure these sessions are going on, it’s all you can ask for and as players, we’re definitely responding to that</p>

  <p><b>[Ben Davies has admitted Friday’s comeback clash against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is crucial to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s hopes of finishing <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> season on a high]</b> It is a huge game in our season - if we start off on the front foot it can really give us a big platform and confidence to push on for the rest of the season. We know that this game is vital going into the final bit of our season to where we want to finish. It’s been a long preparation for it but we can’t wait to get going. It was really nice to be back and it is something we are going to have to get used to - playing in an empty stadium and making sure we’re up and at it</p>
