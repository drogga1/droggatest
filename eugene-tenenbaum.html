<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Chelsea board member explains why Abramovich purchased Blues]</b> He is an entrepreneur. He likes challenges. Once he gets focused, it’s not luck. He likes to understand what a project is about and involve himself for the long term. He likes a drive for results. He likes to win and he wants to help out. In football, the exciting thing is that you set the plan, you execute the plan, and then every week you have a validation or not of whether your plan is correct<br /><br /><b>[Tenenbaum said that other investments that Abramovich made, including on a new training centre, a women’s team and charitable pursuits, had a big impact as well]</b> It is so important to see the excellence of the institution and the excellence of society. Even after nearly two decades in charge, Tenenbaum said that Abramovich is still exhilarated by the challenge of running a football team.<br /><br />He likes to figure things out. I think the reason why he loves football after all of these years is that it’s not a formula. It’s not an algorithm. I think that is why people love it and why it is the number one sport in the world. In a business environment, you have sales figures, you have results. But in this situation, every week you have a validation or not of what your strategy is and I think that’s the exciting part.</p>
