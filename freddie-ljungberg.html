We dominated away from home at the start on the game. But we need to work on the transitions, we dominated and they break on us too easily. In the beginning I saw a lot of things we worked on in training, but we need to score goals and take the lead. Twice they went behind and showed a great mentality to come back. I want this club to do well, it is only winning that counts. I wanted to win the game so I am disappointed but I have also seen some positive things<br /><br /><b>[On the penalty incident]</b> I think I had a heart-attack twice!

  <p><b>[When asked if they can make the Champions League places]</b> 100 per cent. People drop points here and there, we drop points, so it’s a bit of a crazy league at the moment. But of course I think <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> can go back to the top four. I don’t know if you saw it but when we went 1-0 down, the players weren’t shaking their heads, they were actually going ‘come on guys we can sort this out’. That shows they believe they are quality players. I’m extremely proud of the players that they came back twice, especially as they scored just before half-time. You get that and morale goes down but they came out fighting and got it done. We need to change a negative trend plus, with our run that was a difficult game and the players did really well<br /><br /><b>[Ljungberg revealed he is the process of finalising the makeup of his temporary backroom team]</b> Normally a pre-season is five-six weeks and you can implement how you want to play football but I don’t have that. I just try to do small building blocks and try to change things in a slow tempo so people can understand and practice. Now players need to recover and we’ll probably get one and a half sessions but that’s football. I just try to make things simple as possible and hopefully we get better<br /><br />I’m looking forward day by day and I’m honoured that they trusted me to do this. I hope the club knows what I can and can’t do. I’m trying to help the players as much as I can and that’s how I see it. Of course I was proud and honoured to be allowed to stand there on the touchline and lead this great club</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if criticism of his backline is justified]</b> No. I think my players try to defend. Of course, you can have different types of players in the squad. That’s just a fact. We’ve had a gameplan we’ve tried to execute and I want to defend. We need to find solutions. If players are not super quick and we say ‘you’ve got to sprint for this or that’, that’s going to be difficult for that player. In general terms, we try to put out a structure that everybody knows what to do. The main thing I saw in the game <b>[against Norwich]</b> is that we let them get into situations where it was just a sprint. It was not about football or technical stuff, they just went in a competitive sprint with our player. We want to stop that<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on what he has learned from the 2-2 draw at Carrow Road]</b> There was a lot of reflection after the game, I’ve watched it twice now. The general feeling is probably the same as I had after the match. We started extremely well, played very well offensively but had a problem transition-wise - they got shots on target and chances just from the transition of an eight-yard sprint, which we need to stop. Another thing is that my feeling that we got in behind their midfield and behind their backline a lot has been backed up by data within the club. We have been sky-rocketed up to be one of the top teams in the league in getting into the pockets and behind them. That feels very good that it has been backed up by the data and the feeling I had after the game, and of course we will try to keep on doing that. My feeling was that I wanted to win the game, very disappointed not to win it, but if we play a transition game like we did, we won’t win any games, so that’s something that I can coach and try to improve</p>

I know in the past, some stories of how he treated players and how he made them feel good and things like that. I have stolen a little bit of those ideas. He’s a great coach. It’s been a long time and I hope I can speak to him soon.<br /><br /><b>[When asked why there has been a lack of Swedish coaches in the Premier League]</b> I don’t know why that is.

That’s what I want to see from them. Of course, it’s disappointing but we’ve got to keep on going. The players are low on confidence, I think you can see that. There was a little bit of a reaction in the second half, but you’ve got to start games like that. We’re in a difficult situation, we’ve lost a lot of games and the confidence has gone down. We started the game flat with no energy. It’s my job to get them to be aggressive and play with energy</p>

We sliced through them and the result is amazing. Football throws a curve ball at you all the time but the players responded. They worked so hard, and in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> you have to. It’s all down to the players - I’m just there to guide them a little bit<br /><br />I don’t think any of us can really imagine <b>[how hard it has been]</b>. They’ve been low but you could see in the dressing room how relieved they are. I try to not get carried away because I still feel that there are things we need to work on and we’re not near to where I want us to be. But, of course, I hope that the happiness the players could feel, and that spirit and belief in themselves, will have a positive effect</p>

You have to work on it, relax and be brave<br /><br />We have a few injuries. We’ve played a lot of games lately and have another game on Sunday. We brought a lot of firepower here. We have younger players that played in the group stages. It’s a big game and we’re here to get a result. We have a lot of respect for the opponents. We play a lot of games. Sometimes we have to change. We have a lot of respect for the game. We don’t take it lightly. We want to win and get a result</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal interim head coach Freddie Ljungberg was thrilled by 18-year-old <a href="bukayo-saka.html">Bukayo Saka</a>’s amazing rescue act against Standard Liege]</b> He was amazing. His final ball, and last bit, is always effective. He was a bit upset with me before the game that he had to play wing-back and full-back. He’s a tremendous talent. I feel sorry for our young players. A lot of them haven’t been on loan, they’ve not had that exposure to men’s football. Some of them made mistakes but they’ll learn from those mistakes and won’t do them again. But Bukayo had a tremendous night<br /><br />I’m really proud of them. They showed belief in how they can play football. It’s good for us in the future. The energy, they go and go. They don’t stop. We played really well in our game-plan in the first half. They didn’t have any shots on target. We should have maybe been one or two up at half-time. We got sucker-punched a bit, they scored two deflected goals. You can’t really slam the players for that. We could have folded but we didn’t. At 2-2, we could have got a 3-2 but I had the information about the other score so we didn’t go too hard. Of course, it was a small gamble but I believe in those young players and they pulled through and we’re top of the group</p>

  <p><b>[Freddie Ljungberg admits <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> must be ready for a backlash from their own fans in Sunday’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> game against Manchester City]</b> It’s the right of the fans to be this way.

They already know about it but I will try to prepare them for if and when it happens. But I think when we play City at home, the fans know it will be a very tough game and will be with us regardless. I want to make sure I respect the decisions and voice of the fans. In my opinion they are the club and we try to do the best we can for them. We try to respect them and make them know we are doing this.

But we couldn’t get that final spark and when you are 2-0 and 3-0 down early it takes the edge off. The players showed spirit but it is hard to play at 3-0 down. If you look you see the players and price tags they put in from the bench, we have young kids who we put on. There is a gulf but I am still proud of the boys</p>

  <p><b>[Freddie Ljungberg has reflected on his special month as <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s interim manager]</b> It’s been a great experience. I’ve been extremely honoured to be the interim manager for this great, great club. Of course, it’s really nice to hear people say you’ve done good things, but also when you hear from players and other people close around you that you’re appreciated in certain things, that feels good. When people said we’d had progress in how we played and stuff like that, of course, that feels special. Maybe it’s wrong to say now, but I’m a little bit proud maybe. But the main thing is that we now have clarity and I want to thank as well, for example, when Unai left, he left with a lot of staff and we didn’t have any staff. We were short but I want to say thank you to all those people who have been trying to do jobs that maybe are not their jobs. I am extremely grateful for that and I think, together, we’ve done the best we ever could and we pushed ourselves to the limit<br /><br /><b>[Ljungberg added on the support he’s received during his temporary spell in the dugout]</b> The support that I’ve got, and the team, it’s been great. Of course, to hear that song is a bit emotional obviously and they sing it so loudly, it’s been special. Even though we know City and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are in a different league, at home we had a young side on the pitch in the end and the fans stood up and sang, the whole stadium. I felt that showed. That’s the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> I know. I was very, very proud to stand with them</p>

Mesut was injured but I would not have picked him for the squad because I want to make a stance that it’s not what I accept from an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> football player.

We’re a bit low on confidence and it’s been a difficult time we’re going through, but we won away at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> and that was the first time we won away since the first day of the season at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. That changed us a little bit. Now here, we kept a clean sheet and got a draw away from home. We feel a bit stable. For me, the important thing is that we’re <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Football Club, we need to have possession. We should be keeping the ball and dominate. I know <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> were really strong from their long balls, their throw-ins and their set-pieces. That was difficult but that’s what I’ll take with us. I know <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> is a great coach and he will make us even better</p>
