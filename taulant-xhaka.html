  <p>[Granit Xhaka’s older brother Taulant Xhaka] He has to deal with that [criticism], he’s a professional football player. This also means that you can deal with both positive and negative experiences.<br /><br />Arsene Wenger has already taught him a lot, both humanly and playfully. But we do not talk about that very often, so it’s hard to judge from my point of view. I watch the games when I have the time, but in football, when you’re in a negative spiral, the simplest things do not work anymore. That’s just the case for Arsenal at the moment. It’s similar here in Basel. It is clear that the players have enough quality, but if the form is bad, it is difficult</p>

  <p>[Taulant Xhaka has revealed that he wants to be reunited with brother Granit in the future] I call Granit four times a week. We talk about general things, not just football. Also, because he is in a difficult phase with Arsenal as well. We exchange tips as well as criticisms to improve ourselves. He helps me and I help him. We are different players. Granit is technically stronger than me but the coaches should judge the rest. It’s not so easy [to watch Granit’s games] because we often play both on Saturday. When I have the time I try to watch every game Granit plays in.<br /><br />Yes, if not at Arsenal then maybe at FC Basel when he returns to Switzerland. It is my dream to play with my brother again. But whether that’s at Arsenal or Basel, it does not matter. I believe that he wants to return to Basel at the end of his career because he grew up here and FC Basel is his favourite team. As soon as he has two days off, he comes to Basel and visits his friends and family. There is a very strong bond. There are many nice moments. Of course, I like to remember my Champions League debut at Old Trafford at Manchester United, where we drew 3-3. Being able to experience this together with Granit in the same team was a very nice experience for us. As kids we used to spend 24 hours together<br /><br />For me, City is currently the best team in Europe - especially because of Guardiola. They always want to play, that’s impressive. Their passing skills and the physical presence are world class. Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gündogan were my direct opponents in central midfield. You can only learn from such players, they are role models. We did not play so bad, City had five shots, four of them were in the net. We were that lucky against Benfica for example. If you are successful, this is how it goes. At the moment we are in a difficult situation, from which we have to free ourselves. If they [Man City] keep playing in that way, then they can definitely [win the Champions League]. But you must not forget the big clubs like Real Madrid and Barcelona, ​​which are also among the top favourites for me. The current season is not as we have imagined so far. In the league Young Boys are 11 points ahead but we have a game in hand. The season is still going on for a while, there are 12 games left and I think everything is still possible<br /><br />There are good and bad stages in football. Many of us have not experienced a phase like this yet. We have to look from game to game and just try to play well. But it is difficult to say what the problems are. I think we have to find each other again first. We’ve got some young and new players, it needs some time until everything fits. The season is still long, so everything is possible. We are FC Basel, we are the best club in Switzerland. I do not expect Young Boys to win all 12 remaining games, they also will be stumbling and then we have to take our chance. In addition, we play twice directly against them, which can also be an advantage</p>
