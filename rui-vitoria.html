<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Rui Vitoria has revealed that he had to talk a promising defender out of a move to England before his potential eventually caught the Red Devils’ eye]</b> Victor, one or two weeks from the close of the winter market, comes to my office and says to me and <a href="rui-costa.html">Rui Costa</a> that he wanted to leave because he had an offer from a second-tier English league club and he wanted to go because he wanted to play more.<br /><br />I told him ‘it’s very close, your door is about to open, there is only one opportunity that may arise’. And he agreed to stay. Then there was an injury for Luisao, another for Lisandro and when he came in he was ready. Today he is in England and at one of the biggest clubs in the world because he knew how to wait for his opportunity. Our strategy was to have two, three experienced centre-halves and a younger one: we did it with <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Lindelof</a>, then with Ruben Dias and we were also going to do it with Ferro. And they were players who, when they came in, were ready.</p>
