  <p><b>[On Ederson]</b> We faced one of the best teams in Europe, with a very high dynamic of play, with attacking players of great speed and depth who would create problems for any team in Europe. Ederson put in a wonderful performance, but he is at a very high level and that’s why he’s here.</p>

  <p><b>[Benfica boss Rui Vitoria appears to think that an agreement will be reached]</b> If Ederson leaves, he leaves with the gratitude of Benfica. He will always carry Benfica’s name everywhere.</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof backed to earn trust of Man Utd and Mourinho by Benfica boss Rui Vitoria]</b> He is a very high quality player, he has been playing with Jose Mourinho. Of course when you move from the Portuguese championship to an English championship, there is a phase, a stage of adaptation. I do foresee that in the future Lindelof will be a player of Jose Mourinho’s team. He has a lot of value, he is very cold, very competitive and has a great deal of quality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Rui Vitoria has revealed that he had to talk a promising defender out of a move to England before his potential eventually caught the Red Devils’ eye]</b> Victor, one or two weeks from the close of the winter market, comes to my office and says to me and <a href="rui-costa.html">Rui Costa</a> that he wanted to leave because he had an offer from a second-tier English league club and he wanted to go because he wanted to play more.<br /><br />I told him ‘it’s very close, your door is about to open, there is only one opportunity that may arise’. And he agreed to stay. Then there was an injury for Luisao, another for Lisandro and when he came in he was ready. Today he is in England and at one of the biggest clubs in the world because he knew how to wait for his opportunity. Our strategy was to have two, three experienced centre-halves and a younger one: we did it with <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Lindelof</a>, then with Ruben Dias and we were also going to do it with Ferro. And they were players who, when they came in, were ready.</p>
