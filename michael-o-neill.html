  <p><b>[Northern Ireland boss Michael O’Neill believes that his squad will benefit from all players having their club futures settled at an early stage]</b> I don’t know if we’re a stronger squad than we were two years ago but I think we’re a squad with more potential. We’ve benefited from the time we’ve worked together, we’ve had a chance to build something and there have been positives this summer in terms of the players’ club situations. This time last year we still had four or five lads with no clubs sorted and it’s asking a lot of someone who is unattached to come in and play qualifiers but this time the ones who were looking - Craig Cathcart, Aaron Hughes, Chris Baird, Sammy Clingan, Roy Carroll - all got resolved nice and early. All the players have had a decent pre-season and we’ll feel the benefit of that<br /><br />There’s no doubt about it, Roy is capable of playing at a higher level than League One but, at this stage of his career, the most important thing is that he is playing week in, week out. The reports on Roy are very positive already and I went to see him myself earlier in the season when he was excellent. He is still an excellent goalkeeper, he’s shown that with us, and now he’s back enjoying himself and playing with a smile on his face. It’s good for us that both of our other keepers, Alan Mannus and Michael McGovern, are playing regularly in the SPL but Roy is in a good frame of mind</p>

  <p><b>[Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill lauded Kyle Lafferty following the forward’s match-winning display against Hungary]</b> Kyle came up trumps, giving a big performance for the 90 minutes. Kyle knows how important he is to us. We’ve not had him available to us enough, but when you see him like tonight; focused and energised, he gives a lot to the team. And there were a lot of big performances throughout the team tonight. <b>[Steven]</b> Davis and <b>[Chris]</b> Baird were magnificent in the midfield and Conor McLaughlin was outstanding at right-back. I knew and believed that we were capable of coming here and getting a result. When you lose the goal and in the nature we did I feared the worst at that time. I didn’t think it was deserved. It happened at a time we lost Gareth McAuley who is obviously a big presence at set-pieces. I felt the only way we’d lose a goal was from a set-piece. But the reaction to that was most pleasing.<br /><br />It enhances my belief that we can compete in this group. It’s always difficult to not get carried away with one result, but that’s all it is. We have a home game against the Faroe Islands next so these three points are only valuable if we pick up three points against the Faroes. But it’s a great start, the players needed that boost and the players will have enjoyed the experience of being here. Hopefully we can carry this on throughout the campaign</p>

  <p><b>[Michael O’Neill hopes Paddy McCourt can repeat his last performance against Faroe Islands]</b> Paddy’s previous against them has to come into the thinking given the nature of the game we’re expecting. The Faroes will try to be hard to break down and a lot of strong teams haven’t found it easy against them recently. Paddy has the ability to unlock the door and he gives us different options. He’s unique in terms of what he brings to our squad. He hasn’t played a lot of minutes at Brighton but we’ve watched him and it’s a question of what we can get out of him.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United youngster Paddy McNair has been drafted into Northern Ireland’s squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Romania]</b> I’ve been hugely impressed with Paddy - he’s come into a difficult situation at Manchester United and there is a lot of media attention. The manager has come in and spent a lot of money so it is encouraging to see the likes of Paddy given a chance. He’s played in difficult circumstances, with the defence a bit makeshift at times and it’s difficult for a young player to come into that. But he’s acquitted himself very well, he’s around the Manchester United first team and I’m looking forward to having him in the squad.</p>

  <p><b>[Northern Ireland vs Hungary]</b> I think we’re guaranteed third anyway so that’s a good start. We know what’s at hand. The result in Budapest <b>[a 2-1 win for Northern Ireland]</b> is obviously in our favour as well. The players’ response all week has been superb. I’ve no doubt we’ll get a similar response on Monday night. Hopefully we get a similar result. We know the significance of three points. It’s a fantastic prize for the players, well deserved. They’ve won three of the four games away from home which is phenomenal in any campaign. It’s a great scenario to be playing for qualification in our home stadium. The pleasing aspect of it is we do have a little bit of a safety net there as well.<br /><br />We can go into that <b>[Hungary]</b> game and do everything possible to win that group. We’re top and I just think the players will respond. This <b>[Faroe Islands]</b> is the game that was going to be the nervous game. The next game, I think they’ll handle it. I look at the intensity of the team, right through the team, there wasn’t a player that didn’t perform <b>[against the Faroes]</b>. I just thought we were excellent. We just have to continue that. The effects of the game tonight and the fatigue element of it, I don’t think they will be a factor given what’s at stake</p>

  <p><b>[Proud Michael O’Neill switches focus to France]</b> I am very proud of what we have achieved, this is certainly the highest point of my career, either as a player or a manager. Now we can look forward to the tournament. We are not just going to go to France and enjoy it… we are going to go and try to make an impact. I genuinely believe, fitness and availability willing, we can go there with a real optimism. It is just an amazing feeling, what we have to look forward to, but this is about the players, to see their reaction is where I get the real buzz. We have come from an era where Northern Ireland players were criticised for not being available at certain times, but in this squad we have real togetherness and spirit. For those players who have been through campaign after campaign and been through loads of disappointments - and had a lot of criticism - this is their moment as much as it is mine.</p>

  <p><b>[Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill was in an upbeat mood despite seeing his side drawn against Germany, Poland and Ukraine in the Euro 2016 finals]</b> Both showed what they’re capable of qualification. In many ways it’s a good test for us, we have three Premier League centre-backs in our squad, it’s a good challenge to go against Muller and Lewandowski. There’s a lot of positives we take into this tournament, we’ve always done better against the bigger nations <b>[in his tenure]</b>, we go into this tournament with everything to gain. Having watched tournament football, the most important thing is to try and take something from your first game because then you’re up against it. The fixtures work in our favour because we have to play Poland and Ukraine before Germany. Come June we’ll definitely be ready to play. It’s a perfect opportunity for us. Everyone’s looking forward to it.</p>

  <p><b>[Northern Ireland vs Belarus]</b> I think Belarus will pose a greater counter-attacking threat than Estonia and that’s something we have to be wary of. The way we played on Thursday night, we had a lot of possession, and that will be the objective again. Overall it was a good performance - we showed patience when it was needed and we want to build on that. We take a lot of confidence from that game as our general play was of a high standard. We just need better quality in the final third and a better final ball</p>

  <p><b>[Belarus v Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland could keep their 100% Euro 2020 Qualifying record intact and stay atop Group C with a win over rock-bottom Belarus at the Borisov Arena]</b> It was a difficult game in Belfast <b>[against Belarus]</b>. I thought we had a lot of control of the game and then we gave away a slightly unfortunate goal after we had gone ahead and whilst we always felt that we could win the game we had to go virtually until the last few minutes to do it.<br /><br />As Estonia showed the other night, Belarus will look at this as a game they can potentially take points from and with that in mind I think it will be an extremely difficult match. Mentally we’re in a good place because we won the last game, the mental tiredness is not the same, so that should be the key factor for us. We’re looking forward to the game and we’ve everything to gain by trying to go out and get another three points.<br /><br /><b>[Northern Ireland are not so lucky, and the magnitude of taking maximum points from the first four games is not lost on O’Neill]</b> A win <b>[against Belarus]</b> means that all of the next four games have huge significance. It really means that you will go into the last two games, game seven and eight, with a chance of qualification regardless of what happens in between and that’s the significance</p>

  <p><b>[Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill has welcomed comparisons between Steven Davis and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> forward <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. The Rangers midfielder is set to earn his 113th international cap on Monday]</b> I think it’s a great achievement. He pestered me all week to get five minutes against Luxembourg, and I eventually wilted under the pressure. Last night I was watching <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> play at 34 years of age for his country and what it means to him, and that’s why international football is so special. Steven deserves to be talked about in that breath because I believe he will go on and break Pat Jennings’ record. Any player who amasses over a hundred caps at international level, that has played and been available for as long as Steven for every game barring a few that he’s missed through injury, is a fantastic role model for all international footballers. He is still as effective at this level as he was when I took the job seven years ago. He’s had a magnificent career at both club and international level. When he ever does hang up his boots, which hopefully will be after I’ve left this job, he will rightly be remembered as one of the greatest players we’ve ever had</p>

  <p><b>[Michael O’Neill on the supporters, <a href="james-mcclean.html">James McClean</a>, and the relegation situation. Q: How’s the blood pressure Michael?]</b> It was tested today, let’s just say. It was a great way to win a game, you wouldn’t want to be going through that every week. It’s days like today when you look back on the season and maybe say it was a bit of a turning point<br /><br />I thought we deserved to win the game, I don’t think there’s any doubt about that, but we put ourselves in a difficult position again which is something we have a little bit of a habit of doing. But the character of the players was immense and the atmosphere in the stadium was fantastic as well<br /><br /><b>[Q: You made two inspired substitutions?]</b> Yeah, you roll the dice at that time. We felt when we put Ty (Campbell) on he was the right option at that time<br /><br />Lee Gregory had put a huge amount of work in for the team and Ty is a great finisher and he’s shown that this week, particularly in training<br /><br />Sam Vokes was only passed fit this morning. He missed training yesterday and the day before because of an illness<br /><br />So great for him because when you come here with the big reputation Sam’s had, and people are expecting you to score goals, and maybe it just hasn’t gone as he’d have liked, every goal’s important and maybe that can build his confidence because he has a lot to offer<br /><br />The subs, it’s great when they work, but I thought today there was so many positives in the performance. Obviously Ryan (Shawcross) being back. <a href="james-mcclean.html">McClean</a>, again, I thought was magnificent. James, really, I had ruled him out after the Middlesbrough game, but James being James came in<br /><br />Some players at this time of year don’t mind having a niggle, but James made sure he did everything possible to be able to play and he showed that today<br /><br />Every time he stretched his hamstring I thought we were going to have to take him off, but again he goes the 90 minutes and epitomises all the good characteristics in the dressing room.<br /><br /><b>[Q: It’s Fulham away next?]</b> Yes. We’ve just played the third in the league and Fulham were in the top six, so it will be difficult and away from home. We have two away games now, can we pick points up? We’ll not be back here until January 11 and if we can add points to what we have now… then we have a massive game here against Millwall<br /><br />Today was important because without knowing too much about it, clearly over the last couple of seasons maybe the relationship between the team and the fans has not been great and we have to re-build that<br /><br />There’s a responsibility on us, the players and the staff, because the fans will play a massive part in the remaining 22 games this season and if you can send them away like today, then I know the benefit of that.<br /><br />It was a very similar situation with Northern Ireland and it took us a long time to win, but when we did and got that atmosphere in the stadium we felt we were capable of beating anyone and that’s something we want to re-create here because they’ve had that here in the past<br /><br /><b>[Q: You’re now out of the bottom three?]</b> Yes, but I haven’t focused much on the league table. I think it’s good psychologically for the players, but the main thing for me is to get that consistency, confidence and momentum into the team<br /><br />That nine games we’ve had, we’ve won four, we’ve lost four and drawn one, so that’s relatively decent form in the Championship. But the games we lost, on two or three occasions we could have possibly taken something from them<br /><br /><b>[Q: Any injuries heading to Fulham?]</b> I’m sure James will be fine. It’s going to take a lot to stop him playing. He crashed into a tackle there at the end as well and still managed to take the corner. Him and Sam Clucas have been our major worries. Sam Clucas has had to be nursed since I came in after injuring his foot in the Barnsley game and he’s still carrying that injury. You saw the incident with the penalty, it was on that injury. They are two very important players for us and we have to make sure they are fit because they’ve contributed an awful lot since I came in<br /><br /><b>[Q: James gets some hard treatment of away fans?]</b> James is pretty thick skinned, so there’s no concerns about that, and you want people in the trenches with you and he’s certainly one of those you want in the trenches with you</p>

I would have loved the opportunity to manage Northern Ireland in the Euro 2020 play-off game versus Bosnia-Herzegovina and the chance to qualify for another major tournament, but the current situation means that this is no longer possible. It was important to leave the association and team in the strongest possible shape in order to not only have the best chance of qualifying for Euro 2021, but allow the new manager time to build upon the success that we have had during my eight-year tenure<br /><br />It has been an honour and an enormous privilege to have had the opportunity to manage my country and I will treasure my time as manager of Northern Ireland forever. Throughout my time here, I have been fortunate to have worked with many great coaching, medical and support staff who have all contributed to our successes and shared in some great moments. As for my players, past and present, I would like to thank them all for an overwhelming level of commitment and professionalism that has helped to deliver so many unforgettable highs and great experiences for us all</p>
