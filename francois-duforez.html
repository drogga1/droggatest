<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Francois Duforez on when a player sleeps less than eight hours per 24 hours]</b> All the epidemiological studies show that when a player sleeps less than eight hours per 24 hours, he increases his risk of having a muscular injury by 1.7 per cent. A recent study of NBA players also showed that by sleeping an extra two hours each night, there was an improvement in their sprint speed, reaction time and even shooting accuracy by 9%.<br /><br />Chronic sleep restriction causes not only injuries, but also a fall in the immune system and mood swings. We also know that depression and a lack of sleep are linked, especially in winter for players of African or island origin<br /><br /><b>[The bright lights of the 20,000-capacity arena would have been a greater problem]</b> Light has an extraordinary impact on the biological clock. It’s the main synchroniser. Under floodlights, footballers play at an intensity of 10,000 lux. It’s enormous. The average office is 500 lux. The light intensity blocks the secretion of melatonin and prevents early sleep<br /><br /><b>[Duforez pointed to his own experiences with players battling an inability to fall asleep as another domestic danger]</b> They watch TV series because they can’t fall asleep, but these are like drugs. Some find a solution by watching a film they already know the ending of – Disney or stand-up comics especially. It allows them to relax without creating an addiction</p>
