I was 100 per cent sure. No doubt. But with the new system, it is special to buy a defender.

He’s easily the best central midfielder in the world. Easily. He would play in a World XI, no doubt. I know there are players like Casemiro, Sergio Busquets but he’s better than them.<br /><br />He knows the game, when to stay, when to run and how to run well. He reads it so well he knows what is going to happen before he gets there. That way he controls it with his incredible power and finesse.

You do what you do, managers do what they do but how didn’t any scouts see him?.<br /><br />Winning the title, it’s a virus. After you win it the next year something goes wrong for Mourinho, Ancelotti and Conte. It’s tough and when you’re champions everyone wants to kill you. For Chelsea it was a very strange summer, a mess inside the club. The Costa situation was tough and so was replacing him. The new players need time to adapt and prove themselves. Last year, with all respect to the squad players, the team was made. This year you make one team, I make one team, he makes one team, Conte makes another team. That consistency is why they won the league … not just of selection but formation and style of play</p>

In this zone there will be many bodies and it will be an interesting tactical battle. I am seeing these matches from the coach’s point of view now<br /><br />I see Chelsea as a destabilised team, they are struggling and this has happened too many times after winning the title. The next season things go wrong. It happened with <b>[Carlo]</b> Ancelotti, <b>[Jose]</b> Mourinho and now Conte.

  <p><b>[Poyet urges Chelsea to stick with Sarri amid Zidane rumours]</b> I think what Sarri set out to do at the start of the season was excellent. Most people in England were praising how the club were transitioning into a new system of playing. Chelsea were challenging the top teams at the start of the season but then obviously the opposition were able to analyse their new way of playing, and then it’s up to Chelsea to figure out how to counteract the opposition tactics. It’s true that it’s been more difficult for them recently, but we really put the emphasis on the negatives. For example, the final against Manchester City, everyone was talking about the Kepa <b>[Arrizabalaga]</b> situation and everyone forgot that Chelsea played a very, very good game. That was on the second page of the newspaper - the front page was Kepa. And that reflects on where football is today.<br /><br />It would be nice to see what many pundits were saying about <b>[Pep]</b> Guardiola two years ago. There’s no chance they’re going to play like that. There’s no chance you’re going to win the title. He thinks you can play the same as he did in Spain, you can’t do that in England. Then he wins the Premier League and everybody disappears<br /><br />If you look around now for who is the biggest manager without a club, it’s probably Zidane - he’s won the last three Champions Leagues. But I’d rather Sarri would stay to be honest. And, first and foremost, for him to be convinced that it’s the right club for him. We sometimes forget about the coach’s point of view. Sarri knows the players he has. It’s a big advantage - people don’t realise how important it is when you already know the players, you know their reactions, know their characters, how strong they are physically and mentally - it’s a big advantage over going through that process with a new manager who may not be able to sign new players. We don’t know if he will have the time but I want him to finish the season on a high and to have everything set up for next year to be able to be better</p>

  <p><b>[Gus Poyet says comparing Gareth Bale to Cristiano Ronaldo is unfair]</b> The main problem with Gareth is that he’s at Real Madrid and as soon as Cristiano Ronaldo left, people wanted him to be Ronaldo. He’s not the same, he’s Gareth Bale. We think somebody will need to step up and do the job of Cristiano Ronaldo - nobody in the world can do that! You can’t bring in someone similar to Ronaldo. It’s unfair on Bale. He’s the same person who scored in the Copa del Rey final, when he ran 60 yards to score the winner. He’s the same player who scored the overhead kick in the Champions League final. He’s the same person who has been there for his country. He’s Gareth Bale.<br /><br />It’s very important to adapt to where you are, who you are and who you’re working with. That’s natural. But we’re all different. He <b>[Bale]</b> obviously lives a quiet life alone and keeps himself to himself and his friends and family. When he was winning the Champions League, nobody was talking about it. Or when he scored in the Champions League final. He was the same person, doing the same things. You have to accept everyone who they are. The most important thing to remember for a manager is you are dealing with 25 characters. You have 25 different styles of life, 25 people who are completely different to each other, different problems at home, and you need to deal with all of them. If it was all the same it would be very boring and very easy. If you need Gareth to perform at his best then you need to accept him as he is and he needs to adapt a little bit - and I’m sure he he open to that</p>

  <p><b>[Gus Poyet calls for Van Dijk Player of the Year nomination]</b> I agree with a few pundits that he should be a big candidate as Premier League Player of the Year this year. We don’t usually like to name defenders but I think it’s a good time to put him in there. He’s been outstanding.<br /><br />I went to Groningen to watch him. We flew to Holland to watch a game and he was absolutely outstanding. It was so easy for him. It was after our first season in the Championship, he would have cost us €3 million and we couldn’t afford him. We had just moved to the Amex and we had a lot of expenses and it was not possible. We were very close. When he went to Celtic I wasn’t surprised. When he went to Southampton and then to Liverpool it was a bit of a shock but he always had the potential. After the day in Groningen - even after half an hour of watching him - me and my assistant, Mauricio Taricco, thought it would be incredible if we were able to sign him for Brighton<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether or not Van Dijk’s ascent has come as a shock]</b> I’m not surprised. When you see someone with that potential, when you see someone with that power, you know. The only problem is you don’t know him as a player, you don’t know him mentally. At the time, It’s impossible to know. We knew that if he was intelligent or a guy who wanted to improve then he will go to the top, no doubt, and he has! Dutch players are usually good on the ball, but he is an athlete - he’s very powerful, he’s good in the air and can deal with the strong players because of his strength. He’s got everything. He’s had the ideal career progression, too. Sometimes players go to a top team and they have to perform straight away. He’s had the right steps - from Celtic to Southampton - a nice progression of knowing the leagues and now he has a chance of being a Premier League winner. Those steps, I think, have helped him become the player he is today</p>

We went all the way up to Groningen to watch the game, and it was too easy for him. He was already incredible. After ten minutes you could see that he was bigger than everyone, more powerful than everyone and so calm on the ball. We watched the whole game and afterwards we talked to the chairman and we started getting in contact with the club and the agents, but he was too expensive for Brighton. He was €3million at that time! Brighton had just come into the Championship, although a year later we spent €3m on a striker, Leonardo Ulloa, but for a defender at that time it was impossible</p>

Obviously in our time, we didn’t have all these sponsors, Instagram, the clothing brands and other things, but now there are many things that can take you away from football. I was one of the ones who said two or three years ago that I would love him just to concentrate on football, because he can become one of the best ever at Tottenham. Another one is Paul Pogba.

  <p><b>[Gus Poyet is on the hunt for a new job and has given an insight into his life as a manager]</b> I had a phone call the other day from a club that was struggling and the guy started explaining to me the situation. Their coach was still there, it shouldn’t happen but it does happen. It feels awful to talk to someone when you know someone else is in a job but you know the same thing has happened to you in the past. You get sacked and 12 hours later there is a new coach. They explained: ‘we have a coach we respect him but we need to make another plan’. I ask them a question: ‘what’s your aim?’ Depending on the answer, I am interested in it or not. If the team is doing really bad and the aim should simply be survival and then he says ‘top 10’, I would say ‘no thanks’. I am not interested because that’s not realistic<br /><br />I try to measure the quality of the job by being realistic. When I see something that is not going in the same way that we discussed, then it is not going to work. 90 per cent of the time I kept quiet about these expectations in the job and it didn’t work. In Bordeaux, I decided to say it. Nothing else. I didn’t want to be problematic. People just usually don’t know what’s going on in the manager’s head. If you go and get sacked, you get a payout with a confidentiality clause not to talk. So now people will never know. I went to that press conference to say the truth. I had a few meetings with people from clubs in the last couple of years and they ask me the same question about Bordeaux. ‘What happened here?’ I say, ‘why?’ They point to the reports. I say ‘that’s not true’. I am looking for a chairman or president who I can work with. That’s more important than the name of the club. I think when we were young, I would look at the name and say ‘I want to play for this club’. Not anymore<br /><br />I think in France they weren’t used to a person like me. I accept that because I am this kind of person. It is easier to put something in the paper that is more negative than positive. When you open newspapers nowadays, the main news is bad. You see it in Brexit and football is becoming the same. We talk <b>[Mauricio]</b> <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>, <a href="marco-silva.html">Marco Silva</a> and <b>[Ole Gunnar]</b> <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> ahead of <b>[Jurgen]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> being brilliant or <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>’s great football. The good things don’t sell and it can be unfair and hard.<br /><br />In any job you should set up a goal and decide how you do it. It is then up to me to deliver. I am 51 but I look 70. If you don’t say the truth then no one will say it. At Brighton they wanted me to get up <b>[promoted]</b> because they were moving to the Amex Stadium. Up! I sat down with Sunderland. One point in the last seven games. They said ‘get us safe’. We did it. I went to AEK Athens. We were 17 points behind Olympiakos. The league was impossible but they wanted us to finish second and a goal was to stop them going unbeaten. We beat them 1-0 and finished second. I admit <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a> didn’t work for me. I take it. It was me and I didn’t do the right research. I can’t blame anyone. It didn’t work<br /><br />China is different and Bordeaux was an exception. People want to label you over the bad things. I am taking my time and I am not jumping into any job. My idea is to come back here to the UK<br /><br />I saw that other top teams like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> had important ex-players as either the manager or coaches around the team.

I met some of the board and chairman at the time. They were listening to me and I think they thought I wanted a coaching role. That wasn’t my idea. My idea was to see more ex-players around at Cobham. I am sure it wasn’t down to me but it was great that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> started bringing people back<br /><br />It was very strange for the time. We had an English goalkeeper, a Russian, Italians, Norwegians and Uruguay. Everything. We needed each other. We were away from home. Some of us were away from our families. We needed it. We had a leader in <a href="dennis-wise.html">Dennis Wise</a>, who was a strong character. The more the players grew up, the more they brought that strength of character. Look at <a href="marcel-desailly.html">Marcel Desailly</a>. The first time in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> history we played without an English player and I was the captain in the game against <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>.<br /><br />I remember going out and saying ‘what’s happening?’ They told me: ‘we are playing for the first time ever without any Englishmen’. The reaction of us was that ‘we must win’. We are going to get hammered if we don’t. We did win. That was a turning point for football in England. That togetherness and understanding of what we needed to do was very good, when the top teams began to have individual rooms in hotels.<br /><br />Me and Dan Petrescu preferred to stay together because that was our moment to hang out and talk about football. If you are on your own, you would have a day-and-a-half on your own. We were all very good friends and that made it much easier to play. I am still friends with Dan, <a href="roberto-di-matteo.html">Roberto Di Matteo</a>, <a href="gianfranco-zola.html">Gianfranco Zola</a> and <a href="carlo-cudicini.html">Carlo Cudicini</a>.

  <p><b>[Gus Poyet says <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> has all the qualities to become a leading light at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>]</b> He has the technique to finish, we all know that. We didn’t know if he could do it week in, week out in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. The defenders are better, they read the game better and taking chances is more important. I like his understanding of how and when to get into position. Can you coach that? No. It’s all about timing your moment. The ball goes one way and you have to guess where it will be. He always gets into those positions and it’s not easy. People need to understand that it isn’t luck.<br /><br />I like a lot of the youngsters. It’s easy to look at <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> because he’s scored so many goals, but I look at Mount because of the position he plays - a midfielder who arrives late and scores goals. He’s similar to Frank and me. Mount has the personality, despite being young, to be a very important player in midfield. He accepts responsibility, he listens to what’s needed and he’s a leader in the first press. He recovered a few balls, he’s scored a few and he won a penalty from pressing, too. He has the mentality that Frank wants, he goes and produces. People sometimes only look at goals but not at the first line of the press or the aggression or the understanding. I like the way he finds positions around the box as well<br /><br />I’m pleased for all of them that they’ve accepted the challenge. Opportunities like this haven’t happened at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for 15 years. We always had good players coming up - even <b>[Romelu]</b> <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> was playing in the reserves. I went to see him when he was 17 but <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> made it so that he had to leave to have a career. Most young players were coming in and then going out on loan. This group has the opportunity but it doesn’t mean they’ll make it. I hope they stay grounded</p>

  <p><b>[Gus Poyet says <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>’s young <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> squad only need one or two ‘specific’ signings to take them to the next level]</b> I think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s start has been very strong. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> knew the club inside out and he knew the youngsters from his time at Derby, either from having them on loan or playing against them. It gave him extra experience going into the job.<br /><br />If an outsider arrived in the summer they might have thought ‘there are too many youngsters’, but <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> knew what he was getting in to. Even after taking a big hit in losing to <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, he stayed calm, he kept playing them. He knew that the team was going to get better, but I’m also sure he knows what he is still missing. In the next few transfer windows, he’ll know exactly who he needs to buy. It won’t be five players, it’ll be something very specific.<br /><br />That’s what the club needs to aim for. When clubs go into the transfer market and buy too many - look at what’s being said about <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> - then there is something really wrong. If you need to buy five players, something is wrong. When you’re able to just make one or two changes then you can get exactly what you’re missing. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> knew what they were going to get <b>[with <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>]</b>.

You don’t always need to have an ex-player as a manager but it’s important for this current team. The transfer ban has led to a change of identity - that’s never happened before.<br /><br />It wouldn’t be as easy to explain this change to the fans without the core of ex-players around. They listen to their manager. The fans wouldn’t listen to anyone from the outside, they’d think they were making excuses. It was a great decision from the board to bring Frank back - especially with <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> for company.

The key for me was how in the summer he said: ‘maybe <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> needs another striker’. He knew you can’t only count on Suarez. He is very calm and a family man. He knows himself better than anyone. It was a matter of waiting and having <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> back. People forget that in the bad spell, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> wasn’t playing. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>… not me but <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>! So that special connection was gone. He makes space for him. If you watch the overhead-kick <b>[Suarez goal against <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>]</b>, it is extraordinary.<br /><br />If you see the other centre-half, he is looking at <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> on the edge of the box and gives space and freedom for Suarez.

Some say he plays golf all the time. I say he scored in the Champions League final or the Copa del Rey final. It is the same <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a>. How can you criticise <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> after what he did for this club? Unfortunately, we live in a very critical society. I was with Gareth when I went to Madrid to see them train. He seems happy in Madrid.<br /><br />I know the latest news was that he wanted to leave Madrid in the summer. I think that he was good enough to keep to himself when everyone, including <b>[Madrid boss <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine</a>]</b> <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, was saying he would leave in a matter of hours. He kept to himself. He got ready, he started the season and showed everyone he is <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>. It is a family decision <b>[not to go to China]</b>. Many people criticised Oscar or Hulk for being in Shanghai SIPG, being young, but we are all different. We cannot make opinions about other people’s lives and family futures.<br /><br />People say you have to wait until you are old to go to China. Why go now? But we don’t know what will happen in China in the next few years, maybe football will go bust. Sometimes an opportunity comes and you need to make a decision. Some have decided not to go, fair enough, in the same way, if you go you have to respect that.<br /><br />Gareth’s decision will be a family decision because he has his family with him in Madrid. People don’t understand that as well, it is easy to move when your kids are older like mine. I can go to any country in the world with my wife and leave my kids. When your kids are at school, you think very carefully about where you are going. It felt like an issue for me to change Zaragoza with London. Imagine going to a small Chinese city? If it was in Shanghai, I would tell Gareth to go. He would have international schools. There are many things you need to consider for these decisions<br /><br /><b>[Discussing how the Wales international was adamant he wanted to play at left-back]</b> <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> is a good man and I think he can be proud of his achievements. I worked with him when I was at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. He was a very offensive left-back and he always only wanted to play as a left-back. We asked him to play a little bit further forward but he said: ‘no, I need space to run’. A few years later, he played forward and he was amazing. Juande <b>[Ramos]</b> tried but <b>[Harry]</b> Redknapp pushed him on<br /><br />I saw him play for Leyton Orient and I remember he looked like he had a shot on him. With the right and left but it was difficult to see his class at that time. This was when I was at Brighton. There are people who have an eye for a player at 16, 17, 18 where they know that this is the one straight away. Some people can see something in a player. I saw Kane was good but I didn’t think he could become the best English player in every aspect. One of the best strikers anywhere. The confidence and position he has in his finishing is great. England and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> both need to win something for him to be remembered as a top, top player. The golden generation should’ve won something. It was bad that this squad didn’t win anything. Maybe we will think the same about this generation. Something was missing to make the final step with the last generation. They need to take that step this time</p>

These are the ones who proved they were good enough to play. They were given an extra bit of adrenaline.<br /><br />We know as experienced people in football that the energy will drop. It is impossible to maintain it, especially for a young player. Then, when the team had a bad spell that was expected rather than planned. You have to be realistic to know it will happen.<br /><br />Everyone started being too critical about the team. They are in a good place right now. In saying that, it is a normal season of good moments but then wake up call especially in the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Gus Poyet says Don’t blame <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> need an overhaul]</b> I think it is the end of an era, the end of a process. At certain places, you can manage the process in a way by slowly changing. <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> was the master of that. He was always one step ahead of allowing important players to leave and then replace them. There are other places where you hang onto a team until the end and then you feel like you have to change everything. I think <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> is in that place at the moment. This defends every manager in the world, not only <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>.<br /><br />When you have <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> and Son, you are one kind of manager than without them. On the training pitch, you remain the same guy, you train the same way, say the same words and try to convince the players in the same manner. Now, when you have a 20-plus goal striker you are better, when you don’t you are worse. People don’t accept that. If <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is there, the manager is good, when he isn’t the manager is bad. I think that’s very unfair.<br /><br />When you change the manager, something isn’t right. The problem is not always the manager but they change him because it is logical not to change 25 players. People expect him to do something magical and there is normally a change makes a reaction. The players normally like the change; then reality comes back on the players. It will be an important end of the season for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> but even more so in the market after. I think they have a plan. They had their finances and a clear plan under <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> to build a training ground and stadium, taking them to another level. Somehow they still did well without too many changes in their squad. The strategy took them to a higher level but now they need to focus on the sports side again. I wouldn’t be too critical. That’s football that you need to tweak it after a while</p>

  <p><b>[Former Sunderland manager Gus Poyet says there are only two things that matter to the club’s fans - avoiding relegation and beating rivals <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>]</b> When I went to Sunderland, the owners and the fans asked for two things: one, to stay up and two, beat <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. The rest, I swear to God, does not matter. Somehow we did the miracle - and it will be remembered as a miracle - to stay up. Six games to go we were seven points from safety and we were playing <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, so it was a miracle. In my time we played <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> three times and beat them three times, twice at <a href="newcastle-united.html">St James’ Park</a>. Then it depends how you analyse what success is. People say to me: ‘You had a tough time.’ Yes. ‘You got sacked because the team was bad and close to relegation.’ Yes. But what did you ask me to do? What was my goal? Save the team and beat <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. Without saying that we went to Wembley for the first time in 20 years, we lost the Carling Cup to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, but I think we did our job and I was easily accused of saying things that now people watching the series, they will think back: ‘Oh, Gus had a point.’<br /><br />The first series was very special, as it touched me a lot as I was there. It was my office, that was my life. I was there first thing in the morning and leaving the training ground at five or 6pm. I was one of the few, and I am not putting myself in a special place, who managed the club while living in the city. It was sad to see so many people I worked with that were still there and it was tough for me to watch. The second series shows a different side of the story of the new owners. They wanted to change things in a very strong, aggressive manner and certain things they were complaining had been done by people before, they ended up doing themselves. It just shows you that it is easy to talk about something you are not in and it shows what goes on behind the manager, letting people know how it isn’t his responsibility. At the end, though, it ends up being the manager’s responsibility</p>

  <p><b>[Gustavo Poyet thinks it was bizarre for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to make no January signings and then announce a deal for <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Hakim Ziyech</a> days later]</b> A very good player, very interesting player. I didn’t understand - and I’m not criticising anyone - why <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, after all that went on in the summer, not being able to sign players, get to January with the possibility of signing players, they didn’t, and then three days later, four days later, they announce they sign a player for next year. It’s not normal, okay?<br /><br />I’m not saying it’s bad, but I lost it a little bit because you complain a lot about not being able to buy, then you have the chance to buy and you don’t, and then when the transfer window is closed you announce that you bought one. Leaving that aside, I think they got the quality of a player the fans will enjoy watching. Plenty of skill, technically gifted, can score goals, and he can produce things for the team</p>

  <p><b>[Gustavo Poyet says Bringing <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> and <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> back to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> was the perfect decision to boost the club’s youth development]</b> You can get one player every year getting through into the first team <b>[from the academy]</b> but there was always someone coming from somewhere else. A player needed to perform tomorrow. There is a different way of working and I’m convinced there is no right or wrong. Every club, with different people in charge, has a different way of working. At <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, for many years, it was, ‘We want players to jump on the pitch and that day they will perform’ - because of the transfer ban, it was something that needed to be changed. This generation of young players have the chance for the first time in many, many, many, many years to take the opportunity of playing for the first team at a young age. The main thing was the big, strong and perfect decision of the club to bring <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> back and have the support of the fans. And his assistant, many people don’t talk about, <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a>, who has been the coach of these kids before he went to <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>. That connection of knowing the coach and having the fear as a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> player of having someone like <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> in front of you, and having the chance to prove that the kids are good enough to play for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, I think was perfect.<br /><br />They were trying to finish the season in a good way and finish in the Champions League <b>[places]</b>, which would be a great achievement. People take it for granted, because of your name. But like I said before, we depend on the players. We’ve got young players and normally to win trophies with young players is very, very difficult, not impossible, but more difficult than with players who are of a certain age. So, having the chance to be in European competition next year would be a massive achievement for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. These kids are going to be able to go to another level because the more you play against big, big opposition, the better you become. You’re out if you’re not good enough and you improve very quickly</p>

From outside, it looks like, okay, they were through a spectacular five years with <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>, who did incredible things and the way he made that team play football and the way he was able to keep the momentum and get into a Champions League final in an incredible year, with incredible games. But they decided to change that and go more for a manager <b>[<a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>]</b> who looks to win things, which is what the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> fans were looking for. Now, if it was right or wrong, time will tell. What I say in the time he did the job is, if you give him three years at the club, I will be surprised if he doesn’t win a trophy. I will be very surprised. Maybe he’s unlucky and next year we don’t have the League Cup and there will be one trophy less to play for, but he knows how to get players to play for important games. Cup competitions, on the day, it’s totally different. I was lucky in certain times to win trophies, but always in cup competitions. I was part of teams, like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, where we were very good on the day. ‘It’s today, or nothing tomorrow’. And that day, I was lucky to participate in teams that were able to win those games</p>

  <p><b>[Gus Poyet says <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> and <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> can definitely play together for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> They can definitely play together because he’s been playing, in his team, with the big fella upfront. So, it’s not new for him. It’s just a matter of the system you play and how you prefer to play. I think it’s options. For any manager to have different options is very important. I think Tammy has done very well and I hope he finishes the season in the same way because that’s the best way to give somebody a decision to make. You’ve done your best and then it’s down to <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> to pick<br /><br />It’s always very difficult to get one of the top strikers in Europe, especially if you’re the club buying, because there’s too many people who are trying to look for the same type of players. I’m pleased that he’s coming to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I’m pleased that he will give options to <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, especially in front of goal which is the most important and normally the most expensive one. He’s very good at running into space and quick. I’m not saying really fast, but he’s quick, pacy and he can go in <b>[behind]</b> one vs one. He’s intelligent. I think he enjoys it more when he plays as the main striker, but also he’s been playing at lot coming in off the left when you play three up front. I think there are good options for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> next season.<br /><br />This is the dream for the coach. Before you even start training for next season, you’ve got players through the door already. This is acting quickly and not letting anyone get involved and deciding which players are your first choice because that’s something that is very difficult in England. When you talk about big teams in England, like the top four and top five, most of the time when they’re looking for a specific player, that player can be the same one. Then he becomes very expensive or you start looking for other options because you don’t think you’re going to get him. In this case, there was no time for anyone as ‘Bang’ <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. <b>[They made the]</b> first decision and see you later. That’s something that is very welcome from the point of view of the staff and everyone around <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Gus Poyet says <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> is at the dream club to further his development]</b> I had the chance to know him the other day through a sponsored thing with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He loves the game. He’s got people in front of him that he can learn from. There are spectacular midfielders at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, people who have played at the highest level; players who have won the World Cup in <b>[N’Golo]</b> <a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kante</a>, and players who have played for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> in <b>[Mateo]</b> <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Kovacic</a>. So, there are plenty of things he can learn.<br /><br />On top of that he’s got a manager who was an outstanding midfielder - okay maybe a bit more offensive - but also an assistant manager who played in exactly the same position in <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a>. It’s like the dream club for Gilmour right now, because if he really looks around and pays attention and listens, which is what I see him doing, the ability is in him <b>[to go far]</b>. Depending on how quickly he gets all that, he’s going to be an important part of the club. I’m looking forward to seeing him play in the next few games. Obviously he’s fighting for that place with very good players and it’s not like he needs to be in, because the other ones are very well recognised players. But in this period of many games, for sure, he’s going to have a chance<br /><br />I think it was a great decision by the club <b>[to bring in <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>]</b>. I think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> were very clever in that situation to bring in a coach or manager like <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, because it seems different to the previous 20-25 years <b>[in terms]</b> of looking more about bringing the kids <b>[through]</b> rather than buying players. This was a great opportunity for them, with a person in charge who knows the club and who has been working with some of the younger players and with <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> as an assistant, who was coach of these players for many years in the academy. On the whole, I think the combination was very good. It’s been tough, because you know it’s going to be difficult. I’m sure if he keeps progressing and keeps adding, which <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> look like they are doing, I think he’s going to get better and better</p>
