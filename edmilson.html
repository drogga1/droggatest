  <p><b>[Edmilson believes Neymar can replace Lionel Messi as the undisputed star at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> Barca will be thinking about Messi’s retirement. He still has a few years left in him, but in three, four or five years, I think Neymar could very well take the place of Messi. Neymar is a great player, but he has to have a good mindset to play his football. He has had two average seasons combined with injuries and did not have a great World Cup. PSG did win the league but ultimately these are not Neymar’s best years<br /><br />Barca have a host of great players and they will have to decide who plays if they want to bring him back. They have brought in <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a>, <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Ousmane Dembele</a> is still there and so is <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a>. There are many attacking players in the middle as well such as Ivan Rakitic, Arthur Melo and <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Sergio Busquets</a>. He started well at PSG, he was fine. He was well surrounded with his dad. But after that, I do not know what happened… I think Neymar has a place everywhere. The fans are happy when he his playing well and scoring goals but the truth is that he is not always there. He remains a great player and we will need to see where he feels is best to continue to flourish because today Ney has lost a little bit of edge since Barca</p>

  <p><b>[Edmilson says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are approaching the end of a cycle]</b> Since the start of the season, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are having difficulty finding their way of playing, due to the pre-season they had and also to injuries. We are a little worried, but we know there is a lot of quality in this squad. Maybe it reminds me of the end of the cycle. A lot of young players have come in, there are others with a lot of experience, but it could be a change and that normally means a change in play, mentality, behaviour. That’s natural. It’s too soon to draw conclusions but if at the end of the season things haven’t gone well, decisions will be made<br /><br /><b>[Edmilson added, with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> having added academy graduates such as <a href="ansu-fati.html">Ansu Fati</a> to the senior ranks alongside summer signing <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a> and established stars such as <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and Luis Suarez]</b> Football is a collective sport. The youngsters must have confidence and the veterans, when things don’t go well, have to help. It’s difficult to say too much when you’re not there day-to-day, but what I read and see in the press, we expect a little more from this <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, who have given a lot of joy in the last 12 years.</p>
