  <p><b>[Former Brazil and Barcelona defender Edmilson believes Neymar is on course to reach the heights set by his club-mate Lionel Messi]</b> He is following the hierarchy, just like how Messi waited two or three years for Ronaldinho, who was at the time the best in the world.<br /><br />Perhaps Messi has more time to keep playing good football, but Neymar has had a few good seasons. He has been more decisive than in previous seasons. We believe and hope, as Brazilians, that he can carry the reputation of Brazil</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain represent a step lower for Neymar than what he was occupying at Barcelona]</b> It is very difficult when a person makes decisions. Neymar has gone to a club that have paid his clause. If there are people that will pay that value that exists in the clause … .for Barcelona it is also a good operation. But with all due respect, PSG have a great team, but they are still a step lower<br /><br />Philippe Coutinho is a great player. He has improved a lot and would be a good addition for Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[Ousmane Dembele needs to start taking advantage of the opportunities he has been given]</b> Dembele is a young player who is obviously still struggling to get used to the life of a real football professional. But I hope for him that he finally wakes up and takes advantage of the opportunities that life offers him. I think that also the club is required to help him. Sometimes, such behaviours have very personal reasons. Maybe the player has private problems. These problems can often only be solved by people who are close to him.<br /><br />For me it’s more a question of style of play. You can be as individual as you are: if you really want to be successful at Barca, you have to adapt to the style of play<br /><br />Let me give you a good example: Arthur, a young, inexperienced Brazilian in Europe, has only been in the club since this summer, but has settled in well. Why? Because he adapted very well to the style of play. He reminds me a bit of Xavi<br /><br />Barca is, of course, always one of the favourites in the Champions League, but this competition is very balanced. From the round of 16 it will be difficult for any big team</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho still has a future at Barcelona]</b> Coutinho is not having a good season. Mainly because of the good season of Ousmane Dembele. Dembele is fast and decisive and so, Coutinho has lost his position in the starting team match after match. He is currently not in a good shape so, when a player like him is not doing well, there are always transfer rumours. However, I think that he will stay for longer in Barcelona.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Edmilson does not believe that Memphis Depay is good enough to play for a club bigger than Lyon]</b> It is tough <b>[for Lyon to keep their best players]</b>! Today there are a lot of negotiations, transfers in football. Teams like Lyon, Lille and Marseille have a lot of quality players so it is normal that teams like Manchester, Barcelona and Real Madrid come to find these players. I think there are other great players at Lyon such as <b>[Tanguy]</b> Ndombele. For me, Memphis does not have the level today to play for a better team than Lyon<br /><br />Lyon when they were champions for seven years in a row, Jean-Michel Aulas did a great job of building a strong squad from 2000 to 2007 by recruiting and selling intelligently to allow the club to stay on the top and be well organised. Then PSG arrived with their partners, their money, their staff and they took the best players which is now the difference. Today, it is impossible for a club like Lyon to be compared with Paris Saint-Germain</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar should not be Brazil’s captain for the Copa America]</b> It’s a squad list where there are people with experience and who were already captains. In my opinion, this is not the ideal time to deliver the armband to Neymar, but the final decision is with Tite.<br /><br />The list has once again been the subject of debate, the diversity of players is good and we have several alternatives in each position. It is clear that Tite feels the pressure of having to win this Copa America at home, these have been chosen by the coach to get the title</p>

  <p><b>[Edmilson believes <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> can replace <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> as the undisputed star at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> will be thinking about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s retirement. He still has a few years left in him, but in three, four or five years, I think <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> could very well take the place of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is a great player, but he has to have a good mindset to play his football. He has had two average seasons combined with injuries and did not have a great World Cup. <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> did win the league but ultimately these are not <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s best years<br /><br /><a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> have a host of great players and they will have to decide who plays if they want to bring him back. They have brought in <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a>, <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Ousmane Dembele</a> is still there and so is <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a>. There are many attacking players in the middle as well such as <a href="ivan-rakitic.html">Ivan Rakitic</a>, <a href="arthur-melo.html">Arthur Melo</a> and <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Sergio Busquets</a>. He started well at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, he was fine. He was well surrounded with his dad. But after that, I do not know what happened… I think <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> has a place everywhere. The fans are happy when he his playing well and scoring goals but the truth is that he is not always there. He remains a great player and we will need to see where he feels is best to continue to flourish because today Ney has lost a little bit of edge since Barca</p>

  <p><b>[Edmilson says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are approaching the end of a cycle]</b> Since the start of the season, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are having difficulty finding their way of playing, due to the pre-season they had and also to injuries. We are a little worried, but we know there is a lot of quality in this squad. Maybe it reminds me of the end of the cycle. A lot of young players have come in, there are others with a lot of experience, but it could be a change and that normally means a change in play, mentality, behaviour. That’s natural. It’s too soon to draw conclusions but if at the end of the season things haven’t gone well, decisions will be made<br /><br /><b>[Edmilson added, with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> having added academy graduates such as <a href="ansu-fati.html">Ansu Fati</a> to the senior ranks alongside summer signing <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a> and established stars such as <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>]</b> Football is a collective sport. The youngsters must have confidence and the veterans, when things don’t go well, have to help. It’s difficult to say too much when you’re not there day-to-day, but what I read and see in the press, we expect a little more from this <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, who have given a lot of joy in the last 12 years.</p>
