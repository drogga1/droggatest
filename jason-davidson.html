<blockquote>
  <p>[Australian defender Jason Davidson was shown some rare mercy with his good character securing him a dream deal with West Bromwich Albion in 2014 his father Alan Davidson said] He had such a great time at West Brom, they spent three days introducing him to everyone, like all the back staff and the kitchen hand. So what happened was that we didn’t know, Jason spent the next day [after being told his move was off] just thanking everyone for what happened and one of the ladies in the kitchen went to the directors. She went there and said this kid typifies what football and this club is all about. He’s got such a great attitude it’s not fair that you haven’t signed him. So the director turned around and said you’re absolutely right. All these people had mentioned it and then they went around and found out Jason had went to pretty much everyone in the club and thanked them and wished them all the best. Even the players spoke highly of him. So the chairman turned around and said that’s what we want, we want players here that respect the club and appreciate what they’ve got. The coach was an advocate of that as well.<br /><br />So they rang him back and invited him back and said regarding your injury we think there’s two ways we can look at it but we’re gonna look at it the other way. It’s a long term injury that’s been there and never affected you. We’ve looked at all your games, you’ve played X amount of games last year. So that was it and they signed him<br /><br />[The moral of the story?] Image is important. The most important thing in any part of life it’s all about respect. That was one of the things that got him [Jason] over the line there</p>
