  <p><b>[Rangers receive favourable calls from referees in Scotland]</b> <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> have been suffering referee injustices against Rangers for 50 years. The big decisions have always gone against my club and in favour of Rangers. Nothing has changed. I felt that way as a player, during two spells as manager and now as a spectator. This season I’ve seen it in each of three derbies - and what happened at Ibrox on Sunday was as disappointing as any I’ve had to stomach. I believe that when it comes to players being red-carded and booked, Rangers have been more favourably treated than <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. Yes, we have been unfairly treated</p>

  <p><b>[Atletico’s approach to the tie, under the guidance of coach Juan Carlos Lorenzo, was simple and basic: gain a result in Glasgow, then win the home leg in Madrid. What no-one, even seasoned European campaigners like <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>’s inspirational captain Billy McNeill expected, was the lengths Atleti would go to achieve their goal]</b> Atletico were champions of Spain but they weren’t Real or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. They were Spain’s third team. We fancied our chances. Big Jock (Stein) had done his homework, as usual, and found out they had a South American manager who had filled his team with South Americans. We thought ‘well, they’ll be able to play a bit’. We’d played <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a>, we’d played <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a>. We had played teams who knew what that competition meant and had played their very best football to try and get to those finals. What we didn’t bank on was how little the Spaniards wanted to play in Glasgow. They just came out to stop us from playing: They just constantly fouled, breaking any flow to the game, which meant we couldn’t get any continuity to our game. It was stop-start for 90 minutes. What shocked us, everyone, were the lengths they would go just to stop us playing. It was just so crude, brutal at times. Our forwards took some punishment, and Jimmy Johnstone in particular was just massacred.<br /><br />How Jimmy survived it, I’m not sure. It wasn’t through anything the referee did, that’s for certain. But his job was impossible because of how clinical the Spaniards chose to be. They just kicked him in turn. They kicked him black and blue</p>
