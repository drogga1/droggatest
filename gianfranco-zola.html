  <p><b>[Gianfranco Zola has hit out at the betrayal of trust and lack of respect shown to him by his friend and former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team-mate <a href="eidur-gudjohnsen.html">Eidur Gudjohnsen</a> in snubbing <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> at the last moment for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> I feel twisted and turned and certainly a little bit bitter. I’m disappointed because we invested a lot in him and to find he is not coming to us any more. But our life doesn’t depend on <a href="eidur-gudjohnsen.html">Gudjohnsen</a> and we’ll get on with it. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> probably need a striker more than us, they think they need another one. But the player… I wasn’t expecting that. I’m more disappointed in the player because I was expecting something different<br /><br /><b>[When asked if <a href="eidur-gudjohnsen.html">Gudjohnsen</a> would still be his friend]</b> ‘s very difficult to say right now. I think you are taking advantage of my feelings and I don’t want to play that game. But I’m not going to hide my feelings. I feel disappointed and bitter and I won’t hide it from him. But my life goes on - and my life doesn’t depend on <a href="eidur-gudjohnsen.html">Gudjohnsen</a> and I’ll get on with it. They keep telling me that football is like that right now. I keep saying, when I am dealing with people, I always expect the people in front of me to behave in a certain way, with respect. OK, that wasn’t the case and we move on<br /><br /><b>[Despite McCarthy’s lack of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> action - only seven starts all campaign - Zola is convinced he can rouse the forward to a season-saving display for <a href="west-ham-united.html">the Hammers</a> and book his ticket to the World Cup]</b> It shouldn’t be a big problem. The quality is there, that’s what we are looking for. The rest is down to me and my staff to get the best out of him. I have no worries about that. He is determined to do well, to prove himself, and that is a great assurance for us<br /><br /><b>[<a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> manager <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Sam Allardyce</a> has been scathing about the player’s failure to turn up for training]</b> I understand Benni and Sam have different opinions. I don’t know the reasons and I don’t want to know. But I think I know <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> wanted to sell him - that’s the bottom line. If <a href="benni-mccarthy.html">Benni McCarthy</a> is leaving it is probably because he wasn’t playing there and didn’t feel appreciated. That’s probably the reason why he is leaving. It doesn’t mean I want to get involved in the row between the two. I will help him very much to get to the World Cup. We are going to give him the chance because if I help him, he will help us. He has the qualities to be a World Cup player and to give <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> a big boost. So we will co-operate with this<br /><br /><b>[Zola also revealed his regret at the departure of chief executive <a href="scott-duxbury.html">Scott Duxbury</a>, who brought the little Italian to Upton Park in September 2008]</b> We were expecting changes. I’m more sad than surprised. I’ll keep my commitment and do my best to get the team safe. That is my target and my priority</p>

In six months his contract is going to be up, and if we can help him with something we will try to do that – he deserves that.

  <p><b>[Chelsea are doing themselves few favours by using Eden Hazard as a false nine]</b> When Hazard plays deeper, it allows him to come off the pressure and run at players. It’s perfect for him. He is very similar to what I was as a player. If I had to be the main striker and stay around the box, it would limit my possibilities, my strength. While if I had more space to go around and look for the ball, my game was much better. I’m sure having a main striker will help Hazard’s game. We saw in the last two games that Chelsea were not as good in the last 20 metres<br /><br /><b>[On Antonio Conte]</b> People who ask if he is affected by all of this, they don’t know Antonio very well. I have known Antonio for years and in his career he has had tough moments, injuries, breakdowns and he has always came back fighting. Antonio doesn’t worry me. It is difficult for every manager, we live for results. When things don’t go well we suffer. But Antonio is a manager who has been through periods like this and come out of it very well. I’m sure he can cope. Antonio has shown during his spell in England that he deserves people to be patient with him. He deserves it for what he has done for this team<br /><br />Competition has grown and Chelsea are not as strong. They are not playing as well or scoring as many goals as they’re used to. They have had some injury problems recently - they miss Alvaro Morata a lot and Olivier Giroud has only just arrived. But Chelsea are still playing for the FA Cup, Champions League and they’re not far away from the top four in the Premier League. It can still end in a good way</p>

Besides, after Birmingham I’ve taken a year out.<br /><br /><b>[Zola, who spent four years with Napoli during his distinguished career, added]</b> Napoli play like clockwork. They have tactics and moves which you can do little to defend against. The way they play the ball around reminds me of Maradona and Careca and the Napoli of my playing days. I think this is the year for them to win the Scudetto. Napoli can win it this season, and they would deserve it.</p>

If the club and manager want to continue, and I think that will be good for the club, they should sort <b>[the problems]</b> out because the competition out there is so incredible.

  <p><b>[Gianfranco Zola is hoping Eden Hazard will stay at Chelsea next season on his way to becoming a Stamford Bridge legend]</b> It is a pleasure for whoever loves football to enjoy watching Hazard. I am very glad that he plays for Chelsea. I am glad he improved on my records and I hope he is going to double them up, triple them up and it is good to see somebody who plays football so well. For him, it is good and it gives continuation to the club and supporters. I really wish so <b>[that he can achieve my status]</b>. I have been liked for a long time and people appreciated not only what I gave on the pitch, but the fact that I spent such a long time at this club. For Eden, I think it is going to be the same. There will come a moment for him where he gets a lot of commendation for this. You are always very happy when you see his commitment and passion for the club that you play for, so I am very, very happy about that.<br /><br />To be honest, at the beginning I was a little bit afraid, considering my physical condition of a few weeks ago but now I am a little bit better. To be honest, I am much more relaxed and I am ready. It was a long time ago, since I played at Stamford Bridge. My last game was my testimonial. It will be a fantastic day because I remember everything. The crowd and the emotion of playing in front of them. Honestly, the whole stadium and supporters have been outstanding to me. I feel like I have done my bit like many others. We try to make this club a better club. I did my part but there were also many others. To be fair, all of them enjoyed being part of this club and they played a part in making this club what it is now</p>

  <p><b>[Gianfranco Zola is impressed with the appointment of Roberto Mancini as the Italy national team boss]</b> I think that the manager will be a first step to fill the gap that we need to fill. Italian football needs more than just to choose a good manager. They have to improve the production of young footballers, improve the quality of the footballers that we produce. It is a process that will take long than that. We will all be very disappointed and crying about not being at the World Cup. I think people don’t realise yet just how big it will feel to miss the World Cup. Without Italy, I have the feeling that it can be the year of Lionel Messi and Argentina.<br /><br />Of course, being associated to Napoli, I would have wanted them to win it and I think in a way they actually deserved to win it because they have been very, very good throughout the season. The competition from Juventus was very strong and they have managed to win it again. Still, Napoli represents a fantastic reality in Italian football and they made the tournament interesting, which is something that it hasn’t been for the last four or five years. They went very close and if you see the story of Napoli over the last three years, it has been a crescendo and I think hopefully next year that they can go one better</p>

  <p><b>[Gianfranco Zola has hailed special Gianluigi Buffon as the goalkeeper draws the curtain on a legendary career in Italy]</b> I played in the first game of his career. He’s been amazing. A fantastic goalkeeper. He goes down as one of the best goalkeepers in history, and rightly so. What I always liked about him was his personality. I still remember the first game he played. He was 17 years old and it was against Milan, who were top of the league at that time. And he played like he was 30 years old and everyone understood straight away that he was a player who was going to be special. And, so, a special one is stopping and I think he deserves a lot of credit because he has been fantastic in so many ways.<br /><br /><b>[when asked about the PSG offer]</b> It depends a lot on him. When you get to his age, it’s not only about how you feel physically, it’s also about how motivated you are. It is a very personal decision for him.<br /><br />I’m very happy. I’m very pleased because Parma is a club that has to be in Serie A, it deserves to be there. It’s a beautiful story</p>

Of course he’s the type of player that it can benefit him a lot because you have a lot of the ball, close to the opposition’s goal and in these conditions Eden can take a big advantage. I think he’s still not at his best. The more he plays in and understands the system, he’s going to be even more effective.<br /><br />I thought Hazard was one of the best players in Europe, but now I am changing my mind that he is the best</p>

He came back late, and the players were doing well. He will have his chances, and then it’s down to him to take his chances in the best way.<br /><br />I realise that sometimes you have to make tough decisions and football doesn’t wait for people. I don’t want to jump the gun but as things stand at this time, probably, yes <b>[I might have to leave in January]</b>.

  <p><b>[Gianfranco Zola is a much beloved figure at Stamford Bridge]</b> I was surprised when this opportunity came to me, I was very surprised. Considering my previous job with Birmingham, it was very painful for me. I could not believe it. This is a blessing for me. This is the best reason and why I am throwing everything I have got to make the best of this experience for Maurizio and the club. I haven’t honestly thought too much about it <b>[getting back into management]</b>. Right now, I am very happy to be the number two of Maurizio and in this club..<br /><br />I think It is an amazing experience for learning. If you go back to the start of my story, I started like crazy to go in my first experience in the Premier League with West Ham. It went well but I think I missed a lot of things in my experience in management, but I am catching up with this experience. I think I have seen very few coaches that when they work, they are so detailed and work so much like Maurizio does on the games and with everything he does. What you see on the pitch is the result of the huge work he does behind the scenes. It is a lot of work honestly, everyone, not only him, but everyone in his coaching staff works a lot. We don’t want to leave anything to coincidence so for me it has been quite an experience. The more you work, the more you find the energy to work and this is the most important thing. I came across him <b>[in the past]</b>. I didn’t see him coaching, I just spoke to him a few times in Italy. I had seen some of his work, I knew he was good but I didn’t expect him to be that good.<br /><br />I hope I am giving him good support. That’s the meaning of me being here. He could do his job without me. I think I know the league, I know the players in the Premier League, I know the club. I can give him support. I can give my knowledge to him and that’s what I am trying to do. I think it is working very well. I think he likes working with me as much as I like working with him. We are in a good way, although the road is still long but we are going in the right direction. Maurizio, until he got to Naples, he was only coaching small teams. Now he has an opportunity to coach a big team. This is going to be a big difference, in my opinion. If you analyse the games that Napoli has played in the last two years, in terms of wins and losses, you can see that those are very good numbers. In Italy, there’s a team such as Juventus which has been a very dominant team in the last few years so it is not easy for anyone to be ahead of them. Napoli has been a very very good competitor in the last few years and they have been unlucky not to win it. You have to pay credit to that. Of course, people only remember the winner but the work he has done there is remarkable<br /><br />Yes, it is different without a doubt. Nothing remains the same and that’s luckily so. Things they always evaluate. I think the club from 2003 <b>[when Zola left]</b> has evolved a lot and won a lot. I am pleased for that. Hopefully, I am here with Maurizio to help the club develop even more. I think there are big margins and we are looking forward to make it develop even more</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea have granted Frank Lampard the chance to play with his loanees Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori]</b> Good question. No, it’s not that. I can tell you it’s not that. It is because we believe at the end of the day is that Mason and Tomori are growing up as players. We believe that by playing against us it is an opportunity for them to grow up quicker. The more they play against Premier League teams the more experience they get and we can make better evaluations on them. It was a great opportunity to see them play in front of us and we took that opportunity. It’s important to see the two players playing to give us a good indication <b>[of their level]</b>. But in the future it does not mean we will keep doing that. There will be a lot at stake. It will be a game, from a technical, tactical and physical point of view, on a higher level than the ones they play in their own league. But there will also be a psychological component. They will have to play in front of a big crowd, the crowd of the team they belong to. It will give them a good test<br /><br /><b>[Zola admits that the silverware that Lampard won means that he is a bigger legend than himself]</b> I never thought about that before, honestly, but if I have to see the results and the trophies that Frank has achieved with Chelsea, there is no doubt he is the bigger legend. He has achieved so much with this club, personally and for the club. He deserves big credit for this. I’m very honest on this. I know that myself, like many others, we are very important for the club because we started a process of getting better, becoming a well established team in England and Europe. I know I have done very well like Dennis Wise, Roberto Di Matteo and many others. But Frank, for the club, has really made a big mark, a big impression, like John Terry. So he deserves the credit<br /><br /><b>[Zola says Lampard’s legacy as a legend will help him in coaching]</b> Obviously when someone has his name it is a big advantage and if you are ready you can go and do that, provided you have someone next to you in the beginning who can help. Having Jody <b>[Morris]</b> who has experience at youth teams is important. It will help you get your ideas across in a better way. You can understand if someone has the qualities and the attitude to become a coach. Like for example, <b>[Gus]</b> Poyet, <b>[Gianluca]</b> Vialli, <b>[Roberto]</b> Di Matteo, you could see they would be it if they wanted. It was early days. We change all the time but he had the right attributes</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata and Olivier Giroud are being backed to score a lot of goals for Chelsea]</b> You probably expect the main strikers to be the main scorers but sometimes that’s not the case, especially if you play differently. <b>[Maurizio]</b> Sarri asks the strikers to do a lot of work for the team, and even if they don’t score, they are very important for the team. I think they are learning about this. At the moment they are busy doing this and have less attention for scoring. But it will come. I’m 100 per cent it will come. Also they have a good attitude on the pitch and in the week. The strikers for Maurizio, they always score a lot of goals. Maybe not at the beginning, but in the end they score. That’s what I’m hoping is going to be the case here as well.<br /><br /><b>[On Ross Barkley]</b> He had a big injury that stopped him from playing at his best in the last few years. That’s something that has to be said. It’s been important for him the way we play because it’s making him a little bit more complete. We always knew he had ability - physical ability, technical ability. But to play the midfield position, he was lacking a little bit of tactical awareness and defensive awareness. He’s doing very well right now and it’s making him a better player. All these things, added to what he already had, is making him one of the best midfielders in the country</p>

He is 27, and hopefully he will stay long with us and become even bigger.<br /><br />The difference was the changes we made. When Pedro and Eden came on, they gave us an extra gear.

As soon as there is an opportunity he plays, sometimes from the beginning, sometimes he comes on. The manager is giving plenty of reasons for him to feel involved and wanted. There are not many 18-year-olds at top clubs in Europe who are playing as much as him. On top of that, he is a player that we appreciate and believe is growing up. He has a bright future in this club. Maurizio likes him, all of the coaching group likes him. You need to understand he is surrounded by top players and you have to work hard to be better than them. That’s what we want from him, to make sure he keeps improving because he can do better</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea assistant coach Gianfranco Zola says Eden Hazard is getting better every season]</b> He is a fantastic player, extremely good. He has unbelievable potential and it seems to me that he is getting better and better each season. It is a pleasure to be on the bench and see him playing for you, as he is one of those players who makes things happen. I am pleased he is going to be breaking the previous best stats records in the club, but I am not surprised as I see what he can do.<br /><br /><b>[Chelsea’s season has taken a turn for the worse as the pressure grows on coach Maurizio Sarri]</b> I try to give all my support to Maurizio, understand how he works, give the best I can, and to help him understand more about English football and the mentality of the people and the players. It has been an interesting season! I’m learning a lot from him because he is a very well-prepared manager with huge qualities. And I really hope he is learning something from me! And the organisation he gives to the team is something special.<br /><br />It is normal that when you lose a game like that <b>[against City]</b>, you are not going to be happy at all. I believe that game has taught us a lot, to do things better on and off the pitch. And you will see that the team is improving a lot, performing better and we are starting to play again like we did at the start of the season. But we need something more and I think the experience taught us that sometimes on the pitch we can do something different. And also us in how we understand the players better in difficult moments and how we deal with these problems better</p>
