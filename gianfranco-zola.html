  <p><b>[Gianfranco Zola has hit out at the betrayal of trust and lack of respect shown to him by his friend and former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team-mate <a href="eidur-gudjohnsen.html">Eidur Gudjohnsen</a> in snubbing <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> at the last moment for Tottenham]</b> I feel twisted and turned and certainly a little bit bitter. I’m disappointed because we invested a lot in him and to find he is not coming to us any more. But our life doesn’t depend on <a href="eidur-gudjohnsen.html">Gudjohnsen</a> and we’ll get on with it. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> probably need a striker more than us, they think they need another one. But the player… I wasn’t expecting that. I’m more disappointed in the player because I was expecting something different<br /><br /><b>[When asked if <a href="eidur-gudjohnsen.html">Gudjohnsen</a> would still be his friend]</b> ‘s very difficult to say right now. I think you are taking advantage of my feelings and I don’t want to play that game. But I’m not going to hide my feelings. I feel disappointed and bitter and I won’t hide it from him. But my life goes on - and my life doesn’t depend on <a href="eidur-gudjohnsen.html">Gudjohnsen</a> and I’ll get on with it. They keep telling me that football is like that right now. I keep saying, when I am dealing with people, I always expect the people in front of me to behave in a certain way, with respect. OK, that wasn’t the case and we move on<br /><br /><b>[Despite McCarthy’s lack of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> action - only seven starts all campaign - Zola is convinced he can rouse the forward to a season-saving display for the Hammers and book his ticket to the World Cup]</b> It shouldn’t be a big problem. The quality is there, that’s what we are looking for. The rest is down to me and my staff to get the best out of him. I have no worries about that. He is determined to do well, to prove himself, and that is a great assurance for us<br /><br /><b>[Blackburn manager <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Sam Allardyce</a> has been scathing about the player’s failure to turn up for training]</b> I understand Benni and Sam have different opinions. I don’t know the reasons and I don’t want to know. But I think I know <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> wanted to sell him - that’s the bottom line. If <a href="benni-mccarthy.html">Benni McCarthy</a> is leaving it is probably because he wasn’t playing there and didn’t feel appreciated. That’s probably the reason why he is leaving. It doesn’t mean I want to get involved in the row between the two. I will help him very much to get to the World Cup. We are going to give him the chance because if I help him, he will help us. He has the qualities to be a World Cup player and to give <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> a big boost. So we will co-operate with this<br /><br /><b>[Zola also revealed his regret at the departure of chief executive <a href="scott-duxbury.html">Scott Duxbury</a>, who brought the little Italian to Upton Park in September 2008]</b> We were expecting changes. I’m more sad than surprised. I’ll keep my commitment and do my best to get the team safe. That is my target and my priority</p>

  <p><b>[Gianfranco Zola believes that the unity of the dressing room during his time as a Chelsea player was the secret to their success]</b> I was interested in joining Chelsea because I was keen to play abroad. Playing in a different league, speaking in a different language and experiencing a different culture. That was something I really wanted to do. My first day with the club, the day that I signed for Chelsea <b>[was]</b> definitely a great day for me. I was with Ruud Gullit and we took pictures at Stamford Bridge. This was, in my opinion, the start of a fantastic adventure. We created a truly beautiful atmosphere between the foreign and English players. We had a very united changing room, which is what allowed us to achieve those results.<br /><br /><b>[Zola reminisced about his winning goal in the final of the 1998 Cup Winners’ Cup, where he came off the bench to decide a cagey affair against Stuttgart - his first European title with the London outfit]</b> The goal that I scored in the <b>[Cup Winners’ Cup]</b> final against Stuttgart <b>[was]</b> another very important day for me, especially because I wasn’t meant to play in the final, having suffered a pretty bad knee injury just three weeks prior. I really didn’t think I was going to play. So being able to make it, to enter the pitch and score was very important for me. This was a very important trophy for what was a great group of players. So I’m very happy about it</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola says Eden Hazard is an ‘incredible’ talent that deserves the opportunity to test himself at Real Madrid]</b> Madrid have bought a fantastic player. This year he was incredible. And as a person, that’s how he is too. Chelsea lost a key player and Madrid have gained one. I wish him all the best and that it goes as well at Madrid as it did at Chelsea. That’s what he deserves. It will go well. His ability doesn’t allow for any doubts. La Liga will be good for him. This year, he learned a lot and improved, learned to play more with the team, improved his passing. I think he’ll do well.<br /><br />Last year, he was very good for us and he participated in close to 40% of the goals. Not just scoring but assisting too. He was really good, his numbers were incredible too. Some leaders speak a lot in the dressing room, on the field and others do it with actions contributing important things in games, deciding big games. He is a great player for Real Madrid.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on what advice he would offer to Eden Hazard]</b> The best advice I can give is to keep doing what he has been doing. The rest will come. We had many debates about football and he always told me that he performs better when he is having fun, that his best arrives when he is enjoying himself. I hope he enjoys it at Madrid. If he does, the rest will happen naturally</p>

I was head coach before and my main ambition is to return to that. But to work for Maurizio and Chelsea was a great opportunity.<br /><br /><b>[Despite that, Zola insists that there is no bad blood between him and the Blues]</b> It has been a great year, there is no doubting that. Unfortunately, it was not to be. What matters is it was a great year and I have been part of a winning team. I want to take the opportunity to say thank you very much to the players, all the coaching staff and all the supporters and the club for the wonderful year we have had. Chelsea is in my heart and I was so proud to achieve so much for the club. The most important thing is I want to get on with my future. I would like to stay in England.

  <p><b>[Gianfranco Zola says Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku is an ideal signing for Antonio Conte’s Intermilan]</b> Lukaku would make a big impact at Inter, as he has the ideal characteristics for Conte’s football and has the kind of physicality from the Premier League that puts him a step above the rest in Serie A. Having said that, I believe the real strength at Inter will be Conte himself. He’s really fired up after the Chelsea experience and then taking a year off. He’ll want to transmit that determination to the squad. We know how good Antonio is at transmitting grit, intensity and sporting aggression. I am sure Inter will be one of the principle antagonists to Juventus this season<br /><br /><b>[He has also earned the public backing of Conte as a player the manager would like to have with him in Serie A]</b> He is a United player and for this reason we must show great respect for the club, for the player and also for my own players. Lukaku is a player that I like because I consider him a player that could improve our team. On one side is my will and my hope. On the other side we will see what we find with the club.</p>

  <p><b>[Gianfranco Zola has defended Chelsea’s decision to use N’Golo Kante in a more advanced role last season]</b> There are two reasons for that. The main reason is that in the way Sarri plays, the sitting midfielder, the number six, is the player that plays the most balls in the whole team. Normally Jorginho, when he was at Napoli and also last year, makes between 140 and 160 touches, sometimes even more. So he wants somebody that confident in getting the ball and playing it, not afraid to play and be influential in the game. That is the first reason<br /><br />The second reason is that Kante is not a sitting midfielder. Although he has always played in a midfield two, at Leicester and in his first two years at Chelsea, at Leicester he was playing with Danny Drinkwater, who was the sitting one and Kante was moving around. He was free to go sideways, backwards, whatever he wanted. And it was the same at Chelsea when Matic was the sitting one and Kante was doing the same job. We spoke with Kante about this and he was very happy to play the position because he liked the position</p>

He was pretending he was injured because he wanted to waste time. There was nothing really wrong but we then made some considerations. We knew we had Willy Caballero on the bench, who knew all of the Manchester City players and so it was an opportunity for us<br /><br />We were going to make the change. It wasn’t pre-arranged but we saw the day before he was injured, so we thought it was the injury coming back and we saw an opportunity because Caballero knows the Manchester City players so he can also be a good thing; simple as that. It was obviously not an easy situation to deal with. We could not believe it, we were speechless, we kept telling him to come off but he didn’t come<br /><br /><b>[Looking back, Zola admits the staff on the bench maybe could have done things differently, but insists it was a bizarre and new situation]</b> I mean, we could have dealt with it better probably, maybe the skipper could have gone to him and say ‘come to the touchline’ but in the end sometimes you have a situation like this</p>

It’s difficult because <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> has a strong personality, he works very hard and has a high opinion of his own ideas. It wasn’t easy convincing him to use different methods when he had to deal with English football<br /><br /><b>[He added of Sarri]</b> It was exceptional because of the way he planned out his work, the focus on details in preparing for games and careful study of the opposition. All that represented an enormous learning curve for me. I tried to help him and his Italian staff to relate to and deal with the English culture, so that was my role. When he left, he didn’t thank anyone in particular, but that’s just what <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>’s like. He is a very reserved man</p>

When <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> was in Naples, I’m sure that he was one of those Argentines who stood in front of the television to see his idol, the best player in the world at that time.

He has good reflexes and is very strong, he has a great physique for the goal. Although, in my opinion, there are two areas in which he should improve.<br /><br />The first, when a defender goes out to clear, he must be more forceful and offer greater security. The second is his character, he has to be stronger mentally. But it is normal, it is his second year in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, his second year in a team like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> that has many ambitions and demands a lot from the goalkeepers. I appreciate Kepa very much. I think this year he is receiving more shots than last season and that is affecting him. For me, he is one of the best goalkeepers of this moment<br /><br />There was a lot of confusion. We were in the final minutes of the game and he tried to waste time. Then he threw himself to the ground. We wanted to make the change. He was injured and we were approaching penalties. On the bench was <a href="wilfredo-caballero.html">Willy Caballero</a>, who is very good in those situations, and knew all the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> players of his time there. He did not understand, there was a great misunderstanding. We were also pressured because we wasted time. What he did was not good, but he apologised and did not go any further.

I’ll be honest, they were brilliant because they got bored, but they kept doing it throughout and that was the reason why when everyone was dropping we were going up towards the end<br /><br />At the beginning, the players were very much behind everything that we were saying, they were brilliant. They were following everything, but then as the weeks passed due to the repetition and the amount of games they were playing, the players got tired and they also got bored in a way. But boring is part of our job. Sometimes you need to get bored but when you get bored you persist in what you’re doing and you get better. I remember that when I was learning to play football, kicking a ball for example, I used to do it 300-400 times a day at least. There were moments when I got tired but I needed to do it repeatedly because if I wanted it to become a part of me, this was the process I needed to go through.</p>
