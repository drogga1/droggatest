  <p><b>[When asked why he thinks he should be the first player taken in Friday’s draft]</b> You should take me because I can play multiple positions and I’ll always give 100 percent. You’ll always see my work rate and doing even more. Especially now that I’ll be on a higher level. I’ll be in a professional environment. I’ll definitely get better, and I’ll push myself even more. I’m a two-way player, I can play defense and offense and that helps me a lot.</p>

  <p><b>[Frankie Amaya continues rapid rise by becoming first overall pick in 2019 MLS draft]</b> It was the longest four minutes of my life.<br /><br /><b>[Amaya admits beating Mexico in the Concacaf U-20 final helped instill a new level of confidence in him]</b> That game meant the world to me honestly because I wasn’t really the best player on that team. I worked really hard during the camp to earn my spot and I just want to thank Tab for giving me the chance to showcase my skills on a team with mostly pros.<br /><br />A final you always have to play your best game. My family is Mexican-American so it gave me a little more motivation. They were all wearing U.S. shirts back home and I didn’t want to let them down. Especially with Thanksgiving coming up. I didn’t want to go home a loser<br /><br />A lot of people think that I can’t play defense but I’m just a work machine. People are more talented than me, but I don’t think anyone on the field is going to work harder than me, offensively and defensively. I like to get in tackles and stuff like that even though I’m a small player. I like to challenge every ball<br /><br /><b>[Ramos gave Amaya that opportunity in November]</b> I’m not going to lie, I didn’t see this coming. I worked hard my whole life. I knew something would happen, but I didn’t know all this would happen so fast. It’s all hard work, and now I just want to start playing. Being a pro is something I’ve always dreamed about and I’m ready to give it my all</p>
