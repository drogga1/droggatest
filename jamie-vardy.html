  <p><b>[Jamie Vardy has refused to get drawn into the Riyad Mahrez transfer saga as Leicester prepare to deal with more bids this summer]</b> I think it’s happened in the last four transfer windows, so we just get on with it. What happens will happen, we’ll have to wait and see, obviously, until the transfer window.<br /><br /><b>[Vardy has also dismissed rumours that the Leicester squad are unhappy with boss Claude Puel’s leadership]</b> There is no truth in that at all. If you look at us in training every day, and in the games, you can see the players are trying to implement exactly what the manager wants us to do. So, all I can say about that is no truth whatsoever. You can tell he is thoughtful about his football but, behind the scenes, on the training field he is telling you exactly what he wants you to be doing, what we should be doing and every so often he gets involved as well with a few saucy challenges</p>

Going into the new season, it’s an exciting time for Leicester City and I’m delighted to be part of it.</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie Vardy has not shut the door completely on his England career]</b> To be honest with you, this has been on my mind for a while. I’m not getting any younger and you can see, to be fair to the gaffer <b>[Gareth Southgate]</b>, he wants to make it more youthful, which obviously had its benefits during the World Cup - we got to the semi-finals and finished fourth, which is equal to the furthest we have ever been on foreign soil. So I just said to Gareth that I think it’s probably best from now on, especially with the way he wants to go, to bring youngsters in who he thinks have got the ability and start nurturing them into international football.<br /><br />Yeah, I think that had an impact. When you get selected, you want to be playing. If you’re playing week in, week out for your club, you want to be going to England to play as well. And if it’s not happening, then for me personally now, at this age, it’s better to be at home, spending that time with my family and training with my club, preparing for the next game after the international break<br /><br />I explained it all to Gareth and he was fine with my decision. I mentioned it to him after the World Cup had finished, out in Russia, and then I spoke to him on the phone a couple of weeks ago. He let it die down a bit, so that I could have a bit more time to think, and then rang me up just to make sure I wasn’t just taking the mickey in Russia. But I hadn’t changed my mind. Gareth said that he felt I still had a lot to offer, and we’ve not shut the door completely. If the worst came to happen and everyone was injured, then obviously I wouldn’t say no</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie Vardy says former <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> team-mate <a href="n-golo-kante.html">N’Golo Kante</a> was a pleasure to play alongside]</b> What a pleasure it was to play alongside N’Golo! He is an adorable guy alongside being a fantastic footballer: when we lost the ball, wherever that happened on the pitch, boom, he would appear and win it back for us. In training, it was so easy for him that I was convinced that he intentionally gave the ball away sometimes just to enjoy winning it back again. One day he said to us that he was seriously considering running to the training centre each day, which came from the fact that he would always add a little running session for himself. In the moment, we were all a bit taken aback and convinced him not to. In any case, each time that we saw him arrive at training with his Mini Cooper, we were reassured<br /><br /><b>[And <a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kante</a> used the opportunity to catch up some old team-mates, including Vardy]</b> Last month, after our match at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>, he came to say hello to us in the dressing room. The first thing that I asked him was: ‘Are you still driving your Mini Cooper, mate?’ He said to me that he had sent the model that he had at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> back to France but that he had bought a new Mini Cooper in the meantime!</p>

I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for. If you thought that this was happening you could have told me &amp; I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my insta &amp; just this week I found I was following people I didn’t know and have never followed myself.

  <p><b>[Vardy keeps door open to England return for Euro 2020 following <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> &amp; <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> injuries]</b> Who knows? Gareth and I were both agreed that the door would still be open for whatever reason and then we would sit down and have a talk about it <b>[if needed]</b>. We’ve not had the chat or anything yet and nothing has been spoken about. The lads (Kane and Rashford) are out injured, but they’re looking to be back in time. So only time will tell. I’m not going to lie, I’ve had a few extra days off in the international breaks so I’ve been able to switch off completely from football and it is always beneficial sometimes. Knowing that when you get back it’s constant again, it’s 100 per cent football every day so it’s one of those things that has benefited me<br /><br />It’s been a great start but you don’t want to be that team that has a great start and all of a sudden you’re not up there. We’ve got to keep working hard to try and pick up as many points as we can in these last 10 games. If anything, the inconsistency shows you that things are changing. Look at the squad we’ve got, we’re more than capable of beating anyone on the day and other teams up there like <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> have been playing really well. They deserve to be up there. It’s the consistency that they’re putting in week in, week out. That’s where we’ve got to get back to, that consistency that we had in the first half of the season and hopefully that will keep us up there</p>
