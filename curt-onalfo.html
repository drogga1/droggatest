  <p><b>[The LA Galaxy announced the signing of USA international Jermaine Jones on Wednesday]</b> Jermaine is a winner who has experience in MLS and playing against the highest competition in the world. He has a relentless engine on the field and we are confident that he will strengthen our midfield. We look forward to him joining the Galaxy as we prepare for the upcoming season.</p>

  <p><b>[Onalfo confident he can lead LA Galaxy to success in post-Arena era]</b> I’m here for a reason. Those experiences in MLS were a long time ago. I’m 10 times the coach I was then. We all grow and evolve. I remember showing up in Kansas City thinking that I know everything. When you’re a young coach that’s how you think, but then you learn it’s a process and it takes time.<br /><br />I don’t think about it at all, I really don’t. I don’t mind it because I love Bruce. He’s a legend, and it’s great to be associated with him. I’ve been associated with <b>[Arena]</b> forever, but we’re not the same people. My team will play a little differently than his teams, but having said that, there’s things that I’ve learned from him<br /><br />If you look at what is penciled in as our starting group, it’s a strong team. Having said that, we all know in MLS or any league in the world you have to have depth to be successful and I believe we have that<br /><br />We have Jack McBean, Ariel Lassiter and Jose Villarreal that provide depth. Those guys have scored a lot of goals at the Galaxy II level. Can that translate to MLS? I believe it can<br /><br />In D.C. I thought I had three years to do something great and that wasn’t the case. I learned that sometimes you don’t have as much time as you think. I think anybody that achieves anything great has had to deal with adversity. I think that gives me confidence going into <b>[the Galaxy job]</b>, and also gives me drive and motivation to make the most of this because of how those past experiences happened. That drives me<br /><br />Maybe I was a little too forgiving, and maybe too patient back then. I’m less patient now. I know what I want, and how I want to play and what I want to do<br /><br />Winning games is hard work, and this is one of the biggest clubs in the league, if not the biggest. But I’m very optimistic. I believe we have a very good team, and I’m ready to get started</p>

  <p><b>[LA Galaxy avoid disastrous start with vital road win]</b> It took strength of character to get back in it. I thought we showed grit and we pressed and did an excellent job of exploiting the extra player. Credit to the guys for the great effort and more importantly, being intelligent about how we played tactically and got the point.<br /><br />{on Romain Alessandrini]&lt;/b&gt; He’s going to get better and better. He hasn’t been with us a month. That’s another thing for the people on the outside that’s hard to see because we haven’t had our full group the entire time. It takes time to get to know each other. He’s going to only get better. He wears his heart on his sleeve, he tries stuff, and he makes plays. He did well and he only is going to get better and was frankly unlucky not to get a goal</p>

  <p><b>[The Galaxy looked lifeless and uninspired despite having a lineup featuring the likes of Giovani dos Santos, Gyasi Zardes, Jermaine Jones and Romain Alessandrini]</b> Dismal, terrible first half. Better second half, but not good enough.</p>
