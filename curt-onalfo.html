  <p>[The LA Galaxy announced the signing of USA international Jermaine Jones on Wednesday] Jermaine is a winner who has experience in MLS and playing against the highest competition in the world. He has a relentless engine on the field and we are confident that he will strengthen our midfield. We look forward to him joining the Galaxy as we prepare for the upcoming season.</p>

  <p>[Onalfo confident he can lead LA Galaxy to success in post-Arena era] I’m here for a reason. Those experiences in MLS were a long time ago. I’m 10 times the coach I was then. We all grow and evolve. I remember showing up in Kansas City thinking that I know everything. When you’re a young coach that’s how you think, but then you learn it’s a process and it takes time.<br /><br />I don’t think about it at all, I really don’t. I don’t mind it because I love Bruce. He’s a legend, and it’s great to be associated with him. I’ve been associated with [Arena] forever, but we’re not the same people. My team will play a little differently than his teams, but having said that, there’s things that I’ve learned from him<br /><br />If you look at what is penciled in as our starting group, it’s a strong team. Having said that, we all know in MLS or any league in the world you have to have depth to be successful and I believe we have that<br /><br />We have Jack McBean, Ariel Lassiter and Jose Villarreal that provide depth. Those guys have scored a lot of goals at the Galaxy II level. Can that translate to MLS? I believe it can<br /><br />In D.C. I thought I had three years to do something great and that wasn’t the case. I learned that sometimes you don’t have as much time as you think. I think anybody that achieves anything great has had to deal with adversity. I think that gives me confidence going into [the Galaxy job], and also gives me drive and motivation to make the most of this because of how those past experiences happened. That drives me<br /><br />Maybe I was a little too forgiving, and maybe too patient back then. I’m less patient now. I know what I want, and how I want to play and what I want to do<br /><br />Winning games is hard work, and this is one of the biggest clubs in the league, if not the biggest. But I’m very optimistic. I believe we have a very good team, and I’m ready to get started</p>
