  <p><b>[Former Wellington Phoenix coach Ernie Merrick declared]</b> I just don’t know why we bother with a salary cap, I think we’ve grown up, it’s been 10 years now, let’s just get on with it.</p>

  <p><b>[Ernie Merrick has made his first signing as Newcastle Jets coach, bringing New Zealand international goalkeeper Glen Moss across from his former club Wellington Phoenix]</b> I have coached Glen at two clubs - Melbourne Victory and Wellington Phoenix - and have found him to be the consummate professional. Glen is extremely capable both technically and physically, and he is a first class character. He brings a wealth of A-League and international experience to the Jets and we are very fortunate to have his signature.</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle Jets have secured the signature of Dimitri Petratos for the second time in six months]</b> Dimi’ is an attacking midfielder who is confident on the ball, can retain possession and play key forward passes to strikers. I hope to add to his game and encourage him to push more often into goal scoring areas. Dimi is an exciting player and a terrific signing for the Jets<br /><br />Newcastle is the only current team in the A-League that I haven’t scored against. Now that I have come here I kind of feel like it is my home. Now I won’t be able to score against the Jets, only for them. I’m looking forward to meeting the boys officially and to be in the team with them. I’ll work hard and play my part in the team, but two things I know I am here for are to assist and score goals</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle Jets coach Ernie Merrick explained that Topor-Stanley’s knowledge of the Jets is an advantage]</b> We need to strengthen the squad and add experience, and Nikolai fits the job description 100 per cent. He is a skilful and uncompromising defender who will provide on-field leadership. The fact that Nikolai has played previously for the club is another bonus. He knows what to expect and what is needed at the Jets in order for us to make the finals</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle Jets sign Venezuelan international Ronald Vargas]</b> To have a player of Ronald’s quality and experience join the club is massive for us. He’s an exciting, international player with experience in some of the finest leagues in the world and his inclusion goes a long way to completing our squad.<br /><br />Ronald will offer a great deal to our play in the front third and is the perfect fit for our team. I’m looking forward to seeing how he can combine with the likes of Dimi Petratos, Roy O’Donovan and Andrew Nabbout to create goal-scoring opportunities.<br /><br />We’ve said all along that we would wait for the right player and that has paid dividends for us, we’ve now got a player who I feel, can take the game by the scruff of the neck with his skill at the set piece and in general play</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Ronald Vargas]</b> He’s got that vast experience in that front third; that’s the excitement area, that’s where goals are scored. He not only scores goals, but creates goals … he’s really a typical No.10 but can play wide on the right side as well.<br /><br /><b>[On Joe Champness]</b> As a player, he’s got fantastic attacking ability, speed, creativity and a knack for finding himself in goal scoring opportunities</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Central Coast thrashing shows Merrick finally has the Newcastle Jets ticking]</b> It was an outstanding performance. Roy O’Donovan is a veteran of intense football where there is pressure on and he loves .<br /><br />On reflection of the game, I don’t think a 5-1 is really a fair reflection of the performance.<br /><br />We’re not going to get carried away with it. It’s a good start, a good performance</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[FFA chief executive David Gallop has previously said an Australian coach would be preferable, and Newcastle Jets coach Ernie Merrick backed his call on Monday]</b> The Socceroos job should go to an Australian coach. Graham Arnold or Tony Popovic would be the front two. The idea of going overseas again, I just don’t understand that. Those two know the players, they know the sporting culture, and I’d love to see one of those two given the job.</p>
