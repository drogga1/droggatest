  <p><b>[Edinho on his position inside team]</b> I am going through a good phase and in really good condition. If i didnt have a chance of being in the team then tele would not have called me. He has reminded me of my merits and i will make it a difficult decision for him to leave me out. I can also play at left back if needed as i have done before. I want a place in the squad and i want to play in uruguay. I will devote myself entirely.</p>

  <p><b>[Edinho claims <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> too depressed to leave his house]</b> He’s very fragile in relation to mobility. He had a hip replacement and didn’t have ideal or adequate rehabilitation. He has this mobility problem and that has set off a kind of depression. Imagine, he’s the King, he was always such an imposing figure and today he can’t walk properly. It improved a little compared to that recent time when he was in a wheelchair, but he still has a lot of difficulty walking<br /><br />He’s embarrassed, he doesn’t want to go out, be seen, or do practically anything that involves leaving the house. He is very shy, reclusive</p>
