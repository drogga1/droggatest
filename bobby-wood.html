  <p><b>[Bobby Wood started playing soccer at 9 years old, he had no clue people played the sport professionally]</b> I had no idea what the World Cup was. Seriously. No clue. I was nine years old and had only been playing soccer for a couple of years in Hawaii, and I was sitting around a TV with my rec team, watching the 2002 World Cup, and I had just one thought: ‘What the heck is going on?’<br /><br />Listen, I was a beach kid who kind of got thrown into all of this. Which is why - when I was 10 years old and sitting in the living room of my buddy’s house - his mother had to explain to me what the World Cup was. I just couldn’t wrap my head around it. It was probably one of the first times I’d ever actually seen soccer on the TV.<br /><br />Soccer was still just something fun. I saw the move as an adventure. But once I got to California and started playing for a club in Irvine, something just … changed. Soccer became more than just a hobby, or something that I was sort of good at. It became competitive. And all of a sudden, that part of it - that part of me - just took over. I didn’t just want to play for fun anymore. I wanted to be the best<br /><br /><b>[He bought winter clothes for the first time, and went on to train with 1860 Munich]</b> I’ll never forget arriving in Munich and really seeing snow for the first time. I’d seen flakes here and there when we visited my grandparents in Japan, but this was on a different level<br /><br />It also didn’t help that on my first day of practice, I was dressed like a n00b. My big, red jacket looked pretty ridiculous. I had my snow boots on. And I couldn’t speak the language. It just made me feel that much more … well … lonely<br /><br />My contract was running out, and I hadn’t made it to the first team yet. Honestly, I didn’t know what my future was going to be in soccer at all. I thought I was going to have to to quit and go home<br /><br /><b>[He signed his first pro contract in Germany]</b> The moment I signed it, I just thought, ‘You’re really making it.’ After being there for so long - through injuries, through loneliness - I was just really proud of myself. To play in the Bundesliga … you can’t really describe it. Walking onto the pitch in front of thousands of screaming fans every weekend - it’s unlike anything I ever could have imagined. I think back to that day when I was 10 and watching the World Cup with my friends … everyone in their kits, faces painted, just pouring their hearts out. I didn’t understand it at the time. I didn’t understand what this sport means to people. Or, really, what it could mean to me</p>

  <p><b>[Bobby Wood continued his summer of commitment this weekend as he signed a new contract with Hamburg]</b> Bobby is a modern, young striker, who has mastered the leap from the second to the first Bundesliga in the last season, without great difficulties adapting. For us, not only his goals, but also his enormous running and operational readiness count. Bobby is a key player for our offense and a real team-player. We are delighted that he wants to continue his development with us and has extended his contract.</p>

  <p><b>[Hannover 96 has confirmed the arrival of American forward Bobby Wood from Hamburg on a season-long loan with a purchase option]</b> I had very good conversations with the coach and I know what the club want to achieve, what kind of football they want to play and what my role can be. This is the perfect move for me. Hannover played some exciting football last season and I’m confident my style fits with how the team plays.</p>
