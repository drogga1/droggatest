  <p><b>[Emmanuel Eboue’s move to Northern Cypriot team Türk Ocağı Limasol is on hold after abnormal blood values were found during his medical]</b> There are times when I stay in my bedroom and don’t come out. One, two days in that room. Alone. I lock the door and am just thinking. I spend a lot of my time reading the Bible and will say, ‘Emmanuel, why are you doing that? It’s no good for your family.<br /><br />My son Mathis is seven and plays for Arsenal’s academy. Every time I go there with him people ask me what’s going on and it makes it worse. ‘Emmanuel, have you retired?’ So I have to explain my situation. It makes me more depressed</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal defender Emmanuel Eboue has revealed that his 10-year-old son decided to join Arsenal over London rivals Chelsea]</b> <b>[Mathis]</b> plays for Arsenal, I think he signed last year. I’m happy, happy to see him play and enjoy football. And also because he likes Arsenal. Because he had two choices, Chelsea and Arsenal. I didn’t tell him anything, I said: ‘Mathis it’s up to you. It doesn’t matter where, I want you to be happy’. And he said to me: ‘Daddy I want to play for Arsenal. I like Arsenal and you used to play here too, the people they love you, so I want to play here’.<br /><br />I said, ‘okay no problem’. So he’s there now, he is happy. And I wish him the best. Firstly it’s about education and school, then, after, football. But he’s happy, really happy. I haven’t spoken to him <b>[Wenger]</b> about my son, but he knows. He knows about Mathis. I heard that he said to the academy manager, talking about Mathis, that the way he plays is like Gilberto Silva. So I’m happy, very happy. The first thing after he signed for Arsenal, all the younger players went to eat in front of Wenger. And he was so happy when he came back home, to have seen him. So as I’ve said, I wish him the best.<br /><br />This boy, he said: ‘Daddy you will see, I’ll be better than you’. And I told him that I wish that. I hope that he will be better than me. But I’m very happy when I watch him play. He’s a fighter and he is very fast also. So I’m happy to see him play and I think he is also very happy to be playing <b>[too]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Emmanuel Eboue pay tribute to departing manager Arsene Wenger]</b> I saw this morning in the news that, at the end of the season, Wenger will leave Arsenal. It’s very difficult to hear that. When you used to play for Arsenal, an ex-player, and you know Wenger did a lot of good things for you. He took me in like his son. When you hear that kind of news it is very sad to hear that.<br /><br />I think it’s a big mistake for Wenger to leave the club. It’s going to be hard, sad and difficult for the club because he’s been there for over 20 years. I understand the fans because they want to win trophies. It’s normal for the fans to get upset about this because he didn’t bring a lot of trophies for the club since a long time ago.<br /><br />It’s good to win but it’s also good to help the team and to finish in the same position every season. The club play good football even if they don’t win any trophies so if another manager comes, will they have the same style as Wenger? I don’t think so because Wenger is a very intelligent manager. Because of him Arsenal doesn’t have any problem in reaching the finals as we’ve seen with the FA Cup.<br /><br />Life is like that sometimes. Sometimes you’re in a good way, sometimes you’re in bad way. I support Arsene Wenger. I wish him to win the Europa League for the fans and secondly I wish him happy health. I hope before the end of the season Wenger will win the Europa League for Arsenal. I support him, I play for him, I played for Arsenal and God bless Arsenal</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure had to get out of Manchester City because Pep Guardiola was killing his career as a footballer]</b> As a player, there is a time you completely cannot work with a coach and because of your future, you must go. It was evident Pep Guardiola did not like my brother Yaya right from the Barcelona days. It is the best decision for Yaya to get away from Guardiola’s territory because he was killing his career as a footballer. I think Yaya’s last one year has been hell because he was not playing enough. For a professional footballer that is very terrible.<br /><br />Sometimes it’s not all about the money. When your relationship as a player is not good with the manager and it does not seem like it will improve, it is always better to move elsewhere. Yaya is a great player and leader and I think he still has some years to continue playing at the highest level. He is the kind of player who can turn things round and he always wants to win</p>
