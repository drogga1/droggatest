  <p><b>[Wolves attacker Diogo Jota has claimed <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>’s £80 million transfer to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is hard to explain]</b> It (the £80m fee) is hard to explain. The market is unreal now in my opinion. But it’s nothing to do with me, it is to do with the clubs and it is the moment we are living in. We just have to respect that amount. I think <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> has a lot of quality but I know the players that we have in our team and I trust them.<br /><br /><b>[Despite Wolves’s good record against <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a>, the former <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> man believes the visitors will pose a difficult challenge on Monday night]</b> It’s a new season. <b>[Ole Gunnar]</b> <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> has had more time to work with his players - he’s made his own changes. In the transfer market they’ve tried to improve their team so we know it’s going to be very hard for us. We have to understand that we will face a very big team<br /><br /><b>[Jota was more cautious in his assessment of Wolves’s aims over the coming nine months]</b> I think it is too soon about the final classification. We got seventh place, it’s true, but it is very hard to get it again. We have loads of teams that spend more money than us, trying to achieve that position. So we have to realise it’s not going to be easy to get seventh. We go game by game and in the end we will see</p>

  <p><b>[Diogo Jota says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> owe <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> a lot already]</b> I don’t know if he is the best <b>[player at United]</b> but he’s the most ambitious. And that makes a difference. You can clearly see the difference between United with and without <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a>. He takes on the responsibility and aspires for more than what they are doing. I think they owe him a lot already. And that is not only related to his quality, but also to his ambition and personality</p>

  <p><b>[Wolves forward Diogo Jota believes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> should be awarded <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title should the season be cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak]</b> This question is very complicated. In case we have the misfortune of not being able to end the season, I think that few people would oppose this. Of course, there are always rival clubs that could be against that, but I think 95 per cent of the people would agree. For me they would be fair champions. Even though we lost both games, we were a small step away from doing something different in both games, but this year, in addition to having a very fluid style of play, they are very strong and have had a bit of luck as well, which it takes to be a champion.</p>

  <p><b>[Diogo Jota has won the inaugural ePremier League title after guiding <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> to victory over <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>’s <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> thanks to a golden goal]</b> Congratulations to Trent, he’s a good player, and congratulations to <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> - we won. Trent is a very good player and that’s why the final was so tight. I reached the final third quite often, but he was always guessing what I was going to do before I shot, so it was a very tough game. This is the best way to finish the tournament. It can be unfair, but in this case it wasn’t because I did play very well in the second match. It was a tight game and it could have gone either way, but I was closer to winning by the Golden Goal</p>

  <p><b>[Diogo Jota says it is of major importance to world football that <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> season is completed]</b> I believe <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> can finish. We don’t need to look to other countries. Each country has its own problems and has to deal with them individually. Although some leagues can end right away, others can start sooner. I know almost every country in the world has <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> as one of the leagues to watch, so it is major that we can finish the season<br /><br />Maybe we need to go step by step and the first step is to play behind closed doors</p>

  <p><b>[Raul Jimenez ‘happy’ at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> despite transfer speculation]</b> I think he is happy here. I think everyone is and if we are happy we always play better. After the season is finished I think everyone can think about their own careers, but until then we’ll go as a team thinking to do our best in each game<br /><br />I think he’s an unbelievable player. We signed him when we came to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and, <b>[although]</b> not from the beginning, I started to create a good relationship with him, not just on the pitch but off the pitch as well and that’s helped me, him and the team. To have a player like Raul who is a finisher and decides matches is really important to us and he’s in a good moment now<br /><br /><b>[Jota insists qualification for Europe’s top club competition is not on their mind despite]</b> No, that’s not our target <b>[Champions League qualification]</b>. It’s obviously good to be as high as possible in the table but we compete game-by-game. The target is to win every match that we play and the next one is on Saturday so our target is to win Saturday’s match<br /><br /><b>[Asked how much confidence <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> have at the moment]</b> A lot. I think after the restart we haven’t conceded and we’ve created chances after our goals. I think at the moment we are strong; the pandemic didn’t create a big impact on us so I think we just need to keep on going and Saturday we go again against Arsenal</p>
