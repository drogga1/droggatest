  <p>When you win the World Cup, you start to become a legend – for the people around the world, you are different. I’m very proud because, all my life, I worked very hard to be a football player. I was not like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> – with a lot of qualities, with a lot of skills<br /><br />My parents every day said, ‘Ah, it’s better you go to school, it’s very important for your future’. But inside myself, I said: ‘I think the good way is follow the football’<br /><br /><b>[The sight of over 150,000 ecstatic Italians in the Circus Maximus stadium – and many more partying outside]</b> For us it was something unbelievable – more than 2 million people on the streets. We understood we did something – Wow! We understood we are world champs. Now we are not just normal players<br /><br /><b>[Five days after the celebrations, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, Cannavaro’s club at the time, was booted from the Italian top division for its role in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>’s Calciopoli match fixing scandal, and he was soon on his way out]</b> My team was unbelievable. I remember I was with <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>, Alessandro del Piero, <a href="david-trezeguet.html">David Trezeguet</a>, <a href="lilian-thuram.html">Lilian Thuram</a>, <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gianluigi Buffon</a> – nine players we had for this team (played in) the World Cup final. But Calciopoli destroyed everything. In the end… we decided to move. Some players decided to stay there but I went to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> with <a href="fabio-capello.html">Fabio Capello</a>, the coach<br /><br /><b>[Cannavaro started to pick up individual awards too. He became only the third defender to win the Ballon d’Or. He says the new recognition of his talents was overwhelming]</b> I remember every week, some guys called me and said: ‘Ah you need to come to Paris, you need to come to Madrid, you need to receive the trophy…’. <b>[When, the same year, he took home the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Player of the Year title, an emphatic haul was complete]</b> When I won both, everybody was ‘OK, he’s the best!’ so I was very happy for the second trophy<br /><br /><b>[Early in his career, he took to the field with his older brother at <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a>]</b> When I started to play in 1993 with my team, I was shocked because I was a <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> supporter: I grew up all my life with a <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> jersey like my second skin and, for me, to be near to these players was unbelievable. I was like, ‘What am I doing here?’<br /><br />It was very different situation because I remember, in the field during the game, I want help him, I want to be near to him, I don’t want him to make a mistake<br /><br /><b>[Despite not reaching the same heights as his brother on the world stage, Paolo succeeded in one area where Fabio failed: making a successful return to <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, who he led to a Coppa Italia victory in 2012]</b> So now my mother has two pictures: my brother with the Coppa Italia, and me with the World Cup – it’s very funny. She’s very proud<br /><br /><b>[A famous story recalls young Cannavaro training as a youngster opposite <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>’s greatest hero, <a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a>, and delivering a crunching tackle]</b> <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>, I think, is not a football player but he’s something different. He was unbelievable<br /><br /><b>[Moving to Al Ahli first as a player on a free transfer after the 2010 World Cup, then joining the coaching staff the following year after knee injuries forced his retirement]</b> When I came here, the team was very, very bad. Now after three years with my president, we changed the team. <b>[reflecting on a 2014 season that has seen the club take UAE’s Arabian Gulf League, Super Cup and League Cup honors]</b> We are very proud of the job we did<br /><br /><b>[His contract with Al Ahli ends in June and the future is, as yet, undecided – although he has recently stated his ambition to return to Italy once he has earned his <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> coaching badges]</b> Now I’m a coach so I want to be head coach. I think I’m ready to be, to go around the world and share my experience with the players<br /><br /><b>[Italy, the nation with the second best haul of World Cup trophies, can never be ignored as it seeks a fifth crown]</b> We have the good team, good coach and – of course – we are the Italian national team, we can try to win again the World Cup. It is not easy because never in the World Cup history has a European team won the World Cup in South America. And inshallah, like we say in Dubai, we can win</p>

  <p><b>[Fabio Cannavaro has set his sights on replacing Antonio Conte as Italy head coach after Euro 2016]</b> I would love to become the national team coach. I am aware that it is a tough job, but I spent 15 years with Italy. In my opinion, I have the right experience for this role and I know the environment very well too.<br /><br />When a former player remains in the game and gets told he doesn’t have experience I don’t understand it, but that’s football. Pep Guardiola wasn’t told that he needed experience, but if it had gone badly at Barcelona that is what they would have said</p>

No further discussion was necessary. The truth is we had more frequent contact with Aubameyang. Unfortunately, our bid was rejected by Borussia Dortmund who said he was needed in this season’s Champions League. Our prime target is still Kalinic but it’s quite difficult for his club to let him leave at the moment. Under such circumstances, we are caught in a dilemma. I need to communicate with our managing director.</p>

  <p><b>[Cannavaro eyes coaching role in Europe after Chinese Super League success with <a href="guangzhou-evergrande.html">Guangzhou Evergrande</a>]</b> Coaching in Italy? I’m working towards that. I’m doing my apprenticeship. I won the second division in China, I brought a team to promotion and then to the Champions League. Now I can fight to win something. It’s a fantastic experience. The Chinese game is a different kind of football, where there isn’t as much intensity or technique as in Europe, but in the Champions League you play against strong teams.

  <p><b>[Coronavirus: Cannavaro pens heartfelt message to all Italians]</b> Everyone Back Home, What is happening to our country right now is filling me with anxiety and pain. I cannot describe how horrible it feels to see Italy suffer like this, to see so many lives lost each day. My heart goes out to all the people who have been affected, and especially to those who have lost someone they are close to.<br /><br />I also want to salute the medical workers who are working hard to save as many lives as possible. You are the true heroes that our country needs right now.<br /><br />Sadly, though, the reality is that none of us is Superman. None of us is immune to this virus. And yet when this epidemic broke out in China, I felt as if we Italians thought we were going to be O.K. As if we were all thinking, Well, at least it won’t affect me.<br /><br />I certainly underestimated it. At first, I thought it was just a flu. How wrong we were. At least we have shut the country down and ordered people to stay at home. Here in China, where I have been coaching <a href="guangzhou-evergrande.html">Guangzhou Evergrande</a>, I went into quarantine a few weeks ago. People here had already dealt with SARS, so they knew what to do. In Italy we have never had an emergency like this. But now that we are in the middle of this battle, we must fight it together. And that means bringing out the best versions of ourselves<br /><br />Of course, we all know Italy is an amazing country. We have stunning coastlines and a scenic countryside. We have a climate that allows us to spend a lot of time outdoors. We have fashion, we have food. But life in Italy is so good that sometimes we tend to rest on our laurels. Sometimes we look after our own things instead of thinking about the common good. And when we do that, we are wasting our potential.<br /><br />Fortunately, however, there are also moments when we really decide to show our pride - and those moments tend to be when the going gets tough. When there is something important at stake.<br /><br />I have experienced this many times, and the best examples that come to my mind are when Italy have played in World Cups. Perhaps that seems a weird thing to bring up at a time when sports seem more trivial than ever. But as we all know, football is more than just a sport in Italy. When the national team plays, everyone feels a part of it. Everyone comes together. And when Italians come together, we tend to do well.<br /><br />I can still remember watching Italy win the 1982 World Cup. I was just an eight-year-old kid in Naples, my hometown, watching the games with a bunch of people in the houses of relatives and friends. I can recall that when Italy scored, we would shout and hug, even though we did not all know each other.<br /><br />When I was captain of the national team at the 2006 World Cup, I saw something similar happen with the players. The Calciopoli scandal broke out just before the tournament began, so when we met up to prepare, we were all on edge. A lot of people thought that the scandal was going to distract us. But the mood in the camp was always good, and that was the key. In such a critical moment, we did not just look after ourselves. We cared about everyone. We also had a great leader in <a href="marcello-lippi.html">Marcello Lippi</a>, who kept up the harmony and motivation in the group. As soon as we landed in Germany, we had practically forgotten about the scandal, and we couldn’t wait to play.<br /><br />People often ask me why Italy won that World Cup. We didn’t win it because we were lucky. We won it because we had the best team - and because we believed we would win it.<br /><br />Right now we need that same spirit of unbreakable unity as a country. Already we have seen some great examples of solidarity. The phrase andrà tutto bene - everything will be all right - is a message of support to those who are trapped at home, to those who are scared, lonely or depressed. People have stepped out onto their balconies to applaud our medical workers. Neighbours have sung songs together. This is the kind of unity we need.<br /><br />When this crisis is over, Italy will be different. Many will have lost jobs. Some will have lost businesses. There will be an awful lot of hard work to do. We can only hope that a vaccine will become available as soon as possible, so that we can put an end to this nightmare once and for all.<br /><br />Until then, we just have to dig in. So let’s stay at home and spend time with our families, and let’s try to have direct contact with as few people as possible.<br /><br />And let’s also try to do what we can for the common good. For my part I have started a fundraiser along with my 2006 World Cup team-mates. The proceeds will go to the Italian Red Cross and will be used to supply hospitals in Italy with whatever they need to beat the virus. I hope you will join me in making a donation.<br /><br />And if you can’t, a simple act for your neighbour can go a long way, too. We must all remember that this battle is a team effort, and that we need everyone to join in. Sure, it is true that none of us is Superman. But when we stand together, we can achieve anything. Stay strong, my brothers and sisters</p>

They kicked him a lot but he was always in control and he was tough. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is top but <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> is another world. I never compare him with other players. I never saw <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> but I watched <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>, for seven years I saw every game. He’s not one of the best, he’s the best<br /><br /><a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> need players like <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>, a young star who could follow in the footsteps of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. It’s normal that Madrid want to sign him but it also has to be taken into account that <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>’s owners don’t need the money. They are ambitious and they want to win the Champions League. I think it will be difficult for Madrid to get him. The president of <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> is a person who wants to win, I know them well and they will fight tooth and nail to keep Mbappe</p>

  <p><b>[Fabio Cannavaro believes <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> need <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> so that he can follow in <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s footsteps]</b> <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> need players like <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>, a young star who could follow in the footsteps of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>.

Which league would I advise him to play in? When I was in France, I loved watching him play and I was happy to be able to see it first hand. When I went to England, I would have liked to have seen him play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. And if I return to Spain, I hope he comes to <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>. I’m sure there will be some things about being at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> that will give him what he needs and maybe other things that won’t. And perhaps <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> might be able to offer him some of the things that he is lacking at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. We are lucky to have two of the best teams in the world - <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, and I personally would like them to continue having the best players in the world</p>
