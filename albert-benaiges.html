  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s Youth coordinator Albert Benaiges immediately after learning <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, of all teams, were set to offer Seung Ho Paik a trial]</b> We were amazed with the talent in that team, but above all with Paik. Paik was very small but he already played brilliantly</p>

  <p><b>[The story of Messi’s first days at Barcelona]</b> We had to hurry, because if he didn’t play in those two matches, he wouldn’t have been able to play in a national category until he reached the age of 18.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[How Maradona helped Messi become the world’s best free-kick taker]</b> It was something we did not practice. At Barcelona, we used to occasionally do free-kick drills with a wall. We would give the odd bit of advice, but it was not a part of the game we worked on particularly hard<br /><br />While Messi took free-kicks differently when he came to Barca compared to now, it isn’t something we taught him at La Masia. It is a natural feature of his ability which he has been working on alone. His experience has served him well</p>
