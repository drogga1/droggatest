  <p><b>[Mark Robins scored to give the Red Devils a 1-0 win]</b> Nobody will ever know <b>[what might have happened]</b> and I am pleased it never came to that and he was able to fulfil his destiny. He has made an outstanding contribution to football and to United. To have lost him there and for him not to go on to fulfil what he has done and achieved would have been a tragedy.</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Robins says <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> needs to be afforded the same kind of patience that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> gave to <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>]</b> I think what he’s trying to do is re-instil the values that he felt as a player and were there under Sir Alex. I think he needs time to do that. If you remember back to when Sir Alex took over, it was six years before that started to take an effect. I don’t think you get that time these days but I think the board will be patient. As long as they can see things moving forward in the right way, I think they will be patient. But clearly you need to get results alongside that. Ole knows that. But the noises coming out of there, you look at what’s being said, and they seem happy - the players seem happy and it seems a happier camp.<br /><br />But things can turn quickly and you need to get those results to maintain it. I hope he gets that time and he gets the backing in the transfer market because it’s going to take a lot of time to get them back to where they were. The other thing is, there is a danger of trying to chase the teams that are above you, and there are a few teams above them. But certainly with the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Manchester Citys, you just have to get on and plan with what you’re doing at your club. Hopefully he will get the time to achieve his goals</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Robins says <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> may need as many as 10 transfer windows to make <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> competitive again]</b> I’d love to see Ole get the time to be able to build, because he is not doing it in one window; he’s going to need six, seven, eight, nine … 10 windows! You don’t get that time generally. Ultimately what he is doing is trying to implement the processes Sir Alex had in place prior to his retirement. I think that is a huge ask. Remember Sir Alex went years prior to winning his first trophy and that will be very, very difficult to replicate because of the modern-day pressures. Having said that, if things are moving in the right direction then he will get some time. I also think Ole is a character that’s not putting himself front and centre; he’s putting his club front and centre. So he will be part of a process moving forward to make United successful again, and I don’t think he makes any qualms about that. I think that is something to be applauded and respected</p>
