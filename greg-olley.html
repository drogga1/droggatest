<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Greg Olley’s life and his football career stood at a crossroads as he sat in his car outside St James’s Park]</b> I was so proud to represent the club that I had supported from such a young age. I had taken myself back from being a <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> supporter a little bit because when you are in there, it becomes like a job.<br /><br />You want someone to get injured or suspended, you want the team to lose form, because that’s the only way you will get your chance. You fall out of love a little bit, not with the football club, I wanted to be playing so it’s a shift in how you look at football.<br /><br />It was tough, and I didn’t really feel I was ever close to getting in the first team. I was told to meet them at St James, and you knew what was coming. I got told that it was a 50/50 whether to give me a pro deal and they decided against it.<br /><br />I didn’t take it great, I didn’t have a go, I bottled it up as I walked away, but it all came out when I got in the car, I sat on my own, drove back to my digs and got very emotional. It was a case of ‘oh s**t, the safety net has gone, what do I do now?</p>
