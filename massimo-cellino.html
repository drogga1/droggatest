  <p><b>[Brescia president Massimo Cellino has found himself in the headlines once again after controversially referring to <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a>’s rocky situation at the club as black]</b> I demand great intensity and a high tempo in my training sessions. When that doesn’t happen, I prefer to change and make the session tougher. He didn’t do that and was set to one side. At a certain point, he has to help himself<br /><br />What do you want me to say about him. He’s black. He’s working to lighten up but he’s having difficulty. We can’t think that one player alone will save the squad. That would be wrong for the team<br /><br /><b>[To potentially make matters worse regarding the spirit around the club as a whole, Cellino also called out coach Grosso for not handling the situation as well as he could have]</b> The coach was wrong because he only spoke about <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a> and not the team. I bought him because I felt that he could add value; instead he is becoming a point of weakness for overexposure in the media. He must respond on the field and not on social media, but he isn’t the scapegoat for the difficulties the team finds itself dealing with</p>

  <p><b>[Massimo Cellino says when asked about update of <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a> who was racially abused during a game against Hellas Veronas]</b> What should I tell you about him? He is black, but he is working to clear himself but is having many difficulties. In football there are teams that fight and win, if we think that a player on his own can win matches, we would be offending the team. Otherwise, we would play one against eleven<br /><br />I signed him at the end of the window, not to sell tickets, but because he could be of real value. But it’s now become a point of weakness because of the overexposure. If we keep talking about him, it’ll only hurt us and him</p>

For him to play in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> is a big sacrifice, maybe he thought it was simpler. In January he is free to go away for free. Right now he has to choose the road up or down. He has to convince himself. I don’t want him to go away. If he leaves, we have both lost the bet<br /><br />I wanted to play it all down, but I did it too much. Me, racist? I’m Catholic, I can’t be. What did I mean by ‘he’s clearing himself up’? If you don’t like him, does it mean this boy must be cleared up to be accepted? I spoke with him yesterday, it was not me that offended him. When my joke was put in that way <b>[by the media]</b>, I was more worried about Mario than anything else. My sentence was manipulated. I said bullsh<em>t, I do jokes too. After Verona, I told him to buy a can of paint, so he will make all these b</em>stards happy. They are a**holes that go to the stadium to offend. Mario is not a warrior who challenges everyone, it is not so. Mario must make people feel that he’s suffering</p>

  <p><b>[Brescia president Massimo Cellino was among those annoyed by the authorities allegedly treating the Derby d’Italia with greater importance than any other fixture]</b> What mortifies me is that there are 20 teams in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, not just two. If you continue to work for only two teams the problem becomes very serious. I was told we couldn’t transmit Juve-Inter behind closed doors because we would’ve given the message that Italy had a problem. However, if the problem is there, it’s futile to hide it. Everyone looks at their own interests, but if we all only think about our own problems, with malice, then the real problem isn’t addressed</p>

  <p><b>[Brescia owner Cellino calls for further postponement amid coronavirus ‘plague’]</b> I keep getting news from <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a>, and it’s all unbelievable. Yet, the city is facing this with a disconcerting dignity. It’s breaking my heart. They have parents, family, friends and acquaintances who are dying every day, and they are suffering but in silence. People only have one desire, to get back to work and start living again. And you want to talk to me about the championship, about the title? I don’t give a sh*t. I’m scared to leave the house, I’ve got a depression coming on. If we’re speaking in terms of football, everything must be postponed to next season. We must be realistic, gentlemen. This is the plague. <b>[The fans]</b> don’t want it to start again. They’re the ones who forbid it, not the federation. Life comes first. There are ultras who are in hospital on oxygen, others who are mourning their loved ones, and others who are still intubated. We can’t play again this year. Let’s start thinking about next season. Some people still haven’t realised what’s going on, and those people are worse than the virus itself. I don’t believe in miracles anymore, I haven’t for some time now. The season’s been and gone, if someone wants to have that damned Scudetto then let them have it. Done. It’s over. I’m not saying this because <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> are last. We are bottom because we deserve it. Let them do what they want. I’m thinking about those who are going to lose their job, those who are dying</p>

  <p><b>[Cellino vows to pull <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> out of <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> games]</b> This season no longer makes sense. We stopped, no team will return as before, the stadiums will be behind closed doors, plus there is a risk for the health of the players. For me, returning to playing the games is pure madness. If it happens, they are forcing me to be prepared to not send the team out and to lose every game 3-0 out of respect for the citizens of <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> and their loved ones who are no longer there<br /><br />It can’t be avoided: the season ends on the June 30 deadline for the presentation of club budgets and player contracts. They are arrogant and irresponsible: they only think about their economic interests and the cups. But, for the Italian championship, <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> decides that, to resume, it must end by June? Are we going to play every other day? Or does <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> also have the power to stretch their days and make them 72 hours long? If you want to do something with <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s profits, send oxygen cylinders and respirators to <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a>. We would be grateful. I speak for <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a>. Here we have the trucks that transport the dead. We are at the centre of the epidemic. In any case, the players would come from 45 days of total inactivity, it would take a month of training just to get them back in shape. Otherwise they risk everyone getting injured.<br /><br /><a href="claudio-lotito.html">Lotito</a> yelled at me the other day: ‘You don’t want to play to save yourself’. He makes fire and flames because he thinks he will win the championship. I don’t care about going down: so far we have deserved it. I speak generally. To end in June would be impossible, and to prolong the season it is necessary to change all national and international rules: player contracts, budgets, deadlines with banks, transfer market, preparation, the start of the new season. It would be absolute chaos</p>

I didn’t discuss numbers, but only asked one question: ‘Would you let him play straight away in the Champions League?’ They said: ‘We would leave him in <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> until the end of the season’.

It turned out my daughter had the virus, but my son did not, and then I had it instead. I felt excessive fatigue and severe pain in my bones<br /><br />It’s absurd that we are discussing whether to play or not. We are fortunate men, I have a villa in <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> and one in Miami, but there are nine million Italians living under the poverty line. The country should be closer to its people and a €600 cheque isn’t going to do much. I am embarrassed by the lack of sensitivity shown by this government. I’m seriously thinking about getting a British passport<br /><br />The people of <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> defend me. They tell me that I wish to honour their dead and will be offended if I let the team play again. I am not afraid of relegation, I’ll gladly go into Serie B, but I will not lack respect for this town.
