  <p><b>[Norwich City hat-trick hero Teemu Pukki has admitted he stole the ball to secure his third goal in the Canaries 3-1 win over Newcastle United]</b> My first hat-trick in a Norwich shirt, so really happy about that, and three points, that’s why we came here today. It was a great game for us, we totally deserved to win this game, so obviously really happy about it. Last season there were many times when I scored a couple of goals and I could never do the third one. So that’s something I’ve been trying to do and I think I stole the ball from Todd <b>[Cantwell]</b>, I’m not even sure I tried to pass, I just wanted the third one<br /><br />It’s a great start for us and for me personally, so I can be happy about that and next week is a big game, so we can take a lot of positive things out of this for the next game. Todd Cantwell’s been really good in the pre-season and in the Liverpool game, so it’s nice to play with him. Like all the other guys, they are trying to find me a lot of the time, so I just enjoy playing with the guys in this team.<br /><br /><b>[The forward, who signed a long-term deal at Carrow Road in the off-season, said the home fans in East Anglia were going to be key for the team this season]</b> It was really important, we want to win a lot of games at home and with the support we are having from our fans, it is amazing to play there and amazing to score early and get points early. We can build from this</p>

  <p><b>[Teemu Pukki speaks after Finland’s men’s team qualified for a major tournament (UEFA EURO 2020) for the first time in their history]</b> There’s a party for sure. We had some moments of joy, we were celebrating what we had achieved. The coach is wet, that is something we do. He deserved it. Many of us have been with him since the under-21s and he knows how to make us play our best football</p>

  <p><b>[Goalscorer Teemu Pukki, whose goal lifted <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> to within three points of second-bottom Bournemouth but still six points from safety]</b> It is huge. We have played well lately but haven’t got the three points. It was important for the team and for confidence. There is a big road ahead but we are ready to fight. It is never easy to take a penalty and it was a long time before I could take it. I was confident I would score though. We have struggled to get three points against teams in a similar position to us so today was important. Maybe others don’t believe in us but we do</p>
