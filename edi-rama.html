  <p><b>[Edi Rama, Prime Minister of Albania, after his nation’s qualification for <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> EURO 2016]</b> This team has united Albanians. This is a great chance for the team to show everyone about Albania because football is such a big magnet. We never thought this would be possible - it doesn’t happen every day. The whole country is proud of them</p>

  <p><b>[The dragnet swept close to Albania last March, when a Turkish doctor and five teachers working at a Gulenist school in neighbouring Kosovo were secretly detained and flown to Ankara]</b> Relations with Turkey have always been very good and always will be. What happened <b>[in 2016]</b> was absolutely despicable and they lost lives and risked going through a coup d’etat. I fully understand their concern. At the same time, Albania is a country where everything should go through the rule of law<br /><br /><b>[When asked if <a href="recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Erdogan</a> was right to regard Gulenists as terrorists]</b> I think it’s possible, absolutely. But it’s not up to us as a state to make the judgement. If they are…proven to have done wrong by a court of law then we will not protect them or hide from the facts</p>
