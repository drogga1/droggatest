  <p><b>[When asked by reporters if Romelu Lukaku could win the Premier League Golden Boot]</b> I think so, he looks like he has got all the players around him to fit him. He will get better through the season as I think he understands this club is all about winning. Not only games, but trophies. So he will know that he has to keep going and reach 20 to 25 goals. He definitely has the power to bring in other players to score goals. So he will definitely hope this side wins trophies.</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez will become a huge star at Manchester United]</b> It was really easy for him to adapt at Arsenal and made a massive impact; I am sure he will do the same at Manchester United. He will be a good signing; he’s a great player and there’s no doubt about it. He’s definitely unpredictable and very hard to defend against. He brings more goals and chances along with a fear which makes defenders drop ten metres back and this is also because he is very quick. Not many players have skills like him. He doesn’t think twice.<br /><br /><b>[On Henrikh Mkhitaryan]</b> He’s a great player, for sure. Of course, if he leaves this early, it would be a disappointment because he has huge potential and one would love to play with that kind of player. Sometimes there are things outside football or inside the head of the player. But Henrikh himself has done very well. It’s a situation where it’s hard to comment more</p>

  <p><b>[q: When arriving at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> from Fulham, how different did you find it playing at such a huge club even though you’d played <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football before?]</b> Things happen naturally when you are in a state of mind to compete and be the best. You don’t think twice to join <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. You may have offers elsewhere but it’s a lifetime opportunity (to join Manchester United) which you take in without thinking twice. I didn’t question myself either, I knew I wanted to come right away. From Fulham or from anywhere, I would have jumped on a train! For me, in 2004, I was ready for the challenge and wanted to play with players like Scholesy (Paul Scholes) and Keano (Roy Keane)- big legends like them<br /><br /><b>[q: Who was your favourite strike partner?]</b> I enjoyed playing with all of them but <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> was the easiest player to pair with. He read your game so well that he would adapt - if you come short, he would go behind the defender; he would come wide for defending duties; he would do anything possible for you and make you more confident. He was easier to play with because you too could read his game.<br /><br />When you play with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, he has all the confidence in the world but he is very hard to read. Sometimes, he would take the ball and dribble when you’d come short or he would dribble past all the defenders and make wrong choices sometimes because he was very, very focused on his own game.<br /><br />He was a bit less of a team player than <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a>, for example. But he was the most talented, so you’re happy to play. With players like Van Nistelrooy, <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Carlos Tevez</a>, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer- you can really learn a lot from them<br /><br /><b>[q: <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have a lot of options in attack, just as they did in your days. How did Sir Alex keep all of you happy?]</b> It was a matter of seeing (how to manage) different competitions and at the same time looking at the different stages in the season. <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is a marathon and not a sprint. Also, there are cup games and the Champions League- all the competitions where we want to win.<br /><br />So, this is how he made sure how all players got their part. Also, this was worthy because a competition inside the club is very good. He managed us in a way that we all had our part. It’s about finding the right balance in different games and situations, I believe<br /><br /><b>[q: Is <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>’s biggest job keeping all these different talented forwards happy?]</b> Yes, definitely. The players are so good that they can understand the competition isn’t about one player being good and the other being average-they’re all good. The competition is about sometimes which player would play or who would play wide or as a striker- because eventually, it is all about winning trophies together. This is something they need to understand and if they don’t, then the player isn’t going to play.<br /><br />This is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and this is the biggest club so you have no choice but to adapt to things. Most of the players are looking for these situations so they can work harder to improve. If they’re always in the comfort zone, it isn’t good for them. They need to be challenged<br /><br /><b>[q: <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> fans are known to demand an attacking brand of football. Do you think <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> is doing justice to the fans?]</b> It takes time and dedication to find the right balance in order to make sure that we don’t concede and still be able to create opportunities. The result is also important to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> fans. The tradition is always going to be attacking (brand of football) but (Jose) <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> isn’t of the same tradition and we need to understand and respect that.<br /><br />We have to give him the credit for the two trophies won last year. We have two amazing players in (Jesse) <a href="jesse-lingard.html">Lingard</a> and (Marcus) <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> from the academy. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> will keep us improving and maybe with <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> coming, it could get better. We can’t ask for everything in a year.<br /><br /><b>[q: What is your prediction for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> season and the Champions League campaign?]</b> I really feel (Manchester) United has a good draw in the Champions League so they can go definitely to the last four. We may be short at the moment but I feel confident of this side to go all the way. In <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, we are behind right now and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> need to drop points and we need to make sure we don’t lose any. That’s going to be a challenge but I believe we are definitely going to be at the number two or number three position to get in the Champions League and get the consistency back as being the biggest club<br /><br /><b>[q: France had a good campaign at the 2016 Euros despite bowing down to Portugal in the finale. In order to compete for the winning trophy, in what departments do they need improvement, going into the World Cup?]</b> I think they need improvement in the defence- where they have to be sure of their tactics, their way of coming forward. Up-front there is (Anthony) Martial, (Antoine) Griezmann- they are amazing players. Going forward is fine but they need to find the right balance defensively, making sure of the confidence on the ball</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez could prove to be unplayable for Manchester United]</b> His speed, he has no fear. It’s impossible to mark those kind of players. He can play right, left, in the middle, play behind defenders … it’s unplayable. When these players get players around them as well with desire to win titles … he can do amazing things at United. If you remember Van Persie, who also came from Arsenal and destroyed the Premier League by himself in the first season. He killed it, we hope Sanchez will do the same.<br /><br /><b>[On Romelu Lukaku]</b> He started well, we can see that he has got more in him. We want to see him rip apart some defenders because he can do it. Physically he’s so strong. I will say that he can do more but that’s easy to say. Sometimes Lukaku might not be helped with Mourinho’s style of play. I wish next season maybe, with one year under his belt, he’ll be even more consistent</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo is enjoying a dream life and is an example for aspiring footballers to follow]</b> It is just not human what he is doing. The stats are something but just the intensity that he has in his game. His motivation is huge, his face is completely red after the game <b>[Saha says laughing]</b> and, basically, two or three days later, he is still there. He doesn’t miss many games.<br /><br />He represents all his clubs and his country well. He represents his family well. All the responsibility he has and he is able to be happy. He is a very handsome guy as well, so he has it all! That probably helps him to have even more sponsors. He has got his own movie, what more can you ask of him? He has got a dream life and it makes me happy because he deserves it all. A lot of people think they can do everything. Some people think that they have the knowledge, background or time to do a lot. I think that there is a really good team around him, the most famous one being Jorge Mendes, but I think they are guys that he can trust with the right aims. He has that family around him and they run things well. All that makes him successful and I don’t think he makes the mistakes. I think if I would maybe look at any players at this age - Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Neymar types - I think he is the one who is in control of everything. The fame, the performances, getting results every year. He has done really well. I do think that I couldn’t have expected quite so much success from when I played with him, but at the same time I saw something. He was working harder than anybody. He has these attributes. It was just immense. Even the stuff outside of football. The social media, the technology, the businesses. He built hotels. That, linked with his charity work, shows him to be one of the most generous sportsmen. It is just perfect. I would say that there is no equivalent, for me. I respect him a lot<br /><br />I was working hard mentally. I was watching videos while I was injured, but this was the most difficult aspect of my football career and watching my team-mates play. Also, team-mates playing instead of you and having to catch up. It was part of my career and I think that I did well. I played for 15 years at the top level. I had frustration but no regrets, because I gave it my all. I am sure now whatever information I have or have done, I can give it onto my platform as a mentor. It is open source, everyone can add their own information. They can send something like a WhatsApp inside a secure environment and find mentors like me or in other sports, that’s basically what I do now. People will say it is a different industry to what footballers normally do after retiring, but it is not. It is a kind of punditry, you give your expertise. It is a kind of coaching because you make sure you know what is the right thing to do, because I have been there. I am very passionate about innovation and technology. I always try to be around people who want to improve. Of course, the transition is difficult because you change from something that you really love to do, but I understood that, at the age of 28 when I was getting injured, I had to find something. I was already kind of an author as I wrote my book. I found that there are so many mistakes made in football that get replicated many, many times with no solution out there. So, yes, I found motivation and passion quickly through struggles</p>

  <p><b>[Louis Saha believes France have the required ability to win the World Cup]</b> France have very good players in every position. So why not? They could win the World Cup. I think the most important thing is that, when you look at all the 32 teams, they have players who can disrupt and it is very attacking minded. There is no team like Italy from back in the day.<br /><br /><b>[On attack-based teams]</b> You can’t defend like you used to before. Defending is not an option, you have to get possession and be technically gifted enough to get chances. It is not about crossing anymore, so it is going to be a very entertaining World Cup with a lot of goals, I think. A modern team with an exciting style of play will win it and France have all that</p>

There is an indication for me as a striker that they don’t have the indication. It seems like they don’t know where to go, they don’t have the animation when you feel like there is some kind of understanding<br /><br />Mourinho has to deal with the nonchalance that some players could have, maybe sometimes the lack of experience that they have. It’s all about him trying to coach and trying to give them the indication of what exactly he wants. Right now, we don’t see this</p>

It’s the wrong communication. It puts pressure on the manager. With those talks, you should do it in the dressing room with your manager. You know that people will question it, so don’t do it. This is my opinion and I would have said that to him. I would have said ‘no, that’s not something to say because you’re not the manager’.<br /><br />Sometimes I see a bit too much ego, as a fan sometimes I find it very disturbing. Yes, I think there are things that should not be done from the players’ side and from the manager and above.

He has got the quality, the pedigree, there is nothing wrong with that. We make mistakes as humans and he has done it. He is a grown man and he will identify where he has to improve. He doesn’t have as much margin to do it, but the club have identified they need to be stable to be consistent. It is all about results. If you win you get time, if you don’t …</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Martial should be staying at Manchester United if the Red Devils want to create a platform to win trophies again]</b> He should stay because he has got a great platform. Of course he needs to understand the long-term plan is there for him because it is a personal career - it is not only about the club. If you don’t play well you have to remember a club will transfer you and fans will start to boo. But that is not the case of Anthony, he is loved by the fans. He is loved by the manager I am sure. It’s an understanding, making a compromise in some ways, to make sure the player is happy and create a platform to win trophies again.<br /><br /><b>[Saha said of Mourinho’s selection calls]</b> I think the situation was more about the actual understanding - sometimes you have a feeling something is missing; the players, the tactics. As a fan, as someone who has been there in the club and as a forward sometimes I was feeling the link between players was not there. He has been asked to take a lot of responsibility in the field because he is a tremendous player with a lot of quality. You could see sometimes his body language was wrong. But the last few weeks he has just been an immense player. Doing a lot of defensive work, celebrations that I have not seen before so he shows a lot of quality signs that you can be very happy about. If he can replicate that and impact other players around him it will be a massive change</p>

  <p><b>[Saha backs United caretaker <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> to impress]</b> He is there for the transition but I think he wants to prove that he is able to stay longer. Maybe he will try to build confidence in the first weeks or months, and why not build this aura that we are looking for, with stability and an identity, like the one we had with <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>.<br /><br />He was an offensive player, like <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>. I remember how focused he was during the training sessions. He was always trying to repeat some situations. He was very strong with his right foot, so he was doing the same kind of race again and again, the same efforts that will allow him to be in good conditions to score goals. We had five or six strikers. If you scored, you’d play. If you didn’t score, you were in the audience. So you have to find a way to be consistent. I think that’s what he will bring <b>[consistency]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[And Saha cited a lack of communication and philosophy as the reasons for <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s failure]</b> It is clear there was a solidity. But at one point, we felt we were always in transition. There were a lack of information about the philosophy. When you sign a manager like <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, you know what he will bring.<br /><br />There is no surprise. He was true to form <b>[as we know him]</b>. He made his own choices with the communication. Nothing surprising. When you sign a coach like him, you know you will win titles. But I think that something was missing for some players. Maybe there was a lack of guidance. So there was a clash. When you have a coach with that pedigree, there are good things and bad things.

We need to understand him. Some weeks, he’s been outstanding. That’s what we expect from a player as talented as he is.<br /><br />I think that his problem is that he has so many qualities that it’s complicated to keep him in one specific position, even box-to-box or in the defensive tasks, when he can score or make the difference anyway. I think those elements are difficult for him as a player.<br /><br />He can do it because he did it with <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Didier Deschamps</a>. He can do it with any team or coach.

You target leadership for the best players in the team and Paul is definitely one of them, so the pressure is always on him. But it’s unfair on him to have this burden all of the time because the set-up of the team is not built with leaders around him - and perhaps that is not his best quality.<br /><br />Of course, he brings a special ­quality because he can do special things, but I don’t think leadership is his strength. So let’s find the right ­people to be around him because he can do magic. That’s what he has been bought by United to do - rather than as a Roy Keane-type or others that you can compare.

But the thing is it’s unfair to focus on one aspect of their game that is not one of their strong qualities.<br /><br />As for Anthony, he is the type of player, who, on his day, is unplayable, but, again, he needs a role model that will give him a target to go for and set a tone for working harder.<br /><br />In my view, it’s not fair to target those two French players. It is about the squad and the squad right now is not there. Every day in a group is about ­getting the best out of the personnel.For instance, a player like <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a> was essential for me as a striker. Every day he would be there on my back making sure I get it. I knew that every time I missed an opportunity or a dribble then he would be on my back.

What he does right now as a footballer, it is insane. The physicality that he has still got, that drive. Imagine the impact he would have on the forwards that we have right now.<br /><br />They would see the obsession that this guy has got and that would be a great example. He is more obsessed than anybody I have seen. Even Ruud Van Nistelrooy was not in his league in the way that he is acting in front of goal. He wants every ball over the 90 minutes and it is a joy to see.

Then, after the session, I remember we would run a few full lengths of the pitch, and he was dribbling at full pace. When you think it is all natural, it is hard work. People think that he could just dribble but it was hard work building that control of the ball. It is amazing because the most important element of his hard work is his belief.

I had views on some strikers like (Atalanta’s Duvan) Zapata who I think is a decent player, very strong.<br /><br />There is a need for somebody up front who is strong enough to hold the ball and to give time and space to the players like <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> and <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a> to create something in midfield to put passes together. You’re asking a lot from young players because passing the ball around and having nice touches, it just looks too nice and it doesn’t work. This football is really down to possession, but hard on young players especially when they don’t have confidence. You need a couple of big strong characters to talk to people, to do the dirty jobs, winning duels, and to help the fans react. I think that’s what we want to see.

The potential to work harder is not there because there are no visual challengers. These guys can’t see anyone that is going to put them in the stands. I think they were right to let the players leave (Lukaku and Sanchez). Definitely, if they had expressed that they don’t want to remain there so you have to understand that it’s not just about economics but the man management, and if those guys don’t want to be there it’s not right for the spirit where they’re trying to build something new.<br /><br />This is really hard because those players are not small players. They were very useful players so I think they are right in their actual decision to get the move that they wanted and they are happy, but the situation right now is obviously to replace those guys. You have to have replacements for competition. You have to have replacements because we want to score goals. The players that we have right now, you could see that they could realistically score 10 to 15 goals, but is that enough?</p>

I would be more confident of his future if Maddison came to United, he has been showing some great things</p>

  <p><b>[Louis Saha says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> has improved significantly]</b> Martial is a talented player and has everything needed to be world class. He can score goals and build play. He now has to be focused on things that will definitely work. It’s not just about having a style and being nice to look at it. He needs to be more of a killer and I think he has done that in the last few games. Definitely, since coming back from injury, there has been an improvement. You have to pick your moments and be decisive and I think he has done well, it’s not easy<br /><br />Martial has been criticised for his attitude but sometimes people misinterpret things and that’s the problem with our industry. People don’t know who you are and what you want and they assume. I have been a victim of that sometimes, they pick on one thing and think you have a nonchalant attitude and then they start getting criticism as to why you’re not producing on a regular basis. The same criticism can be said of <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>. It’s something you have to accept in the industry</p>

It’s a combination - you need to use different types to try and upset the defender - especially when they tried to kick you as well!</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> team-mate Louis Saha says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> was always destined for greatness]</b> He always improved but I would say that his ways never changed <b>[as a person]</b>. Throughout his career, you see the same dedication that he had when he was 18, maybe with less confidence as people were challenging him, and he had to prove that he was the best player. But to have that type of confidence to train, to work hard and to be consistent, no matter what people say, that was just an amazing skill. It was better than having talent because the way he was able to analyse, at that age, and grow and maintain those qualities - for me, it was genius. You ask anybody - working hard when you have that much talent, not everybody does this. You can get complacent or happy with your level and you think you have made it. But he wanted it way more. To have the vision to see something way more, when you’re already at United, at his age, it’s really hard. He managed to do that and that’s why I respected him so much<br /><br />Even though he was younger than me, I remember he said to me: ‘Louis you need to smile more when you play’. When the kids say that to you, when you’re older and have more experience, you say: ‘Hang on a minute’. But I realised it was so true. During his career, he could be cheeky in the way that he spoke to people, and people just could not understand and got frustrated because they were not in his league. He’s so above everybody that, when he speaks normally, it sounds strange for everybody. It’s amazing. His power and speed … the skills were one thing that are important in a career, but analysing when to do it - the timing and the precision - nobody can do that</p>

He’s already a man at his young age. He’s very mature, he knows what he wants. He doesn’t hide and that’s to his credit. At his age he manages to defy physics, he goes super fast. Anything we do in the normal way will be different for him, period. I think he’s an exceptional player who makes the biggest clubs dream, which is normal. He’s the most valuable player on Earth.

He had a tough season plagued by injuries. He came back very motivated, that’s what some of the players told me. When I talk to him on the phone, he’s super motivated, so I really want to see not a new <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, but <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> with support. I don’t think he was supported. Now he has <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> next to him, who’s another leader, another creator.

But he’s very motivated, he’s incredibly talented, he already proved himself, but now he has a better platform to improve and shut down the critics, sometimes justified<br /><br /><b>[Saha praised Martial’s development this season, in which he has become a regular scorer for United]</b> I’m a real fan of Anthony. I was frustrated maybe a year ago because I knew his potential but, on the pitch, I saw him lost left or right. The guy, he can do anything, he’s got huge potential</p>

  <p><b>[Louis Saha says <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> has changed his attitude to become a proper leader for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> Yes, I think the attitude, the drive, the actual consistency, all those things are leadership qualities. You said that sometimes it’s really hard for a striker to lead and, if you do, you need that. You need those three: consistency, drive, and, of course, talent. What is very important is having that dedication to actually look around and grab someone who needs to be grabbed and shout at them. All those things are essential. They don’t have that platform as much as I had when I was playing. I had <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>, <a href="phil-neville.html">Phil Neville</a>, <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a>, Rio <b>[Ferdinand]</b>, <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a>, <a href="patrice-evra.html">Patrice Evra</a>, <b>[Paul]</b> <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a>, <b>[Ryan]</b> <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a>, all those players. You could rely on those guys. There are definitely four or five players who are very important to <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>. I would say that, based on <b>[his]</b> record, he is not young anymore, almost because he started really young. He’s one of the starters for England. And <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>, as much as we can compare to Anthony <b>[Martial]</b> has done the same. The attitude… I’m not saying they had a bad attitude; they had the attitude that was in line with what <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> needed at the time. Maybe this attitude was okay when you had leaders around like proper players who win trophies and all that, and it was fine. Maybe I was like this at the time, but I had players to do what I can’t do. I had to actually evolve and be a leader. When I spoke to <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a>, he was young as well, he had to do it. All those players who made that improvement process for <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> were very important, and I think for <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>, the introduction of <b>[Harry]</b> <a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a> was important to give that kind of confidence aspect. That’s why you give the platform for <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> to make the difference all the time because he can do it because his work rate is amazing and that thing he maybe missed in one year because maybe he thought ‘I’ve got my position, I’m respected, I’ve got my status so I don’t need to do this or that’. Those things can be a bad sign for those playing behind you. Now you can see he is a proper leader.</p>

  <p><b>[Louis Saha has expressed his belief that <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> would be a good fit for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Asked if the England international would be a good signing for his old club]</b> Totally, yes. He is a player that is uncatchable, he’s clever, quick, very precise. He’s got the legs, the stamina, the quality. He’s very creative for that type of player. When you have all those things, like I said about speed and creativity, but precise as well. So, imagine how deadly these things are. You can’t stop the guy and at the same time, he is very precise because he knows how to stop when passing the ball. It’s really hard because players, for example, Anthony <b>[Martial]</b> and <b>[Marcus]</b> <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>, it can be hard for them because most of the time they’re going so quick so it’s hard to deliver the good pass like <a href="juan-mata.html">Juan Mata</a> would do. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> has got that ability to address the right passes, the right weight of the pass because of his intelligence</p>

  <p><b>[Louis Saha says <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> and <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> are definitely in the same bracket]</b> Ability-wise? Yes. They’re both very fast players, they have the technical ability to get out of situations where they’re surrounded by two or three defenders<br /><br />In terms of positions, Marcus and Kylian are quite similar. They like to play out wide but have also played up top. Kylian’s strength is that he is very direct, all the time. He doesn’t think twice. When he makes runs, you have to give him the ball, he’s so quick. That kind of directness is something we’ve also seen from <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>. When he started, he was asking questions of defenders - ‘are you quick enough and good enough to keep me quiet for 90 minutes?’ In terms of quality, they’re definitely in the same bracket. <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> has been able to achieve more consistency and approach the game without having to think too much. With United, <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> has been part of a team in transition, so he couldn’t really express himself. He had to be a leader when perhaps it wasn’t his strength at first. He had to build qualities which should not have been his initial focus. <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> has taken advantage because he’s been able to play with <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> players who are at the very top level, so he’s been able to build confidence and try different things, a platform that <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> hasn’t had so far</p>

  <p><b>[Louis Saha says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> would be stupid not to try and sign <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> this summer]</b> When you’re talking about <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> - a proper striker. When you see how many goals he scores each season, I would be stupid not to consider him. He’s a world-class striker. I know Werner is quite young, but he’s a prolific goalscorer. There’s definitely talent out there in the league and we have to catch up, we need a guaranteed 30-goal striker who is able to create some magic out of nothing, like Van Persie was able to do, removing the burden of having to play well as a side. This is what wins titles. There are six to eight sides competing at the top, plus, there’s so much quality everywhere now, you need competition within the team too</p>
