Okan, Emre and Arif Erdem are admired by everyone in Turkey for what they have done in Europe</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> midfielder Arda Turan has been handed a suspended two years and eight months prison sentence for firing a gun to incite fear and panic, illegal possession of weapons and causing intentional injury]</b> I did not commit this ‘verbal harassment’ crime which even bothers me to speak of it. Nor is it possible. The headline of this event is that I’m acquitted of the charges of harassment; not the penalties I received for errors I made due to these slanders thrown at me</p>

  <p><b>[Arda Turan says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is the best but <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> was something else]</b> There’s no need to talk about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. He’s the best player I have played with. But <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> was something else. His attitude, his commandment of the ball makes you admire him<br /><br /><b>[Arda Turan is hoping for another chance at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> as he believes he still has something to offer]</b> I have made mistakes, of course. But it’s not like I’m done. When I start playing football three months from now I can be better than everyone else after three or four games. I can still be like the old Arda Turan. I want to play football for a club where I can feel happy. I can still play football at a high level for four or five years. I have a contract with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I wanted it to be the case until the end of the season. This is what I wanted<br /><br />With <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>, we have beaten <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to the title. That was the most special moment of my career. Winning <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> was amazing. Winning Copa del Rey in <a href="real-madrid.html">Santiago Bernabeu</a> also has a special place in my heart. Copa del Rey finals are always special. <a href="diego-simeone.html">Diego Simeone</a> and Fatih Terim are special managers. Terim never gives up, he’s very motivated and has leadership skills. <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> is tactically very good, he’s energetic, he keeps you awake at all times. I have worked with many talented coaches but Terim and <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> are a step ahead of the rest</p>

  <p><b>[Arda Turan reveals failed <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> move]</b> My agent, Ahmet Bulut, didn’t tell me I had signed for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. He said I would find out 15 days after. I was thinking that I was going to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> because a year before my transfer to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> fell apart at the last minute. The document fell out of his bag and I saw <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s logo on top of the paper. I couldn’t believe it. Ahmet said, ‘come here, come here, look at the documents’. I was not sad that I was going to Barcelona<br /><br /><b>[Arda added on his time with the Catalan giants]</b> Valverde didn’t give me any minutes. I was the one who had given the most assists behind <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <b>[Luis]</b> Suárez the year before</p>
