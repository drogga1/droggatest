  <p><b>[Arda Turan has announced his retirement from international football in the wake of an alleged heated confrontation with a journalist]</b> Bad things happened last night. But am I regretful? No. Now I feel at ease. I talked with our coach and president of the federation and said that I want to leave national team. I said that I don’t want to play against Kosovo. I’ll always give the same response to those who put out such false news. I’ve never forgotten what it did to us. I speak as a man who serve the national team in all categories, loves his country and jersey. My national team career is over.</p>

  <p><b>[Arda Turan and Turkey head coach Fatih Terim’s very public spat has continued]</b> First things first: I have quit the national team. Why are people still talking my behind back? I’ve made a quick decision because some of my team-mates were also willing to quit. But I told them it was never the true way and we were serving our country. I told them this was just a personal issue.<br /><br />All my life, I’ve spoken my mind directly to Fatih Terim’s face. But he chose to hold a press conference. It is true that I had been undisciplined with the national team from time to time. I have been a naughty player but I have always given my all on game days. Fatih Terim calls me as ‘the player’ instead of my name. I thank him for all he has contributed to me. But I have quit. I have quit the thing that I loved most, that I struggled to achieve for 30 years. Not even a single person respects that? Can those journalist let go of the thing they love most?<br /><br /><b>[The row initially began over bonus payments for qualifying for Euro 2016, with Burak Yilmaz excluded at the hand of the coach]</b> While people were calling me a ‘bonus hunter’, Burak never requested any money. He even wanted me to let this go. But it was about the balance in the team. As the captain, I have to receive and give information about my team</p>

Nor is it possible. The headline of this event is that I’m acquitted of the charges of harassment; not the penalties I received for errors I made due to these slanders thrown at me</p>

  <p><b>[Arda Turan says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is the best but <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> was something else]</b> There’s no need to talk about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. He’s the best player I have played with. But <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> was something else. His attitude, his commandment of the ball makes you admire him<br /><br /><b>[Arda Turan is hoping for another chance at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> as he believes he still has something to offer]</b> I have made mistakes, of course. But it’s not like I’m done. When I start playing football three months from now I can be better than everyone else after three or four games. I can still be like the old Arda Turan. I want to play football for a club where I can feel happy. I can still play football at a high level for four or five years. I have a contract with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>.
