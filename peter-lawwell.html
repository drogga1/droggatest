  <p><b>[<a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> have confirmed the appointment of <a href="neil-lennon.html">Neil Lennon</a> as their new manager, with a familiar face agreeing a 12-month rolling contract]</b> We’re delighted to name Neil as our new manager. Neil stepped up to the plate and answered our call in February, and in the difficult circumstances, played a huge part in delivering the treble to <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. We have known Neil as a player, captain, coach and manager. He has brought great success to <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> in the past and we’re sure he’ll do so again in the future. He’s a <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> man, a winner and someone we’re delighted again to have as part of the club. Neil has a great record in identifying players, and he has already been working hard in this area as we look to strengthen the squad this summer. We’re all looking forward to a positive future together</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> players and management take ‘significant salary reduction’ amid coronavirus crisis]</b> I would like to pay tribute to Neil and the players for their desire to play their part and the outcomes achieved. I am also grateful to my own executive team for the commitment they have devoted to this outcome in very difficult working circumstances and also their own willingness to play a part in the measures adopted.<br /><br />I am extremely appreciative of the willingness of everyone concerned, to recognise the practical difficulties which this awful crisis has created. <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> are in a strong financial position but we are not immune to this unique set of circumstances.<br /><br />Our club is built on a great collective spirit and we are acutely aware of our responsibilities to colleagues, supporters and society as a whole. The fact that we can announce this package of measures in a spirit of harmony is testimony to the unity which exists within the club and will carry us into the future.<br /><br />We will negotiate and overcome these unprecedented times of challenge with continued teamwork and support for each other and I would like to thank our fans for the continued support which they give to the club. Our togetherness is our strength.<br /><br />I also want to take this opportunity to thank all those people, across so many areas of life, who are so bravely doing all they can to keep us safe and well. Everyone at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> applauds this monumental effort</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> CEO Peter Lawwell wants Scotland to be involved in fans ‘pilot’ scheme]</b> We have discussed the idea of ‘pilot’ games with the Scottish Government and believe it provides a safe, sensible way forward. As a club, we have put enormous thought and effort into making <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> Park fully compliant with all public health-related requirements while allowing our supporters to return to watching football. It is acknowledged that Scottish football has been exemplary in implementing all the safeguards required of it, first to get back into training and, from August 1st, to playing competitive SPFL matches. We are convinced that this should now be accompanied by a phased return of spectators which would be good, not only for the game of football but also for public health and morale in Scotland more generally. Scottish clubs are much more dependent on matchday revenues than other, larger leagues. That factor should be taken account of, so long as the public health obligations are met, to which we are entirely committed. We also have an obligation to our own supporters to make the case for them to be allowed to watch live football, particularly when they can see the steady progress towards this in other European leagues. Alongside other sporting bodies, <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the Scottish Government and look forward to early progress</p>
