<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former Sao Paulo defender Flavio Donizete has revealed the extent of a cocaine addiction that led him to sell his most prized possession in order to fund his habit]</b> I sold it to buy drugs. I sold it for 7,000 reais (around £2,875/$3,500). When I sold it the money came and I blew almost all of it on cocaine. The first delivery was 1,000 reais of cocaine. I used it in two days. The more money I had, the more drugs I wanted. After I was acquainted with cocaine, I lost everything else. Because at the start I was a moderate user. Until cocaine became more important in my life, I started to lose everything I had. Any money saved I used to buy drugs. I wouldn’t let myself be without drugs. Morning, afternoon and evening I had to take cocaine. Any money in my account, my possessions, I started losing them. I lost everything, except my wife, daughters and family, who are still with me even today. <br /><br /><b>[My friends]</b> would say to me, ‘snort!’. I would snort and at that moment the effects of drinking would wear off. Every day I went out I would say, ‘today I can drink as late as I want because when I use cocaine the effect wears off. Let’s go find some’. I was never at home, it was just parties and drinking. There were times I wouldn’t go a single day without taking cocaine. I started to get fat through the drink, I picked up a knee injury and I couldn’t run. All that as well as the coke. So I said, ‘that’s it’. I gave up football for good.<br /><br />My biggest regret is having tried cocaine. It destroyed me</p>
