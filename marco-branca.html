  <p><b>[Despite seeing Philippe Coutinho close in on a €150 million move from Liverpool to Barcelona, former Inter sporting director Marco Branca says the Serie A side can have no regrets]</b> Nobody at Inter doubted his quality, even if when you arrive in Italy at 18 it’s normal you can experience some difficulty. Real Madrid wanted him too, but we had a word with his family and in 2010 he joined the Nerazzurri for less than €4m. Is he worth €150m? There’s no way to measure the transfer market these days, but that doesn’t just apply to Coutinho, it applies to everyone. Crazy figures. I can say that he’s someone who can occupy all roles in the attack. Philippe was unique then and today, he can use his left or right foot and it makes no difference. When he dribbles, he can do it from anywhere. What we did with Liverpool wasn’t a technical operation, there was a budgetary issue and the club was starting to have problems. That’s why Coutinho left.</p>

He was very grateful to the club. Money does not always come first.<br /><br /><b>[Branca revealed the secret of that success in the transfer market]</b> We sign angry players because they were rejected by their previous clubs. <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a> told us that he no longer had the serenity necessary to continue. We listened to him and looked for the ideal solution for everyone.
