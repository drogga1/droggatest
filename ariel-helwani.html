  <p><b>[<a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> vs <a href="dustin-poirier.html">Dustin Poirier</a>]</b> <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> is the most dominant fighter in the history of MMA…It’s about the fact that he absolutely mauls his opponents. He suffocates them. He stifles them. And that dominance was on display Saturday afternoon against <a href="dustin-poirier.html">Dustin Poirier</a>. Sure, Poirier had his moments – the beginning of the second round and that guillotine in the third – but you never truly got the sense Nurmagomedov was ever in trouble<br /><br /><b>[<a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> vs <a href="dustin-poirier.html">Dustin Poirier</a>]</b> I was reminded of that famous Marvin Hagler quote going into this fight: ‘It’s tough to get out of bed to do roadwork at 5 a.m. when you’ve been sleeping in silk pajamas.’ You get the point, right? Life has forever changed for <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> and we’ve seen countless fighters lose that fire once they become multimillionaires. Look no further than <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> himself for a recent example. In the end, Nurmagomedov was just as impressive as ever. Just as dominant as ever. The most dominant ever, in fact<br /><br />Next for <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> has to be <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a>. It just has to be. Ferguson has won 12 in a row and Nurmagomedov has won 12 straight in the UFC. They’ve been booked to fight each other four times, but a fifth attempt must be made. This is the fight. No doubt about it. End of story<br /><br />I remember interviewing <a href="dustin-poirier.html">Dustin Poirier</a> backstage after his loss to Chan Sung Jung in 2012. The general consensus was a win would get him a title shot versus then-featherweight champion <a href="jose-aldo.html">Jose Aldo</a>. Unfortunately for Poirier, he lost that fight, and when he came to talk to us he couldn’t stop crying. He was devastated. Just like he was Saturday night <b>[against <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>]</b>. I feel like a lot of us have a stronger emotional connection to his journey because we were privy to his humble beginnings thanks to the documentary ‘Fightville’ I wrote about last week. I think that’s why those moments hit some of us a little harder. Or maybe it’s because we know Poirier represents the best MMA has to offer in and out of the cage and it stings to see him hurting like that<br /><br />After UFC 242 was over, I was reminded of an interview I did with <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> immediately after UFC 181 in December 2014. This was right after then-lightweight champion Anthony Pettis beat Gilbert Melendez. I remember seeing Nurmagomedov backstage at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas with one other member of his team. There was no big entourage around, no media following him.<br /><br />At the time, Nurmagomedov, who was 6-0 in the UFC, was nursing a torn ACL he suffered months prior. The injury scrapped a big fight against Donald Cerrone and left his future somewhat in doubt. In fact, that injury led to a two-year layoff for Nurmagomedov and three canceled fights due to a string of bad luck and injuries. It’s easy to forget about those days now as we see him evolve into one of the biggest megastars this sport has ever seen. But not that long ago, Nurmagomedov was labeled as injury-prone and unreliable. The fans had begun to turn on him due to the constant injuries. It felt like he was headed down the ‘never was’ path rather than realizing his true potential.<br /><br />During that interview, Nurmagomedov called for a title fight against Anthony Pettis. He said Pettis was scared of him. I felt bad for Nurmagomedov that night. He was trying hard to pick a fight with a guy who has never been labeled as scared. He seemed desperate. Five years later, those days feel like an afterthought. I’m glad the injuries are behind him and we’ve been able to learn just how good he really is<br /><br />The road to making Nate Diaz vs. Jorge Masvidal was a wild one. It has been a while since there’s been a match-making story like this, so allow me to explain: Days after Diaz’s win over Anthony Pettis last month, the UFC reached out to his team to make the Masvidal fight for Madison Square Garden on 2019 11 02. As you may recall, Diaz called out Masvidal after his win, so there was a desire to get it done as soon as possible … <br /><br />UFC came to terms with Diaz and Masvidal on Friday night and both fighters signed their bout agreements shortly thereafter. Diaz historically delays signing his bout agreement because he views that as the beginning of his fight camp, but wouldn’t ya know it, I’m told he’s so focused on this fight that he actually started his camp on Thursday. A day before the fight was even finalized<br /><br /><a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a> told ESPN’s Brett Okamoto last week that B J Penn won’t fight for the promotion again. While late, that is the right call. The question is: Will the UFC release him? Will they help him get help? I am genuinely concerned about Penn’s well-being and afraid if he’s left unemployed he will continue to get in trouble. Hopefully he has the right people around him who are helping him transition, and hopefully there isn’t a promoter out there who is going to try to capitalize on his name. Problem is, I believe there are many out there who will choose to do so. That’s when things can get really bad<br /><br />B J Penn’s demise reminds me a lot of what happened to Jason ‘Mayhem’ Miller. For the longest time, Jason Miller was one of the most charismatic and entertaining fighters in the sport. Unfortunately, his life spiraled out of control as of late and he has repeatedly found himself in trouble with the law. In a somewhat strange coincidence, Miller ended his two-year social media silence last week. I was pleased to see that he recognizes he lost control and hope he’s able to figure things out before it’s too late<br /><br />The ending of the Ryan Bader vs. Cheick Kongo Bellator heavyweight title fight was weird. Kongo claimed he couldn’t see out of his left eye because he was poked. However, all the replays seemed to suggest there wasn’t a poke. So, the fight ended in a no contest. Bader was well on his way to winning, so I don’t see a need to run it back. The fight summed up Kongo’s career, which has been filled with strange moments. The ending got even weirder when Bader and Kongo’s buddy Quinton Jackson got into an altercation in the cage. Jackson has never liked Bader since he lost to him at UFC 144 in 2012. Luckily, it didn’t get ugly in there. And no, I don’t think Bellator will now consider booking Bader vs. Jackson 2. Last I heard, the plan was Jackson vs. Fedor Emelianenko in Japan at the end of the year<br /><br />I asked <a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> on Saturday night if he watched the <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> vs <a href="dustin-poirier.html">Dustin Poirier</a> fight. He did. Great performance. He is a very, very good fighter and no one has been able to find his weakness. Great champion, too. I also asked if he heard UFC president <a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a>’s coy ‘sure’ response when asked about a potential <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> vs. <a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> fight. He read about it, but he’s not holding his breath. Neither am I. For now</p>
