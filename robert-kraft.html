  <p><b>[Robert Kraft intrigued by prospect of owning <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> team]</b> I like to win at whatever I do. But without a salary cap I’m concerned that we might be at a disadvantage<br /><br /><b>[Despite his hesitation, Kraft did indicate a willingness to potentially join the growing number of Americans invested in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> teams]</b> We helped found <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> in America. Our league here is starting to really develop, and with our soccer team we’ve gone to the championship game five times in 21 years. I’m just concerned in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> that we might not, with all the different ways of operating, we’re not as familiar with all of them. Let’s say people from all over the world come in and buy teams and maybe they have different reasons for doing it and managing it. And you have to compete with that and I’m not sure. But I’m still intrigued</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Kraft donates $100,000 to Boston Uncornered during the fundraiser]</b> One of the thrills when you have the privilege to own an NFL team is you get to meet people like Devin and (twin brother and Patriots cornerback) Jason (McCourty). You could even see that fellow – I forget his name, he used to play quarterback who left – he really wishes he was still with you here. I could hear it in his voice</p>
