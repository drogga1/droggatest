  <p><b>[On Sandro Wagner]</b> Bayern is a good club and Sandro Wagner knows the club. So I think it would not be a problem if he joins Bayern. If you have the possibility to play for Bayern Munich, you don’t think about it for a long time. As a player you know what a club Bayern are. Furthermore, Wagner is a German international, he would fit well for Bayern..</p>

  <p><b>[Retiring <a href="ze-roberto.html">Ze Roberto</a> hailed by Elber]</b> He was an extremely fit football player and an outstanding person. I knew that already from the Brazilian national team. So when he came from Leverkusen to join <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> in 2002 I knew it would fit. He assisted Ulf Kirsten for many goals at Leverkusen, so I thought I could gain from him. He is a really kind and humble guy. It was super to play alongside him<br /><br /><b>[As well as being team-mates Elber and <a href="ze-roberto.html">Ze Roberto</a> were close friends away from football, but the forward is especially grateful to his companion for his potent skill at setting him up in the area]</b> We had much contact, off the pitch. I’ve been to his home and I invited him to mine. We went out for dinner together with our families<br /><br />He had two little children and my children were young as well. I remember especially a game against Borussia Mönchengladbach. I hadn’t scored for six or seven games and, then <a href="ze-roberto.html">Ze Roberto</a> ran towards the box and I only cried: ‘Ze, here I am.’<br /><br />He played the pass and I was with my back to the goal. I scored with the heel. It was a superb assist and typical for <a href="ze-roberto.html">Ze Roberto</a>. He had the chance to shoot himself some seconds before but he played the ball to me. he was a unselfish player, who always looked in all directions to find a teammate which is in eben better position.<br /><br />You have to love players like <a href="ze-roberto.html">Ze Roberto</a>, especially as a striker. <b>[…]</b> in his career: You only have to say: Hats off! He lived football - a life for football.</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Lewandowski is the best striker in the world]</b> This shows that Cristiano Ronaldo is not stupid. Everyone wants to have such a player in their team. If they have the opportunity to get Lewandowski away from Bayern, they will do their best to do it. But Bayern have been warned and Lewandowski feels very settled with his family in Munich. He knows that he has everything at Bayern. I hope and expect that he stays with us for a long time.<br /><br /><b>[on Robert Lewandowski]</b> He has incredible skills and he shows them in every game. You could say that it’s easy to score goals at Bayern, because the other teams are not good enough, but you still have to deliver. He does that, and also in the Champions League. He is currently the best centre-forward in the world. He is the whole package. He is as good with his left and right as anybody else and while not a specialist in the air, he still gets plenty of headed goals. He has everything. It is difficult to say what weakness he has and what he still needs to improve</p>

  <p><b>[Former Bayern Munich forward Giovane Elber says Robert Lewandowski needs to put his focus back on Bayern Munich]</b> This isn’t good, like what happened last season with his agent always talking about how he could leave, he could go to Madrid, he could go I don’t know where. That’s not good. A player has to have his mind on the club he’s at right now, and that’s Bayern.<br /><br />We saw that the last season, the time when the club needed Lewandowski most, we didn’t see him at the end. That’s not good for him or for Bayern Munich. I don’t know if all these things about leaving Bayern were in his head or going to the World Cup were in his head. I hope now that when he returns to Bayern Munich and gets back in training that he does so with his mind set on working and nothing else. The things that are going to happen, he should leave to his agent, to the other people. He doesn’t need to have issues with Bayern Munich<br /><br />We still don’t know how everything is going to go, but I think Bayern has done really well to give him this job. He’s a young manager, and he can change a lot of things here. He played for Bayern, Niko Kovac, I played with him and his brother. He’s done great work with the Croatian national team in 2014 in Brazil, he’s done special work with Frankfurt, being champion of the cup against Bayern Munich last season, and I think he’s going to bring good things to Bayern Munich<br /><br />To work and have a bit of luck because if he starts well, with good matches at the start of the season, it’ll go well. If they can get the points they need early, it’ll all go well. The problem is if they start poorly. That’s a problem Bayern and all big teams have after the World Cup because the players who played in the World Cup still aren’t training so when you start, you start a bit weak. It’s a chance for the other teams to get points off Bayern, so he has to pay attention right now to how he’s starting the Bundesliga</p>

  <p><b>[Former Brazil forward Giovane Elber believes Neymar’s attempts to draw fouls and convince referees to book opponents has become too much]</b> Too much. Too much. If you want to be one of the best three players in the world, you have to look at who the best are right now. Cristiano. Messi. Cristiano and Messi don’t do these things. They play football. And Neymar knows how to play football! There are times in the match where he could move the ball more quickly, but he keeps the ball and takes a foul from behind and falls by himself and the whole problem starts. That’s not good for him. I think it’s going to big for him this season because now we’ve all seen who Neymar can be on the field. That he can have problems with the referees, that players are going to play against him and with the fans. You have to only think about playing football. It’s not necessary. Neymar is a fantastic player, a nice person and he doesn’t need this sort of thing<br /><br /><b>[Tite has signed a contract extension to manage the Selecao through the 2022 World Cup]</b><br /><br />it’s really, really good. The CBF has done well to give him a chance to stay more time. Because in Brazil, in football, people want the results to come right now, quickly, and that’s not how it works. When you look at some of the top teams, past champions like France, Germany, the manager has been there for three or four World Cups with the team. There’s a process. They work <b>[and have]</b> more time with the players, they know what they can get with each player and I think the CBF has done well to keep Tite because now Brazil has a team. It’s not just Neymar. Even in this World Cup, we saw Coutinho perhaps surpass Neymar. You have to have a team and not just one player</p>

  <p><b>[Giovane Elber, the former Bayern Munich striker, insists he never experienced racism in Germany]</b> No, in Germany, thankfully, I never had any issues with racism. Not me, my family, my kids. It always went really well, and everyone always respected me the same way, no matter who it was, always with respect. With Ozil, I think it was a thing done without thinking much<br /><br />Yes, the photo he took because it started a problem that wasn’t necessary. On the other hand, it’s the president of the country where he has roots. You have to understand that. In Brazil we always say that football can’t mix with politics. Politics is another thing, football is on its own. It moves people. When you look at the World Cup games and a team loses, the fans are crying as though they’ve lost someone close to them. That’s football. And when you mix football and politics, it doesn’t go well for anyone</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich must be patient with Niko Kovac as he finds his feet]</b> The situation is of course unusual, but Niko is the right coach for Bayern. I think that’s what the bosses think. After six championships in a row, they also realised that such a phase will come. You have to be patient with Niko and the team.<br /><br />I can still remember my active time. When we were in second or third place, we were really annoyed. That was the worst thing ever. We went into training totally motivated, wanted to do every day a Bundesliga game to collect points as quickly as possible. Bayern is always committed to be at the top. But there are phases in each season that just do not work<br /><br /><b>[Elber admitted that he felt the side was missing the influence of a playmaker]</b> I also had the same idea when playing against Freiburg. I had to think about Mark van Bommel. One misses such a player types<br /><br /><b>[On James Rodriguez]</b> After returning from Madrid, he found joy in football again. He is doing well not only <b>[at]</b> Bayern, but also <b>[in]</b> the Bundesliga. I hope he stays with us for a long time<br /><br />Dortmund is also the favourite for me, and not only because they play in front of their own fans. They have lost against Atletico, but they are all in the Bundesliga at the moment. They work very well as a team, have many young and hungry players. Even the rotation principle of Lucien Favre works. One has to say: BVB is doing very well and it is right they are at the top</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich risk losing out to Real Madrid or Barcelona if they hesitate on signing Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi]</b> We can only know if Hudson-Odoi is suitable for Bayern after his signing. However, Bayern need to be cautious when signing new players. The current transfer market is indeed the case, €5 million cannot buy the players you want. If Bayern don’t make the call, maybe Real Madrid and Barcelona will.<br /><br /><b>[Bayern returned to the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday after beating Borussia Dortmund 5-0]</b> Before the game, Bayern Munich were under a lot of pressure and was two points behind. We had to win this game. Bayern Munich showed their desire to win from the beginning of the game, to force Dortmund to make mistakes. And Bayern did seize the opportunity<br /><br /><b>[Elber expects James Rodriguez to still be in Bavaria next term]</b> James didn’t get a chance to play against Dortmund, but he has played a lot in the latter half of the season. Bayern need quality players, and James is a quality one. I think he will remain in Bayern’s squad next season</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and Brazil striker Giovane Elber says <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> is a great player but lacks aggression and is shaken very easily by setbacks]</b> When Philippe arrived at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, everybody hoped that we would see the same <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, where he had great games, but he came after a season at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> where things weren’t good for him. I think maybe that stuck in his head. I think he’s a person who gets shaken very easily when things aren’t going so well. He’s not a person who thinks, ‘I’m <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> and I’m going to fix this’. It’s different from one person to another but, during my time, we had some players - Roque Santa Cruz, the Paraguayan, for example - who were like this. There are people who think ‘I’m going to nail this game’ and there are others that get shaken. I think <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> lacks some aggression. It’s a shame because he’s a great player<br /><br />I don’t know whether <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> will keep him or not. Things can change very quickly in football. I wanted to speak to him but then, the pandemic happened. Although we already have Thiago <b>[<a href="thiago-alcantara.html">Alcantara</a>]</b> helping him, I wanted to give him some advice, speak about <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> and tell him about how we see his situation from the outside. When he gets the ball, everybody starts thinking something extraordinary is going to happen, but he can’t expect that he’ll do that every time he gets the ball. Sometimes, you have to make an easy pass, do the basics, before trying dribbles, or a nutmeg. But, in the beginning, you have to have more focus on the team, try to make fewer mistakes and gain confidence. I think he lacks confidence sometimes</p>

With <a href="niko-kovac.html">Niko Kovac</a>, it seemed he couldn’t reach the players. He worked on a team and the team didn’t seem to obey his commands.<br /><br />With the new manager the players didn’t have anyone to blame anymore. A bad game wasn’t the manager’s fault anymore, as was happening before. It would be the fault of the players. So the players were united and started playing well, because we’re talking about very good players. And now we’re back on top. <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> could have done better because they had the chance to accumulate more points during that poor period.

But since I started playing in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, in 1994, the biggest rivalry is <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> vs Schalke. It’s a regional rivalry, you know? <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> against <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> is nice, because people are always excited to watch it and the both teams usually are the favourites for the title.
