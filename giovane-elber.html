  <p><b>[Retiring <a href="ze-roberto.html">Ze Roberto</a> hailed by Elber]</b> He was an extremely fit football player and an outstanding person. I knew that already from the Brazilian national team. So when he came from Leverkusen to join Bayern in 2002 I knew it would fit. He assisted Ulf Kirsten for many goals at Leverkusen, so I thought I could gain from him. He is a really kind and humble guy. It was super to play alongside him<br /><br /><b>[As well as being team-mates Elber and <a href="ze-roberto.html">Ze Roberto</a> were close friends away from football, but the forward is especially grateful to his companion for his potent skill at setting him up in the area]</b> We had much contact, off the pitch. I’ve been to his home and I invited him to mine. We went out for dinner together with our families<br /><br />He had two little children and my children were young as well. I remember especially a game against Borussia Mönchengladbach. I hadn’t scored for six or seven games and, then <a href="ze-roberto.html">Ze Roberto</a> ran towards the box and I only cried: ‘Ze, here I am.’ <br /><br />He played the pass and I was with my back to the goal. I scored with the heel. It was a superb assist and typical for <a href="ze-roberto.html">Ze Roberto</a>. He had the chance to shoot himself some seconds before but he played the ball to me. he was a unselfish player, who always looked in all directions to find a teammate which is in eben better position.<br /><br />You have to love players like <a href="ze-roberto.html">Ze Roberto</a>, especially as a striker. <b>[…]</b> in his career: You only have to say: Hats off! He lived football - a life for football.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and Brazil striker Giovane Elber says <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> is a great player but lacks aggression and is shaken very easily by setbacks]</b> When Philippe arrived at Bayern, everybody hoped that we would see the same <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, where he had great games, but he came after a season at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> where things weren’t good for him. I think maybe that stuck in his head. I think he’s a person who gets shaken very easily when things aren’t going so well. He’s not a person who thinks, ‘I’m <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> and I’m going to fix this’. It’s different from one person to another but, during my time, we had some players - Roque Santa Cruz, the Paraguayan, for example - who were like this. There are people who think ‘I’m going to nail this game’ and there are others that get shaken. I think <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> lacks some aggression. It’s a shame because he’s a great player<br /><br />I don’t know whether Bayern will keep him or not. Things can change very quickly in football. I wanted to speak to him but then, the pandemic happened. Although we already have Thiago <b>[Alcantara]</b> helping him, I wanted to give him some advice, speak about Bayern and tell him about how we see his situation from the outside. When he gets the ball, everybody starts thinking something extraordinary is going to happen, but he can’t expect that he’ll do that every time he gets the ball. Sometimes, you have to make an easy pass, do the basics, before trying dribbles, or a nutmeg. But, in the beginning, you have to have more focus on the team, try to make fewer mistakes and gain confidence. I think he lacks confidence sometimes</p>

  <p><b>[Giovane Elber says <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>’s revival in the second half of the 2019-20 <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> season is largely due to the players respecting <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a> more than they did former head coach Niko Kovac]</b> Bayern started very irregularly and then they made the change <b>[of manager]</b>. <a href="hansi-flick.html">Flick</a> already knew the players from Bayern and the Germany national team and had the respect and admiration of everybody, so it was easy for him to reach the players again. With <a href="niko-kovac.html">Niko Kovac</a>, it seemed he couldn’t reach the players. He worked on a team and the team didn’t seem to obey his commands.<br /><br />With the new manager the players didn’t have anyone to blame anymore. A bad game wasn’t the manager’s fault anymore, as was happening before. It would be the fault of the players. So the players were united and started playing well, because we’re talking about very good players. And now we’re back on top. <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> could have done better because they had the chance to accumulate more points during that poor period. But neither them or Leipzig took their chance and now it is difficult to take Bayern away <b>[from the top]</b>.<br /><br />Bayern versus Gladbach was the biggest game - it used to be a match that made people get anxious and excited to watch. But then Gladbach started to fade, got relegated… now they’re getting back on track, fighting for the Champions League places. But since I started playing in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, in 1994, the biggest rivalry is <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> vs Schalke. It’s a regional rivalry, you know? Bayern against <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> is nice, because people are always excited to watch it and the both teams usually are the favourites for the title. But emotion-wise <b>[the biggest match]</b> really is <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> vs Schalke. It’s thrilling</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> forward Giovane Elber believes that the Bavarian club’s supremacy in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> isn’t good for the competition]</b> This Bayern supremacy is not good for the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, no doubt. I felt the supporters were craziest when we were chasing the leaders, and when we got on top of the table they calmed down because they started thinking ‘Oh, now Bayern are going to win it’. I’m sure Bayern would exchange two or three <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>’s for one Champions League, because the Champions League is different. The <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, as we say, is like homework.</p>

So I told him this: ‘You’re not equal, you are even better than me!. It’s impressive the focus he has, his calmness and the person that he is. He is a spectacular guy<br /><br />I think today it’s easier for him to surpass the record of goals scored in one season. There’s lot of games to be played and I believe he can reach <a href="gerd-muller.html">Gerd Muller</a>’s record because he scores goals almost every game. The Champions <b>[League]</b> is more complicated, but of course I’d be very happy if he could break <a href="gerd-muller.html">Gerd Muller</a>’s record and also win a Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Former Brazil striker Giovane Elber feels <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> should not re-sign <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> as he questioned the forward’s decision to join Paris Saint-Germain]</b> No. As he left <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, for me there is no possibility of returning to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. For me, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> behaved very badly with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, because when he wanted to leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> he said he wanted to be the best in the world. But for God’s sake, you are not going to be the best in the world playing for <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. For that you have to go to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, to some team where you can win the Champions League. I believe that <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> will still not be able to win the Champions League in the next three or four years<br /><br />The aim is to be ready for when they signal the return of club activities, so I can be in the best possible condition. I’m here, training hard, with the same rhythm and frequency that I would with the club. Training even harder actually, with more activities to compensate for the lack of games. Of course I miss the competition, but fitness coach Ricardo Rosa set up a programme that I have been following to the letter.</p>
