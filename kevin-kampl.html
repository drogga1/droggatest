  <p><b>[RB Leipzig midfielder Kevin Kampl has identified <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> as the best team-mate he has ever had]</b> The best team-mate was <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> during my time at Red Bull Salzburg. He just had everything, the complete package. He was good on the ball, incredibly fast - both with and without the ball. He was dangerous in front of goal and played great passes. It was already seen back then that he could become a really great player<br /><br />I benefited the most from Schmidt. He wanted to sign me when he was still a coach at SC Paderborn and I was still a player at VfL Osnabruck. The transfer failed due to the transfer fee. Shortly afterwards he went to Red Bull Salzburg and I went to VfR Aalen. I was only signed to Aalen for two months before Roger Schmidt brought me to Salzburg. I finally had my breakthrough there.<br /><br />Roger Schmidt’s departure contributed to this, but was not the main reason. When he subsequently took on a coaching job in China, I had an exchange with him and almost went with him. I would have taken this step only because of him, because I would not have got this far without him. Ultimately, however, there was no transfer to China</p>
