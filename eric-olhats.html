  <p><b>[The scout who discovered <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a> as a youngster says he has been saddened by the France international’s time at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> When he left <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>, I was sad to see the controversy that there was. It really affected me. I can understand why he would want to sign for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> is <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. Other players and friends said that his game was going to fit in and adapt very well to the way <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> play, tiki-taka and all that, but I don’t like his performances. You see that there are problems, that he isn’t enjoying it<br /><br /><b>[Olhats believes <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> can do more for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>]</b> It hurts me because I know what he is capable of doing. He can give much more and he doesn’t say anything. He tried to do it without saying anything. It seems that he does not receive as many passes from the other players, or as much from the boss<br /><br /><b>[The scout added he hoped that the situation would change, but he still feels his old protege is being marginalised]</b> A month passed, then a second. He understands that he is not the boss there, but due to his attitude and his talent, he deserves to have a little more consideration. He is only 28 years old <b>[at time of interview]</b> and a world-class player</p>
