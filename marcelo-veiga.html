<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Joao <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> played as a winger. It was not until the club’s Under-17 coach Marcelo Veiga assessed his attributes and decided that he suited the role of a central striker]</b> I’ve noticed during training that he had a knack for positioning and scoring goals. He could shoot with both feet, showed precise heading and had that hunger for the goal. We then started working on the fundamentals, playing with his back to goal and such. And he began improving<br /><br />What I like the most about him is his mentality. He’s a focused kid and is always looking to learn. Sometimes we have youth players who frown and can’t accept when they are being taught. But Joao has always shown commitment to making things work, that spark in his eyes when he knew he could do better</p>
