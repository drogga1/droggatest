The <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> game will be the first game I am available for and I’m very excited about it already. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> has really, really big names, big players.

  <p><b>[Everton striker Cenk Tosun is pleased that he played the waiting game in order to join the right Premier League side for him]</b> Crystal Palace wanted to sign me during the first phase of the season but it couldn’t happen. I’m glad it didn’t because I now play for a bigger club in the Premier League. Players like Rooney, Phil Jagielka and Seamus Coleman have given me a helping hand to settle in,” he said. “I want to emphasise Rooney. He’s a legend in the UK but he’s far from being arrogant. I admire him on and off the pitch.<br /><br />I love Besiktas but I had to set new career goals for myself. That’s why I wanted to play in the Premier League. The Premier League is as good as people say. It’s the NBA of football world. It’s the fastest, toughest football league in the world where the most expensive players play. I had always wanted to play in the EPL since I was a little child<br /><br />I want to stay in England. Everton is a great club with tradition. We should play in the European competitions every year. I want to play in the European competitions with an Everton shirt</p>

  <p><b>[Cenk Tosun was sent off under strange circumstances as Turkey drew 2-2 with Tunisia on Friday]</b> When I turned my head, I saw a quarrel with my father. I didn’t know the whole story. I told them that they were wrong, threatened, unworthy of me. Character is more important than football. It was an unbecoming gesture. I apologise. I guarantee it won’t happen again.</p>

He’s still got a lot to learn and he has a long road ahead of him. I think if he continues like this, he has the potential to be playing in the top teams of the world.</p>

I told the club I am ready to go out on loan and return stronger, but they told me they needed me here.</p>

I just want to say thank you to all the lads because everybody ran until the last second, even after the 2-1, nobody gave up and I think we deserved a point here.<br /><br />We played a solid game today.
