  <p><b>[Emerson Hyndman moved to Rangers hoping to get his season, and arguably his career, back on track]</b> wouldn’t call myself a goal scorer, but I like to get in and around the box. When you get chances you’ve got to try to put them away. Had two today, and put one in.<br /><br /><b>[Rangers style is conducive toward scoring]</b> It’s a very attacking team. You find space and people can create chances on their own, which is nice. I think whenever you have a team that’s attacking minded, you find chances easier</p>

  <p><b>[His efforts in the latest one, a 1-1 draw between Celtic and Rangers]</b> It was really exciting for me with it being my first one. The boys were telling me about it before the game and the atmosphere was ridiculous, and to not be intimidated and to go and do my thing. It was a great experience, and all the boys put in a real shift.</p>

  <p><b>[Hyndman bagged his fourth goal in eight league games for Rangers FC in a 4-0 victory over Hamilton Academical]</b> Joining a massive club <b>[with]</b> high expectations, you have to go out every week and perform - there are no exceptions. I’m enjoying that challenge and I just hope to carry it on.</p>

  <p><b>[Emerson Hyndman’s dream move to the English Premier League couldn’t have started off much worse]</b> I was really excited to make this move to Rangers because it came at a good time. I needed games, and it’s such a big club as well. It was really exciting to have the opportunity to play in pressure situations in front of big crowds. It wasn’t the best start for me <b>[at Bournemouth]</b>. Obviously it was frustrating. I was real excited to make my move to Bournemouth, and obviously you want to impress in preseason so for <b>[the injury]</b> to happen was tough<br /><br />The Championship is obviously good quality, but moving to the Premier League is a step up. I enjoy training with that group, a good team, well coached as well. It’s frustrating when you don’t play games. I had to take that on and try to show up every day with a good attitude to improve. When I heard bout the Rangers interest it really excited me. The manager told me I deserved games at some point in the season, so when that opportunity came I jumped to grab it<br /><br />I spoke to Gedion about the club - he was there last year - to have a more up to date version of it and <b>[he]</b> was very complimentary of Rangers as well. I knew they had that history as well, which was nice. I could tell as soon as I walked in the building that they’re very friendly with Americans. Any time I met one of the staff members they always brought up some American that they knew - Bocanegra or Maurice Edu, whoever it was. They’d bring up a story and try and make me feel comfortable. It was nice going to go to a club that has that kind of history<br /><br />My attacking qualities were always there, but at the same time I’ve been put in different positions throughout my career. Sometimes I’ve been the deeper midfielder. Sometimes I’m more of an eight role, kind of creator, other times a 10. It’s been kind of similar here. I find myself in advanced positions with Rangers. They give me the freedom to go forward and try to create. Part of the job of a box-to-box midfielder is to chip in with goals. I’ve been fortunate enough to have as many chances as I’ve had, and I was able to put some away early on<br /><br />You hear so much about it, I’ve seen them in the past on TV, you realize how big of an occasion it is, but to play in one is a completely different feeling. Playing in that kind of atmosphere is special and it’s something you aim for in your career<br /><br />That was the goal when I came here, to get playing time and find my form and earn experience to help me in England. I know Bournemouth has been keeping tabs on me and I feel good about competing for <b>[playing time]</b> next season<br /><br /><b>[On Christian Pulisic]</b> I just think it’s brilliant for American soccer in general. I don’t think we’ve seen a player that quickly, at that age, break through like that and really make that sort of impact. Obviously he’s doing really special things at Dortmund, playing in Champions League matches and things like that at the highest level. I think it’s brilliant. I’ve enjoyed watching him play on those nights. I’ve never played with him, but obviously I hope to have the chance in the future because he looks like a great talent<br /><br />I’m really anxious to get back in with the national team. Any time you’re doing well and playing regularly, you want to get called in. It’s a bit of a disappointment with the <b>[March]</b> roster, but at the same time I’m really optimistic about the future. I know I just have to keep performing at the level I should do, and keep chipping in with goals and helping my team win is all I can do. I hope to have a shot maybe at the Gold Cup in the summer - that’s what I’m aiming for. I think that’d be a good time to make an impact. You never know, that’s out of my control. All I can do is try to work hard and get into the squad</p>

  <p><b>[Emerson Hyndman made his return to the field last week]</b> The gaffer told me he sees me in and around it this year so all I can do is work hard in training and see where it takes me. Playing in the first team and getting involved in the match days is a big thing for me. I am optimistic. I’m training hard every day and doing my best to try to impress. It’s just making that next jump and achieving that next target.</p>

  <p><b>[USA national team prospect Emerson Hyndman has hailed Cesc Fabregas as a key influence]</b> Cesc Fabregas was one. He wasn’t the biggest guy, and at the time I really related to that. I was quite small for my age and he had the captain’s armband at Arsenal when he was young, so he was one player I sought to be. He was the difference-maker in that team. Later on, Luka Modric and the way he impacted Tottenham. There have been quite a few, but I think Fabregas is probably the one.<br /><br /><b>[Having left FC Dallas’ academy to join the Fulham setup as a 15-year-old in 2011, Hyndman finds himself embracing England as a second home]</b> I’m used to it now, but at the beginning it was a bit tough. I was scrapping for myself, cleaning my clothes and feeding myself, but you get used to it quickly.<br /><br />England almost feels more like home sometimes, just because I’ve lived here so long and I don’t really get back often. I get a six-week break in the U.S., so I live here for most of the year and I’ve been doing that for six years now.<br /><br />It was a hard transition at the age of 15, but I’ve really grown to enjoy playing in England. I enjoy the way the game is played - at a fast pace - and I think I have adapted quite well</p>

  <p><b>[Emerson Hyndman is heading back to the Scottish Premiership as the Bournemouth midfielder has joined Hibernian on loan]</b> I am delighted to have joined Hibs. I enjoyed my previous time in Scotland - my game is well suited to the style of play here. I’m looking forward to meeting up with the squad and hopefully working my way into the team.</p>
