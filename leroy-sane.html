  <p><b>[The City winger admits it was crucial for him to have the operation in order to be fully fit this season]</b> I missed the Confederations Cup because I had to have surgery on my nose. I couldn’t really breathe through it. I was working out when I could do it <b>[surgery]</b> and I spoke with the national coach and also <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>. It was a problem. Sometimes I would feel it during the games, it was really hard to breathe for me, but now it’s fine<br /><br /><b>[Sane admits that the support of his teammates and <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> helped him through his difficult early months in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> At the beginning, I had a little bit of problems to know the league and how they play. It was completely different for me, but the team helped me and the coach too. They gave me a lot to improve and be comfortable on the pitch. Everybody tried to help me on the pitch and off the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Leroy Sane has given opposition defences nightmares this season]</b> It was before when I was playing against Kyle Walker. And Crystal Palace’s right-back Timothy Fosu-Mensah, I have played against him twice this season, and even last season, he had me really well under control and I told him how happy I was to play against him.<br /><br /><b>[The 22-year-old said on his icons]</b> Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho, especially Ronaldinho - how he was playing, enjoying football, you could never see that he had any pressure. It did not matter who was in front of him, he just tried to pass the player, no matter how, and this is the player I tried to play like!<br /><br /><b>[On Kevin De Bruyne]</b> Kevin is a fantastic player and everyone knows and can see that. He also really enjoys playing football and the way he plays is fantastic - the assists and some of the passes he plays … .. I just run into the space and say, ‘Kevin, here, here!’ Sometimes he is not even looking at me and he still passes the ball. And that is why I always say that when Kevin has the ball, something is going to happen. So, we as strikers have to be ready and give him a choice of where to play the ball. And even if the space is really tight and you think the ball cannot go through, you still must expect that he will find a way to play the ball through</p>

That’s why it will be much more difficult to win the title next year. It means everything to me - I’m very happy that we won the league and won the trophy.<br /><br />I think there’s a lot of things we can change. Of course we can improve, but we still have to believe that we can do it. We have enough talent and quality to do it. We’re going to see what happens next season<br /><br />We said when we won the league we want to set new targets, to break records, to still be focused on the games. We can’t take a step back, although we know we have won it already. Every player is still trying to play well.

The big teams and even the smaller teams too. Everyone’s trying to get better and work harder to stop us too and the way we play, our tactics. We have to work hard to get more perfect in some situations<br /><br />Yes I’m totally happy for <b>[the competition with Mahrez]</b>. I like competition especially because he’s a really good person.

I am really happy here and I’m on the right side!<br /><br />It’s so important not to just have one or two players who score the goals. Maybe one day they don’t score, and then the team doesn’t score at all. It’s a big strength for us that anyone can score the goals, and we have that hunger. But we also have a hunger to give each other assists, it makes things easier<br /><br /><b>[Sane says the Catalan’s demands help to keep the squad on their toes]</b> In our team we have players of good character who always want to win, always hungry, always want to improve, score goals, give assists and have a clean sheet. And we have a coach who keeps telling us we need to improve, improve, make more clean sheets, make less mistakes, and be more careful. It makes us so hungry to win the game and to score a lot of goals<br /><br /><b>[On Bernardo Silva]</b> <b>[Bernardo]</b> has played really well this season and I am happy for him because he’s a really good guy - last season he came in and gave 100 per cent. Everyone in the team likes him. I love playing with David Silva but maybe when the time is over for David to play, Bernardo can take his place</p>

I have felt really at home here since day one and of course <b>[signing an extension]</b> is possible<br /><br />Even if I am not playing for a certain time, I am still happy to be here and to play for this club, to work with these players and the coach. He is doing it good. Every one of us knows that we have to rotate sometimes because in every single position we have more than one or two good players. Obviously there is a time when you do not start from the beginning. You have to accept it. I think it is also good to put more pressure on everyone</p>

I was thinking of whether to shoot or not from the free-kick, it was quite a distance. It was quite lucky. We had enough chances in the second half to make the game quiet, I don’t know what happened with the three-on-one, I passed it to Bernardo Silva and he had a tap-in…I wanted an assist!<br /><br /><b>[City will now face a group runner-up]</b> We look forward to the draw, we will watch it together and we will see who we will face next</p>

That’s why I suggested that I should play for the youth team first so that I could get used to the speed of the game step by step. Lots of people were surprised but for me it was the logical first step to make; that’s what I planned to do from the start and what I told the coach. Overall I felt really good and was on the right track; I was on the verge of making my comeback. I still need one or two competitive games to get back to full fitness so that I can get my confidence back again, which is very important<br /><br />As I said I was on the verge of making my comeback; I had been working towards that for many months. Nevertheless, I can still continue to do that and I know that there are much worse things. For example, being exposed to the virus. Now we can only wait for the situation to relax again. We all have to trust the experts and stay patient. So I’m preparing myself every day for an unknown date. With every injury, or preparation, you always have to set yourself a goal. But at the moment unfortunately all we can do it wait and see. Will it continue in May? Or in June? No one can answer that right now<br /><br />You read something different every day and not even the experts agree on this, so it’s difficult for me to make an assessment. All I can say is that I really miss football and want to be back on the pitch as soon as possible. We have no choice but to trust the experts and to be ready for when we are told to start again. If it does continue then it will probably be behind closed doors, but that would also be fine. It’s important that we find solutions, without taking people’s health lightly. Purely from a sporting point of view, it would of course be the fairest thing to do if the season was still somehow finished</p>
