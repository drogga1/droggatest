It was completely different for me, but the team helped me and the coach too. They gave me a lot to improve and be comfortable on the pitch.

<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are set to make a last-ditch attempt to extend Leroy Sane’s contract and ward off interest from <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. Sane’s current deal expires in 2021 and City have been trying to reach a new agreement for over a year, but a lack of progress has opened the door to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> and other suitors</p>

Leroy Sane was forced off in the opening stages of their Community Shield match against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.

  <p><b>[Leroy Sane feeling confident after making return in boost for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>]</b> It felt really good. It was good to get a general feeling of how it is to be back on the pitch and how quick it can all be. There’s still a gap until I’m 100 per cent and on the level I was before. There’s no doubt about that, but generally, everything feels good. I feel confident and I had no problems, so I am happy with today. Of course it would be good if I could get back as soon as possible to the best I can be, like I was before. But I’m not putting a lot of pressure on myself to do that. I have to get used to the tempo and how quick it is because if you’re out for the time I was, you have to get up to speed</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> star Sane opens up on injury nightmare]</b> The whole team supported me, of course. But I was especially talking to <a href="ilkay-gundogan.html">Gundogan</a> and <a href="benjamin-mendy.html">Mendy</a> a little bit more about the injury, what they did, what could happen and their experience with everything. It helped me a lot to know how certain stuff feels and what can happen. It helped me and I’m very pleased that they pushed me along with that<br /><br />It was the hardest and longest injury that I’ve ever had in my career. Especially the first day after the surgery because you can’t move at all and that’s not something any of us athletes are used to. You have to push yourself every day because you know it’s a long rehab, but it is a good opportunity to work more on other weaknesses and that’s why I took it as a chance to recover well and come back strong</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> star Leroy Sane offers fitness update after eight months on the sidelines]</b> After being injured for such a long time I didn’t want to jump straight back in again, but rather take the time that my body needed. That’s why I suggested that I should play for the youth team first so that I could get used to the speed of the game step by step. Lots of people were surprised but for me it was the logical first step to make; that’s what I planned to do from the start and what I told the coach. Overall I felt really good and was on the right track; I was on the verge of making my comeback. I still need one or two competitive games to get back to full fitness so that I can get my confidence back again, which is very important<br /><br />As I said I was on the verge of making my comeback; I had been working towards that for many months. Nevertheless, I can still continue to do that and I know that there are much worse things. For example, being exposed to the virus. Now we can only wait for the situation to relax again. We all have to trust the experts and stay patient. So I’m preparing myself every day for an unknown date. With every injury, or preparation, you always have to set yourself a goal. But at the moment unfortunately all we can do it wait and see. Will it continue in May? Or in June? No one can answer that right now<br /><br />You read something different every day and not even the experts agree on this, so it’s difficult for me to make an assessment. All I can say is that I really miss football and want to be back on the pitch as soon as possible. We have no choice but to trust the experts and to be ready for when we are told to start again. If it does continue then it will probably be behind closed doors, but that would also be fine. It’s important that we find solutions, without taking people’s health lightly. Purely from a sporting point of view, it would of course be the fairest thing to do if the season was still somehow finished</p>
