  <p><b>[Four years ago, Brazil were lucky to make the semi-finals]</b> Brazil were eliminated because of individual and collective mistakes, because of pure chance, and mainly because Belgium have four players who are among the best in the world in their positions <b>[Courtois, De Bruyne, Hazard and Lukaku]</b>. We have to let go of our pride and learn from the obvious: Against the best teams, the chances of each winning and losing are almost the same</p>
