  <p><b>[former Brazil striker Tostao on <a href="denilson.html">Denilson</a>]</b> We all thought it a bit strange when he went to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. He had played only a few times for his club. He was discreet, he never stood out. I only saw him a couple of times - he was basically a reserve</p>
