  <p>[Suso seeking Liverpool return but intends to honour Milan deal with €40m release clause] In a sense I became a man before I became a footballer. It was very hard with the lifestyle and language. But to this day I remember everything. I did not play that much but I got to know Steven Gerrard and be a team-mate of players such as Luis Suarez, Philippe Coutinho and Jamie Carragher. I’ll never forget my experience at Liverpool. Premier League football is different, I would call it special: I would like to play for Liverpool again some day. I grew up there and it is a big club.<br /><br />[While Liverpool may be the future for Suso, the present is very much Milan] I’m very happy at Milan. Always when there are rumours about me leaving I reiterate that I am happy here and I think the club is with me. I have a release clause [€40m] and that was something both the club and my agent wanted. If the club wants to continue to be among the top sides and count on me then I am here for them.</p>

  <p>[AC Milan winger Suso says the club is in a better place now than the ‘mess’ that was created under the previous Chinese ownership] Now everything has calmed down. After the mess of the Chinese (owners), now everything has changed with the Americans. They have brought club legends like Paolo Maldini and Leonardo in, people who know football and the club. (Maldini) watches a lot and speaks little. for what it is and is always close to us<br /><br />[On Gennaro Gattuso] In training and in the game, it’s like when he played, pure passion and intensity, but outside it’s something else, you can talk to him about everything. Italian football is very tactical. Demanding for offensive players and, for strikers, it is the most difficult place because every week you face well-organized defenses with teams that always know what to do.<br /><br />As for AC Milan? We are similar to Spain. Milan want to keep possession, I start from the end to cut towards the centre. The styles are very similar<br /><br />I would like to play against England. It would be great for me to play all the games. I think we saw what I can give the team, and for us, the one with England is the most important match. They know how to play and know how to hurt you. They have young players who are improving a lot</p>

  <p>[Suso hails ‘champion’ Gonzalo Higuain ahead of Milan derby] He’s a champion. You’ve seen him play before, but until you’re on the pitch and on the same team together and get to see how he moves, what he does, what he likes, what he doesn’t like…<br /><br />He talks and talks and talks. At times I want to pull over on the motorway and let him out!<br /><br />Physically and mentally, I think it’s the best moment of my career. It’s about timing. Choosing the right moment. Watching the body position of your opponent. Lionel Messi always does the same move and you know it’s coming but no one can stop him. To be clear, I’m not comparing myself to him. I think it’s just something that comes naturally to you<br /><br />[On Eden Hazard] He’s one of the best players to watch. The way he runs with the ball and goes into one-v-ones. He’s one of the players I like most</p>

  <p>[AC Milan winger Suso admits he is flattered by rumoured interest from Real Madrid] When the best teams in the world are interested in you, it is normal to be proud that things are going well. Who would not be happy for Real Madrid to be interested in you? To make the jump to one of the biggest teams in the world is always a happy thing.<br /><br />Playing at home [in Spain] is always beautiful, now I am in a country whose culture is very similar to the Spanish one and at the moment I am very happy there. I feel important in the team, I am very comfortable, I am happy and I get along quite well with the coach. It’s like when [Gattuso] played, the intensity he had as a coach has not lost it, when he finishes training he’s the nicest and friendliest person you can find, he’s the perfect man for the club we’re in<br /><br />[On Jordi Alba] The coach knows what he has to do, on this occasion he believes it is fair to bring [Alba] and I am very happy for him. We know he is one of the best</p>
