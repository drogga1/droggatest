  <p><b>[Inter Primavera midfielder Lucien Agoume discussed the reasons why he joined Inter this summer]</b> I had an idea in mind, that of saving the club. Sochaux is very important in our region and also in French football. It really meant leaving the club in the professional world. I see that now we are not bad … Later, for my growth, I thought that I should aim a little higher. I told myself that I had the opportunity to train every day with a great coach and with great players. I won’t say that I’m progressing more during training with Inter than during a Ligue 2 match, but when you train with <a href="marcelo-brozovic.html">Brozovic</a> or Sensi, you feel the growth</p>

  <p><b>[Inter Primavera midfielder Lucien Agoume discussed his move to the Nerazzurri]</b> I found out about two years ago when I was with France’s Under 16 national team. It was an honor, also because when I was a kid, I loved watching Inter. Of course, I remember the 2010 Champions League final with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, <a href="javier-zanetti.html">Zanetti</a> and <a href="diego-milito.html">Milito</a>. Even then I was already rooting for Inter, so when they told me they wanted me, it was exciting. When you play football, the dream is always to get to play in the most important teams. Inter was quick to realise this dream<br /><br />I’d like to say one thing first, it was a privilege for me to meet the mister. <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> is certainly one of the best coaches in the world, if not the best.<br /><br /><a href="borja-valero.html">Borja Valero</a> because of his experience and because we play in the same role. He has great qualities. But I also look at <a href="marcelo-brozovic.html">Brozovic</a> a lot. I’ve matured a lot since I’ve been in Milan<br /><br /><b>[Agoume touched on the best players in the world in his role]</b> There are many strong ones. Maybe my favorite is <a href="toni-kroos.html">Toni Kroos</a> from Real Madrid<br /><br />It’s true, ever since I started playing, they always told me I looked like <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, because I am physically similar to him. But if I’m honest, I don’t like the comparison. Not that I have anything against <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, he’s an example, but I just want to be Lucien Agoume<br /><br /><b>[He touched on his <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> debut, against <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> in December]</b> So far it has been the best moment of my young career. Making my debut at 17 with the Inter jersey, I think, is no small thing. It’s been a great satisfaction. It’s just a shame I didn’t win. I hope to have other opportunities<br /><br /><b>[Finally, Agoume spoke about his future and whether that will be at Inter or elsewhere on loan]</b> I only think about the pitch, the rest I leave to the people who follow me, my agents and the company to decide. I’m sure they’ll choose the best for me</p>

Not that I have anything against <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, he’s an example to follow, but I just want to be Lucien Agoume<br /><br /><b>[Rumours already abound that a loan move beckons for Agoume next season, with <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> yet to be convinced that he’s ready for the step up to becoming a <a href="inter-milan.html">Nerazzurri</a> regular]</b> I’m young. If I don’t play among the professionals this year it won’t be a problem, my moment will come</p>
