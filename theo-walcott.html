  <p><b>[Theo Walcott sees no reason why England cannot win Euro 2016 next summer]</b> I think this team is getting better and better, and that’s what we want to do going into the tournament next year. We’ve gone a long way towards that, so I am sure things are going to improve. There are big tests for us, but I believe in that dressing room. We are playing in the best league in the world, we’re improving every day, the players are playing at the top of their game. It’ll definitely be a big achievement if we can go far. I am sure that we can. The manager has got that in our system, that he believes in us. The belief is there, the confidence is there, so why not?.<br /><br />What can you say? Wayne has been doing it for years. It just shows how established he is as an England international and at Manchester United. He’s so good in the dressing room, he’s a winner. In training, he always wants to win - never wants to lose. He just wants to improve and improve this team. He has belief in this dressing room that this young talent can actually go on and do something special</p>

  <p><b>[Theo Walcott affirmed that England must back up their impressive record in qualifying with a strong showing at Euro 2016]</b> We have to be proud of ourselves. Having nine wins after the disappointment from the World Cup and bouncing back the way the players have done - the backroom staff have changed things and things are working for us. This team is definitely hungry and eager to do well. We want to make it 10 on Monday night. It is a nice little thing to have - we want to win every game but we will be more tested in these friendlies coming up <b>[against France and Spain in November]</b> and everyone wants to win competitions and make this country proud. There are some young, eager faces in that dressing room who are keen to do well but we are only going to be judged when it comes to tournament football.</p>

  <p><b>[Theo Walcott says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are mentally stronger now than they have ever been]</b> The mental strength in this dressing room’s the strongest it’s ever been. When you have the likes of <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a> come into the dressing room as well he just enhances that. He’s a leader in that dressing room as well. He’s lifted everybody’s heads up in that dressing room today saying this is a very good point, no one tends to win here. We’ve just got to look at him because he’s obviously been at the top level and won many things. We all have the belief he’s got that we can push on<br /><br />After the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game, we’re looking back at that and there are two points dropped at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. You always felt here it was going to be a tough match. All the big clubs that have come here have always struggled and they <b>[Stoke]</b> have managed to get a positive result. There were a few mixed emotions in there, to be honest, but it’s probably a positive result reflecting back at the game<br /><br />We felt from the start physically we were up for the fight and the battle and tried to unease them. We managed to do that. It’s a shame we couldn’t get the result we desperately wanted but it’s an improvement from previous performances here. We’ve got to be proud of that point<br /><br />It shows how difficult this <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is. You can’t tell what’s going to happen this year, it’s just so tight. The amount of teams that could potentially win this league, it’s probably going to be the most exciting <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> for a neutral ever. No one can call it at this moment in time but we’re top of the league and we can be proud of that</p>

  <p><b>[Theo Walcott has ignored Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez as he identified Gareth Bale as the third best player in world football]</b> If I’m being honest I didn’t think he’d be, for me now, the third best player in the world. It’s just my opinion. When you think he’s a left-back and kept moving up and up and now can obviously play at No.10, left-wing, right-wing and some of the goals he scores. He’s proving me wrong, that’s for sure. It just shows, it’s hard work. It’s what it comes down to.<br /><br /><b>[Walcott also reflected on his time as a team-mate of Bale’s at Southampton]</b> We’re the same age. We used to live in the same room together at the lodge at Southampton. We loved messing about. It just shows, you put your head down, you work hard you can do anything. You just have to put your mind to it. You look at him as an athlete as well, he’s got all the attributes you want as a footballer. He’s only going to improve. He’s still relatively young and he’s done a lot. He’s playing very well for Wales, him and <b>[Aaron]</b> Ramsey taking Wales to a different level. It’s good to see, I’m really pleased for him</p>

  <p><b>[Theo Walcott has revealed that he enjoys something of a telepathic on-field relationship with Wayne Rooney]</b> We have a good bond. He knows the sort of runs I make. When he gets the ball it’s the first thing he thinks ‘where’s Theo going to make this run’ so I don’t even need to look at times. He spoke to me about that in the past. I’ve got a shirt at home with a lovely message on there. He’s a winner. Off the pitch he’s a great person to talk to. Makes a lot of sense. He’s got a lot of good points as well. He’s not afraid to say what he’s thinking. I like that. To play at the level he’s played at for so long, break so many records, you’ve got to be a good player.</p>

  <p><b>[Theo Walcott relieved to overcome ‘bogey side’ Southampton in FA Cup]</b> We know how it’s been when we come to Southampton, they tend to be our bogey side to be honest. But from the word go, we were ready. We’ve been lacking on poor starts lately. It’s nice that we created a lot of chances and we tucked them away, and it’s a clean sheet which is what we aim for in any game. A lot of changes today were made. We’ve managed to do our talking on the pitch.<br /><br />We’re on the pitch, we just try to do our job. When things are going well it’s great, it’s obviously important for the manager to be there, but he was in the dressing room before and after the game and during half-time, but we know our jobs. We’ve been in the game for a long time, we’ve got so much experience and we wanted to get the win today<br /><br />It’s been so long now, I’ve had some great memories and Southampton always will be in my heart without a doubt. I enjoyed playing football here at the time and obviously I’ve enjoyed tonight. Fantastic game today, but Southampton are a strong team. They’ve obviously done very well in the cup competition - I’ll be cheering them on in the final and they’re very strong in the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Theo Walcott issues rallying cry after Arsenal bust-ups]</b> Things get taken out of proportion - we all know this. There are certain things that happen at training grounds. I’m sure it happens at every other training ground, most of the time, really. You don’t see it often at Arsenal. Things have happened. They need to stay in the dressing room and the players and staff need to sort it out. We are in it together here. We can’t be fighting each other.<br /><br />I don’t really want to go into it but the stuff that has gone on did not affect our first half here <b>[the 5-1 defeat to Bayern Munich]</b>. At certain times when things don’t go well, you don’t want to have anything in your head that you are giving up. The 5-1 scoreline looks like we have given up but we haven’t. It just looks like that. That’s the disappointing thing because we know as players we don’t give up<br /><br />The players are like everybody else - we don’t really know what’s going on. We just want to try to focus on the football. The manager is focused on us. You can see how passionate he is with us from the way he talks to us in the meetings. He will take this on himself but us players need to look at ourselves. The manager has been taking a lot of flak in recent weeks and us players have been accepting it, but we can’t. We need to take the pressure off the manager and that will happen by performances. Who knows what the manager will do? Players just want to play football for this club and do well for the manager</p>

I’m pleased with this decision and I’m definitely pleased to be here alongside Wayne. I’m someone who wanted to be part of something and Wayne felt part of Everton again. That’s why he came back here. He said he had other offers but felt Everton was unfinished business. He wanted them to reach the levels he’s reached as a player. He believes that this club, going forward, can create history again. There’s so much desire there and that’s what I wanted. It just felt like the right decision for me. It’s been mad. I just want to get on that football field</p>

  <p><b>[Theo Walcott trades Arsene Wenger and Arsenal for Sam Allardyce and Everton]</b> I had that short stint with Sam with England and to see it now every day, the way the intensity of training is and how demanding it is has been great. I like to go into training every day and try to be better than the day before. Sam was one of the main reasons why I came to the club. I wanted a manager like that who could get the best out of me. He is eager to turn results around. There have been a few recent results like getting the draw against West Brom and then beating Leicester City where we have seen improved performances but I have come here to push Everton on. I want to improve the team and anything I can do to help, I will do so. Results will change, I am sure of it. We need to make sure we are ready and focused for the weekend because we need to start getting some more points in order to be more comfortable.<br /><br />I have settled really quickly. When you get to go to events like that and you can get nice and personal with the fans, it’s brilliant. My experiences of Goodison, however brief so far, have been amazing and given the fact how tight it is, the fans are always behind the team. I loved it straight away. Having the opportunity to meet with the fans was really good. I feel like Everton can go up and up. It is the right place for me to be</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott admit to having similar motives for forcing Arsenal exits]</b> I feel it was the right time. The loyalty I had for Arsenal and Arsene Wenger meant I could do it the right way. It was time for me to experience something different but still be competitive. The season didn’t start off how we wanted but Everton are going in right direction. I never knew what it was going to be like having been at Arsenal for so long and coming to somewhere completely different, but the fans have taken to me and been so welcoming. I’m pleased with how passionate they are, it’s one reason why I came here because I feel like they’re competitive and want to improve. The first time walking about at Goodison Park… you can’t explain it. Then, when I scored my first goal, the emotion came out. It was about enjoying my football again</p>

  <p><b>[Theo Walcott admits he fell out of love with football]</b> I’m not going to lie, I fell out of love with football for a little bit. Because I had some good performances, but then just didn’t get the chance to play on. Scoring over 100 goals for Arsenal is a great achievement for me personally, and then just the last year-and-a-half was tough, I can’t lie. It was really tough, not being able to get into the team, being in and out. I just felt I wanted to get the excitement of football again. I didn’t feel like it was going to be at Arsenal then. Sam <b>[Allardyce]</b> at the time got in contact, and I felt ‘yeah, this is the right move for me’. I got the buzz and enjoyment back, and I couldn’t be in a happier place to be honest, I’m playing football with a smile on my face. I just love football again.<br /><br /><b>[Leaving]</b> was tough, it really was, I can’t lie. When you’re used to something for so long it’s a difficult decision, but I felt like it was the right one for me. The hardest thing was leaving my family for a certain amount of time before they moved up. That was the missing piece of the puzzle, which only has just sort of kicked into place at the start of this season. It always felt I was I was a little bit at Arsenal, and a little bit here. We obviously played Arsenal two weeks after I moved <b>[losing 5-1]</b>, and it still felt like I was a little bit there, because it was too soon.</p>

  <p><b>[Everton forward Theo Walcott has credited his switch to the Toffees for reigniting his passion for football]</b> wasn’t enjoying it. I’ll be honest. I was frustrated, I wasn’t playing, I didn’t play a lot of the games. Having spent so much time there, done so well, it does hurt, but that’s gone now. I had great times but I feel like I’m going to have even greater times here, I really do. I also feel like I’m playing with a smile on my face. If I’m doing that then the best will come out.<br /><br />I genuinely believe, the football we are playing, the way the manager can take us, is above Arsenal and more. That’s the reason I joined the club, with the young talent coming through and the signings. I feel like we’re nearly there, I really do. With Marco Silva, the way he coaches players, he has that knowledge, he wants the best out of you. He wants something out of you all the time and, having seen him work in a short space of time, it’s only going to improve</p>

  <p><b>[Jadon Sancho won’t be fazed by the pressure of representing England]</b> He can deal with it, he’s been in the Dortmund dressing room, he’s played at their stadium which is fantastic. He won’t be fazed at all. It’s completely different now, there are a lot of young players in that group. When I came through there was Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard - completely established players in the team - so it’s a different environment I would say. Of course, it’s still daunting, but when you get down on the field and play football that’s all you want to do, you just want to play, it doesn’t matter who it’s for. You just want to go out there and do your best and I’m sure everyone will. The young players with England is fantastic to see and they’ve just got to take their chances. Good luck to them all.</p>

  <p><b>[Everton forward Theo Walcott has set his sights on an improbable top-four finish this season]</b> Me personally, I’m hoping for a top-four finish, I really am. I’ve set my goals really high. I’m a positive guy so I genuinely think we’re going in the right direction. You need to be realistic as well and think maybe that’s a bit too far-fetched, but I think sixth is reachable. We just have to start turning those draws into wins, it’s as simple as that. We’re not far off, I really don’t think we are. I think you can judge us fairly when everyone is back fit.</p>

But we are in good spirits, we are in good form, we’re enjoying ourselves. It’s obviously well documented <b>[United’s struggles]</b> but the players they have, it’s not going to be an easy game. But we know our strengths, we know what to do to obviously keep the fans quiet, that’s the most important thing. We need to focus on ourselves really, not them. We need to do the stuff that the manager drills into us every day in training and if we do that and if everyone works to the ability we know we can, we have a very good chance.</p>

  <p><b>[Theo Walcott considers Arsene Wenger to have unfinished business in the coaching world]</b> I still think he’s got unfinished business and there’s a missing chapter for him. He’s a father figure, he gave me the opportunity at a young age, took the pressure off me and put it on himself when he didn’t need to do it.<br /><br /><b>[Walcott has reiterated that he was not enjoying life at Emirates Stadium]</b> I wasn’t enjoying it. I’ll be honest. I was frustrated I wasn’t playing, I didn’t play a lot of the games. Having spent so much time there, done so well, it does hurt, but that’s gone now. I had great times but I feel like I’m going to have even greater times here at Everton, I really do<br /><br />I’ve got a good six or seven years left in me. I look after myself well, my kids keep me healthy. But I don’t think I will go into management when I do finish, it’s not for me. I like working with children, maybe a striking coach with kids or something. Possibly a bit of TV as well</p>

But, fingers crossed, they can come back, I’ve enjoyed every minute with them and they’ve been a big boost for us. We’ll see, who knows? I’m like a fan, we want the best players to sign for Everton and they’re definitely two of them</p>

  <p><b>[Theo Walcott say ahead of the Canaries’ visit to Goodison Park]</b> The win at <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> was very important for us, obviously. It was important to get the three points. I felt like the performance didn’t really matter at times, I felt like we just needed the three points to get us that winning feeling (away from home) again. We showed good signs, especially in the first half, but we just need to be a bit more clinical come the final third. But I felt like it was a well-deserved three points and we can hopefully build on that<br /><br /><b>[Walcott returned to Silva’s starting line-up recently and hopes he is finding form]</b> I’m personally pleased. Obviously I’ve worked very hard to get into the starting line-up and I just want to stay there. Results have picked up as well which is always a positive when you’re in the team, the team is winning and doing well. That’s always a nice feeling<br /><br />I missed the <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> game (a 1-0 away defeat) because of precautions of concussion and, before that, I’d worked so hard to get in the team against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and obviously that (the concussion) happens. But you can’t dwell on it really, you just need to focus on the next day and try to get back and look forward to training again. That’s all I could do. Then the manager has given me a chance to get back in the team and I thank him for that and hopefully I can just stay there and the team can keep climbing up the table</p>

  <p><b>[Walcott laughs again as he recalls a conversation with <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> prior to the game at Vicarage Road]</b> He came to me and said ‘Theo, you do know that you’re allowed to score goals, right?’. I just had to laugh. And lo and behold I go and get my first of the season. I told him afterwards that I was just waiting for his permission!<br /><br /><b>[The <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> effect is clearly taking hold at Goodison Park]</b> He has this aura of calm. It’s like ‘don’t panic, everything is OK’, and that really stands out with him. Everyone had high expectations when he came in. I know I did, having played against his teams in the past. I knew he was a top manager<br /><br /><b>[Walcott would know a top manager when he sees one, of course, having spent 12 years under the guidance of the great <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> There are similarities between the two, 100 per cent. They both have an aura, and they both want to build relationships with players. Carlo will talk to you about anything. He was asking my opinion on what wine he should buy recently. I mean, I’d have said he was more an expert in that field! He should be telling me. But that’s just a small example of him, he’s talking to players and getting to know them as people. Those things make a difference<br /><br /><b>[on <a href="moise-kean.html">Moise Kean</a>, the 19-year-old striker signed from <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> last summer]</b> He’s 19 and coming to a whole new country, new culture, language, way of playing. It’s hard, you know! It feels like we put a lot of pressure on players who don’t ask for it. They just want to enjoy their football, but it always takes time to settle in a new environment, especially when you’re moving countries. He’s done very well in Italy, and now he’s adapting to English life and English football well. He’s a workaholic. He does some mad things with the ball, and he’s probably the strongest guy I’ve ever come across as well. I mean, Yerry <b>[Mina]</b> is a big unit but Moise can more than hold his own in that battle! I was so pleased when he got his first goal, because you could see the emotion in his face. He’s worked so hard, firstly to get his move and then since. I’ve been there myself and I know how it feels.

At times at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> he was in and out, and he was tried in different positions. Here, I feel he can express himself a lot more and use his attributes, his skills and his energy. I’m not the manager, but I feel like he likes to be on the ball, be in the middle of the game and express himself.<br /><br />He’s a great athlete, he looks after himself. He doesn’t come to the gym with me and Mason <b>[Holgate]</b> yet, but I’ll try my best! He’s a great kid and he’s really settled well. I was really excited when he came having worked with him before. I knew he was always going to fit right in<br /><br /><b>[As for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, they’re ready to put the difficulties of 2019 behind them]</b> We are our best critics. We have high standards, and we know where the club should be. There’s no reason why we can’t be finishing in the top six. We have got the manager and we have got the squad. We’re desperate to make history, because the club has been deprived of that for too long. If we can be the team that starts that process, working towards success and trophies, then that’d mean everything</p>
