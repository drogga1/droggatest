  <p>[Santos Laguna, Toluca share history, chip on shoulder heading into Liga MX final] It’s a very passionate city, and yeah it adds pressure. Pressure is what a player wants: A full stadium, a footballing atmosphere</p>

  <p>[Santos Laguna pulls out another home win, but one-goal advantage might not be enough to win Liga MX] It’s total satisfaction for the result and for the guys’ efforts and above all being able to make the fans happy. We have to win playing, playing well, trying to take advantage of our chances and despite the fact that we didn’t start the game well we were able to get an advantage and put ourselves on top for the second leg. I think that’s been the characteristic of this team, to always put in a good effort, give 100 percent and once more we played a very tough game to try to play and put in a good effort. I think we were able to give our fans a lot of satisfaction. The series is open, it’s not closed and overall we played a good match</p>

It’s an enormous honor to defend these colors, to defend the organization. I’m happy for everyone who has supported us, helped us and put their confidence in us for this job and I hope everyone and all of us enjoy [the success]..</p>

  <p>[Santos Laguna manager Robert Siboldi handed in his resignations Wednesday] During the weekend, it was brought to our attention that there have been a series of differences between the coaching staff which derive from a conflict with a player breaking the code of ethics in an irreparable manner, creating an atmosphere that is not proper for the good of the team and that goes against the philosophy and the values of the institution. For this reason, the coaching staff, recognizing the seriousness of its actions and omissions, present its resignation and the club decided to accept it…</p>
