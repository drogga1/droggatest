  <p><b>[Wilfredo Caballero insists <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> still in title race]</b> We are going to fight until the end. We want to be involved in the fight for the title and we will fight until the last game to compete with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and the others. We are a little bit far away from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> now but we have to do our job and win the next game. We must go step-by-step and have a bit of luck to see <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> drop some points. We are a big team and we have to focus on big achievements</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea goalkeeper Caballero signs new one-year contract]</b> I am very happy to renew my contract with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and hopefully we can enjoy the next season and achieve a lot of targets. For me to stay at a big club like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> was a really easy decision</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea goalkeeper Willy Caballero says he feels blessed after the club activated their option to extend his contract]</b> I am very happy to make this announcement. It is a privilege to be part of this <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> squad and the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> family, at one of the most historic clubs in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It is a difficult time for everyone right now so I feel blessed by this opportunity and truly appreciate it. I want to thank my team-mates for helping me to be my best and I want to thank the boss and the club for extending my contract. I’m sure they will continue to demand the maximum from me and I will compete with the same energy as always. I am very happy.</p>

  <p><b>[former <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> goalkeeper Caballero says Training with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> is like going to university]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> is like going to university. I spent a year with him at City, learning something new every day. On the playing field, watching videos or at any time, when he approaches you and explains things to you. He has no problem teaching someone at 34 years old, as I was, like someone who is 18. He is a great teacher<br /><br /><b>[Caballero only made 23 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> appearances for City but was a regular in the cups]</b> <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Manuel Pellegrini</a> had convinced me to go with him to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. I was doing very well at <a href="malaga-fc.html">Malaga</a>, but I accepted. He had promised to keep me as a starter in the cup, although in the league, the starter was <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a>, the England national team’s goalkeeper. We reached the final and we had to play it against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. There was a lot of pressure for <a href="joe-hart.html">Hart</a> to start the game. But <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Pellegrini</a> said, ‘I’d rather lose a title than lose my word.’ It kept me going and we won the cup<br /><br /><b>[Caballero also spoke about his new contract at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, which will see him stay at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> until 2021]</b> I really appreciate having renewed for another year with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> at 38. I always look back because I had a hard time getting to where I am. When I started at Boca, as well as when I got to the national team, I felt it was the top of the mountain, but they turned me around and I had to start from scratch. I went back to the second division in Spain and it served to give value to what I have now</p>

  <p><b>[Caballero reveals death threats after mistake for Argentina vs Croatia at 2018 World Cup]</b> With the mistake for Croatia’s goal I went to lift it to give it to Toto Salvio, but I hit the ground. The ball had an unexpected effect and it went to Rebic. Everyone thought I wanted to chip it but it wasn’t like that; I never hit a ball like that in my life. I wanted to lift it and hit it long because the two strikers were coming. The day after my mistake at the World Cup, everyone had my number. I did not have a good time. Very extreme messages were sent to me, including death threats. And they made me think a lot about my family and my future<br /><br /><b>[After his mistake, Caballero was dropped by manager <a href="jorge-sampaoli.html">Jorge Sampaoli</a>. Franco Armani, then at Atletico Nacional, played the rest of Argentina’s games at the tournament and Caballero hasn’t played for Argentina since]</b> I would have wanted one more chance to play and vindicate myself, but I understood Jorge’s decision. In addition, Franco came in and played very well. The one who confirmed that he was playing was me.<br /><br /><b>[Caballero has spoken of his delight at extending his stay in west London, and he also added that he has no desire to finish his career back in his home country]</b> I could go back to Argentina to live, but not to play. I started another life when I had to start from scratch in Spain <b>[joining Elche in 2005]</b>. So I never set a goal to return</p>
