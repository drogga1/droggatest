  <p><b>[Willy Caballero is aware that Manchester City need to defend better]</b> We know that we have to defend better than we have been doing and we know it will be tough, but I think we can win and go through. I think Crystal Palace is always a tough place to go. It won’t be easy to go there and win but they’ve had a complicated season so far and need to a lift so beating us in the FA Cup is something they’ll be looking to do to kick-start their season. Every team left in the competition wants to win the FA Cup but for us, we have the added incentive of the frustration of not beating Tottenham and the loss at Everton and because we are out of the Capital One Cup we are now focused on the FA Cup<br /><br />This is another motivation for me to get to Wembley. After the Capital One Cup final, everything changed for me and I felt a lot of affection from the City fans and I’ve really enjoyed it since. I’ll never forget that day against Liverpool and I’m sure all our players and fans want to repeat that experience but in another cup competition. We haven’t won the FA Cup for six years and we want to put that right</p>

  <p><b>[Willy Caballero insists Claudio Bravo’s reaction to being dropped from the Manchester City team has been fantastic]</b> It’s not an easy week for him but his behaviour is fantastic. He supports me and we are working really hard and he has a competitive mind so he’s doing very well. <b>[Guardiola]</b> told me before the West Ham game that I was going to play. I accepted it immediately, I loved it immediately and I tried to do my best during the game. <b>[Against Swansea]</b> I had another opportunity so I try to be positive and concentrated on every single ball. But it was a decision and I try to be working really hard for the rest of the week but he always makes the decision for the team.<br /><br /><b>[Caballero is now charged with the task of tightening things up for City]</b> I have to improve all the time. I feel that I improved with my feet from the time the boss arrived here. Not just me, the centre-backs, the full-backs – we have to play from the back and do a lot of things with the ball now and for sure we have to improve. Claudio is a fantastic player, a fantastic keeper and we have to respect him because he is probably the keeper <b>[with the most]</b> titles in his country in the last two years</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City goalkeeper Willy Caballero says that working under Pep Guardiola has been a priceless educational experience]</b> You can learn a lot from Pep Guardiola. From pre-season to the match itself. He has a vision of the game that is impressive. Being able to hear him speak is priceless. He explains all the strategies: why play from the goalkeeper, why the numbers are important from the start, why we sometimes play with three, four or five defenders, how to find free spaces and attack. His advice to me is to be more in control of the ball. For those of us who love football, his coaching is very formative.<br /><br />Pellegrini as a coach likes the team to be in control of the ball, and go forward. He has the forwards attack the opponents, and that’s when cracks and figures are made. ​ ​​We didn’t play from the back, like Guardiola likes, but we worked hard on pressing in the opponent’s half<br /><br />There’s almost no goalkeeper that played from beginning to end, we all have to compete with other professionals, and be patient. Being able to be in such a big club is very satisfying, because it means I must have done something right. In general, this kind of institution looks for young players with bright futures. That was not my case, I wasn’t young, so that means I must have had a good track record. I’ve been abroad for many years now, and I’m not on my own now, I have my family with me, and I need to think for the best for them, I don’t owe anyone, and I’m not crazy about going back right now. When the year finishes, and depending on what happens in City, I’ll think about what’s best for everyone</p>

  <p><b>[Willy Caballero not satisfied with Man City victory]</b> I made a mistake in the first goal and we have a lot of things to improve, but we never gave up and the team was strong today, even when we conceded easy goals. We stayed in the game and finish up winning the game. It was a crazy game. Fortunately we won but we have to play against this fantastic team again. We have to enjoy this but we don’t have anything yet. The most important thing is we recover our mentality and team spirit.<br /><br />Fortunately for me and the team I chose one side. We studied Falcao and the rest of the penalty takers a lot and I have been lucky today to choose the right side</p>

I have to keep going and after we will speak with the club and my agent.<br /><br />I tried to be focused when Claudio started to play again and I trained well. I kept my professionalism and unfortunately he probably can’t play until next season but I trained really hard for this opportunity and I am now focused on Claudio and me, on the team</p>

In every training session, we train a lot on strategy, tactics and movement to do everything what the team did last season by winning a lot of games. So he is a very good coach.<br /><br /><b>[Blues were defeated 2-1 by Inter in their final pre-season match]</b> It was a great pre-season. Not the best result but… we played every game until the last minute against great teams. We have to take this and start the Community Shield on a strong note as it will be a great match</p>

  <p><b>[Willy Caballero knew that Thibaut Courtois was destined for greatness after facing the current Chelsea number one as a teenager]</b> I saw him in his first season <b>[at Atletico]</b> and he was fantastic. I couldn’t believe he was just 18 years old, with the kind of saves he was making and his personality. He was fantastic and in that moment I saw he was going to be a great goalkeeper for many years, because not too many keepers can play at 18 years old for a big club and do it properly. You had to have character to play in goal for a club like that at that age.<br /><br />David de Gea was the previous goalkeeper at Atletico, and for Thibaut to arrive there. at a big stadium like the Vicente Calderon, wasn’t easy, but his mentality helped him to do it properly. I had a chat with him after our games against Atletico and I realised he was also a great man. Now I am working with him every day I see he is even better and we have a good relationship. We are laughing all the time, enjoying every day. I try to support him when he plays and he’s a fantastic guy.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea goalkeeper Willy Caballero offered his advice on how to stop his countryman Lionel Messi]</b> He’s unpredictable. When you are watching a game on TV the commentator might say, ‘He’s going to do this or that’ but the reality is he is capable of doing things even better or faster or more unpredictable than people think.<br /><br />It is very hard work to control him but it doesn’t come down to a goalkeeper but the whole team. It is the coach who will decide how to plan for the game. Moreover, having players like Pedro or Cesc <b>[Fabreas]</b> who have played there <b>[at Barcelona]</b> we don’t need to discuss too much their style. Without doubt for those of us that have played in La Liga we know more than enough about this team, it goes without saying what this team can do. It doesn’t matter if they change players or coaches, their way of playing remains the same, but it also means the way of causing them problems remains the same. It’s just a memory <b>[beating Barca with Man City]</b> and for sure I will be on the bench come Tuesday so maybe I can tell them what it’s like to beat Barca</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea goalkeeper Willy Caballero has said that the FA Cup is of vital importance for his side]</b> Every time I walk around Cobham I see a lot of pictures of the team winning trophies, so for this we have the obligation and ambition to go for it. This is a very important game after what we’ve done in the other competitions this season. We have to play it as a final. We are happy because all of our supporters are going to be at Wembley, but the most important thing is to ride to the final and win another trophy. To finish the season playing a final and winning a trophy means we can finish well. The most important is to win again and put the name of our club on top again.<br /><br />I enjoy playing not just because it’s a cup, but because it’s a great achievement for me to be in a big team. Playing in the Carabao Cup, the FA Cup, the Premier League, every game is very important for me. To have this kind of opportunity after long years of fighting for this, I feel blessed. I try to enjoy every game and try to do my best to help the team</p>

I have played in every game. But, for the final, we will see. I have to train very well. But we will see what the starting XI is that Antonio chooses to play in the final and they have to be ready. It doesn’t have to be fair - it’s the decision of the boss. And I have to respect what he chooses for this game. There is not an agreement. As I say, when I started I knew that I would start in the cups. I always train so I am ready to play, I want to play.<br /><br />I think I am in good form, I don’t know if it’s the best or not. But this form and my experience means I am in a very good team and I am in the national team, so I am very happy. City has helped me and Chelsea has helped me to be in the national squad. Yes, of course, after three years playing derbies against them, now playing in a final it’s going to be very exciting, and I think there will be a lot of supporter friends from City who will be Chelsea fans <b>[for this game]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Willy Caballero has praised Kepa Arrizabalaga for how well he has adapted to the Premier League]</b> First of all, we needed a goalkeeper who plays really well with his feet. He is doing really well with that; he has confidence and a good pass. Long and short. As well as that, he has very quick reactions, good hands and he is doing well. I thought he might need a few weeks and months because adaptation to the Premier League sometimes needs a little bit of time but from the first game, he has been doing really well. I think that football has gone crazy in the last three or four years. When we talk about a player for the money that we spent, in this market, I think it is a little bit crazy. We shouldn’t talk about money, we have to talk about his performances and I think his performances have been really good.</p>
