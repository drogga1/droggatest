  <p><b>[Edson Alvarez, being involved in Thursday’s event in Mexico City provides motivation to get himself out of the fringe and onto the final 23-man list]</b> Being here for the presentation of the new shirt makes me very hopeful about everything that could be coming. Really, it’s a personal challenge. I’m taking it on with a lot of responsibility. There’s a little less than a year until then and a lot of things can happen in a year.</p>

  <p><b>[Edson Alvarez, young Mexico players can seize Wales chance to make World Cup roster]</b> We’re professionals, we know things happen and that we can be on the list. We know those who go and represent us will put in their best effort, will fight for the shirt. The group is calm. We know there are still two games to show ourselves, put our hand up and prove we can win our place.</p>

  <p><b>[How Mexico’s Edson Alvarez converted practice squad experience into World Cup roster spot]</b> Of course. The truth is from the first time I was called I couldn’t believe it, being a young guy who at that time was 18 or 19 years old. I felt really happy to be involved with these stars, with these ‘cracks’ who have done a lot of things in their careers. They’ve come to me giving me advice, advice on the field as well. I feel really fortunate to have been in with the group because with this I grew daily, I became more and more professional from what they told me and really they’re things I can’t describe to you because they showed me their experience and gave me confidence and made me feel really, really good.<br /><br /><b>[With Reyes struggling with a hamstring problem, Alvarez suddenly has a spot on the squad - helped along by Nestor Araujo’s continuing knee issues that forced him out of the squad]</b> Of course it’s sad. Nobody wishes anyone any ill, especially not a teammate. We feel sad but we have to do our job. It’s part of the game. Unfortunately it happened to him but he knows we’re supporting him and are there for him at all times and we can’t do anything except for continue forward<br /><br />If you’re a player in Europe, it’s because you deserve to be. You’ve done something right. My dream also is to play in Europe</p>

But his health comes first. Personally, it would’ve great to play against him.<br /><br />We’ve shown that in adversity, when we are the underdogs we step up. I like these challenges… what better way to show our quality than now, against a great team in front of their fans? We all want to play the game already</p>

  <p><b>[He’s currently the starting holding midfielder in Martino’s 4-3-3 but went to the World Cup last year as a right back]</b> Really, I’m comfortable in the middle, I feel really comfortable as a five. I don’t dislike playing center back either. It’s a position where I started my career, even going back to the academy days, when I was just starting I was playing center back. To be honest, right back isn’t my strongest position. At the end of the day, though, I’ve always said that’s football and at the time the manager needed me there. I wanted to show him I that I was able to do it<br /><br /><b>[Alvarez recalled last year]</b> I couldn’t believe it, being a young guy who at that time was 18 or 19 years old.
