  <p><b>[Mexico defender Alvarez disappointed El Tri won’t get to face Messi]</b> It would’ve been really nice to face <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. But his health comes first. Personally, it would’ve great to play against him.<br /><br />We’ve shown that in adversity, when we are the underdogs we step up. I like these challenges… what better way to show our quality than now, against a great team in front of their fans? We all want to play the game already</p>

  <p><b>[Gregg Berhalter watched his team attack Mexico’s defense relentlessly in the first half]</b> They got tired a little in the second half and we took advantage of the spaces. We took advantage of our intensity to take the ball from them on their side of the field and that was a turning point</p>

  <p><b>[Prior to Mexico’s 1-0 win over the United States in the Gold Cup final, Edson Alvarez insisted his head was totally on the match but allowed that his mind still is set on moving abroad]</b> Right now my mind is 100 per cent on tomorrow’s game. It’s a tournament and a trophy that I don’t have on my personal list yet. We’ll see about Europe later, with more calmness. Obviously I’m really hopeful to go to European football</p>

  <p><b>[He’s currently the starting holding midfielder in Martino’s 4-3-3 but went to the World Cup last year as a right back]</b> Really, I’m comfortable in the middle, I feel really comfortable as a five. I don’t dislike playing center back either. It’s a position where I started my career, even going back to the academy days, when I was just starting I was playing center back. To be honest, right back isn’t my strongest position. At the end of the day, though, I’ve always said that’s football and at the time the manager needed me there. I wanted to show him I that I was able to do it<br /><br /><b>[Alvarez recalled last year]</b> I couldn’t believe it, being a young guy who at that time was 18 or 19 years old. I felt really happy to be involved with these stars, with these ‘cracks’ who have done a lot of things in their careers. They’ve come to me giving me advice, advice on the field as well. I feel really fortunate to have been in with the group because with this I grew daily<br /><br /><b>[It was a frustrating end to his America tenure, with injuries limiting him and keeping him out of the Liguilla in the Clausura]</b> Possibilities are opening up. I’m really happy to be more and more close to this dream that I desire with all my heart and hopefully it will be the best for me</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico star Edson Alvarez reveals he would like to play for Manchester City]</b> I would really like to play for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> one day. I have been following that club since childhood and I think it is a really nice club, I am a fan. So if I had to choose I would like to play for City<br /><br /><b>[After initially being separated from family upon moving to the Netherlands]</b> Now I can use the time to be with my family. My daughter is doing well, she is healthy and that is the most important thing. It is nice to see how she grows and learns new things every day. That is then it’s great that I can now see that every day</p>
