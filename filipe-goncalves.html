  <p><b>[Filipe Goncalves says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> very happy at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> &amp; in great shape]</b> He seemed very happy with his experience in Italy, in <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> and in particular to play at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. He told me several times that the club is very large, organised and he has huge admiration for the <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> fans, who care so much about him<br /><br /><b>[Goncalves helped <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> to go through his paces at Madeira’s national stadium]</b> The training lasted an hour. But <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> arrived at the field after having already trained at home. And after the shots on goal he did technical exercises and shots. Sometimes I tried to run with him, but it is impossible to keep up with him: he is a beast! He is in great shape, he trained a lot in Madeira. Another partner of mine, <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> Andrade, started working with us. He is not a goalkeeper, he is a player to makes the last pass or cross. He was trying to serve <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> a little like <b>[Miralem]</b> <a href="miralem-pjanic.html">Pjanic</a> and <b>[Paulo]</b> <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> do.</p>
