  <p><b>[Aston Villa have announced the signing of Ahmed Elmohamdy from Hull City on a three-year deal after activating his release clause]</b> I am delighted to be here at Aston Villa. Aston Villa is a great club and I am thrilled to join - it’s one of the very biggest clubs in England and its history and tradition is there for all to see. It’s a great time to join too as we look for promotion to the Premier League. I will give absolutely everything to help us achieve that goal. I know, first hand, what it takes to win promotion and I want that feeling again</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah has been advised by Ahmed Elmohamady to ignore Real Madrid transfer talk]</b> His spell with Chelsea helped him a lot. He is a source of happiness and joy to us, in my opinion, I think he should stay at Liverpool. He’s the club’s superstar, but if he wants to leave he should leave after spending another season at Liverpool at least.</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah may be drawing comparisons to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> He’s been good at Roma. But for the level of Ronaldo and Messi, he has to do it for seven or eight years.<br /><br />It’s easy in training <b>[against him]</b>, but in a game he turns into a different player. He’s one of the best players in the world. I am happy for him. We are all happy for him. Mo-Mo is a great lad. He has been excellent this season. He is doing really well with Liverpool. Hopefully he can continue in the same form and help us in the World Cup. We need him. He is going to play a big part in the team. He took the chance to leave Chelsea and go away from the Premier League to prove everyone wrong. And he did it at Fiorentina and Roma then came back to the Premier League and you see what he can do now</p>

  <p><b>[Egypt captain Ahmed Elmohamady says <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> deserves to be recognised as one of the best three players in the world]</b> <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> is now one of the best three players in the world. This is a huge deal for the country and the Egyptian team. <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> being on any team will help it and be a great addition. Everybody anticipates his performance, so this is a positive thing and a good addition for the Egyptian team. As has been said, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> is one of the 23 players on the list. Each player will help the others. We play as one team, but having <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> with us is a positive thing and an important thing for us as a team and as players</p>

  <p><b>[Egypt vs DR Congo. Ahmed Elmohamady on his national team]</b> Our team was impacted by the pressure of the opening game and we aim to improve our performance against DR Congo. Playing at home and with our fans must be a motiviation and not be pressuring. We clearly dropped against Zimbabwe in the second half. Aguirre contemplated solutions with the players for this issue and the team will appear with an entirely different face against DR Congo.<br /><br /><b>[Moreover, he has backed an improved display from <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>]</b> He deals very well with pressure. He experienced tougher situations with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Egypt and his presence with us is vital due to his abilities and experience. He helps the players on the pitch greatly.</p>

  <p><b>[Another Egypt player, Ahmed Elmohamady, gave a show of support for Warda by signalling his team-mate’s No.22 with his fingers when celebrating his goal against DR Congo]</b> Amr Warda is one of us and we all make mistakes. We will not leave Warda alone. Warda represented Egypt on many occasions before, and what we should do is to stand by him. No player should be held accountable for anything done outside the pitch. We support Amr Warda</p>

  <p><b>[Ahmed Elmohamady has expressed his delight after committing himself to a further year with <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>]</b> I am absolutely delighted to extend my contract. Playing for <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> is unbelievable. It’s a great club and the fans are unbelievable. I am looking forward to continuing my stay here<br /><br />When I came here the main thing was to get back into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I had a first difficult season because we didn’t go up. But we did it last year. The Championship is the most difficult league in the world to get out of. But we had a successful year. We want another now<br /><br /><b>[Elmohamady feels that the team have performed admirably despite the results and is aiming to play his part in establishing the club back in the top division]</b> It’s been a difficult start. I think we played really well in the last two games. But sometimes we are unlucky with some mistakes. But if we continue playing well the luck will come. Our main target is to finish as high in the table as possible and be in the Premier League<br /><br />In the summer, we had new players coming in, who have had to settle in the club, it will take time. Some boys have played in this league before. For some of them, it’s new. Hopefully they can settle quick and we can get going</p>
