  <p><b>[Egypt captain Ahmed Elmohamady says Mohamed Salah deserves to be recognised as one of the best three players in the world]</b> Salah is now one of the best three players in the world. This is a huge deal for the country and the Egyptian team. Salah being on any team will help it and be a great addition. Everybody anticipates his performance, so this is a positive thing and a good addition for the Egyptian team. As has been said, Salah is one of the 23 players on the list. Each player will help the others. We play as one team, but having Salah with us is a positive thing and an important thing for us as a team and as players</p>

  <p><b>[Egypt vs DR Congo. Ahmed Elmohamady on his national team]</b> Our team was impacted by the pressure of the opening game and we aim to improve our performance against DR Congo. Playing at home and with our fans must be a motiviation and not be pressuring. We clearly dropped against Zimbabwe in the second half. Aguirre contemplated solutions with the players for this issue and the team will appear with an entirely different face against DR Congo.<br /><br /><b>[Moreover, he has backed an improved display from Mo Salah]</b> He deals very well with pressure. He experienced tougher situations with Liverpool and Egypt and his presence with us is vital due to his abilities and experience. He helps the players on the pitch greatly.</p>

  <p><b>[Another Egypt player, Ahmed Elmohamady, gave a show of support for Warda by signalling his team-mate’s No.22 with his fingers when celebrating his goal against DR Congo]</b> Amr Warda is one of us and we all make mistakes. We will not leave Warda alone. Warda represented Egypt on many occasions before, and what we should do is to stand by him. No player should be held accountable for anything done outside the pitch. We support Amr Warda</p>

  <p><b>[Ahmed Elmohamady has expressed his delight after committing himself to a further year with Aston Villa]</b> I am absolutely delighted to extend my contract. Playing for Aston Villa is unbelievable. It’s a great club and the fans are unbelievable. I am looking forward to continuing my stay here<br /><br />When I came here the main thing was to get back into the Premier League. I had a first difficult season because we didn’t go up. But we did it last year. The Championship is the most difficult league in the world to get out of. But we had a successful year. We want another now<br /><br /><b>[Elmohamady feels that the team have performed admirably despite the results and is aiming to play his part in establishing the club back in the top division]</b> It’s been a difficult start. I think we played really well in the last two games. But sometimes we are unlucky with some mistakes. But if we continue playing well the luck will come. Our main target is to finish as high in the table as possible and be in the Premier League<br /><br />In the summer, we had new players coming in, who have had to settle in the club, it will take time. Some boys have played in this league before. For some of them, it’s new. Hopefully they can settle quick and we can get going</p>
