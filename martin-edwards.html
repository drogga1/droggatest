  <p><b>[Zinedine Zidane at Manchester United? It could have happened, according to the club’s former chairman Martin Edwards]</b> Zidane and Eric played in the same position and Alex felt if they brought Zidane in it would have upset Eric.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if, looking back, United could have made room for both]</b> In hindsight yes, because Eric retired a year later and Zidane was younger so he would have continued it</p>

  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger has revealed why he turned down the chance to manage Manchester United]</b> Our first choice was Arsene. Since joining Arsenal in 1996 Wenger had been greatly successful, especially in his first full season in charge when he won the Double. And while it’s true to say he suffered hard times since, at the time we thought he was the best candidate to replace Alex. Certainly he was my number one choice. So we made our approach and Wenger did show a little bit of interest, enough to want to meet Peter Kenyon and me at his house in London to listen to what we had to say.</p>

  <p><b>[How Man Utd missed out on Zinedine Zidane, Alan Shearer, Gary Lineker and Paul Gascoigne]</b> Paul Gascoigne was certainly one <b>[we missed out on]</b>. We thought he was coming but he decided to join Tottenham. I think there were certain last-minute inducements involved.<br /><br />I’d done the negotiations for Alan Shearer and again, I thought he was coming. But <b>[Blackburn owner]</b> Jack Walker was very adamant he wasn’t coming to Manchester United. It was a case of ‘over my dead body’ but he allowed him to go to Newcastle.<br /><br />Gary Lineker, as you know, was going to sign for Everton and his agent Jon Holmes rang me on the day and said: ‘We’re about to go on the train to sign for Everton but his first choice would be Manchester United, if you want him to come.’ I put it to Ron <b>[Atkinson]</b> and he said: ‘I’ve got four strikers already. The last thing we need is another striker.’ So we passed on that one.<br /><br />With John Barnes, Graham Taylor rang Alex Ferguson to see if he wanted to take him before he signed for Liverpool. Alex passed on him because it was his first season, he had Jesper Olsen in his squad and he wanted to see whether Jesper would make it.<br /><br />When Zidane was at Bordeaux, Les Kershaw, the chief scout, was telling me we should be interested in him and I mentioned it to Alex. Alex said that Eric had also mentioned Zidane to him but Alex felt Zidane played in the same position as Eric.<br /><br />Having gone over to France to persuade Eric to re-sign for us, after the Crystal Palace incident, he felt that, if he had brought Zidane in, it may have affected Eric’s position, so he stuck with Eric.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> will not rest too heavily on Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> I think people make a lot out of these things. Ole will have learned a lot from Alex’s management, but I don’t see that Alex will be down there at the training ground or interfering in any way. I am sure if Ole wanted some advice he could go to Alex and he will give it. Whether Ole would feel the need to do that I don’t know. Ole is his own man now, and Ole will do it his way. He will have picked up things from his experience in football, particularly under Sir Alex Ferguson. You can glamorise it, the relationship, but Ole is his own man<br /><br /><b>[Edwards has told the tale of how he was lured to United 23 years ago]</b> I was very close to Les Kershaw, our chief scout, and one day I popped into his office and he told me that he had spotted this boy from Norway called <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>, but the manager is unsure on whether to take a chance on him. Les said ‘he is only going to cost £1.4m and even if he plays a dozen games for the reserves then we will get our money back on him but he might just do it, he is fantastic’. On the basis of that I went to see Alex, and he said ‘if you are willing to take the risk, chairman, then I will go along with it’ and that was it. He nearly didn’t come</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United will not be in contention for the Premier League title next season]</b> I think it needs a rebuilding job, I think they need certain players. I think United supporters are going to be patient. And I think with Ole they will be patient than previous managers because he is one of our own. He’s been a player, he’s popular, he understands the club, he makes the right noises, he’s enthusiastic. So I think he will get support from the supporters and I hope he gets support from the management<br /><br />It’s been difficult since Alex Ferguson left, Ole is now the fourth manager. I don’t think any of them found it particularly easy, so we’ve sort of slipped backwards a bit. Ole came in and did a great job earlier on in the season, I think it’s been difficult since - the last few games. We’ve struggled a bit, particularly against Barcelona in Europe. But I think Ole now needs to be given support to start building again. We are back from where we were, but we are still a high-profile club, we still have a huge worldwide support, we still get good income, so we have a chance of rebuilding. So there is some hard work down the road, obviously with the current management and owners and everything else, and let’s hope that Ole can do it from the management point of view. It’s not an easy job, it’s not been easy following Alex Ferguson, he’s started well but I think now he’s finding out how hard it is. But hopefully, with a bit of support, he gets the players he wants in and going forward he can rebuild it.</p>
