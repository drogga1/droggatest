  <p><b>[Former <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> man Simao says <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> can win the Ballon d’Or]</b> I think he can get to the Ballon d’Or. He is in a phase of adjustment, it’s not easy. Atletico’s way of playing is different from that of <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> and the first few months were not easy. I know that it bothers him to be substituted, but he has to think about the team having the opportunity to win. You have to be cool to attack in the <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a> team.<br /><br /><a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>, <a href="luis-figo.html">Figo</a>, <a href="patrick-kluivert.html">Patrick Kluivert</a>, <a href="ronald-de-boer.html">Ronald de Boer</a>… if we look at this team, almost all of them are coaches. Playing with <a href="luis-figo.html">Figo</a>, the great idol, was fantastic. It was the biggest difficulty for me. Being extreme, I thought: ‘Where am I going to play?’ On the one side there was <a href="luis-figo.html">Figo</a>, on the other <a href="rivaldo.html">Rivaldo</a>, I had to wait for them to be suspended or tired. It was a fantastic two years, I spent a lot of time with <a href="rivaldo.html">Rivaldo</a> and had conversations with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>. He already had a tactical sense, he took a role and told me how you should move without the ball. On the plane I sat in the middle of <a href="luis-figo.html">Figo</a> and <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> and I already had football books, many about golf. I read a lot. I was 19 years old. I finished an exhausting workout and <a href="rivaldo.html">Rivaldo</a> asked me to train with him, because he wanted more, I couldn’t say no.</p>
