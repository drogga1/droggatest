<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Scaling the high-income ladder]</b> Setting a long-term target for Thailand to become a high-income country by 2036 is a challenging but worthy goal. Assuming, for simplicity, a similar trend for inflation and exchange rate changes for both Thailand and HICs over the next 17 years, the economy must grow by 3.5% per annum on average to reach HIC status by 2036<br /><br />First, the shrinking labour force as the population ages will slow down the overall growth rate. The NESDC projected that the Thai labour force <b>[people aged 15-60 years old]</b> would decline roughly by 1% per year over the next 17 years<br /><br />Second, Thailand does not have capital deepening. Capital per labour has been declining over the past decade, as reflected by low investment in GDP at 23.8% during 2016-18, the lowest among Asean peers<br /><br />I believe that a three-dimensional strategy will be required for Thailand to achieve HIC status by 2036. The most important thing is supply-side policy to improve human capital and innovation<br /><br />Second, we need to boost sustainable demand, especially in the form of private investment, as well as government spending on education and health, particularly for lower-income households<br /><br />Last but not least, an effective digital strategy to promote digitalisation among businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, is essential<br /><br />This balanced strategy will not only enhance overall economic growth, but also help mitigate the problem of rising inequality as well</p>
