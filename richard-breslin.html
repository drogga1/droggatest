<blockquote>
  <p>[Orlando City provides A-League stadium blueprint] Atmosphere is absolutely critical. What we work very, very hard doing now and what we’ve always spent a lot of time looking at is how do you get that intensity of experience when you’re actually there. What you really want is a continuous [seating] bowl. You want the seating bowl to wrap all the way around, you want to try and capture the atmosphere, the noise, the activity of the crowd. As soon as you start having gaps or breaks in the seating bowl, that’s when the atmosphere escapes.<br /><br />The other thing that we try to do is proximity to the field of play. People want to be as close as they can possibly be to the field of play. So we spend a huge amount of time when it comes to working on the geometry - what we call the cross-section - of the seating bowl to understand how we can get people as close as possible, with the best-possible sightlines<br /><br />One thing we did do at Forsyth-Barr Stadium in Dunedin was we built the shell and the fixed roof based on it being for 30,000 seats but then on the two short ends we built a concrete pad there and the venue managers, they owned 10,000 temporary seats. So we built 20,000 permanent seats and when they need to they can come in … and install the temporary seats in those ends</p>
