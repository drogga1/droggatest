<blockquote>
  <p>[Qatar are all set to introduce an Under-23 league to run alongside the domestic football league] We are trying to set-up a pyramid structure where we introduce the new league as the Under-23 QFA League. The Under-23 league has been set-up with the idea being to give the youth players an opportunity to play because most managers at clubs will put more experienced players in their line-up, including the professional players they bring from abroad<br /><br />We wanted to ensure that the Under-23 players get a good number of field time which shall maintain their development<br /><br />So there has been a new restructuring in new competitions department where we have QSL which consists of 12 teams and then you have the second division with six teams. Then you have the Under-23 league which includes all the teams. It’s kind of like a replacement of the previous reserves tournament<br /><br />We had a reserves tournament to make sure that the players are playing. Now we have made it into an Under-23 league with specific regulation and participation rules for their players to make sure that the whole squad is getting enough field time for development<br /><br />We do have existing leagues for different age groups. We are one of the few countries that have age group tournaments starting from Under-14, Under-17 and Under-19. We do a lot of grassroots festivals which are Under-10. We have it also on a GCC level in collaboration with GCC countries where we do GCC grassroots festivals</p>
