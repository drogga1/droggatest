  <p><b>[Ba claims vote is weighted in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> star’s favour]</b> These days we speak so much about statistics - I believe that he had the individual and collective stats to have won the Ballon d’Or. I always said if you swap Mane’s stats in 2019 with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> still would have won it, even with fewer goals. The fact that Mane won the Champions League, the Super Cup, he played an unbelievable season and finished joint top goal-scorer in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, it’s crazy! Not only that, he was decisive in all of the games. I believe he could’ve won it<br /><br />I’ve had this talk with a lot of players. They say ‘yeah, but <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is a better player’. Of course, everyone knows that! Even if Sadio comes and tells me that he’s better than <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, I’d slap him in his face and tell him ‘shut up boy, sit down!’ But in 2019, in my perspective, he had a better season<br /><br /><b>[Ba hopes the Blues will resist the urge to spend big after seeing a transfer embargo lifted]</b> I would love to see them continue doing what they’re doing. Those youngsters are proving themselves every week. They’re not as experienced as some players who are 27 or 28 so maybe <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> could sign some experienced players to help them win the important games, the biggest games.<br /><br />It doesn’t mean they have to spend hundreds of millions - I believe small additions can help them. I saw a picture that shows how much <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> sold <b>[Philippe]</b> <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> for, and the players they bought with this money. The team that they built, it’s unbelievable! This year, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> won’t be far off and I believe if the management let Frank do what he’s doing, next year they will surely fight for big titles. I have faith in Lamps</p>

Back in July 2017, <a href="abdelhak-nouri.html">Nouri</a> collapsed on the pitch during a friendly match between <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and Werder Bremen, and he was later diagnosed with a cardiac arrhythmia attack … He is aware of where he is, he is back in a familiar environment with his family. He’s no longer in a coma. He’s just awake. He sleeps, he sneezes, he eats, he burps, but it’s not like he gets out of bed. He’s very bedridden and still very dependent on us]</b> Ya Allah. As I get ready for bed I see the news about <a href="abdelhak-nouri.html">Abdelhak Nouri</a>. My heart just squeezed in my chest. I don’t know him at all but this news has brought me instant joy.

I have spent a very great time there and if this goes through it’s going to be another top team. I’m not going to say top club because <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> is already a top club, but it’s going to be another top team, fighting for the title, fighting for the Champions League, and it’s going to be only great for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and for <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> also<br /><br />They will challenge. It does not mean they will win because we have seen for example a team like <b>[Manchester]</b> City, who have been challenging for a decade now for the Champions League. It’s not an easy competition and just money does not give you any guarantee. If money would give you guarantee then for sure City would have had a couple of <b>[titles]</b>, and other clubs also would have had more - Paris <b>[Saint-Germain]</b> would also have one</p>
