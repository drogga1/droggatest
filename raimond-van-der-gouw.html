  <p><b>[Raimond van der Gouw says De Gea mistakes are normal, even <a href="kasper-schmeichel.html">Schmeichel</a> made them]</b> Well, United have very good goalkeepers. De Gea is fantastic – he has shown that he is one of the best goalkeepers in England. Not only for one year, but for the last couple of years. Last season he made a couple of mistakes, but that’s normal. He’s a human being, and if I look back at when I was at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, when I first saw Peter <a href="kasper-schmeichel.html">Schmeichel</a> I thought he would never make a mistake. But then during the Treble season he had a bad spell and you wonder how that is possible. De Gea is fantastic, but he can make mistakes. So do all top players! Fantastic players are always looking over their shoulders and if they make a mistake people say they’re not as good anymore. This is ridiculous because they are human beings. For a goalkeeper, you have to be stable and if you make a mistake, make sure next time you are in the right place so you can stop the ball<br /><br /><b>[De Gea faces competition from <a href="sergio-romero.html">Sergio Romero</a> at present]</b> You have to deal with the competition. In my situation that was with <a href="mark-bosnich.html">Mark Bosnich</a>. There was a new goalkeeper, but I thought this could be my chance. Peter was the no.1, but Mark was going to have to show it. I gave myself a chance and I was lucky because <a href="mark-bosnich.html">Mark Bosnich</a> wasn’t really fit, he had a lot of injuries and I took my chance. When I look back, I played a lot of matches and I think that season <b>[1999/00]</b> I was probably No.1.</p>
