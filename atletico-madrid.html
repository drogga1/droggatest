In the days following that meeting Atletico were made aware that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and the player had reached a deal back in March, just after the second leg of our Champions League game against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, and that they had been negotiating the terms of the deal since mid-February.<br /><br />With regards to President <a href="josep-maria-bartomeu.html">Bartomeu</a>’s declarations today, we want to make clear that it is true a meeting took place yesterday between Miguel Angel Gil and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> CEO Oscar Grau, at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s request; and that in said meeting Mr Grau made known his intention to, once the release clause in <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a>’s contract has been modified from €200 to €120 million, ask for a delay in the payment of the above amount in the clause, valid from July 1.<br /><br />Obviously Atletico Madrid’s answer was negative, understanding that both <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and the player have disrespected Atletico Madrid and all their fans.

However, this is not a sufficient reason for this committee to opt for the imposition of a sanction - the closing of the stadium by a party - which, as stated, seems to be intended for infractions of another nature</p>

  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid players take 70 per cent pay cut to help pay salaries of 430 club employees]</b> The cessation of activity that has meant the declaration of the state of emergency in Spain as a result of the Covid-19 health crisis, has caused Atletico Madrid to have to study measures to safeguard the club’s economic viability. Due to this complicated situation, and always with the aim of guaranteeing the entity’s future, the club has made the decision to present a Temporary Employment Regulation File (ERTE). From the outset, the club’s objective in studying possible measures to deal with this delicate situation has been to minimize its effect on the salaries of its employees as much as possible. The agreement reached with the first team will also allow supplementing the salary of 430 employees affected by the ERTE. To make this possible, the first team squad will contribute half the necessary amount and the members of the club’s management committee, made up of the CEO and the directors of the different areas, the other half</p>

  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid to maintain membership numbers of fans who died from coronavirus]</b> During these past few months, we have gone through difficult times and the Atletico de Madrid family has not been oblivious to the consequences caused by Covid-19. Sadly, we have had to say goodbye to illustrious players and coaches who made Atleti great throughout its history, as well as some of our club members. As soon as it’s possible, the club will pay a well-deserved tribute to them in gratitude for their dedication and love for our colours and to show that they will always remain in our memories. Due to the very difficult circumstances we’re going through due to the health crisis, the club has exceptionally decided to respect and maintain the membership numbers in the 2020-21 season of all those who have passed away during the pandemic, as a symbolic gesture in their memory and in gratitude for their support. The membership numbers, which have great sentimental value as they indicate the uninterrupted seniority as a club member, will be updated as usual in other cases, but will be kept for next season to pay tribute to all those Atletico supporters who left us due to this health crisis.</p>
