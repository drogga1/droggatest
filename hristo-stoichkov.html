Many teams could stay up at the bottom, there are a lot of matches left. They could leave the league as it is, have no relegation and the top two from Segunda could get promoted to have a 22 team league. Because they have also done a lot of work to win many matches</p>

  <p><b>[Hristo Stoichkov has expressed his belief that <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s work was easy at Barcelona]</b> <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> was already cooked. Pep’s work was easy, as he knew perfectly well the infrastructure of the youth system. Frank Rijkaard made the squad Pep took over. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and other players had already debuted with Rijkaard. Spectacular things would have been achieved with Pep or without. There was <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>, <a href="deco.html">Deco</a>, <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>, Rafa Marquez, <a href="carles-puyol.html">Carles Puyol</a> and Victor Valdes.

  <p><b>[Hristo Stoichkov says <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> will learn a lot at Barcelona]</b> Martinez has great ability.

And he will have a good understanding with <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <b>[Antoine]</b> <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> and <b>[Ousmane]</b> Dembele. He likes to compete a lot, not just score goals. He’s growing every day. I think he’s proving that this year. The question is not whether he can play or not, the important thing is to compete. He has to train, he has to get into this style of play. I spent eight years at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> playing both left and right <b>[wing]</b>. Everyone is a substitute and a starter; it depends on how you train during the week</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona great Hristo Stoichkov says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is always unfairly blamed for Argentina’s failures]</b> To see a friend happy, like Leo, and to stop him suffering so much for not being able to win a World Cup, I would change my Golden Boot, which I got at the 1994 World Cup, to see <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> world champion. Always when he loses, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has the blame and they never talk about those who are next to him and fail. In South Africa <b>[at the 2010 World Cup under Diego Maradona]</b>, they had a great team and where did it end and why? No one asks it. Later in Brazil, Argentina reached the final and when <b>[other players]</b> have clear opportunities, the fault lies with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> loses. In the Copa America, they have lost two finals on penalties. And again, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> cannot win, but what do we do with the players who failed and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> assisted them? They are hiding<br /><br /><b>[Stoichkov does not think all is lost for Argentina ahead of Qatar 2022]</b> Sooner or later the glory of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> will end. Then we must value everything that was done in football. I believe that in 2022 in Qatar this Argentine national team will have the last great opportunity to win the World Cup in its history. With <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a>, with <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Paulo Dybala</a>, with the last campaigns, I imagine, by <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> and Angel Di Maria.
