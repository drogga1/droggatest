  <p><b>[Barcelona legend Hristo Stoichkov has paid tribute to former team-mate Pep Guardiola]</b> He was a born leader. Everyone was connected to him on the pitch due to his position in the midfield. Each play started through him. Ronald Koeman got the ball to Guardiola and he did the rest. He became the leader of the play at such a young age for that position. He had a long career with Spain, too. But, of course, as a coach, when you have the money, you can get the best players in your side. It’s been like that in Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City.<br /><br />Mourinho was always a coach, but few knew about it. Mourinho had a special position. He was writing down what each player did, or could not do in the training. Then he was telling Robson about it all. That’s why he is one of the greatest managers in the world. He was always one step ahead<br /><br /><b>[On Lionel Messi]</b> Messi cannot be compared to anyone. He is the greatest. I want him to win the World Cup, so people will stop comparing to the others. Nobody can do what he does at Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho has been told to not even think about joining another club]</b> I am writing these words to send you my most sincere support for the difficult moment you have been going through, although I’m sure there are a lot of players out there who would like to be in the same situation as you like when you scored those two vital goals against Sevilla in the Copa del Rey. And by the way, for the first goal, to have an incredible player like Messi asking you to take that penalty - a penalty which set the course for the rest of the tie. That’s a task that only the very best players are asked to do. Barca isn’t an easy club and during my first few months there, I suffered like you. I know how it feels when things aren’t turning out how you want, but I’m convinced that with hard work and sacrifice you’ll move forward because you have all the quality you need to do that. You are one of the best foreign players to have played for Barca.<br /><br />You’ve got a lot of football in you to give Barca and the only thing you should be thinking about is enjoying your game. Enjoy it like you do with Brazil. I tried to enjoy playing like I always did with Bulgaria and I ended up enjoying myself exactly the same with Barca. Never let yourself be disheartened because, from what I’ve seen, the fans are with you and want to see you succeed. Understand that they’re the best fans in the world and they’ll support you always - like they did with me. And besides, now’s not the time to feel down, we have every reason to feel positive. Forget all about the draw against Valencia. It’s starting to get tight at the top in La Liga, the Champions League is back and more than anything, we are about to face a month in which we’ll have three games on the trot against our eternal rivals, Real Madrid, who we can never rule out.<br /><br />The Clasico is the best game in the world and you yourself know what it’s like to score in one - it’s a feeling which cannot be matched. We’ll need you at your best to sew up the league and book our place in the Copa del Rey final - and even more so if the God of Football, Leo Messi is carrying a groin strain from the Valencia match.<br /><br />Lastly, a small favour. Please do not even think about joining another club, which is something I’ve read might happen in the press. There is no other club like ours. That’s why they say it’s more than a club. And anyway, you wouldn’t find another club with mates like Messi, Suarez and Co. with whom you have a great time doing what you love most - playing football.<br /><br />I wish you all the best, with all of my heart, I am sure that you will make history at Barça. Keep your chin up! A big hug, Hristo</p>

Many teams could stay up at the bottom, there are a lot of matches left.
