  <p><b>[Matthias Ginter hails ‘incredible’ Mkhitaryan &amp; picks out <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> as his toughest opponent]</b> During my time in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, <a href="henrikh-mkhitaryan.html">Henrikh Mkhitaryan</a> did incredible things in training every day and, in the first season under <b>[Thomas]</b> <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a>, he really took everyone apart<br /><br />The most unpleasant striker to face so far has actually been <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>, it’s very difficult to play against him, he seems so impassive sometimes and then he suddenly bursts into life<br /><br /><b>[Ginter is currently preparing for a Europa League meeting with <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> on Thursday]</b> There was not one reason for this change. I played in a lot of positions in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and had a lot of international experience, which was very important as a young player, but at the age of 23 I had thoughts about whether, as a defensive all-rounder, I was happy with changing positions regularly. Then came the interest of manager <a href="max-eberl.html">Max Eberl</a> and former coach Dieter Hecking, with the offer of a permanent role in the team, which has been very good for me<br /><br /><b>[Ginter’s desire to find a settled role has led to him becoming a centre-half, with that now his position of choice for club and country]</b> When I moved to Gladbach, I was not so much focused on the role of centre-back, I could have played in midfield as a six, eight or anywhere. But I finally wanted to settle somewhere, especially with regard to the World Cup in 2018, I wanted to develop and grow in one position</p>

  <p><b>[Matthias Ginter was central to the victory, having a hand in the second and third goals after scoring the opener at Borussia-Park, the home of club side Borussia Monchengladbach]</b> Scoring a goal like this as a central defender - that goes to show that nothing is impossible. Manu is right - after 29 games, it was about time. Scoring here in Gladbach is the icing on the cake</p>

  <p><b>[Matthias Ginter on <a href="alassane-plea.html">Alassane Plea</a> and Marcus Thuram]</b> Both of them have unbelievable quality and they showed that against Union. They were ice cool in front of goal. We’re happy to have players like them in our squad</p>
