  <p><b>[Borussia Monchengladbach defender Matthias Ginter has revealed he almost lost his sight following an on-pitch collision with Hannover’s Sarenren Bazee]</b> I was very fortunate, because the optic nerve and muscle of my eye were only just missed. The doctor explained to me that, if the injury had been only an inch closer to the eye, I would have had to undergo emergency surgery that same evening because my eyesight would have been in danger. Of course, it makes you think about it <b>[how he would have to retire from football had he lost his sight]</b> and I realised that my career can be over from one day to the next, which is not a nice feeling, but is part of our business.<br /><br />That <b>[Sarenren Bazee contacting him]</b> was a great gesture from him and I’m keeping my fingers crossed for him, that he too will get 100% fit again</p>

  <p><b>[World Cup winner Matthias Ginter has hailed Arsenal star Henrikh Mkhitaryan as simply unbelievable]</b> When Henrikh Mkhitaryan played at Dortmund in 2015-16 he was simply unbelievable. He collected 50 goals and assists across all competitions and destroyed everybody. He worked a lot for the team, assisting goals, scoring goals and helping us to have a strong season.<br /><br /><b>[On Sergio Aguero]</b> After the 2014 World Cup we played against Argentina. He is nimble, always moving and very difficult to defend. Aguero is a madman<br /><br />I’ve participated in two world championships at the age of 24 and have been able to witness an incredible number of great moments with the national team. You should not search for negatives all the time. Of course, every footballer wants to be on the pitch, but especially with the national team you have to put your ego to one side. I would rather sit on the bench and win the title than play and lose in the quarter-finals<br /><br />Nobody in the national team expected what happened at the World Cup. After such a tournament, certain things change. New players are joining and some established players are not playing as often. Nevertheless, as far as the processes, the training or the coach is concerned, nothing fundamental has changed since the summer. We know what mistakes were made. The World Cup is analysed and worked upon<br /><br /><b>[Thorgan Hazard and Alassane Plea among those to have sparked transfer talk]</b> I hope that we stay together as a team like this. With players like Alassane and Thorgan, something big can be achieved here. But I’m not a football romantic and I know that it’s hard to predict the future</p>

  <p><b>[Matthias Ginter hails ‘incredible’ Mkhitaryan &amp; picks out <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> as his toughest opponent]</b> During my time in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, <a href="henrikh-mkhitaryan.html">Henrikh Mkhitaryan</a> did incredible things in training every day and, in the first season under <b>[Thomas]</b> <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a>, he really took everyone apart<br /><br />The most unpleasant striker to face so far has actually been <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>, it’s very difficult to play against him, he seems so impassive sometimes and then he suddenly bursts into life<br /><br /><b>[Ginter is currently preparing for a Europa League meeting with <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> on Thursday]</b> There was not one reason for this change. I played in a lot of positions in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and had a lot of international experience, which was very important as a young player, but at the age of 23 I had thoughts about whether, as a defensive all-rounder, I was happy with changing positions regularly. Then came the interest of manager <a href="max-eberl.html">Max Eberl</a> and former coach Dieter Hecking, with the offer of a permanent role in the team, which has been very good for me<br /><br /><b>[Ginter’s desire to find a settled role has led to him becoming a centre-half, with that now his position of choice for club and country]</b> When I moved to Gladbach, I was not so much focused on the role of centre-back, I could have played in midfield as a six, eight or anywhere. But I finally wanted to settle somewhere, especially with regard to the World Cup in 2018, I wanted to develop and grow in one position</p>

  <p><b>[Matthias Ginter was central to the victory, having a hand in the second and third goals after scoring the opener at Borussia-Park, the home of club side Borussia Monchengladbach]</b> Scoring a goal like this as a central defender - that goes to show that nothing is impossible. Manu is right - after 29 games, it was about time. Scoring here in Gladbach is the icing on the cake</p>
