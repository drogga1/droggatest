  <p><b>[Phil Babb says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> should be looking to join the hunt for <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> defender Kaidou Koulibaly]</b> As a fan and a broadcaster I wonder where <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> can improve the squad and I’d probably say they might want to look at bringing in another top centre-half. That’s only because of the injury records of <b>[Joe]</b> Gomez, <b>[Joel]</b> <a href="joel-matip.html">Matip</a> and <a href="dejan-lovren.html">Dejan Lovren</a>. <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> is like a thoroughbred horse, very rarely gets injured, and if he could have another world class centre-half constantly alongside side him that would bolster <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I can’t see them doing that, but it might be in the back of their minds. I say this with a heavy heart because I’m a big fan of <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a> - I have been since he was at Charlton when I was doing agency activity years ago. I started tracking him and was made up when he went to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. But if you look at the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> squad and where they might need to strengthen, the only place I can think of is centre-half. You look at the full-backs - no need to strengthen there, there’s good young cover at left and right back, and Gomez can go there at a push, as can <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> on either side. In midfield there’s a plethora of talent all capable of adapting to the tactics suited to each game. And then up top, the front three speak for themselves and <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> and now <b>[Takumi]</b> <a href="takumi-minamino.html">Minamino</a> offer good support from the bench as well. I’m not so sure they will go into the market again this month or even in the summer, but from my point of view centre-half is the only position that may need addressed. Can you imagine <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> and <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Kalidou Koulibaly</a> together? That would be some centre-half partnership</p>
