  <p><b>[Dennis Wise on the <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> ‘snitch’ who allegedly passed on team news to opponents Crystal Palace]</b> It’s just disappointing and it disappoints you</p>

  <p><b>[Dennis Wise says Frank Lampard would be a managerial gamble for Chelsea]</b> Is it too soon for him? I think it is. I look at the staff he may bring in as well. Jody may come alongside him and he’s a bit inexperienced in a coaching capacity. If Frank does come in, he probably needs to bring someone with a bit of experience. There probably will be some changes, because he’ll want to bring his own staff in. Chris Jones, who was there <b>[at Chelsea]</b> before, is at Derby with him. He’s the fitness guy and he’s got good experience. But on the coaching side of things I worry. Frank, from a playing and personal point of view, everyone loves him at Chelsea, but he hasn’t been long in coaching, and neither has Jody. It worries me a little bit, but if they get it I wish them all the luck. It’s going to be tough for them, but fingers crossed they do the right thing for Chelsea.<br /><br />I think that gives Frank more time, by having the <b>[transfer]</b> ban. But at the end of the day Chelsea are a Champions League team, they want to finish in the top four. They don’t want to finish in the top six, I don’t think that’s something that we want. I think as Chelsea fans you want to be competing at the highest level and winning trophies. We will find out in time how it’s going to pan itself out</p>

  <p><b>[Jayden Bogle, Max Bird and Mason Bennett at Derby will tell you that this coaching team gives youth a chance. Former Blues captain Dennis Wise is also in no doubt that Chelsea’s players will respect Frank Lampard and Jody Morris’s frankness and meticulous approach to the game]</b> I think they are both very honest. I think they tell people what they expect. I think they are very detailed on what they want from their players and then you always need a little bit of luck, always on your side. If they get the luck, they have already got the detail and understanding.</p>
