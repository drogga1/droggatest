  <p><b>[Andy Carroll is the not the answer for Chelsea]</b> <b>[Carroll]</b> is a handful on his day, he really is. But, no, I don’t think he is <b>[the answer]</b>. The reason being is he doesn’t play enough games. He’s had a lot of injuries, 29 years old, doesn’t score enough goals. So, therefore, looking from that point of view, no. And I think that Chelsea, they need a striker that likes to go in behind and stretch teams. He won’t be that person. If they play with one up front he will be more of a hold up and I think with the players that they’ve got they come off more. And they always need that one person that’s really going to stretch to give them the space. I think there’s more out there that’ll score more goals because they’ll get a lot of chances and really push Morata and that’s what he needs. I think Andy won’t push him as far because he’ll play only a certain amount of games. And I think you want a player that’s really going to push Morata, that’s going to score goals and put him under pressure</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte is blind to Eden Hazard’s deficiencies as a false nine]</b> Hazard is not a centre-forward, I don’t believe. Maybe he <b>[Conte]</b> felt against Barcelona they did well in that system, he felt it could work against City. It didn’t. When you know it’s not working you expect a change around 50 minutes to change the way your team is playing and that was the disappointing this about it, in the manner the substitution came on. You’ve got two strikers sitting on the bench ready to come on and all of a sudden you put one on in 80 minutes and another one in close to 90 minutes to affect the game. You can’t do that. I think it was wrong in the way they set their stall out and the way they played. It was against a great team and you might as well go down and go down at least having a go.<br /><br />It boils down to the result at Stamford Bridge, it’s a really big game on April 1 against Spurs. Chelsea have got to win that. You won’t find out until after that situation how Chelsea are going to get into a Champions League spot. It’s a massive, massive game for Chelsea and they can only look at getting three points against Spurs</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham are batting above their weight]</b> I think Spurs have built well, but I don’t think they’re near Chelsea as a club at the moment. Where do I class Spurs? They are batting above their weight. They haven’t won anything and haven’t spent a fortune on personnel. They have kept the nucleus of the squad and, from the outside, it looks like resources have been saved for the stadium. But as a player you want to win things - at Chelsea you do that. They may miss out one year but they’re back the next.<br /><br />It is more important for Spurs to push Chelsea out of the Champions League. Chelsea will always be there competing for honours. But for Spurs they’re at more of a crossroads of which way they’re going to go. They’ve already lost in the Champions League and if Manchester United beat them in the FA Cup semi-final and they finish fifth, then it’s another season where they have failed again. That’s the problem they have. There is more pressure on them. They always seem to get themselves in a nice spot but fall short<br /><br />I am not concerned about Chelsea. They have an owner in Roman Abramovich who is willing to put money into the club. He has shown that he can bring players in. Spurs have done a really good job, the way chairman Daniel Levy has built the new stadium and kept the team together. But they really do need to be consistent and stay in the Champions League spots constantly. If it doesn’t happen to Chelsea this season, it’s not a major problem. That’s the difference</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere would represent an excellent signing for Chelsea]</b> If Chelsea needed a midfield player I would definitely take Jack Wilshere. He’s free, he’s 26 years old and he’s proved he’s come back to full fitness. You see the money they’ve paid for Danny Drinkwater and Tiemoue Bakayoko and I think he’s better than them. At 23, what would you have paid for him? £40 million? Would I play him in the Chelsea team now? Yes, I would. I’d sit him alongside N’Golo Kante and I’d play him. I’m sure Arsenal fans wouldn’t like me saying this, but he’s for nothing if he’s walking away. Go and have a go at him. Go and take him.<br /><br />His injury record is what it is. Someone could get injured tomorrow, so that doesn’t matter. He has proved he has come back to get away from these injuries. How long do you stick that enigma on him? He has proved himself over the last year what he’s capable of. He’s got himself back to playing top football. Everyone was writing him off 18 months ago, but he has shut them all up. His timing is spot on. His agent must think they are in a really comfortable position</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea legend suggests Conte can have few complaints if he’s sacked]</b> I think all managers are under pressure, if I’m being honest, not just one. I think a few of them have lost their job this year and it will carry on being that way. It is not just Antonio, I think it’s everyone. There are certain levels you have got to get to, if you don’t get to those levels I think this is the way that football is, it’s cut-throat and you are out, it is as simple as that really. There are different expectations at different clubs, from the bottom to the top. I think there are certain expectations here that you would expect to be in the Champions League and challenging for the title, challenging for trophies. Unfortunately there has been only one that we have challenged for, which is now the FA Cup. The rest of them we have fell away really.<br /><br />At the start of the season, you have things that you have to achieve as a manager. As expectations with each individual club, what are Chelsea’s expectations? I would like to think that their expectations with the money that has been spent and the structure of this football club with the way that it is done, is that you would like to think you are challenging for trophy and getting in the Champions League and being close to winning silverware as well</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea could be set to bid farewell to two more players before the summer transfer window closes across Europe]</b> They’ve got a fair few in that position that can play there. So it’s a fight for places, it really is. It will be interesting whether or not we see one or two Chelsea midfield players go by the end of <b>[the window]</b>, you never know. And Europe goes on for another couple of weeks, it could still happen. Bakayoko, Danny Drinkwater. I think they won’t feature too much.</p>

  <p><b>[Dennis Wise believes that Jorginho has been absolutely outstanding for Chelsea]</b> I like the boy <b>[Sarri]</b> has brought in, Jorginho, I think he has been absolutely outstanding. have watched him and how he covered holes, how he pressed and he dictates to his team-mates as he wants them to do certain things. I think by bringing in Jorginho, you bring in someone who knows Sarri very well and how he plays and what he wants to do. When you have someone right in the middle of that midfield who understands how the manager plays and dictates that to everyone, I think it is really helpful and he has so much quality as well. I think he has given the ball away once over the whole pre-season. I am actually looking forward to seeing him progress over the course of this season.<br /><br />I think he had only been with them for 21 days <b>[before the Community Shield game against Man City]</b>, so it is a short period that he has been in charge. He has had to change the system from a 3-4-3 to a 4-3-3 now and they have worked on it in an impressive manner, having watched them against Arsenal <b>[in pre-season]</b>. I think in that first half they played very, very well. I was impressed with the way they were set up and they haven’t had all their personnel throughout pre-season, so probably the team that starts in each game might not stay the same to begin with.<br /><br />After a couple of games into the start of the season you will see a couple of players coming back into it. What I see, in terms of the way they play, they press very, very high. They want the ball constantly and they want to control the game. It is different from Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte, who were more counter-attacking in their football. I think Maurizio wants to play on the front foot. That’s important for him, he wants to press teams high. It is difficult because the work rate, you have to keep up. He did it at Napoli and it worked extremely well, so I am looking forward to actually seeing him do that because I think it is going to be very exciting to see Chelsea on the front foot and passing it around teams<br /><br />I think everyone is looking at Man City, they had 100 points last season. Nineteen points ahead of Man United and 30 points ahead of Chelsea so that’s a big gulf to catch up. They have done it in such a commanding way, that you have to catch them. We are hoping that a little bit of complacency creeps in <b>[at Man City]</b>. You look at Chelsea, they did very well when Antonio Conte came in for his first season and won the league. I don’t think anyone expected that to happen. I think the expectations at Chelsea this year is people are not expecting them to win the league. What you need to do is to see how it pans out. I think it could be quite interesting because Chelsea have a lot of quality players but they never hit it off. Whether that was internal or inside the dressing room, who knows, but now there is a fresh start. They could be a surprise package again, Chelsea. Everyone is expecting Man City to win it and Liverpool to press them because of the amount of money that they have spent. Liverpool plugged gaps where they needed and I think they have really spent well but now the expectations are there as well. So they have to live with those expectations. I think those are the two teams that people will be looking at, Man City and Liverpool. Hopefully Chelsea can creep in through the back door because no one is expecting that to happen<br /><br /><b>[On Callum Hudson-Odoi]</b> I think Hudson-Odoi has been outstanding. I think it is good he has had the opportunity. He is a local boy and I am looking forward to seeing a lot more of him and him competing against players in that position. I think he is capable to go and do it. I think he gave Hector Bellerin a torrid time in Dublin and in his performance against Inter at times</p>

  <p><b>[Dennis Wise believes fellow Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola could be key to helping Alvaro Morata rediscover his goalscoring touch]</b> I think if we can get Morata scoring goals, I think that is very important. Obviously last season he got a few injuries and not enough goals but I think he has a lot of quality. Once he builds his confidence and scores, you would have a real striker there. I think it has taken him a little bit of time to get used to the Premier League. Last season wasn’t his most outstanding season. So I expect a bit more from him. I think he can learn from Gianfranco. I think it will be great and Franco will take him under his wing to help us. If he can get enough goals, then we would start to compete. It is important that others share the load as well. <b>[Olivier]</b> Giroud is still there, they are people who can add to that tally and get more goals. I think it is important that they score as well, I think that is something that is a little bit lacking.<br /><br />I don’t think Maurizio will, Franco will or the players will <b>[turn their back on Morata]</b>. I think they will get behind him, so he is someone who you probably need to help a bit. You can see that he really wants to do well. Sometimes it doesn’t go as well as you want in your first season, so therefore you are looking for a little bit of help from personnel. There was obviously a lot of change around the club last season. There was a period of six months where there was a lot of upheaval, I would say, now it is all changed. I think everyone is looking forward in the season in a positive manner. What we want from Morata is an early goal and to hit the ground running and to make an impact. If he can do that, it can help the team</p>

  <p><b>[Dennis Wise believes Ross Barkley has made the most of his opportunities under Maurzio Sarri]</b> There’s a big possibility and I think Ross Barkley can come into the fold here. He has been given an opportunity under Maurizio. When you have got a new manager coming in you look at things and think, ‘right okay there’s a level playing field there’. I am sure he has gone in and said that to them, that there is an opportunity for everyone. When Ross came in, he was never really played. You kind of felt, when you looked at the interview of Antonio, that he wasn’t the first choice option that he wanted at the time and I think that came across a little bit. I think he will get an opportunity under Maurizio because he will leave it a little bit open and he is capable. He is a talent. He has had a little bit of a bad spell but hopefully he has come through it and he has got ability. He is the type of player that can open people up. There’s places up for grabs and it is up to people to grab those places.</p>

I think he’s quite loyal and I think he wants to stay at Chelsea, I really do.</p>

  <p><b>[Frank Lampard and Derby County are the perfect fit for each other]</b> Of course I am <b>[buzzing for them]</b>. I text the guys to wish them all the best and I think it was a fantastic result <b>[to begin with]</b>. I think he has obviously worked on a few things, you have just got to give him time. One of the things that Derby fans have got excited about is that he is going to bring some talented young players through and I think that can be good. There hasn’t been too many that have come through over the past few years at Derby and the money they have piled into the academy is a lot. I think that the owner wants to see the club benefit from it. I think if Frank goes in there into the first team, Frank and Jody will be looking to the academy at some stage. I think they are both very honest. I think they tell people what they expect. I think they are very detailed on what they want from their players and then you always need a little bit of luck, always on your side. If they get the luck, they have already got the detail and understanding. Then with the players on their side, hopefully Derby can have a really good season to try to get to where they belong, which is the Premier League..<br /><br />I think Mason Mount is a very talented young boy. Obviously Frank knows a lot about him and Jody knows a lot about him. Therefore, they decided to bring the boy in who has now developed physically, technically he is fantastic and he showed the other day his capabilities. So he is a boy that they have looked at and I wouldn’t be surprised if they take one or two more <b>[on loan from Chelsea]</b> as well further down the line. At the moment, I think that the manager who previously went into Derby were constantly buying old, constantly trying to make it happen. I think there’s a different philosophy with Frank, Jody and Chris Jones, in the manner that they want to go about it. I think they will be given enough time by the owner as well, I think he said that in the press conference. He wants to improve on certain things at Derby. Frank is the person who is capable of doing that</p>

  <p><b>[Dennis Wise has launched a defence of Maurizio Sarri’s Chelsea selection in midfield]</b> What I would say is that I found that there’s been a lot of talk about Kante’s position and Jorginho and people like that and I think what people have to understand is Maurizio Sarri brought in Jorginho because he knew his ideas. I think it is really important as a manager, you can put your ideas across to the players on the field when training is going on and try to constantly show them what you want with repetition, but then there’s nothing better than having a player in the middle who can dictate what you want. I think that’s a big plus. I think that’s why Chelsea have started and done so well, up until this period this season. I think it was a big, big call to bring Jorginho in and plonk him in the middle of the park. I think Kante and Jorginho have complimented each other quite well. Having him there gives Kante the chance to break through at times. I think what has happened is the other three midfield players; <b>[Mateo]</b> Kovacic, <b>[Ross]</b> Barkley and <b>[Ruben]</b> Loftus-Cheek, they are the three more offensive players who like to go forward. I think he likes having these other two more defensive players and then encouraging these more offensive players to go forwards and that’s the way he kind of plays. I think there’s more competition in that three than there is in the other two spots, from what I see. I think Kante and Jorginho are the first two names on the team-sheet every week. It is not about them two not fully clicking, I think they have.<br /><br />You have to give Spurs credit on the day. It is easy to pick faults, but you have to say: ‘do you understand how Spurs played?’ What Spurs did in that midfield was they got superiority in that midfield. How they did it was very good. <b>[Christian]</b> Eriksen and Son drop in, Dele Alli drops in, push right on Jorginho and not allow him to get on the ball. The other two, <b>[Moussa]</b> Sissoko and <b>[Eric]</b> Dier, sat in front. It was a five against three superiority. What needed to happen was our two wide men drop in or our full backs push up a little bit more. They were caught a little bit half-and-half. There were other parts of the pitch that needed to be adjusted. We had four defenders marking one player <b>[Harry Kane]</b>. Our defenders needed to be tighter and narrower <b>[to help the midfield]</b>. There were different ways we had to adjust, it wasn’t just Jorginho-Kante or just the midfield’s fault<br /><br />Look at Ross Barkley. Last year you would have looked at Barkley when he first came to the football club that he is not going to get much of an opportunity, but the new manager has given him that opportunity. I look at Loftus-Cheek who is really pushing now. There’s a lot of speculation that he should go out on loan and I think, why? Why? He should stay and fight here. I think he has a chance of pushing to get that other spot, as he competes with the other two. Why would you want to go to a team like Crystal Palace and fight down below when you can be at a team like Chelsea and fight for a Champions League position and to win trophies? He is only young as well, Loftus-Cheek, he has got a bit of time on his side. I think what he has done so far is that he has made progress as well. He is looking good. I think it is important he stays at the football club and doesn’t go out on loan<br /><br />Fabregas is older and I think he obviously will be looking for longer term contracts and maybe the club don’t want to give him as long <b>[as he wants]</b>. So maybe it is a situation where you settle in the middle ground and he is someone who has good ability. He hasn’t played as much as the others because they are the first choice for now. So, it is just about getting the balance of whether he wants to be at Chelsea and not play all the time or seek a new challenge<br /><br /><b>[Wise says a Premier League title win was never on the cards]</b> They are higher than everybody expected them to be. I think it was a year about changes of ideas in the way that Chelsea have set their stall out and played. They have played. I think it has been fantastic. Expectations are now a little bit higher than they were at the start of the season because of the performances. We are in a nice position in the league and we are doing okay in the cups, so what do we want at the end of this year? Are we going to compete with Man City and Liverpool? No, we are not going to compete and finish either first or second, but I think we can finish in the Champions League spots. Then in time we can try to compete with them. It took Klopp a while, it took Guardiola a while. So, this takes time. It is his first season. I think for his first six months, he has done extremely well</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea should have moved for Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy during the summer transfer window]</b> I would’ve looked to bring in a third striker over the summer, someone who guarantees goals,” said Wise, at the launch of the Sportsperson with a Personality Awards. You’re not going to get (Sergio) Aguero, you’re not going to get (Harry) Kane, but for me there’s a third option in Jamie Vardy. He’s a natural goalscorer in a team that doesn’t create loads of chances, I think he’d be fantastic in the Chelsea side<br /><br />Giroud and Morata are very different players. Morata is a confidence player, he’s an excellent finisher, whereas Giroud holds the play up far better. Against Man City, you want someone who’s going to get hold of the ball and keep possession, so for me Giroud starts</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Loftus-Cheek has no need to leave Chelsea]</b> No, I don’t think he should. He <b>[Sarri]</b> has played him a number of times. He’s got competition for places but why would Loftus-Cheek want to go on loan? I’ll pick Crystal Palace just because he went there on loan. Why would you want to go there on loan, to a team where you’ll play a lot of games but you’ll be in a battle down the bottom when you can play in a team full of top international players, fighting to win trophies and trying to get in the Champions League? I think he’s improved so much. This is a process for him and I think it’s important he stays at Chelsea and he fights. He’s very close to being one of the players who could take one of those shirts and stay in there and he has to carry that on until the end of the season. He’s got the opportunity to do it now that he’s thought of in a different way than when he went out on loan. Maurizio said it: he won’t go out on loan. He’s stepped up to another level. He will be the one fighting for that offensive spot</p>

Chris Jones, who was there <b>[at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> before, is at Derby with him. He’s the fitness guy and he’s got good experience. But on the coaching side of things I worry. Frank, from a playing and personal point of view, everyone loves him at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, but he hasn’t been long in coaching, and neither has Jody. It worries me a little bit, but if they get it I wish them all the luck. It’s going to be tough for them, but fingers crossed they do the right thing for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.<br /><br />I think that gives Frank more time, by having the <b>[transfer]</b> ban. But at the end of the day <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are a Champions League team, they want to finish in the top four. They don’t want to finish in the top six, I don’t think that’s something that we want. I think as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans you want to be competing at the highest level and winning trophies. We will find out in time how it’s going to pan itself out</p>

  <p><b>[Jayden Bogle, Max Bird and <a href="mason-bennett.html">Mason Bennett</a> at Derby will tell you that this coaching team gives youth a chance. Former Blues captain Dennis Wise is also in no doubt that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s players will respect <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> and <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a>’s frankness and meticulous approach to the game]</b> I think they are both very honest. I think they tell people what they expect. I think they are very detailed on what they want from their players and then you always need a little bit of luck, always on your side. If they get the luck, they have already got the detail and understanding.</p>
