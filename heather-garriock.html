  <p>[Former Matilda Heather Garriock slams Australia’s tactics in a 2-1 loss to Italy at the Women’s World Cup] It’s disastrous. I’m so upset, more for the fact of the style we played the second half, and we touched on it at the start of the game, this high line is absolutely ridiculous. If you think as a coach you can come in and change the philosophy and change the style within five matches…we’ve just been crucified, not once, but twice. We’ve got a 15th ranked side and we’re ranked 6th in the world and they’ve just beaten us. And if we had a better team playing against us tonight it would have been more than five. I’m so disappointed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Heather Garriock, echoed Cheryl Salisbury’s comments that Sam Kerr’s showed signs of immaturity as she praised her former skipper] The thing I loved about (Salisbury), win, lose or draw, regardless…her emotional stability and answers in the media and how inspiring she was, were phenomenal. I kind of feel bad Sam that has come out and said that they’ve won one game at the World Cup, that we know we’re (one of) the best teams in the world. I think (Salisbury) said it on the couch, that’s an immature captain. We don’t see the France or US captains come out and say that. I think it is one game at a time, and I hope she learns from this.</p>
