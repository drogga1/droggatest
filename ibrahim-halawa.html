  <p>Each time you are transferred to a new prison, there is something called ‘the party’. They show you who’s boss.

  <p><b>[at The Late Late Show]</b> Of course I’m not with the Muslim Brotherhood, I don’t support the Muslim Brotherhood, I don’t support their ideology. As a 17-year-old you don’t even know what a Muslim Brotherhood is. You don’t know what an organisation is basically other than a human rights organisation. I was in prison with them of course. And I differ with them so much on a lot of points, so much points<br /><br /><b>[Addressing rumour about he tore up his Irish passport while protesting in Egypt]</b> I was actually in prison when I heard that rumour. There’s a few rumours about the same rumour - that I ripped my passport, that I burnt my passport, that I threw away my passport. … No. I didn’t. I was in prison when I heard the story. At the time there was an American citizen who … was in Isis in Syria who was ripping up his passport … They had a video and that was about the same time I heard the rumour. And I was just like - I’m not blonde, I don’t have blue eyes, and I’m definitely not in Syria with Isis … I was with the prosecution. He was like, ‘we need your passport for you to be treated as an Irish citizen, for you to get consular visits, for your family if they’re coming from Ireland and use their Irish identification. … So it’s with them and whoever said my Irish passport was torn up they would look so bad because I’m trying to get it back right now<br /><br /><b>[By his own account, Ibrahim Halawa and his sisters had travelled to Egypt - where they had extended family - for a family holiday, and got caught up in the political turmoil]</b> I didn’t know there was a political game going on in Egypt or nothing like that. <b>[He soon found himself speaking at a rally in support of the Muslim Brotherhood. Halawa said that two of his friends had been killed in political violence while he was there and that had motivated him to become more engaged in what was going on]</b> There was an Eminem concert that I wanted to go to at the time if anyone remembers that Eminem concert. So I was going to go there as a normal kid back to a concert. But I was going back to a concert and my friends were going to graves. So I just had to give my opinion about that<br /><br />While you’re at the prison door you’re given a stick to batter you down. Then you have to run then you find this very long two rows of soldiers. One on the right and one of the left and you have to run through because every soldier has a different weapon that he’s going to beat you with<br /><br /><b>[In one instance, Ibrahim Halawa described being beaten in front of his mother while she was visiting him. His mother had heard that he was sick and Halawa tried to reassure that he was okay]</b> I was being dragged because time was over for the visit. So I grabbed onto the bars and I was like ‘mom I’m okay don’t worry’. They dragged me and my mom started screaming mor … The guard was pulling me away from my mom and they started beating me up in front of her. And then my mom was screaming and I just want to resist.

Nothing can be harder than what I went through. When I meet someone and tell them that I’ve been to prison, how can they understand what it’s like to be a prisoner of conscience? I have to prove what I’m capable of, what I’ve become. I’m working with a lot of youth and in schools. With young people, when they see you’ve been through a hardship, they listen. My story is about moving from darkness to light<br /><br /><b>[The most significant change within himself in the last year came about as a result of his appearance on RTÉ’s The Late Late Show last November. He was questioned about rumours he was involved with the Muslim Brotherhood, and that he had ripped up his own Irish passport. After that interview, he decided that he wasn’t on principle going to be forced to defend himself and his actions again]</b> I shouldn’t have been put in that position. That’s what I’m doing now: I’m allowing people to see what I’m capable of, and what I will do. I decided I’m going to tell my story from my own point of view<br /><br />I’m back in my old bedroom.

I love a prison joke … People get comfortable when you make them laugh, and they get to be who they are. You can still talk about hardship, but also laugh - to show them you can once again laugh<br /><br /><b>[The hunger strikes, Ibrahim Halawa says now, showed his captors that they could not have full control over him]</b> That was when the guards gave you attention.
