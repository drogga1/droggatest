  <p><b>[Gerardo Martino recalls a strange altercation with the Chile forward during their time at Barcelona]</b> I had a problem with <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a>. We were just about to start an exercise in training. He was 50 meters away. I called him: ‘Ale, Ale.’ And he started sprinting towards me as if it were a match. I thought, ‘What’s up with him to make him come so fast?’ So I asked him: ‘What’s up? Are you crazy?’ And he said, ‘Well, as we’re fighting…’ ‘Who’s fighting?’ I asked him. And he said, ‘Didn’t you see the paper today? That’s what it says so, well, I thought there was a problem’.</p>

  <p><b>[Tata Martino can finally turn focus on winning Gold Cup]</b> The reality is I’m not used to it. After my arrival to soccer in the United States, after two years in Atlanta, I understood that my role as a manager was growing beyond what happened in a practice, a match or a training camp. There were social things I had to attend to because they were beneficial and positive for the club. So, from there, I understood from there that there were things I have to do. I don’t analyze it too much. When Mexico does an event with an American business, they do the games, this event in Dallas, it’s something I have to participate in. Am I used to doing it? Honestly, no. But I have to do it and do it totally calmly.<br /><br />We always want to play against the best and if we could play every day against Argentina, Brazil, Germany, France, we would. I don’t pick the game, but yes we want, we want to compete in the Copa America. That’s what is going to make Mexico grow. We want to leave the comfort zone that comes with playing in the United States, where we’re always the home team. Of course we want to play against Ecuador in Ecuador or against Chile in Santiago. In fact, Mexico played two games in Argentina last year, but we know that with the commercial commitments that it’s out of the football-side of things and we have to do that as well. Let there be no doubt at all, I have no fear of losing 10 games in a row if we’re going to play against opponents that really are superior to us</p>

  <p><b>[Cuba’s reality is far different from Mexico’s]</b> Since Mexico, we’ve been getting to know every one of the players as far as the way they were playing in the friendly matches and now it’s time to inform ourselves about Cuba, about some of the difficulties they’ve had with getting visas for some of their players. The majority of the players play in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. The most important thing is to play 90 minutes in an intense way, even and as the attacking team, trying not to give the opponent any type of chance.<br /><br />It’s difficult to do an analysis beforehand of what the opponent is able to show. I’m expecting a game in which Mexico will have the majority of the ball and they wait for the counter-attack<br /><br />I’m really happy with the players who are here and who we’re going to compete with. Surely, they’ll all grow with the participation we have in the Gold Cup. Every moment together, whether it’s in friendly matches, official competition, it’s a new chance to get better and to grow as a team and show our best version. So, in no situation can we think about the players who aren’t here because they’re not here for different reasons. For us, it’s a great opportunity to be together, to live with each other, to compete and to keep growing</p>

  <p><b>[Tata Martino said after the Ecuador friendly]</b> Uriel Antuna, I think for his first game, he played with a lot of determination, he sacrificed a lot. Maybe it wasn’t as dangerous as we’d have wanted in attack, but he worked really well in the press, working with the defense, he ran a lot, he was intense. Obviously we hope for more, above all, in the attack.</p>

Don’t get on social media too much. Don’t watch too many programs,’ Because it surely won’t be us here who misplace the kid. We’ll always have words for him that have to do with calm, both in a poor showing and a superlative showings.

  <p><b>[Tata Martino: Mexico must perfect its Plan A]</b> I’m still convinced we have to perfect the Plan A. That’s something you hear a lot in Argentina, people demanding about a change of plan when long-term we’re always talking about the lack of time for a national team manager. For a national team manager, a calendar year is a short amount of time. They demand a Plan B or Plan C when in reality what you have to do is perfect the A. What we’re doing is starting with the A.<br /><br />I’m really happy because I think there’s a clear form to the team, apart from the opponents and the strengths they have, to come out and try to dominate the game. In this sense, we’ve played better at times, other times not as much but the way in which the team plays can clearly be seen<br /><br />Raul Jimenez is our most important forward, and I’m not talking about only the players in the group for this competition, but Mexican football. Whoever is in, whoever is out, he’s the most important forward Mexican football has. I’m not very worried about if my nine is or isn’t top scorer on the team. If Dos Santos scores two goals, Chapo Montes might score one, Moreno scores one, Reyes another. Sincerely, I’m not worried about it. What I’m worried about is if he can offer what he’s shown he can offer in all the games he’s played so far</p>

  <p><b>[Canada is a team that puts those sort of scorelines on other teams. Martino has been paying attention]</b> I’ve been able to see four or five Canada games. I don’t have all the fine points down to talk about the team as a collective. I don’t have any doubt that individually the Canada squad is very important, with players even playing in the Premier League or in the Bundesliga, really important players. There are very important wingers, midfielders, central defenders. With that, just today I was telling the players that we’re not playing against the history of Canada, but this Canada team. A lot of times people complain, ‘This national team or that national team doesn’t have history.’ But history isn’t the important thing. The important thing is what they have today, and I think Canada has put together … probably one of the best national teams it’s been able to put together in recent history.</p>

  <p><b>[Professional performance helps Mexico pass first real test of Tata Martino era]</b> Clearly, the level of demand was very high today. When you see what happens here, Copa America, what could happen in the Euros, honestly, today, when teams are well-organized it’s hard to attack. What I liked was that the team still controlled the game, but it was really hard for us to be able to translate the amount of the ball we had into chances to score.<br /><br />I really value the fact that we won a game with these characteristics. I think it’s a good point of the game for what we’re going to find from the quarterfinals on<br /><br />We didn’t want to show everything tonight. We wanted to learn a lot from Mexico. We’ve got an important game against Cuba which hopefully will qualify us for the quarterfinals. Tonight we lost, but we learned, and we learned a lot</p>

He’s worked well over the last few days, but he’s always trained separately and he doesn’t feel the confidence needed to be able to play. Everything that doesn’t involve a change of rhythm, he can do well, but when he starts to participate at full-speed, he feels some discomfort. While that happens, we can’t involve him in a match</p>

  <p><b>[Tata Martino said all of the things one would expect ahead of Sunday’s match against Martinique]</b> The Mexican player is always very competitive, so when you have a very competitive squad that knows how to face opponents of a different nature, the only thing that happens for me is that we must prepare more to always compete in the same way.<br /><br />Mexico has the characteristics in its games against different rivals and suddenly they become real opponents. To put it one way, ‘minor’ opponents are suddenly very demanding, and what you have to do is face each game thinking that we are playing against the best. Today, that is the point we try to make the most. In short, play against Cuba, Martinique in the same way we can do with Canada, Panama and the United States<br /><br />Whether it’s the Gold Cup, Copa America or World Cup, players play at the end of a long season and sometimes we do a little more analysis on whether it’s a lot or little activity. <br /><br />It is true that the coaches, when we have the players with the national team, we want to do everything in a single day and sometimes we have to respect the times. In addition, it’s true that everything that has happened is not exclusively related to muscle injuries. We have had different types of injuries and fortunately, beyond this Erick injury, we can say that there are many who have recovered in a very favorable time, mainly thanks to the work of the medical team. Because, at the time, what happened to Carlos Salcedo and Edson Alvarez are quite similar injuries to the one we had with Hector, injuries that we did not know for sure which way we were going to be able to have the players. I can say that even with the training that Hector Moreno did this morning, they have been able to do it with the whole group<br /><br /><b>[Martino and El Tri have the chance to reassess and drive competition for places forward with the knockout rounds looming]</b> The first thing we do is try to choose the best team that we understand that has to be presented tomorrow. The physical problems we have had, and still suffer today, added to the fatigue of travel and games we have ahead impact the selection of the team, but we always try to put the best team together in each encounter</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico is the favorite, and in Tata Martino’s eyes it should be. But to be the champion, it needs to be focused on this game against the Ticos]</b> With what we saw in the previous phase, there’s no reason to fall into some type of overconfidence. Even beyond the opponent’s historic success, it’s a quarterfinal. We’re on the wrong path if we’re overconfident. I don’t have to talk the players right now about what place they see Mexico in, in regards to the Gold Cup. When we talked as we came here, before the friendlies, we knew the place we were in. We accept that role, and we’re open to showing it in every one of the games we’ve played and the games we’re going to play.<br /><br /><b>[Mexico have to win]</b> Obviously, the big difference between a group game and one in the quarterfinals is there are 90 minutes and you go to your house if things don’t go well. We know that errors in those situations are fatal. We have to try and keep our style of play in the different conditions the game presents. It’s one thing to do it in a tournament where you have 19 matches, accepting that you can make a mistake in one or two and come back from that because there’s still a lot in front of you. Other times, there are teams who lose this form because they know that everything starts and ends in 90 minutes of soccer. It’s a different way of seeing tomorrow’s game and to see if we’re capable of confirming our current form</p>

  <p><b>[Jonathan dos Santos missed Mexico’s first match of the tournament with a muscle complaint of his own and also came out of the quarterfinal before the extra time period]</b> Jonathan dos Santos ended up a little heavy in the back of his leg. He told me it wasn’t anything more than a heavy load. He was calm. Andres, I think it’s something that he even came in with in the second game, also in the back. He even was in doubt for today’s match. We decided yesterday in the final training session that he was going to play and not Rodriguez. He made the effort to be able to be in the game. But I see it as a big positive that one of the two or three most emblematic players goes out, a guy with just 10 games in the national team - if he even has 10 - and does it like he did. This makes me really calm, it makes me happy. It makes the range of possibilities in choosing players much more broad.<br /><br /><b>[Jonathan dos Santos should be available for Tuesday’s semifinal, which is good news for Mexico]</b> It was just a cramp.

  <p><b>[The Gold Cup is far from the most respected tournament in the world, but Mexico manager Tata Martino says people should give the tournament the respect it deserves]</b> I’ve seen good games in the Gold Cup. For me, Mexico vs. Costa Rica was a really good game in the Gold Cup. I don’t know if I’ve seen games like that in Copa America with this level of play. I’m not saying the Copa America is worse than the Gold Cup. Of course there is much more variety between teams<br /><br />It’s also true that it’s difficult to play against one standard of opponents in the group stage and then find yourself against others going forward, including, for us it’s been really difficult to get comfortable quickly with what Costa Rica wanted to do because the jump between Martinique - beyond the 3-2 - and Cuba. I’m not talking about Canada. And then suddenly you find yourself that’s a candidate to win the tournament like you, it’s the same thing I tell the guys here. If Mexico doesn’t play friendly matches that have a really high level, you end up playing a mid-tier and lower. Suddenly you play Germany in the first round of the World Cup. It’s not easy to get used to that.<br /><br />We’ve got Haiti, which I think has the revelation of the tournament. No matter what happens, Haiti is the revelation of the tournament. We had Costa Rica in the quarterfinals and if do well tomorrow we could have Jamaica in the final or the United States, another candidate to win the title. Those are three games in which the competition is really level. I think there’s another question which has to do with why you guys in the press devalue a competition so much. What’s the reason for doing that? I always have a bit - I don’t know if the word is dark - view about why the competition gets devalued because what happens is at the end of the day if we win, ‘Ah, it’s nothing,’ and if we lose, it creates a bad environment<br /><br /><b>[Even with a quick turnaround and both Andres Guardado and Jonathan dos Santos carrying knocks that forced them to leave the quarterfinal against Costa Rica before extra time]</b> Rest in a semifinal? No. Nobody would be out because they have to have rest. What we are trying to do is avoid the risks all the risks players can have, the implications an injury can have for a player where you might have to make a quick change. From no point of view will there be a player who is out to get rest. We’re in the last 180 minutes. We’re not thinking about that</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico manager Tata Martino has watched the film. He’s analyzed Haiti’s strengths and weaknesses - as well as those of his own team]</b> The first thing I have to say is Haiti is a tremendously effective team that has taken advantage of the chance the opponent has given them to get into the game. Costa Rica allowed it, and they took advantage. They turned it around. Canada let them get into the game, with a mistake on a ball played back and later a penalty, and they took advantage. So, it occurs to me that it’s an opponent against which you have to play the 90 minutes with a lot of intensity and attention because the smallest concession you give to the opponent they’re going to take advantage.<br /><br /><b>[Martino’s initial reviews of his team have generally been positive in the first six months]</b> We’ve got an attacking position with a lot of players, so we can take charge of the game. While we do prepare well for the moments in which the opponent can pressure us or command the match, don’t forget the first goal in the Martinique game, we also prepare to go to the space and the reality is we play a lot of time in the opponent’s half with possession of the ball, putting a lot of players into the attack. What we have to do is slow down the quick exits the opponent makes<br /><br />With the way we play, there really aren’t that many chances teams create on us with counter-attacks, with how much time we spend in the opponent’s half. Even so, we have to analyze them, realize and fix the situations that were conceded in every one of the matches</p>

  <p><b>[Gold Cup final just one step in Martino’s plan for Mexico]</b> (The obligation) doesn’t change. I’ve seen a lot of Gold Cups and I know that Mexico is obligated to win. We’ve never hidden Mexico’s responsibility. We got here and we’re still backing that. We’re in the final and we’re still going. But I think also you have to look at the full context a little bit, beyond the fact that it would be a big disappointment not to win the cup. We also know we have to keep moving forward, getting better because maybe the most important goal, yes, is a bit more long-term<br /><br />In whatever situation you lose, what happens in the environment is what you mentioned is going to happen, but it’s fine. In this tournament, there are how many teams, 12? (There are 16.) And there are 11 that have to be ready to lose, one to win. That’s why I’m saying I’m talking about different goals: One, undoubtedly, is to win because that’s why we’re here - to win - but also with the five or six months we’ve had leading the national team there are other secondary goals that we can never lose sight of because it involves a four-year process. You have to work with the close-up view but also the long-term view<br /><br /><b>[He’s also expressed the idea while he would’ve preferred Carlos Vela, Hector Herrera and Javier Hernandez for this tournament run, the minutes that have fallen to young players with those veterans not in the squad will be helpful down the road]</b> Above all, those guys who are playing their first matches with the senior national team have been at the level this tournament is. It’s not easy to find yourself as a first-timer and suddenly be in the Gold Cup<br /><br />We believe that in a tournament like the Gold Cup, we can try to pin down an idea, have young players available for tomorrow to be in the senior national team and also we’re here to win it. There are several goals, and not all of them are reduced to what can happen tomorrow at the end of the match</p>

At <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> he will have more of a fight because (Cristiano) <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> shares the inside of the pitch with whoever plays alongside him, with (Paulo) <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> or with (Gonzalo) <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> and maybe he has a tougher fight there</p>
