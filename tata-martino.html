  <p><b>[Gerardo Martino recalls a strange altercation with the Chile forward during their time at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> I had a problem with <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a>. We were just about to start an exercise in training. He was 50 meters away. I called him: ‘Ale, Ale.’ And he started sprinting towards me as if it were a match. I thought, ‘What’s up with him to make him come so fast?’ So I asked him: ‘What’s up? Are you crazy?’ And he said, ‘Well, as we’re fighting…’ ‘Who’s fighting?’ I asked him. And he said, ‘Didn’t you see the paper today? That’s what it says so, well, I thought there was a problem’.</p>

We struggled in stopping Alberth Elis when he had the space; and we committed a lot of individual errors where we basically invited our opponent to finish the game.<br /><br />I think that what cost us was the defensive part, which is something you have to care about in soccer. It looks like we struggled with defending the ball and we struggled on the 1-v-1 defensively. Offensively, we probably created as many scoring situations as Houston did, but our defense didn’t work as well - and when I talk about our defense, I mean the whole team</p>

  <p><b>[Gerardo Martino will leave Atlanta United at the end of the season after rejecting a contract offer]</b> This was not an easy decision to make, I have enjoyed my time with Atlanta United very much and am proud of what we have accomplished together in such a short time. The decision was not made for financial reasons, negotiations with the front office were transparent and fair. It was simply the right move for me and my family at this time. The opportunity to build a team from the start does not come along often, and I am grateful to the club and to the fans for putting their trust in me to establish a solid foundation here in Atlanta. What is most important now is that the focus remains on our goals for this season</p>

  <p><b>[Former Argentina coach Gerardo Martino has denied that Lionel Messi has a hand in running the national team]</b> We should never have to do whatever Messi says. I did not pay attention to him, not even in the national team. But that is the myth that has been formed. But it is not just me, a lot of people have said it, but of course you won’t believe it from me…It is not me who is denying it, the facts deny it. When you look at what happened in the 2014 World Cup, who was left out, who came back in 2015 when everyone said they wouldn’t, who came back in 2017. When that happens and shows it’s not true people are maintaining something for the sake of it, without sitting down to think about the facts. That is the problem we have in Argentina, we do not sit down and think. There is another issue, besides: it depends who said it and we cannot sit down and discuss that<br /><br />My happiest time was with Paraguay. Those were five years in which I managed to find happiness. We still have a group called ‘South Africa 2010’. They get together once a month and send me photos. Sometimes in football unique moments come along, that’s what happened there. It is hard to enjoy life in a national team. They were five extraordinary years. I have had places, I should name Instituto de Cordoba where we had a brilliant team and I am wrong not to mention them, to not put them in first place. But the other place was something special</p>

We let all the hard work that we had done until that point go to waste. We betrayed ourselves, threw away everything we had worked for this season. It’s always a possibility that you can lose away at Toronto, the important thing is the way that we lost it today.</p>

  <p><b>[Painful lesson from 2017 playoffs leads to more adaptable Atlanta United]</b> What has brought us to this point is playing a certain way, so I don’t think we’re going to have to change for the playoffs. You play the playoffs differently (than the regular season) in any part of the world. Look at the Copa Libertadores and see if they play the same there as compared to the first round or in the tournament. It’s clear that teams prioritize the need to avoid errors because if you lose a league game in Week 9 and then you win in 10, 11, and 12 then nothing happens, once again you’re up in the standings. But here when you make a mistake and commit an error, you’re eating nuts in your house.</p>

Every time they have a chance to attack directly, they don’t waste time, in two passes they’re looking to be in the attacking third and they attack with a lot of players.

So we were going to have to opt for a style of play that we had played during the season, which was the line of five, and it was the system that has given us the most security defensively. This has helped us be solid defensively on the road and dominant at home</p>

  <p><b>[Atlanta United hopes to send off humble, direct Martino with MLS Cup win]</b> I’ve seen teams where there are bad relationships in the locker room but they can leave that aside and win on the field. For me, I’m not satisfied with any part of that. It’s very important to have a good group of people that get along well, where the people come in to work and do it in a happy way, that they enjoy being at the club. And it’s not just the players, but the coaching staff, the trainers also, the kit-man, the people who work around the club. In these two years, we’ve been able to work in a marvelous environment with exceptional facilities. I think that good energy over the course of time transmits itself on to the field.<br /><br />I liked the ideas and ambition the franchise had and I quickly started to follow with that same idea. Everything that has happened since shows the clarity Atlanta United has had with the way it wants to work and the path it set out to follow, and that’s what’s happening. The franchise’s expectations keep growing, since it’s only been two years. I’m surprised by the magnitude of everything, but not for what’s happened because what has happened was the first thing they put to me</p>

  <p><b>[MLS Cup title a fitting end for Tata Martino’s Atlanta United journey]</b> Well, we won one, that’s good. It’s been a long time. In 2013 with Newell’s and one title with Barca. Now this. After several disappointments, above all two in the Copa America. It’s a beautiful title and you celebrate after, obviously<br /><br />For me, to talk about the final and the championship, it’s good, it’s beautiful. I’m happy, but what has happened over the length of these two years is what will stay with me. The work we did. But I don’t think it’s necessary to win a title to think a job was well done<br /><br />I said what happened to me here is I started to feel like a coach again from the perspective of putting a team together, signing players, giving the team an identity, see how the players are growing in the last two years. A lot of times when you work at the top level, you feel like your part really isn’t as important, you don’t feel as involved in the growth. Here the same thing happened as happened at Newell’s. I felt like I participated, I felt happy, I felt I had an influence on the growth of the team and the growth of the players, and I’ll try to conserve this and try to think about this above all when I have the possibility to choose another job<br /><br />In the Toronto game, we saw that we weren’t as great in the build-up and we conceded a lot of goals. There were games before that which were a warning, but we didn’t lose. We changed, we got more solid</p>

But I can’t say it’s totally official.<br /><br />As I’ve said over the past few weeks, this past year, since I arrive in early January, I haven’t had chance to go back to Argentina once to visit family. This coming year, I couldn’t be able to stand another year like that, especially with all of the tournaments. You have to be here every day. It’s the labor of the job. I didn’t think I could do another year<br /><br />I just want to say that aside from Atlanta United, any national team gives you a little bit more free time. I don’t want to get completely into the analysis. There are are different responsibilities compared to clubs and national team</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle’s record signing Miguel Almiron will shut up ignorant critics]</b> Miguel has a commitment to the team, I’m talking about his commitment to winning the ball back, pressing, he’s a player that’s always working. He’s an atypical number 10. Because he gives you everything that a number 10 gives you and he probably dispossesses players like a defensive midfielder. So as a player who always works hard, he’s never absent in a game, even a game where your team isn’t dominating the offensive facet of the game</p>

  <p><b>[Tata Martino says he understands why fans may have concerns about a foreign coach leading the national team]</b> I understand that it’s always difficult for a national team to have a foreign manager. It’s a nationalistic question that also flows into football. We always think that the right thing is to make an effort to have domestic coaches. I don’t think that posture is bad. Right now, I’m here like <b>[Argentine Ricardo]</b> La Volpe was here or Osorio was here, also being from different countries. We’re taking it on with a lot of hope, with a lot of intensity and with a lot of desire. We weren’t born in Mexico, but when we’re in this role we’re putting on the shirt and giving our best. I’m not one of those people who kisses the shirt because my commitment is shown through work, but since the 6th or 7th of January, I don’t remember what it was, we’ve got the shirt on.<br /><br />A player doesn’t only define his situation by sporting issues, but rather also with personal ones. That’s where, as managers, we don’t have anything to say. Surely, he considered and analyzed the situation. I wouldn’t put it down as a step back, coming to a team with the characteristics that Tigres has. For me particularly, as manager of the national team, it’s true that we want the players to play in the best leagues in the world. The second step for me is that the players play, and in no way do I consider it a regression that he’s come to play here in Mexican football because when you analyze the European leagues, I don’t know if there are as many matches like America-Monterrey, Cruz Azul-America, Monterrey-Tigres, Tigres-Pachuca, in Mexico there are seven or eight teams that are really even and that gives the player competition. If you analyze the German league, the Spanish league, the Italian league, there are two or three teams that stand out above the rest and the other teams have a regular level. That’s on the football side, but there also is the personal side and every player has to make his own decision. I can’t add anything else to his choice</p>

  <p><b>[No problem calling up MLS or Liga MX based players]</b> My biggest concern is the rhythm the players are able to have. Obviously, we’re going to value the players who play in the best leagues in the world, but as I’ve said we’ll also value the players who have continuity. So, in that sense, for me it isn’t a problem that Carlos or Layun or Marco Fabian are coming to play in Mexico or in the United States’ league.<br /><br />Probably the Liga MX or the American league, there are a higher number of competitive games than in the Spanish league or the English league. If you look at the Premier League or the Spanish league, the really competitive games are 10 <b>[of the]</b> 38. Here the competitive games, if you really compare, in the United States where you have teams all having the same conditions for signing, I’m speaking in financial terms, you’re probably competing with more urgency over the long-term of the year in Liga MX or in the U.S. than the best leagues in Europe<br /><br />We can’t be full of players who aren’t playing, but yes there are cases where we can put value on players that we could need and there could be circumstances where players who aren’t playing could be called up</p>

  <p><b>[Tata Martino frustrated with Jesus Corona’s decision to miss Mexico camp]</b> Jesus, I made contact with him on the phone 17, 18 days before the call-up. He told me he was good. We did the call-up. Saturday he spoke with one of the doctors and told him he had a problem in his ankle, that he was playing with injections. Sunday I was in touch with him and told him that although he might not be able to train and might not be able to play, he could be with us in this camp, getting to know us and seeing how we work, including that if it was necessary he could continue or start his ankle rehabilitation here without any commitment that he had to play. At first, Jesus agreed, but five hours more or less after, while we were in the airport he called me again to tell me that he’d talked - I don’t know if with his family or with his agent or with his club - and told me he’d decided to do his recovery there and he didn’t feel good enough to travel. I didn’t agree with his decision but I respected it. I also told him that it’s not a position that starts and ends with this camp. There is going to be some repercussion in the future<br /><br />I’m not here to make future threats. Those are decisions the players make that you have to take naturally and respect it in a way, beyond the fact that obviously, I don’t share his opinion.

In these conversations with players - I spoke a lot with Carlos at the All-Star Game in Atlanta as well - we’re not getting to know everything about players in one hour, but you always leave with some conclusions after those types of chats. With him, in person, the Euros on the phone. After that, around a month passed and I made my first call-up. Seeing a bit of the chat and seeing a bit of the necessities we have right now, my decision was not to select Carlos Vela.<br /><br />I can’t give you that answer right now. We’ll have to see what happens on the way and probably chat again with the players in the local market and also those playing in Europe because I’d like to share opinions about what they went through in this camp<br /><br />What I tried to do is tell a bit of the story of how things went with Jesus in the last 17 or 18 days. What’s going to happen after is we have to resolve it with the coaching staff and fundamentally I have to resolve things with the player. What’s clear is that there’s a way to work that isn’t a big mystery but there are rights and obligations. The obligation Jesus had to come here - he didn’t come. He preferred to stay recovering in Porto. How much of that is the player’s, the club’s or the coach’s decision? Honestly, I’d love for the player to tell me, look the coach came and told me and I’m with him. This hasn’t happened, so there’s nothing I can do other than recount things as they happened</p>

  <p><b>[Martino looking to establish foundation as he begins Mexico journey]</b> To aspire for a fifth game, I think we have to have a style of playing. That’s what will give us fundamentals to dream about what can happen in a hypothetical World Cup. Today, that’s what I’m worrying about most, being able to quickly set up an idea of play that after the team might be able to maintain.<br /><br />It’s a system I like. I think we found the right soccer players to play it. Mexico has good wingers, it has good interior midfielders, interior midfielders with experience, young interior midfielders who are emerging. What I like beyond just the 4-3-3 is you can change to a back five if you need by moving back a central midfielder if it were necessary. We have players who can play that way as well. But I think what is the most important thing is to grasp a style of play so that after we can start to apply the different modifications that might be needed with the opponents’ performance<br /><br />We have the material that lets us dream and the dream is what moves us. But it sustains itself with the raw material we have, and what we have here is enough to be able to have a more successful World Cup than the past editions. For me, it’s not a small thing that a national team is systematically, during seven World Cups, getting into the round of 16. That’s a really important achievement, and you have to analyze it with how you get to the next step, but not just anyone gets to that stage at so many World Cups</p>

I think from the analysis side of the player, he’s absolutely ready<br /><br />I think there are several players. I haven’t been around all of them or had all of them in camp, maybe, we weren’t able to have everyone in we were hoping to in the local camp or at least we had to decide on some and not others. If I had to say a name and say this player is ready to do it, I think Edson Alvarez is the one.

He learns to be a national team player by playing in the conditions over time. If there’s someone that is out of the roster, it’s because there definitely is always someone out.

At the same time, I don’t think he should have any type of problem to play in the Gold Cup. The timing allows for him to be able to recover well and to participate. We’d never try to make him return too soon or risk it, but we’re really confident that he is going to be able to participate in the Gold Cup.<br /><br /><b>[Carlos Vela wasn’t part of the March games either]</b> It’s not about what he’s doing right now, Carlos has been doing that for a long time.

  <p><b>[Mexico is the favorite, and in Tata Martino’s eyes it should be. But to be the champion, it needs to be focused on this game against the Ticos]</b> With what we saw in the previous phase, there’s no reason to fall into some type of overconfidence. Even beyond the opponent’s historic success, it’s a quarterfinal. We’re on the wrong path if we’re overconfident. I don’t have to talk the players right now about what place they see Mexico in, in regards to the Gold Cup. When we talked as we came here, before the friendlies, we knew the place we were in. We accept that role, and we’re open to showing it in every one of the games we’ve played and the games we’re going to play.<br /><br /><b>[Mexico have to win]</b> Obviously, the big difference between a group game and one in the quarterfinals is there are 90 minutes and you go to your house if things don’t go well. We know that errors in those situations are fatal. We have to try and keep our style of play in the different conditions the game presents. It’s one thing to do it in a tournament where you have 19 matches, accepting that you can make a mistake in one or two and come back from that because there’s still a lot in front of you. Other times, there are teams who lose this form because they know that everything starts and ends in 90 minutes of soccer. It’s a different way of seeing tomorrow’s game and to see if we’re capable of confirming our current form</p>

  <p><b>[The Gold Cup is far from the most respected tournament in the world, but Mexico manager Tata Martino says people should give the tournament the respect it deserves]</b> I’ve seen good games in the Gold Cup. For me, Mexico vs. Costa Rica was a really good game in the Gold Cup. I don’t know if I’ve seen games like that in Copa America with this level of play. I’m not saying the Copa America is worse than the Gold Cup. Of course there is much more variety between teams<br /><br />It’s also true that it’s difficult to play against one standard of opponents in the group stage and then find yourself against others going forward, including, for us it’s been really difficult to get comfortable quickly with what Costa Rica wanted to do because the jump between Martinique - beyond the 3-2 - and Cuba. I’m not talking about Canada. And then suddenly you find yourself that’s a candidate to win the tournament like you, it’s the same thing I tell the guys here. If Mexico doesn’t play friendly matches that have a really high level, you end up playing a mid-tier and lower. Suddenly you play Germany in the first round of the World Cup. It’s not easy to get used to that.<br /><br />We’ve got Haiti, which I think has the revelation of the tournament. No matter what happens, Haiti is the revelation of the tournament. We had Costa Rica in the quarterfinals and if do well tomorrow we could have Jamaica in the final or the United States, another candidate to win the title. Those are three games in which the competition is really level. I think there’s another question which has to do with why you guys in the press devalue a competition so much. What’s the reason for doing that?

  <p><b>[Mexico manager Tata Martino has watched the film. He’s analyzed Haiti’s strengths and weaknesses - as well as those of his own team]</b> The first thing I have to say is Haiti is a tremendously effective team that has taken advantage of the chance the opponent has given them to get into the game. Costa Rica allowed it, and they took advantage. They turned it around. Canada let them get into the game, with a mistake on a ball played back and later a penalty, and they took advantage. So, it occurs to me that it’s an opponent against which you have to play the 90 minutes with a lot of intensity and attention because the smallest concession you give to the opponent they’re going to take advantage.<br /><br /><b>[Martino’s initial reviews of his team have generally been positive in the first six months]</b> We’ve got an attacking position with a lot of players, so we can take charge of the game. While we do prepare well for the moments in which the opponent can pressure us or command the match, don’t forget the first goal in the Martinique game, we also prepare to go to the space and the reality is we play a lot of time in the opponent’s half with possession of the ball, putting a lot of players into the attack. What we have to do is slow down the quick exits the opponent makes<br /><br />With the way we play, there really aren’t that many chances teams create on us with counter-attacks, with how much time we spend in the opponent’s half.

The first was against Chile, and the substantial difference between tonight’s game and the one against Chile is that we made errors in areas where we thought Argentina could hurt us. There were 15 minutes of the game in which we played well, but the game starts to get out of whack from an error<br /><br />I didn’t end up seeing a lot of disorder, what I kept seeing was a lot of errors. We started having doubts and slowness with our ball circulation, we didn’t find passes between the lines, there weren’t deep movements to understand a bit what happened in the middle of the field and in Argentina’s defence to find spaces in these areas</p>

  <p><b>[The Mexico national team center back had a horrendous showing against Argentina where <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> put three goals past El Tri in a 4-0 Argentina romp Tuesday night]</b> We have a way of setting up the game, with the central midfielder and the two center backs. You saw it in the first 15 minutes and it was giving the feeling that it was working - maybe we were playing a bit too deep, but it was working. When the first error happens, there’s no reason to think we didn’t want to keep playing the same game as the first 15 minutes<br /><br />But, as it happens, you start to have doubts, the fears, the fact that you put the ball in a place thinking your teammate is going to take it, the opponent is there and the disorder starts, the doubts about how things are going to work creep in. If we hadn’t committed the errors that allowed the goal, or even if Argentina had scored (the first) goal in another way, surely we would’ve competed a lot better<br /><br />It was a good opportunity to show our best way of playing, and the truth is we didn’t do it</p>

  <p><b>[Tata Martino said after the loss to Argentina]</b> I want to make something clear. I also talked to the players about It as well in the tactical chat. It’s not that I don’t want to have players who play abroad. The idea is not to have the majority of them who played in the Gold Cup. We understand we have to spend more time with the players who weren’t there those 40 days and in this context we’ll look at local player and foreign-based players as well</p>

  <p><b>[Tata Martino has made no bones about the fact that this game is set up essentially so he can see some of the young players he’s called into mini-camps in more competitive action before he begins the Concacaf Nations League campaign]</b> <b>[The manager said Tuesday he wants]</b> to know a little more about these guys, who have a really heavy year ahead of them with the Pre-Olympic tournament and the Olympics. But that doesn’t mean that having a good or bad game (Wednesday) will determine if they’re in for the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> dates<br /><br />I’m thinking much more in the future. Getting to know the guys, to know how they’re working, so they can understand the idea of play. We have the expectation that they see a national team and might know how it wants to play. A lot of them will be in the next <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> dates, and it’s really important that they come into the senior national team with an understanding of the style of play</p>

  <p><b>[Tata Martino enters the press room at Estadio Nemesio Diez and gives his verdict on Mexico’s 2-0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago]</b> Sometimes in this game and when the opponent allows it, we can fall into a bit of individualism because they want to show themselves. But generally I think we played with the idea of play we practiced, we carried it out. Sometimes we got deep, other times we didn’t hurt the opponent at all but I think we never were in danger of losing the result, we did well and the first 45 minutes stay with me</p>

  <p><b>[How Tata Martino’s Nations League approach sets Mexico up for future success]</b> We don’t have to go crazy asking for (generational) change. In the senior national team, we also have a lot of young players who could play in the Olympic games who are regularly coming in to play with us, and this group also can be important for the national team<br /><br />It’s a chance that we are given, fundamentally because of the club’s willingness to let us work with the players, be able to see them, to train. We had three weeks of the training process and were able to close it out with a game, which for a national team manager is a situation you can’t make any better. We really value it</p>

  <p><b>[Martino consistently has said that while some experienced players will take part in El Tri’s campaign in the new tournament, he is also looking to see the next generation]</b> We’ve made our call-up and are trying to start giving participation to the young players. That’s the idea. You have to compete, try to win this tournament since it’s really similar - not in the format but with the competitors - to the Gold Cup. You have to keep growing in some way, and that’s why there are 13 players that were in the game against Trinidad and Tobago last week</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico flying high as aerial game shines in romp over Bermuda]</b> Our game was serious, correct.

  <p><b>[Lozano shows he can shine for Mexico anywhere on the field - if he can avoid injury]</b> They’re things that happen. When sometimes you in the press ask how much does it help him to come in. And it’s true. When those things happen you can ask, ‘Why? Why?’ But it’s not the opponent’s fault or ours, the responsibility is that of the referees, who I insist have to impart justice<br /><br /><b>[Lozano worked well as a forward on Tuesday, dropping in to fight for the ball and keeping things circulating to his fellow attackers <a href="rodolfo-pizarro.html">Rodolfo Pizarro</a> and Roberto Alvarado]</b> I really liked the team in the first 38-40 minutes.

Then we found a third with pressure. On the one side I’m worried about the second half, on the other, I really liked almost all the first half</p>

Also because <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is characterized by selecting very good players, and Rodolfo surely is so I’m sure he’s going to bring a lot of satisfaction to Miami fans<br /><br />I think you don’t have to make so many comparisons. I think the Mexican league is a very good league. I think <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is a very good league. What’s certain is that players can pick the league in which they think they’re going to be better - in the sporting sense as well as the economic aspect and the quality of life. They’re very personal decisions and I try to give advice when possible and only when they ask me<br /><br /><b>[Martino’s viewpoint is an indication that perception is shifting to a place that’s very different than years past]</b> Well, I think there’s still a supremacy from the Mexican teams.

  <p><b>[Tata Martino remains optimistic that Mexico will be well-prepared for World Cup qualification]</b> If we can finalize them, they’re against very important opponents, and that would leave us with four really good games in the last time we get together with the players before the start of World Cup qualification. The goal this year is to get ready for the most important thing for us this year, which is qualification and getting to the next World Cup<br /><br />What I want to say first is not having top national teams from Europe doesn’t mean that we don’t have historical strength. They have good ranking, it’s just that they’re not the kind of teams that you in the press and us were expecting at first.<br /><br />I’m not the best-authorized voice to explain why the negotiations didn’t come through. I don’t participate in the negotiations. I just can give my point of view with respect to the opponents we’re facing. It’s clear, and I imagine that one of the explanations, is that the United States scheduled two games in Europe which really cut down on the chance we could bring in one of those European national teams who are looking to play two games.<br /><br />The two most relevant games in this region are against Mexico and the United States. The United States is going to Europe to play two very important matches so I assume that makes it much more difficult to be able to bring in those types of national teams</p>

If they call me and tell me that for April and until further notice they will readjust my salary to pay others, I would gladly accept it. Like I said before my compromise is to help others<br /><br />We have to be supportive of the people that need the money the most and also we have to find ways to help them in their daily lives. I think every single player and coach should agree to reduce their salary because it is a solution to a problem.

We scored the second goal running into space and if <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> ran into space, it was because something didn’t add up, but I thought that there was something we could add to the team, it was not denying them the chance to run.
