  <p><b>[Giels Brouwer says <a href="memphis-depay.html">Memphis Depay</a> made ‘the first laptop transfer’ when leaving <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> in 2017, with a sports analytics company helping the Dutch winger to identify the best club for him]</b> Memphis made the first laptop transfer by asking us for transfer advice with data. The agent of Memphis asked us to visit Memphis in Manchester where he was living at that moment. I went there with two colleagues and we watched a Champions League game on his couch. In our discussion about the next step in his career, he was really open about what he wanted and didn’t want. He wanted to play ‘more freely’, he wanted to be ‘important for the team’ and wanted to play in a big five competition with a coach that had a clear playing style. We translated these questions into data searches. We looked for instance at his playing style at <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> and the Dutch national team and compared that with the playing style of <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>. We noticed that he was involved with a lot more defensive actions at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>. Regarding importance of the team, we looked for teams who didn’t have their star player on LW or LCF. For playing style, we investigated consistency, speed of passing and transition, use of flanks and defensive line, the height of the defenders. One of his arguments was that playing style and development was more important than money. In the end, we wrote a report with five potential clubs that would suit his playing style and <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> was one of them. Of course, it is up to the agent and the club to make a deal as our work ends there.</p>
