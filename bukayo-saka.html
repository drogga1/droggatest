  <p><b>[Bukayo Saka has named <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> as his inspiration after his match-winning display for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in the Europa League]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. I love his mentality. He always wants to be the best, is always working hard on and off the pitch and trying to make his body the best. When he gets on the pitch he performs with full confidence and full personality and shows why he’s one of the best players to ever play football. I wouldn’t say I have his attitude as we are two different players, he is unique, but I try to look at him and take the good things from his game and one of the good things from his game is his mentality. He’s always focused, always working and I try to do that as well.<br /><br /><b>[Along with <a href="joe-willock.html">Joe Willock</a> and <a href="emile-smith-rowe.html">Emile Smith Rowe</a>, he was one of three academy products to start for the Gunners and another, <a href="reiss-nelson.html">Reiss Nelson</a>, was on the bench]</b> It’s good to have your mates around you. They push you on. When you’re down they pick you up, when they’re down I pick them up. It’s good to have them all around us. There will be a lot of opportunities in the Europa League. That’s how I made my debut last season and I hope I can continue to get more and more opportunities and keep progressing so I can play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and start playing for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s first team. I take a lot of confidence from this game. It was my first goal and I also managed to get two assists so I’m very happy with my performance</p>

I feel like he’s been a player before so he understands how I would feel, he’s played in my position and it’s just so good to have him there, an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> legend giving me advice. There’s not much more I can ask for<br /><br />He gives a lot of advice to me every day but the best piece of advice he’s given me is to stay humble. He’s been with me since I was 15, seen me do amazing things but he always tells me to stay humble and to keep working hard because he really thinks I can be a top player. It helps so much <b>[having <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a> around]</b>.

If I do something wrong, he’ll tell me, which is good because I don’t want him to think because I’m a young player that he won’t shout at me, put my confidence down. He tells me when I’m good too. I feel like I have learned so much playing in his team and I’m happy that he put his faith in me<br /><br /><b>[It was an excellent night for the Gunners and one that Saka will never forget]</b> I’ve always dreamt of this moment. From when I was a kid, <b>[I’ve wanted]</b> to score a goal for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Football Club. Now I’ve done it, I just want to keep working, stay humble, get that feeling again one day. I had so many messages: Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat. I had them from everyone. I even gave my dad a quick FaceTime call. He was so proud of me. He’s a massive inspiration for me. From when I was young, he always kept me grounded, kept me humble and I’m sure he’ll see some criticisms from tonight, something I can get better from, but I’m sure I would have made him happy. I couldn’t speak to him because the coaches wanted me to get in the ice bath for recovery. We just put our thumbs up to each other, I saw him smiling and it was a proud moment</p>

All of us competing makes us push to play better and better. If one player is injured then others get an opportunity but I want everyone to come back and do the best for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.<br /><br />The boss knows what I can do, what the other players can do. Different games require different players but I feel like I’ve shown the boss he can trust me. Whatever game he puts me in I’ll always give it my all. This has always been a dream for me. I’ve been working for this moment as a kid, in the academy. Now I’ve got to the first team I just want to give it my best to repay the faith the boss has given me. I just try to work hard, give my all and put in a good performance. Hopefully after I’ve put in that performance I can build on it. If the boss trusts me to play I’ll always do my best<br /><br /><b>[Saka believes giving youth a chance has benefited <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> so far this season, just as it has <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, who have also blooded a number of young players since the start of the campaign]</b> Both clubs have top young talent that they’re trying to integrate into the first team. It’s working for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and it’s working for us, too. I hope we can continue to get the chances, play well and show the boss what we can do<br /><br /><b>[It has been a whirlwind couple of months for the academy graduate, who has been quick to credit Emery and his team-mates for his impressive form]</b> The boss has really trusted me and put a lot of faith in me. He has given me the opportunity to work in this team. I’ve learned so much from the other players and it’s showing on the pitch. The players give me a lot of confidence and the boss gives me a lot of confidence. When the boss is going to start you at Old Trafford it’s going to give you a lot of confidence. I just try to go out there, do my best, play without fear and doubt. If the boss trusts me to do it I can do it</p>

  <p><b>[Bukayo Saka admits <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> need to win games and win trophies after hitting a serious slump]</b> <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> has his own way, his own philosophy and he’s even talked about bringing his own philosophy to the club, to try to bring the club back to the direction we need to be in. We need to win games and win trophies, so I feel like he has that vision and that strategy. He knows how he wants us to get there. If we can be on board and do what he wants us to, we’ll do well<br /><br />He’s someone who understands the players, understands the club and all the ideas that he’s bringing in. He has a clear strategy of how he wants us to play and we’re just really excited to work with him. He’s teaching us little things that we didn’t know before and just bringing in his own strategies, his own ways of playing. We can see that it’s going to work, we’re just looking forward to doing it. Maybe one thing that I’ve picked up straight away is that when nobody’s pressing you, you don’t need to pass the ball. What you can do is just get the ball, drive the ball forward a bit and wait for someone to come to you, commit a player, then pass it. Then that man will be free or that man will have less pressure on him. It’s just attracting players before you pass the ball off, which will help our team-mates a lot on the pitch</p>

You can see what the manager is building and we’re really delighted with the results we’re getting and that I can tie down my future here. I’m 18 and it’s been a dream to play for this club. I came up from the academy this season so I feel like I have to take it game by game. Wherever the boss puts me, I have to try and give my best.

We fought for every ball, we fought for every duel and we’re delighted to get the win. We just want to keep building some momentum. I know KT <b>[Kieran Tierney]</b>, I know where he likes to cross it… I anticipated that the ball was going to come to the edge of the box so I made sure I was there. When I got the ball, I knew at the far post was where the gaps were going to be and I just tried to guide it there. Luckily, it was a good finish and it went in. We fought for each other together and I feel like that’s why we got it over the line today. The subs that came on helped us so much and they gave us a boost. It feels like we’re more together.</p>
