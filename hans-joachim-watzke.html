  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has dismissed the notion that the Chinese Super League will be able to sign any of the best players in the world]</b> No, China won’t be able to buy football’s best stars. Tevez is also in the final stages of his career. If the Chinese Super League has decided that it wants to make older professionals even richer, then so be it. But I can not imagine that an extremely ambitious, reasonable player - who is not yet at his peak or in their mid-20s - would go to China. I would be very critical of this. Of course football is at risk of becoming broken; we have to take care that this does not escalate even further up and the bubble bursts. There can be no question of that.<br /><br />There used to be only three or four leagues who could bid such high sums. Globalisation has made it so that even China or Qatar can compete financially. Everything has changed… <b>[but]</b> at some point madness will calm down again. I only get a headache over wages when I feel that the money is not justified but I also have the feeling that with the football quite money is earned<br /><br />There is no reason for US investors to invest in the Premier League. The shareholders of Bayern Munich or Borussia Dortmund do not have the feeling that no money can be earned here.<br /><br />If there were losses, that would be different but the Bundesliga is an economic success story. Football fans must feel that their team’s players are earning their money; that’s the most important thing</p>

The BVB family was particularly strong when it had to cope with difficult situations. This is perhaps the most difficult situation we have had in the past decades and I am sure that we will show ourselves as BVB as strong and united as never before. We do not just play for us. We play for everyone. No matter whether Borussian, Bavarian or Schalke. We want to show that terror and hatred can never determine our actions. And of course we play for Marc Bartra, who wants to see his team win! We ask all BVB fans to support our team with full energy for 90 minutes.</p>

But we also explained that this is only possible within a certain window of time. We must find a replacement, which is difficult, if not impossible. Personally, I would prefer he stay with us, but there are a few clubs on this planet where he can obviously earn more.<br /><br />From his mentality and attitude to his great passion, Mario was always ready. That was never a concern. However, he suffered a serious illness. We have never talked about it in detail and will not. <b>[Sporting director]</b> Michael Zorc and I had very close contact with him over the last five months. We knew everything. The fact that it is now all going in the right direction makes us all happy.

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich’s signing of James Rodriguez is another example of the gulf in class between them and Borussia Dortmund]</b> We know our limits. James Rodriguez is an exceptional player. We would never be tempted to go for a player like that because with what he deserved, our salary structure would be completely blown up.<br /><br />If you can get such a player, that’s great - but in Germany that can only be Bayern. That’s why I cannot stand this whine that another club should win the league. They should all try it. They will usually fail. We need to increase our budget by €100 million, which would require an extra €250m in turnover. That is Utopian! But we are considered to be just a few miles away from reaching them or coming near them.<br /><br />In the international ranking, we are currently seventh. However, Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool are close behind us. They come at us with great speed and want to overtake us. In financial terms, we are still the second biggest in Germany, athletic too, even if RB Leipzig finished second. But to come in third and win the DFB-Pokal is a good achievement<br /><br />The style of BVB in the past two years has been a good one. We had good two years. That we changed the coach had nothing to do with the football we played. It would have been senseless to bring in a coach with a completely different style of play</p>

  <p><b>[Watzke has now revealed that questions were asked of <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>’s future]</b> A chief of one of the super clubs asked me back in spring if there was a chance <b>[to sign <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a>]</b> but I told him straight away he should forget about it and he never contacted me again. He knew I meant what I said<br /><br />There aren’t many 19-year-olds with such a potential. He is also not a player from the region or one who would have any connection to it. When you have a player like <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>, you must reassess the situation every single year. Everything else would not be honest.
