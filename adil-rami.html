  <p><b>[Pamela Anderson has accused Adil Rami of being a ‘monster’ as she announced in an Instagram post that she and the Marseille defender have broken up]</b> It’s hard to accept. The last (more than) 2 years of my life have been a big lie. I was scammed, led to believe… we were in ‘big love’? I’m devastated to find out in the last few days. That he was living a double life. He used to joke about other players who had girlfriends down the street in apartments close to their wives. He called those men monsters. But this is worse. He lied to all. How is it possible to control two women’s hearts and minds like this - I’m sure there were others. He is the monster. How could I have helped so many people @<b>[National Domestic Violence Hotline]</b> and not be wise enough or able to help myself.<br /><br />Narcissists don’t change. Sociopaths don’t change. I will run for my life - I have always fought for truth and justice. - this is my worst nightmare - I was not a very jealous person before I met him. I’m happy to know the truth. But it hurts like hell. I’m glad I spoke to his ex. My God. He lied to her about <b>[it]</b> all too. She’s also in shock and is very sad. It’s the evidence I needed to move on. He can’t hurt us more. He warned me that all the tabloids in France are his and his sisters’ friends? They control all - So my last note is here on Instagram.<br /><br />I don’t think I’ll recover easily from this. I am not a stupid girl. I felt many times his lies, his excuses. But we were together every day - unless I went away to work. This was always hard because he did not trust me? He was very insecure? He wanted me next to him always - or video every location I was?, with who? I learned to accept this as normal. And even found myself asking him the same ridiculous questions?<br /><br /><b>[But she has alleged that she is scared of the defender, who she says has gone to great lengths to try to get her back]</b> I will leave France now. He has tried all - He has sent flowers, letters - I did not accept. He showed up to my hotel. Security took him away. I have a body guard because he scares me. He has hurt me and threatened me many times. Some knew all along. <b>[Photographer and director]</b> David Lachapelle told me from the beginning that he was a liar. That he was not to be trusted. He told him to his face and looked at me and said. Pamela this is a fling. Don’t get your heart involved. I didn’t listen. I was not allowed to see David more after this. He cut my ‘crazy’ friends one by one out of my life. He should not be the face of protecting women from domestic violence. Or protecting women at all. He did this to improve image - only. He has no respect for any woman but his mother. And he lies to her too - they all lie. It’s very painful. I’m so, so sad. I will feel my feelings and move on</p>

  <p><b>[Adil Rami has offered an emotional response to the ‘really disgusting’ accusations levelled at him by former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson. The Marseille star was branded a ‘monster’ by his former partner and told that he should not be the face of protecting women from domestic violence]</b> Hello everyone. Well, I have no choice, I’m sorry. I kept silent because I am shocked and it is very difficult to speak without interpreting every word. But I have too much on my heart. I will make it simple and super clear and as I said before I will not comment on the details of my life with Pamela. I want to tell you that these accusations of violence are completely false and I cannot let that go. Those who know me know who I am and my values. They know it’s impossible and that I would never do that.<br /><br />If she wanted to hurt me, she chose well. She knows that my commitment to the cause of violence against women is something that is really important to me. This is really disgusting. Lying to keep a good relationship with her ex and her children is one thing, but using lies about violence to hurt me, it goes too far and it’s unfair. Again I will not let these false accusations about me and my family go unanswered. All this is too serious. Here, I have said what I had to say from the heart. I let the pros take care of it now</p>

  <p><b>[Adil Rami recalls an interaction he had with President of Croatia Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic after Les Bleus’ 4-2 victory over Croatia in the World Cup Final]</b> After the World Cup Final, the president of Croatia looked at me and said ‘nice moustache’. And I told her, ‘I love Mykonos’. I don’t know why but I’ve always confused Greece and Croatia. She said ‘thank you’ and she left. Then, <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a> looks at me and says: ‘Are you stupid? Mykonos is Greece’. I told him, ‘Oh god, I don’t know anymore. It’s okay, I’m world champion!’</p>
