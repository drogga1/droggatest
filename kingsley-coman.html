<p>: 2019 08 01
Kingsley Coman has sustained only bruising to his knee and could be available for Bayern Munich’s DFL-Supercup clash with Borussia Dortmund on Saturday</p>

  <p><b>[Kingsley Coman was also pleased to come away with two victories and strong showing on the personal level, and says his fitness is a big part of his progress in France’s 3-0 win over Andorra]</b> It’s a very nice week. It went well on the personal and collective level. When the body follows, it’s easy to be at the top level, and I will continue to work. My quality of dribbling, when I returned, I could bring it. And that of a finisher! It’s always fun when I have it, especially in team France. It’s very nice to have more play time and I try to return the confidence that the coach gives me. I do not set myself on fire yet, because the season is long and we must never be satisfied with one or two good performances</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman admits that he does not believe he will ever become a prolific goal scorer]</b> I’ve forced to be more present in front of goal and I’m creating more chances. I don’t think I’ll ever be someone to score 30, 40 or 50 goals in a season. This instinct to be a killer in front of goal, it’s not natural to me, even if I work for it. I love creating goals. But I know that scoring is very important. So I’m strict with myself and I try to be more egotistical. I want to break my record of 12 goals in a season – to get more is my objective. I know that stats are very important but I don’t want to totally change my game and be in the box all the time. I’m a winger, my target is first and foremost to create. The team must be homogenous and there has to be different types of players<br /><br /><b>[Coman is coming off a difficult 2018-19 campaign, in which he twice had surgery, the winger admits it was a tough period in his career]</b> It was a hard year because I had two operations and two long periods out on crutches that lasted seven or eight weeks. And when you’re on crutches and you live because of your feet, there’s nothing you can do. And each time I took to the field, the ankle was sore. When I came back for the second time, I said that if I was injured for a third time, I could quit football, but I was emotional. Psychologically, I was very low but happily it did not last too long</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman says he wants to follow in the footsteps of compatriot <a href="franck-ribery.html">Franck Ribery</a> and stay at the club for a long time]</b> I’ve been playing at Bayern for five years now – that’s almost half. In all seriousness, I’m only 23 so I have around 10 more years at the highest level ahead of me. It’s too early to predict my whole career path. Of course I can picture myself staying 12 years like Franck, and then I’d still be young and have enough time to discover two or three new countries. I’m sure that I’ll stay at Bayern for a long time yet. The city is great, the club are very good, we’re winning trophies – we’re just missing the Champions League. Apart from the weather, I wouldn’t change a thing<br /><br />I’ve played a lot of games since my last injury. I feel the trust of the club, I feel like an important part of the team and I want to keep contributing more and more in the future, off the pitch too. I’m working as hard as possible. <a href="franck-ribery.html">Franck Ribery</a> and <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a> were here for over a decade, they had great careers. There’s more to that than just always playing well, which is hard enough. I hope that I’ll also have a great career in my own right</p>

  <p><b>[In 2018 Kingsley Coman made comments suggesting he would consider retirement if he suffered a serious injury again in his career]</b> It was a very difficult year. When I hurt myself, it was the end of the world for me. I hope I don’t have to relive what I’ve been through, enough is enough. I will not accept a third operation – it will mean maybe my foot is not made for this level. I will then lead another life, an anonymous life<br /><br /><b>[However, he backtracked shortly after, telling German media that he was trying to explain how another rehabilitation on his ankle would be crushing]</b> That was misinterpreted. I meant that I wouldn’t feel like having to go to rehabilitation again if I suffered the same injury once again in the same year - meaning in the next few weeks. I didn’t comment on anything further out in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Kingsley Coman is fully committed to Bayern Munich]</b> I don’t know what I want in five years so anything is possible. To stay at the top level and to win the most titles. Bayern is one of the clubs where you can do that.<br /><br /><b>[Asked to pick out the best coach]</b> I would say <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> because he is the one who made me start playing a little more regularly even if I had played a few matches at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. For a player in my position, a winger who likes to hit and provoke, he is the best coach we can have because that is what demands us the most. He creates systems to have one-on-one situations and it’s the system where I can flourish the most. He didn’t ask me to have stats. He just asked me to take, hit and centre. And that was what I appreciated very much.</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman has apologised and is facing a fine from his club after driving his McLaren 570S Spider to training]</b> I would like to apologise to the club and Audi for not having come to training in my company car. The reason was a damaged wing mirror on my Audi. Still, that was a mistake, of course I can see that. As a reparation, I will visit the Audi plant in Ingolstadt for an autograph hour as soon as possible and bring some attention to the employees</p>

  <p><b>[Kingsley Coman says he will have no problem if <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> sign <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a>, and has vowed to stay and fight for his place in the team]</b> If Sane came, it would not be a problem! Except if the club says to me that they no longer need me, but I think the club knows what it has in me. The situation of <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> has nothing to do with my own future. When I came to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> we had <a href="franck-ribery.html">Franck Ribery</a>, <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a>, <a href="douglas-costa.html">Douglas Costa</a> and me, and I was still a young player, in front of the legends <a href="franck-ribery.html">Ribery</a> and <a href="arjen-robben.html">Robben</a>! You can see that that’s not a problem for me. It is better for the team if there are many players at this level<br /><br /><b>[Coman went on to insist that he is in no rush to make a decision on his long-term future]</b> I have a contract until 2023, which means we have time. I want to finish the season, after that, in the summer, I can think about my situation: what I want to do, what decision is good</p>
