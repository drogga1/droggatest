  <p><b>[Wonderkid Camavinga responds to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> links]</b> Honestly, I don’t focus too much on that. Certainly, it’s nice that big clubs like the ones mentioned are interested in me, but conversely, I’m not too interested in that. Especially since I am doing well at Rennes. We’ll see what happens next, I’ll let my parents and my agents manage this.<br /><br />I don’t look too much, but I see anyway. In fact, I can’t avoid it. Sometimes, I’m quickly on social networks and I see things or friends send me articles. Once, in Amiens in the League Cup, an opponent said to me: ‘We have to exchange our shirts before you go to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>.’ But I didn’t really want to joke, we had just been eliminated. After that, I thought about it, I laughed about it<br /><br />Everything about negotiations and discussions during the season is really none of my business. When the season starts, I focus exclusively on football, I let my agents and my parents settle everything else and then we talk again at the end of the season, when necessary. But if there had been such an important agreement in mid-season, frankly, I would know. My future, we will see at the end of the season.</p>
