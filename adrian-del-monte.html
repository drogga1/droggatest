<blockquote>
  <p>The veteran left-back <b>[Roberto Carlos]</b> has called for his Brazilian compatriot to join him in Turkey amid his recent troubles. Inter’s Brazilian hitman <a href="adriano.html">Adriano</a> has recently declared that he wants to take a break from football to deal with his personal issues that have been severely affecting him both on and off the field this season<br /><br /><a href="adriano.html">Adriano</a>’s return date to professional football is unknown at this point, and it is highly unlikely that the <a href="inter-milan.html">Nerazzurri</a> will want him back at the club. With this in mind, Adri’s former Brazilian team-mate <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a>, has taken the liberty in inviting him to Turkish outfit, Fenerbahce.<br /><br />Later this week, <a href="adriano.html">Adriano</a>’s agent Gilmar Rinaldi is expected in Milan to discuss his client’s future at Inter, however as previously mentioned, it is highly likely that his career with the reigning Italian champions will come to end<br /><br />If the Turkish outfit do show interest in the powerful striker, then it won’t be the first time that this will be the case, as there were reports suggesting that they were keen to acquire his services back in 2007, when <a href="zico.html">Zico</a> was in charge<br /><br />All of this, however, will depend on the agreement between <a href="adriano.html">Adriano</a> and <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a>, as the Italian giants may put in a clause that prevents him from moving to another top European club</p>
