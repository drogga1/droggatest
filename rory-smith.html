<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Rory Smith emphasises the importance of the return of fans on clubs lower down the football pyramid but warned all measures remain subject to the control of coronavirus]</b> <b>[The return of fans]</b> is especially crucial for the EFL. The Championship is due to finish on Wednesday but with the play-offs to follow, clubs can survive because of the share of the EFL TV deal they get. But for clubs in Leagues One and Two, who are talking about starting the season in September, they are essentially mothballed at the moment; their squads are dwindling down, they are not functioning as football clubs in any real sense and they are hoping to be there when the season kicks off<br /><br />They need fans to be back as quickly as possible to make their whole business model worthwhile and project the integrity of the entire football pyramid, which is integral for the health of English football. Everyone around Europe is looking into this, it’s key to football’s health, but the one thing it is still dependant on is what happens with the virus. If the virus is still in control and we see increased infection rates, then whatever they are planning now won’t be able to happen</p>
