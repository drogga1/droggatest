  <p>[The Mousedeers’ Montenegrin forward Ilija Spasojević announced that he has relinquished his captaincy at the side] I would like to announce to all MU [Melaka] fans about my decision to relinquish my captaincy of the team. I have thought about it for a long time, and has told the head coach about it this morning.<br /><br />I always put the interests of the team before my career and want to hand over the responsibility of leading the team to a more deserving player. I promise that my dedication remains the same, I’ll give my 100% to this team as long as my services are still needed</p>

  <p>[Relegation-threatened Super League side Melaka United have hired a new head coach] What a great experience playing for Melaka United during this 18 months. Thanks to my teammates for their unconditional support on and off the pitch. Thanks to all the coaches I worked with during this time, especially to coach Mat Zan who recognize my football strengths and pull the best out of me. Thanks to club management and all the staff for taking good care of me and my family.<br /><br />Finally, biggest thanks to all people of Melaka and our amazing supporters. Your love for the club is amazing, keep supporting the team as you always do. I may not wear this jersey anymore but I will always be a part of big Melaka United family. Gegau Melaka Gegau!</p>

  <p>[Former Melaka United star Ilija Spasojevic is open to the idea of rejoining Indonesian club Persib Bandung] I have an emotional connection with Persib and Bobotoh. I’ve been reading [on social media], many of them want me to return to Persib. Their belief in me is extraordinary. I really appreciate it, and am grateful for it.<br /><br />So far Persib have not contacted me, and I am still open to all possibilities. I am here for Persib whenever needed. So far there has only been interest and discussions with Barito Putera, but there has been no agreement. I am currently a free agent. So, we’ll see how it goes</p>
