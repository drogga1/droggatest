<blockquote>
  <p><b>[FC Utrecht set to challenge Eredivisie ruling after missing out on Europa League]</b> FC Utrecht does not accept the intended decision to distribute the European places. FC Utrecht does not hesitate to challenge the decision not to award a place to us before a sports tribunal and <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>. After written correspondence earlier today, the KNVB announced via a conference call that the European place will be allocated to numbers 1 to 5 in the current Eredivisie rankings. It is unacceptable for FC Utrecht that the cup competition, for which the final has not been played, is completely ignored and does not count in the consideration of which club is entitled to a European ticket on sporting grounds. The Europa League group stage ticket will be awarded to Feyenoord without any explanation based on the league table. FC Utrecht is just as entitled to this ticket as fellow cup finalist Feyenoord (and even more entitled because it has won a cup match more than Feyenoord), which is not included in the presentation of the decisions today.<br /><br />Based on the rankings, FC Utrecht is also shorted. We are at position six of the Eredivisie at the end of the competition, but the club has played a match less than Willem II. In the explanation, the <a href="knvb.html">KNVB</a> has not spoken a word about the fact that FC Utrecht has played a match less than Willem II and would overtake the Tilburg team in the rankings if they win. In that case, FC Utrecht would have the same number of points, but a much better goal difference, more goals scored and a better mutual result. According to FC Utrecht, the decision to shift the European place from the cup to the competition is not based on sporting grounds and cannot be justified in any other way. This is the main prize for another competition. The highest prize of the cup competition, which only two clubs are entitled to, cannot therefore simply be shifted according to regulations. In fact, during the call, the <a href="knvb.html">KNVB</a> announced that shifting the place for the group stage of the Europa League from cup to competition may mean that <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> will not allow the place. The decision-making of the professional football board (the lack of transparency and objectivity) is therefore very much against FC Utrecht. This process is not accepted by the club. FC Utrecht is convinced that the club is entitled to a place in European football on sporting grounds, because of the place in the cup final and because of the current Eredivisie ranking, where, with a game less played, we have better mutual results than compared to Willem II. There is no doubt that FC Utrecht deserves a European ticket based on the current seasonâ€™s sporting achievements.</p>
