  <p><b>[Elise Kellond-Knight after reaching her 100th senior international cap with <a href="ffa.html">the Matildas</a>]</b> It’s a good feeling. It’s a sign of how much dedication and commitment I’ve had to the game over the years and I love being part of it. There’s an enormous amount of pride to be able to put on that jersey for the 100th time. Every time I do, it’s a special feeling</p>

  <p><b>[After Australia’s 3-2 victory over Brazil in on Wednesday evening, Elise Kellond-Knight revealed just what inspired <a href="ffa.html">the Matildas</a> to their first win. Asked about the nature of Brazil’s celebrations after they scored]</b> It pisses you off a little bit to be honest with you. It’s such a big rivalry as it is and then to see them celebrating and putting it in your face a little bit, it fires you up. So good on them, it gave us a little bit more encouragement.<br /><br /><b>[They had lost their first game in a shock 2-1 defeat to Italy]</b> We believe. We are a team that believe in what we can do. 2-0 down, backs against the wall, it just shows the character of this team. I think until we’re down and out, we’ll keep believing. Results recently haven’t been convincing, <b>[we’ve got]</b> a little bit of criticism but it’s safe to say we will have won a lot of support back after that game. Not only getting a result, but the way we played, the excitement of the game and seeing the courage and the character. How could you not want to support a team like this?<br /><br /><b>[Kellond-Knight believes it was luck due to Australia though, who were the better team throughout]</b> It’s football isn’t it? You’ve got to put the ball in there and you’ve got to make luck in a way. Some people say sometimes that the goals are just luck, but you’re making the luck. You’re dominating the game, you’re dominating where the ball is played, so in a way we created those chances, with a bit of fortune<br /><br />There’s a long way to go. This tournament is a marathon so we can’t get overly excited after one win. We’re going to enjoy it, of course, but we know we’ve got a mountain ahead of us so we’re ready for the challenge<br /><br /><b>[Up next for <a href="ffa.html">the Matildas</a>, in their final group game, are Jamaica, who face Italy on Thursday]</b> They are a decent team. They’re dangerous and unpredictable so we’re going to have to be on our game against them and it’s another challenge we face next week. <b>[Conceding]</b> two goals is again a concern but look at the character of this team. To get three and win the game is just amazing</p>

  <p><b>[Elise Kellond-Knight on the <a href="ffa.html">Football Federation Australia</a>’s ground-breaking deal that closes the pay gap between the men’s and women’s national teams]</b> This new deal is enormous, because as a female footballer it’s what we’ve always dreamed of. We’ve always wanted to be treated equal, we’ve wanted to be able to step out on that pitch with equal opportunity and have the equal facilities that the men have been exposed to. So as a player, the new <b>[collective bargaining agreement]</b> shows signs of respect. Now we’re going to be completely included and also have opportunities. I think having these facilities that the men have been exposed to is now going to set us up for success<br /><br />I’m towards the end of my career now - I’m 29 - but for me, the big winners are this younger generation. They’re looking at this new deal and thinking, ‘Wow, I can make a go of it’. When I was their age, when I was up and coming at 12, 14, I didn’t know who <a href="ffa.html">the Matildas</a> were. Now we’re renowned, now there’s going to be an established professional career path for them and it’s just going to attract more females to the game</p>
