  <p><b>[Elise Kellond-Knight after reaching her 100th senior international cap with the Matildas]</b> It’s a good feeling. It’s a sign of how much dedication and commitment I’ve had to the game over the years and I love being part of it. There’s an enormous amount of pride to be able to put on that jersey for the 100th time. Every time I do, it’s a special feeling</p>

  <p><b>[Elise Kellond-Knight in Response to Brazil Celebrations at going 2-0 ahead]</b> It pisses you off a little bit to be honest with you. It’s such a big rivalry as it is and then to see them celebrating and putting it in your face a little bit, it fires you up. So good on them, it gave us a little bit more encouragement</p>

  <p><b>[Elise Kellond-Knight on the Football Federation Australia’s ground-breaking deal that closes the pay gap between the men’s and women’s national teams]</b> This new deal is enormous, because as a female footballer it’s what we’ve always dreamed of. We’ve always wanted to be treated equal, we’ve wanted to be able to step out on that pitch with equal opportunity and have the equal facilities that the men have been exposed to. So as a player, the new <b>[collective bargaining agreement]</b> shows signs of respect. Now we’re going to be completely included and also have opportunities. I think having these facilities that the men have been exposed to is now going to set us up for success<br /><br />I’m towards the end of my career now - I’m 29 - but for me, the big winners are this younger generation. They’re looking at this new deal and thinking, ‘Wow, I can make a go of it’. When I was their age, when I was up and coming at 12, 14, I didn’t know who the Matildas were. Now we’re renowned, now there’s going to be an established professional career path for them and it’s just going to attract more females to the game</p>
