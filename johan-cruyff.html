  <p><b>[Netherlands v France to pause for Johan Cruyff silence]</b> The KNVB, including the national team and its staff is deeply touched by the news that Cruyff has passed away. Our thoughts are with his family, who were with him when he passed away. Cruyff’s death is a huge loss for Dutch football and we will honour him in a number of ways. Netherlands play France on Friday and the game will be stopped in the 14th minute for one minute’s silence. The KNVB hopes amateur sides across the country will also pay tribute to Cruyff, but leaves it up to the clubs how to do so.</p>

  <p><b>[Johan Cruyff has attacked Netherlands’ style of play]</b> Against weaker teams we seem unable to build well, so we cannot attack. Jeroen Zoet did not have to react to one shot, but had to clear about 20 balls with his feet. Netherlands completely lost control against Kazakhstan. It was painful that Robin van Persie, since coming on in the 87th minute, touched the ball once. The comments that Netherlands does not have good young players coming through don’t make sense. It proves that the last World Cup was not properly analysed. People did not wonder how they had gone so far in Brazil. Things were back to normal for most after that somewhat surprising third-place finish. And now they are facing the consequences.</p>

As a coach, my teams might have won more games if we’d played in a less adventurous way. Maybe I’d have earned a little more and the bonuses would have been bigger, but if people say that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> were playing the nicest football in the world with me as coach, what more can I ask for? If you’re appearing in the World Cup final it may be the biggest occasion of your life, so why be sad and fearful? Be happy, express yourself and play. Make it special for you and for everyone watching. For the good of football, we need a team of invention, attacking ideas and style to emerge.

  <p><b>[What is tiki-taka?

It’s not like somebody runs 100 yards in nine seconds and if you can’t do it, you don’t count. You always count because you can always get better. If you want to play basketball you’ve got to be two metres. Otherwise you can’t play. Here, everyone can play and everyone can develop. That’s the nicest thing about the game of football</p>
