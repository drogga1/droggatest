  <p><b>[Jesus Corona said after the match that he was confident in his teammates’ ability to cut down chances from the opposition]</b> We’ve got a big responsibility but we also know that we have a chance to show ourselves. If we come to the Gold Cup, it’s to win it. Of course, we have to show game-by-game that we’re capable of doing that</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico wasn’t surprised that Curacao gave it a challenge Sunday]</b> We know that Curacao was going to come out like that, go forward and try to hurt us. We were thinking about that and that we were going to have to intervene. The opponent does its job too, the opponent counts. I had to get involved a couple of times but the other goalkeeper also made a lot of saves. He stopped two goals that could’ve gone in our favor.</p>

  <p><b>[Edgar Mendez needs to step up for Cruz Azul]</b> Greatness isn’t lost. I have no doubt about this. What has been achieved in 53 years, the titles won in Mexico and the international titles are there. We’re going through a drought, and we’re the ones responsible for that. We’re going to keep working, looking for the team that can win championships. It’s by fighting we’ll be able to return Cruz Azul to the golden years.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Cruz Azul playing dangerous game]</b> We weren’t having trouble. Tigres wasn’t getting forward. It annoys me. We look stupid when the opponent isn’t creating chances and we set things up for them. The little details are the ones that define football. I’ve always said the great teams are the ones who don’t mess up. We’re missing a little of this, being more focused on the details.</p>

  <p><b>[Corona shows no signs of confidence issues in Mexico’s scoreless draw]</b> I think we showed that we connect really well and that we know each other. At the end, we lacked finishing, which is the most important.<br /><br />I’m good. Somethings that’s how things go. I think the manager told me that they were going to push me more and so they were on me but I’m going to keep working to get better physically</p>

  <p><b>[Jesus Corona ready for another season with the Dragons]</b> The team is ready for what’s coming. We did make great efforts to be good next Saturday. The new players are to discovering what it is to love FC Porto, and we will continue to work for that. Vacations were good, but now we have to work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Clasico Joven]</b> I think next Saturday will be a good test. We’re capable of winning the double, and we’re working to get there. Every one of us is thinking in getting it. We’d like to return to the top of the table. We’re working to be the best. We want to stay as leaders to the tournament, and we have to show that.</p>
