<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Orlando Pirates head coach Kjell Jonevret has confirmed that he will consider reinforcing the squad ahead of the new season given the challenges they have come across this season]</b> I’m not going to sit here and talk negatively about the players that we have - definitely not, but I can also see not only there <b>[in defence]</b>‚ but that there are midfielders and other players <b>[needed]</b>.<br /><br />I saw a few clips on the internet from matches last year‚ and there were so many faces I did not recognise, and I feel there are a lot of players who have left us, but I think there is a reason why Orlando Pirates now are in 10th or 11th place in the league.<br /><br />If we want to be up there in the future‚ I think we have to look at all departments - defenders‚ midfielders and maybe forwards also. This period has been good for me. We have a lot of players out there - maybe 30 players and they are all good players, but I am not sure if they are all quality players.<br /><br />I think we will discuss that first within the club‚ and then maybe with you <b>[the media]</b>. I’m happy with the players we have out there, but of course I can see that many good players left us from last season</p>
