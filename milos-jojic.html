  <p><b>[Milos Jojic says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> boss creates ‘special atmosphere’]</b> The journalist took my statement out of context so that it came across as if <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> and I had never spoken to each other. At that time, however, I still didn’t speak German very well and it was quite normal for us not to have spoken much<br /><br /><a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is just a great guy and a positive person. He creates a special atmosphere in the team in which everyone is motivated. Every squad player always gives 100%, no matter how much playing time they got before. I only look back with good feelings<br /><br /><b>[A switch to Turkey followed with Basaksehir]</b> Basaksehir is a good club, the training centre and the stadium are great. But the club has no tradition and few fans. We’ve been close to winning the league for the past few years but there has always been a little something missing. It was a bit difficult for me personally, for example in terms of discipline. I was used to other things in Germany. The character of some people wasn’t ideal either. They bet on old players and big names. They like stars and they give them preference – I don’t think I got a real chance. They said they wanted to start a project with young players and then 35, 36-year-olds came back. I didn’t understand that. I really wanted to leave and I think I made a good move. I’ve always worked hard to be fit for my next station and not to lose my head</p>
