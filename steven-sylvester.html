  <p><b>[psychologist Steven Sylvester says <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players will have George Floyd on their minds]</b> It would be remiss of me not to mention George Floyd and the whole feeling of inequality, access to opportunity and to have a fair opportunity to do your work, whoever you are in society. As a psychologist I spend a lot of time hearing people’s stories about fairness, justice, inequality and it would be wrong to say that it isn’t on their minds. Every player is thinking about that. I’ve had so many discussions with all different players from all different backgrounds on how to bring people together and celebrate difference. Those conversations do make particularly black footballers want to disclose how they personally feel about the situation, the particular situation that we’re living in with unfairness in society. When I speak privately as I do for many hours a week with <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> footballers, they all have a voice and they all want to find a way to make sure unfairness gets resolved<br /><br /><b>[Sylvester believes clubs should have an agreement in place with their players on how they can come together to protest collectively]</b> Something needs to be done and what I would say is that the clubs should have a club protocol on how to protest. We saw <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> take the knee in their friendly match. I think the players have to come together and I would urge all players to talk to one another in every club and make sure there’s a uniformed protest about what happened because we’re all horrified<br /><br />There are some who are so excited and they can’t wait to get back to doing their job because it’s been a long time since they last played. There are others who are just thinking ‘oh my gosh, I’m training all the time and games behind closed doors is an issue or it’s making me feel a bit nervous. I’m fearful about the virus and what that means and I feel slightly like a guinea pig. Players are very professional. They get back to doing their work but you mix the fact that they’re human just like anyone else and we’re all fearful of the virus. On top of that they’ve got the demands of finishing a nine-game or 10-game season and get up to speed and be ready to play in a very unusual atmosphere</p>
