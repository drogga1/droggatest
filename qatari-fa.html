  <p><b>[Annual External Compliance report of SC’s Workers’ Welfare Standards published. SC Secretary General, H.E. Hassan Al Thawadi was buoyed by the results of the auditor and stated on the same]</b> We have always believed that the 2022 FIFA World Cup will be a catalyst to accelerate positive initiatives already being undertaken in Qatar, leaving a legacy of enhanced, sustainable and meaningful progress around workers’ welfare. While the findings clearly state there are challenges, they also demonstrate our continued commitment to this process.<br /><br />We will do everything necessary to ensure the issues identified are dealt with promptly. We respect the diligence shown by Impactt during their audits and the constructive observations and recommendations made</p>

  <p><b>[Meet the Indian behind the ‘Made in Qatar’ 2022 FIFA World Cup seats. Nishad Azeem said]</b> You can say that the seats manufactured for the 2022 stadiums are 95% Middle Eastern and 5% Indian. Actually India deserves more than 5%.<br /><br />The seat is 100% recyclable, and the fact that we have sourced most raw materials locally - aluminium from Qatar, polypropylene from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and steel from Oman - reduces the carbon footprint. All the raw materials are recyclable and this fits in well with the sustainability goals of the SC for the 2022 FIFA World Cup<br /><br />I want the world to say in 2022 that Qatar made the best stadiums seats they have ever seen. Secondly, our objective is to be a reputed exporter of seats from Qatar and doing so to my country of birth would be a matter of pride. Currently, we have distribution rights in the MENA region and it is a no-brainer where I want to take my seats next</p>

We believe that the extent of our cooperation with this investigation and the conclusions drawn represent a vindication of the integrity of our bid. We will continue to dedicate ourselves toward delivering on the promises we made during our bid and hosting an historic first FIFA World Cup in the Middle East.</p>

  <p><b>[Plans revealed for incredible ground-breaking 2022 World Cup stadium in Qatar]</b> As well as providing invaluable infrastructure to sporting projects far and wide, Ras Abu Aboud Stadium will also give global stadium developers and tournament planners a fine example to follow. The venue’s temporary nature and clever modular design will mean that fewer building materials will be required than in traditional stadium building, helping to keep construction costs down. And with other projects reusing the seats, roof and other components of the arena, parts of the venue will be utilised for years and even decades to come.<br /><br />Minimising construction costs and ensuring regular future use are the key ingredients in making a new stadium - and sporting mega events - sustainable. Ras Abu Aboud Stadium will create an innovative blueprint that many others will follow.</p>
