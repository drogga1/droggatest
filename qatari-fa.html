  <p><b>[Annual External Compliance report of SC’s Workers’ Welfare Standards published. SC Secretary General, H.E. Hassan Al Thawadi was buoyed by the results of the auditor and stated on the same]</b> We have always believed that the 2022 FIFA World Cup will be a catalyst to accelerate positive initiatives already being undertaken in Qatar, leaving a legacy of enhanced, sustainable and meaningful progress around workers’ welfare. While the findings clearly state there are challenges, they also demonstrate our continued commitment to this process.<br /><br />We will do everything necessary to ensure the issues identified are dealt with promptly. We respect the diligence shown by Impactt during their audits and the constructive observations and recommendations made</p>

We’re at about 500 workers</p>

  <p><b>[Meet the Indian behind the ‘Made in Qatar’ 2022 FIFA World Cup seats. Nishad Azeem said]</b> You can say that the seats manufactured for the 2022 stadiums are 95% Middle Eastern and 5% Indian. Actually India deserves more than 5%.<br /><br />The seat is 100% recyclable, and the fact that we have sourced most raw materials locally - aluminium from Qatar, polypropylene from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and steel from Oman - reduces the carbon footprint. All the raw materials are recyclable and this fits in well with the sustainability goals of the SC for the 2022 FIFA World Cup<br /><br />I want the world to say in 2022 that Qatar made the best stadiums seats they have ever seen. Secondly, our objective is to be a reputed exporter of seats from Qatar and doing so to my country of birth would be a matter of pride. Currently, we have distribution rights in the MENA region and it is a no-brainer where I want to take my seats next</p>
