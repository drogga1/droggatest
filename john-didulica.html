  <p><b>[CSL gold rush could be over for Aussies]</b> The impact of this change on Australian players will be significant. Effectively, our players will need to compete with players from around the world for positions within the CSL, not just Asia. Clearly, as Asian champions, we are highly-coveted throughout Asia and likely present excellent value given the significant disparity between those salaries in the A-League and those, for example, in the J.League.</p>

  <p><b>[PFA revealed what it believes a national second division would cost clubs]</b> We need more employment, more secure employment, we need pathways for young players, for retiring players, we need pathways for coaches - so these are the things that are motivating us. You wrap that around our need to be internationally competitive in terms of global competition, it makes very sound policy sense to build our professional football footprint.<br /><br />We need to actually set the bar at the level that we can constructively build Australian football. FFA Cup could force promotion-relegation. Part of that is a player pathway piece, which is the players need to be in a professional environment and that comes with a price-tag. The second part is that clubs - if they are realistic about joining the A-League, if they’re realistic about having a high quality product for their fans - that needs to be at a certain level as well … there’s no point in having a second tier where clubs are turning over $1.5m or $2m</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Australian <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> question government over coronavirus concerns]</b> While we acknowledge that the response to coronavirus is constantly evolving, the government’s reactionary behaviour and ad-hoc decision-making on travel and sporting events has placed the players in a challenging personal position. These players will now have to isolate while their livelihoods will be impacted; they will no longer be available to play and train with their team for the next fortnight. More clarity and proactive planning - and less see-sawing - from the government could have prevented a situation whereby we have players departing the country under one condition, and then re-entering on another in the space of 48 hours</p>
