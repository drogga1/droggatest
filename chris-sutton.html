  <p><b>[Chris Sutton sees ‘Huge gap’ between Arsenal and Chelsea]</b> That’s not true. Chelsea are the favourites and he’s trying to put the pressure on Arsenal. How many Arsenal players would get into the Chelsea team? Not many. think he <b>[Alexis]</b> would <b>[get into Chelsea’s team]</b> and there’s an argument for <b>[Hector]</b> Bellerin over <b>[Victor]</b> Moses. You could get <b>[Laurent]</b> Koscielny in the back although he’s not available for the final. There’s a huge gap between both sides and Chelsea are the far stronger team going into it.<br /><br />Regardless of whether Arsenal win or lose it’s been a thoroughly disappointing season for them. They should be challenging for titles and have qualified for the Champions League consistently under Wenger but they’re going backwards - that’s the truth. The team has regressed. He’s <b>[Wenger]</b> been a great servant and I’ve got no doubt that he loves the club but the team are going backwards. In my lifetime they’ve always been title challengers and I don’t see it with this team at the moment<br /><br />It has been helpful that they haven’t had Europe to cope with and they’ve made the most of it. Every time there has been a question mark over Chelsea this season Conte has responded. You have to say it’s been a near-perfect season and they could round it off with an FA Cup trophy at the weekend.<br /><br />I think it was a bit self-indulgent but we should really be concentrating on how much of a fantastic servant John Terry has been for Chelsea and he has been one of the outstanding defenders in Premier League history. <b>[The 26th minute substitution/guard of honour]</b> is not for me but you should focus on his career more. I think he’ll want to carry on playing. It will be interesting to see where he ends up</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Sutton has called upon Antonio Conte to use Michy Batshuayi more]</b> I’ve been impressed with Batshuayi when he’s come on but do I think Conte has total faith in him? I’m not so sure. I think they’ll be looking to buy a top class striker and they’re now in a position as Champions where it’s an attractive club to go to. I think Costa’s departure would be a big loss for Chelsea. I just wonder if Conte can talk him around. It’s going to be an interesting summer in terms of who Chelsea are going to acquire in their recruitment because they’ve got the Champions League next season.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea must enjoy Eden Hazard while they can]</b> Chelsea fans should enjoy Eden Hazard while they can. They are a different team when he is playing. With Alvaro Morata out of form and Michy Batshuayi misfiring, Hazard has been Antonio Conte’s go-to man this season. He brings an unrivalled energy and sharpness to this team. As we saw against Norwich in the FA Cup last week, remove Hazard and Chelsea are far less threatening. Hazard is the biggest weapon in Chelsea’s armoury and to lose him this summer would leave them with a fair bit of business to do. Without him, Chelsea are still a good team. Despite a lack of strength in depth, they are third in the Premier League and still fighting on three fronts in the cups. But Hazard takes them to another level. Who can they rely on to do this when he is gone?.<br /><br /><b>[The Belgium international has not been aided by comments from family members either]</b> My dad says some bad things. Yes. I talked with him <b>[to tell him off]</b>, no, no worries. I’m focused with Chelsea. I’ve got two years contract left and I’m happy here. Like I said 10 times before, I want to finish this year and then we’ll see. But I’m happy here</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Sutton believes that a few Rangers players will be shiting themselves ahead of Sunday’s Old Firm meeting with Celtic]</b> I’d ask the question, were they cheering because they were happy with the draw - or was it a total bluff? Come on. The closer we get to kick-off the more reality will kick in. They will be shiting themselves when they go to bed tonight.<br /><br />I would have loved to have heard that stuff when I was a player. It would only make me even more determined to ram it right back down their throats. I’d see this as a brilliant opportunity. Deep down I’d be thinking, this is a chance to prove you’re not really up to much - and we’re going to bash you. The motivation for Celtic should come from the fact they’ve not been very good this season and it’s about time they did something about it. But the ridiculous stuff from the Rangers dressing room only cranks it up a notch</p>

  <p><b>[England goalkeeper Joe Hart doesn’t deserve a spot at the World Cup]</b> You cannot take someone because they are a nice bloke and good in the dressing room. If England get two injuries to goalkeepers you need your third keeper to be strong. That is how it should be judged.<br /><br /><b>[Hart is competing with Jack Butland, Jordan Pickford and Nick Pope]</b> There are three better goalkeepers than <b>[Hart]</b>. Gareth Southgate isn’t wondering if he is a joker, is he good in the dressing room? He is wondering if he is going to make a save and keep us in the tournament. After that, how can Southgate go away and feel he can trust Joe Hart in an England jersey again?<br /><br />You feel for Joe Hart after what was a good display at Chelsea - he kept West Ham in the game. But tonight was bread and butter. Football is harsh. He was indecisive when that shot came in from Xherdan Shaqiri. He should have gathered it. It would have been routine for the Hart of yesteryear. But he spilled it and it was a woeful, woeful bit of goalkeeping</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Tierney continues to shrug off links to Manchester United]</b> One thing that stands out straight away with Kieran Tierney is his personality. He’s level-headed, hard-working and very likeable. And he’s a grafter, someone who works hard for the team. It doesn’t surprise me Manchester United are after him. He’s a Jose Mourinho-type player. He really caught the eye in Europe last season and, amazingly, only Sporting Lisbon goalkeeper Rui Patricio has played more minutes in any top division across the world this season. He’s extremely solid in defence, makes good decisions and can play anywhere across the backline. He can improve. His final ball could be better and his attacking contribution is not as outstanding as it was last season. That said, he is a top young talent with the mentality to make those improvements and United would be lucky to have him.</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Sutton believes that Olivier Giroud has earned his starting spot in the upcoming FA Cup semi-final ahead of Alvaro Morata]</b> It will be interesting to see which way Antonio Conte goes. After those two goals against Southampton, I think he will go with Giroud off the back of that. I think he has the edge and that will be in the back of the Southampton player’s minds. He has been uncertain about who the best striker to go with is really. At times it has been Morata or Giroud or neither of them and Chelsea aren’t the same force. I think Giroud might get the nod in this particular game.<br /><br />I don’t think Morata was as bad as me <b>[at Chelsea]</b>! Not really. I thought he started the season well and he is an accomplished player. You can’t play for the clubs that he played for without having something about you. As a striker in the Premier League it is brutal. You have to score goals and contribute. The eyes of the world are on you and everybody analyses your game to the nth degree and that has always been the issue at big clubs and at Chelsea. They have faith in him to invest that sort of money. They want a return on that and that’s not unreasonable. Now with Giroud, he has severe competition for his place and that can only be a good thing. He started the season exceptionally well and then he lost form and confidence. In terms of who is the main man? It is a fight for that place. I am a big fan of Olivier Giroud and I think that Arsenal got it badly wrong to sell him and he will push Morata all the way. I think that it is good.<br /><br />They are both really capable players. I don’t think there’s anyone who out-and-out justifies that position at the moment. It is healthy competition between two players who are fighting it out for that spot. I think that’s what Chelsea hope. I think for Morata this season is the most amount of games that he has started in his career and that’s why there has been this dip. Depending on what happens over the summer whether Conte leaves and a new manager comes in, they will still want Morata to show more consistency. Mentality is a big part. Morata lost confidence and I lost confidence when I was at Chelsea. You have to find a way to get your confidence back. I did it through training and repetition. You have those little bits of doubt but it comes because you care and you want to do well. There’s a player in there and we have seen it. We just haven’t seen it consistently enough<br /><br />I think what it would do for Chelsea, it would be a good end to a season which has been full of turbulence and having underachieved, in terms of what they did last season, but it is a prestigious trophy and a big trophy. It looks like Antonio Conte is not going to be there next season so it would be big for him, if he left the club on a high<br /><br />I don’t think that has any effect on the players. Whatever the situation is between the manager and the club, as players you go in and train with the instructions that the manager gives you. It is as simple as that. It is a pretty lame excuse, if the players were to use that as an excuse but I don’t think the Chelsea players have and that’s all you do as a player and concentrate on the job at hand. The manager situation won’t effect the players. I think Chelsea is a club that has huge aspirations of winning big titles. When Antonio Conte went in he did an unbelievable job, to go from tenth to win a Premier League title. Chelsea have had that approach where managers aren’t in the club for the long-term and I don’t think that is going to change</p>

His weight of pass is superb, his movement off the ball is lethal and he has become deadly in front of goal. What defender in the world would want to face Sterling in this form? It doesn’t matter if you take him on or back off - either way he will destroy you. He is still just 24 and improving year on year. His wonderful performances for England in the last two games have confirmed that he can thrive on the international stage. Sterling is one of the hottest properties in world football.

  <p><b>[Maurizio Sarri’s erratic approach at Chelsea will be testing the patience of the club’s board]</b> Maurizio Sarri got lucky in Cardiff. If it were not for the assistant referee, Chelsea would have been fortunate to escape with a point. Sarri may get lucky again and win the Europa League. Even if he does - securing Champions League football in the process - this abject performance only highlights why he cannot be the man to lead Chelsea next season. His decisions are becoming increasingly erratic. There are no easy games at this stage of a Premier League season, especially against a Cardiff side battling against relegation, so why leave out your best player? If Sarri wanted to rest Eden Hazard, would it not have been better to start him, win the game early on and then take him off with half an hour to go? The reaction of the Chelsea supporters who made the trip to South Wales shows they have lost faith in their manager. If they haven’t already, the board must be rapidly running out of patience, too</p>

As a young player at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, you will be looking at it and saying we are going to get an opportunity. It didn’t happen under previous managers so maybe this is a turning point or it seems to be a turning point. <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> is in his 30s. For <a href="michy-batshuayi.html">Batshuayi</a>, he did enough last time for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans to have faith in him, but I think Abraham is the favoured one. <a href="michy-batshuayi.html">Batshuayi</a> with something to offer, too. The likes of <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> is someone you would take over any of the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> strikers, of course. Abraham has been shown faith in terms of being thrown the No. 9 shirt, which has burdened a lot of players, myself included and other <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> No. 9s. Frank rates him highly and he is going to get this opportunity<br /><br /><b>[Sutton thinks that his former club are set for a battle for fourth place once again]</b> Do I think they can challenge <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>? Absolutely not. I think there is a rung of four clubs: <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> who I think will be fighting it out for the other two places in the top four again. They are not going to compete for the title if we are honest, but <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> won it from 10th, which is amazing stuff. <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> did carry <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> last season, whether we like it or not. Third place and Europa League, people will say <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> did well, but things weren’t right there. There were always murmurings behind the scenes. There were questions whether the players liked the manager. There was the <a href="kepa-arrizabalaga.html">Kepa Arrizabalaga</a> incident. It never seemed like the manager was going to be there long term. It seemed to be one of the worst-kept secrets ever when he left.<br /><br />Now, because of this situation and the transfer embargo, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have to go again. I think that there will be patience for Frank. He has taken <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> with him. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans will probably accept that they aren’t going to compete for a top-two place this season. That still doesn’t mean that they can’t perform strongly and fight for a place in the top four. I think it is a season for the first time in the Roman Abramovich era where I don’t look at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> as a team who can seriously challenge for a title</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Sutton says England now boast European football’s best front three]</b> England may have a house made of straw at the back, but at least they have their big bad wolves up front. <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>, <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> and <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> will strike fear into any opponents at Euro 2020.

At 26 years old, it is hard to see the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a> striker not writing his name in history as England’s greatest-ever goalscorer. With his ruthlessness and knack for making mincemeat of the minnows, he has to be a shoo-in to beat <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>’s total of 53. It would be unfair to brand Kane a flat-track bully, and I wouldn’t call him that because he offers so much more, but he loves facing inferior opponents. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. I’m glad we can sit here and talk about how much he loves scoring against them than not scoring! Kane on Sunday equalled the record for most goals in a calendar year for England, joining George Hilsdon in 1908 and Dixie Dean in 1927 on 12<br /><br />Look at who his goals in 2019 were against. Four against Bulgaria and four against Montenegro, two nations currently ranked joint-61st in the world. Two against Kosovo, ranked 114. Two against the Czech Republic, ranked 43. He has not been in the best form for his club but started this week on 28 goals for his country and finished it on 32 - just 21 shy of <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>. Given the volume of games and the opponents he will face in the years that follow, I cannot see Kane passing up the opportunity to make that record his own.<br /><br />The only thing that might stop the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> striker is himself, if he gets injured. Or possibly if someone like <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> can somehow succeed in forcing him out of the starting line-up. Yet <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a> clearly trusts Kane. It was interesting on Sunday how, given the changes made by the England boss, he kept him in there. Maybe Kane is asking his manager to play him. Maybe he is already eyeing up that record himself. I like that ambition if so. As a striker, Kane wants to score, score then score some more, and it’s difficult to see him stopping any time soon as long as the supply line is there</p>
