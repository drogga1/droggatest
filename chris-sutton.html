  <p><b>[Chris Sutton says Brendan Rodgers would have some ‘cheek’ plotting a raid on his former employers at Celtic for Callum McGregor]</b> There’s been talk about Brendan Rodgers taking McGregor to Leicester City but I would be stunned if that happened. Not only would it be some cheek from Rodgers after the way he left the club but it would also be a major decision for Celtic to sell such an important player. They should be strengthening the squad rather than weakening it further.<br /><br /><b>[On the areas that he feels Celtic need to be addressing]</b> There’s still work to be done and the right-back situation needs to be addressed pretty quickly after Mikael Lustig all but confirmed he’d be leaving. It’s fair to say the Swede splits opinion. I think he’s been a good servant for Celtic but the time is about right for a change. I know Neil Lennon likes him and would probably prefer to have him around, even as back-up, but you can understand why the club would offer him reduced terms if he would be having a reduced role. It’s an area Celtic need to address though with the Champions League qualifiers just around the corner and the new right-back certainly has to be better than Jeremy Toljan showed during his loan spell. The Borussia Dortmund man didn’t fancy some of Scottish football’s less than finer points and that’s something Lustig’s replacement will need to handle - as well as getting smashed in training</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Sutton says Kieran Tierney should be insulted by Arsenal’s bids for him]</b> Kieran Tierney should be insulted by Arsenal’s bids for him. Celtic and Scottish football should also be seeing disrespect in what the Gunners are offering. Yet again I’m having the same argument I’ve been having year-on-year since Virgil van Dijk was inexplicably allowed to leave Celtic for a fee of £13 million in the summer of 2015. Nothing has changed. English clubs believed then they could get away with transfer market murder and they still do.<br /><br />Fair enough all clubs start low in a bidding process but £15m for Tierney smacks of disgusting contempt. Not just for Celtic and Scottish football but for the boy. If I were Tierney I would be wondering if they really rated me at all given the figures which are flying around south of the border. Manchester United are paying £55m to land Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Crystal Palace. Leicester are looking to get about £70m for Ben Chilwell if he goes. Both of those boys have had roughly one good season each in the English Premier League and that’s the fees? Are you trying to tell me that Chilwell is a four times better player than Tierney? Or that Wan-Bissaka is three times as good?<br /><br /><b>[Sutton added on Arsenal’s efforts to lure a highly-rated prospect away from Parkhead on the cheap]</b> Whatever way you look at it and however you see the level of the Scottish league, it’s nigh-on impossible to get to a final figure of £15m. It’s mocking Scottish football. It’s scornful to Celtic and disrespectful to the player. There is a halfway house here. Arsenal think they can get Tierney for around £20m. Wan Bissaka has gone for £50m. That means the meet in the middle figure should be at the £35m mark. And, if Celtic accept anything significantly less than that for Tierney during this transfer window, then they have been insulted again just as they were over the sale of Van Dijk.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea striker Chris Sutton is full of hope that Tammy Abraham will be given the chance to shine as the club’s new No. 9.]</b> If you talk about Abraham and the No. 9 jersey and myself and the No. 9, I had the additional issue of going for big money. The same happened for Fernando Torres, Shevchenko, Morata and others. When you have a big fee, you are expected to have a goal return. Abraham doesn’t have that. That’s evident. He has been nurtured and developed. There will still be an expectation on him to perform, but the fact that Chelsea hasn’t laid on big money for him might help.<br /><br />It only takes you so far. Chelsea have aspirations but maybe just not as big as in previous seasons due to circumstances. When you are competing with Giroud and Batshuayi, that is a healthy competition. If I am honest, I think that most people want to see Abraham develop. As a young player at Chelsea, you will be looking at it and saying we are going to get an opportunity. It didn’t happen under previous managers so maybe this is a turning point or it seems to be a turning point. Giroud is in his 30s. For Batshuayi, he did enough last time for Chelsea fans to have faith in him, but I think Abraham is the favoured one. Batshuayi with something to offer, too. The likes of Aguero at Manchester City is someone you would take over any of the Chelsea strikers, of course. Abraham has been shown faith in terms of being thrown the No. 9 shirt, which has burdened a lot of players, myself included and other Chelsea No. 9s. Frank rates him highly and he is going to get this opportunity<br /><br /><b>[Sutton thinks that his former club are set for a battle for fourth place once again]</b> Do I think they can challenge Manchester City and Liverpool? Absolutely not. I think there is a rung of four clubs: Chelsea, Arsenal, Spurs and Manchester United who I think will be fighting it out for the other two places in the top four again. They are not going to compete for the title if we are honest, but Conte won it from 10th, which is amazing stuff. Hazard did carry Chelsea last season, whether we like it or not. Third place and Europa League, people will say Sarri did well, but things weren’t right there. There were always murmurings behind the scenes. There were questions whether the players liked the manager. There was the Kepa Arrizabalaga incident. It never seemed like the manager was going to be there long term. It seemed to be one of the worst-kept secrets ever when he left.<br /><br />Now, because of this situation and the transfer embargo, Chelsea have to go again. I think that there will be patience for Frank. He has taken Jody Morris with him. Chelsea fans will probably accept that they aren’t going to compete for a top-two place this season. That still doesn’t mean that they can’t perform strongly and fight for a place in the top four. I think it is a season for the first time in the Roman Abramovich era where I don’t look at Chelsea as a team who can seriously challenge for a title</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Sutton says <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is no flat-track bully and will eventually break <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a>’s all-time record to become England’s greatest-ever goalscorer]</b> Watch out <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a>, because <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is coming for your record. At 26 years old, it is hard to see the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a> striker not writing his name in history as England’s greatest-ever goalscorer. With his ruthlessness and knack for making mincemeat of the minnows, he has to be a shoo-in to beat <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>’s total of 53. It would be unfair to brand Kane a flat-track bully, and I wouldn’t call him that because he offers so much more, but he loves facing inferior opponents. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. I’m glad we can sit here and talk about how much he loves scoring against them than not scoring! Kane on Sunday equalled the record for most goals in a calendar year for England, joining George Hilsdon in 1908 and Dixie Dean in 1927 on 12<br /><br />Look at who his goals in 2019 were against. Four against Bulgaria and four against Montenegro, two nations currently ranked joint-61st in the world. Two against Kosovo, ranked 114. Two against the Czech Republic, ranked 43. He has not been in the best form for his club but started this week on 28 goals for his country and finished it on 32 - just 21 shy of <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>. Given the volume of games and the opponents he will face in the years that follow, I cannot see Kane passing up the opportunity to make that record his own. <br /><br />The only thing that might stop the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> striker is himself, if he gets injured. Or possibly if someone like <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> can somehow succeed in forcing him out of the starting line-up. Yet <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a> clearly trusts Kane. It was interesting on Sunday how, given the changes made by the England boss, he kept him in there. Maybe Kane is asking his manager to play him. Maybe he is already eyeing up that record himself. I like that ambition if so. As a striker, Kane wants to score, score then score some more, and it’s difficult to see him stopping any time soon as long as the supply line is there</p>

The pressure is off on the basis since the early 2000s in the Abramovich era, everyone always expected <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to be in the hunt for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title. He’s achieved great things with the younger players, the likes of Abraham coming through, <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> playing well, <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a> has been excellent.

He links the game, he makes runs, he creates and he is a quality finisher. <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> really assumed the mantle of responsibility as <b>[Neil]</b> <a href="neil-lennon.html">Lennon</a> chased the nine last season and delivered in emphatic style for his boss and team.<br /><br />Dutch defender oozed class from the minute he settled into life at Celtic. The centre-back often strolled through matches. Able to step out from the back and play in the midfield as well as score brilliant free-kicks, Van Dijk was destined for the top and that’s where he’s ended up as a Champions League winner<br /><br />Outstanding in the left-back role from the moment he was given his opportunity during the Ronny Deila reign. <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Tierney</a> was outstanding going forward, had boundless energy and was tigerish in his tackling and defending. His strong bond with the club also made him a huge favourite among the supporters and a must-pick for the position</p>

  <p><b>[Lampard under pressure after Werner &amp; <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Ziyech</a> deals]</b> I think he has done a good job and answered some of the people who questioned whether he deserved to get the job. Arguably, Frank went into the first big job of his managerial career at the perfect moment<br /><br />They had a transfer embargo to deal with, expectations were massively diluted and <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> had time to get used to the job and the fact that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are sitting in the top four of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is a testament to the job he has done. Now, after the money that has been spent and the quality of the players that have been signed, there will be a very different pressure for Frank to deal with next season. That is the nature of the business we are in. There will be pressure when you are at a big club and the big question for Frank will be can they close the gap between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, who are quite a distance ahead of them at the moment. Those two teams are the benchmark at the moment<br /><br />There are a lot of big teams still left in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, so it will be tough for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to win it. They also have a tough game against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> on Sunday as even though they have had a slow start since the return to action, they have players who are capable of hurting <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It will be a tight game and it could go either way</p>
