  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen assistant coach Marcel Daum says <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> has the elegance of Zidane]</b> Everyone is asking about <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a>. If you see him play, it tells you everything. For me, he has the elegance of <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. If you see his movement, he’s very elegant, he’s always calm, he has great passing ability. What a lot of people don’t see, because we watch him every day, is that he’s pretty fast. That’s a big bonus. He’s a great player; he’s scoring goals, he’s great in the air and he’s pretty fast. It’s up to him how far he can go. I can’t say he will be the best German player ever, but he has the talent and there are no limits. He’s displaying signs of Zidane<br /><br />The situation with coronavirus is so strange and so complicated that it’s still open that he will leave us. I don’t know what will happen, but at Bayer, he has the right place to develop his strengths and improve. The only thing I know is that Bayer won’t sell him for a cheap fee.<br /><br />It’s strange to be honest. It’s kind of bizarre sitting on the bench and coaching. You get used to it. It’s bizarre without fans. You are in an empty stadium, you can hear everything the other coaches say, you can hear every word of every player. Sometimes the atmosphere is like a friendly game, but still you know it’s a competition. It’s strange</p>
