  <p><b>[Andries Jonker says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> should show guts and hire Ljungberg]</b> I would support the guts in making the choice <b>[to hire]</b> <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a>. Arsene had been there many, many years and he did it his way. Then came another coach <b>[with a different way]</b> who had a very difficult time. I would prefer for them to give the chance to someone who knows <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, knows the academy, knows all those talented players. He also knows the laws of total football. Give him time, give him confidence, help him and support him. He is one of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I would appreciate the guts of the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> bosses if they hired Ljungberg<br /><br />Freddie is a lover of really good football, the way <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> want to play normally fits him. He wants his teams to try to play offensive football and be exciting - winning with that. This is the style he likes. He will always try to find the combination of having good organisation in his team. Freddie has a good eye for the tactical details for the team and he knows that you cannot only play beautiful players. If you want to win you need to find the mix of people who can defend and do the dirty work and then the players who can make the difference and decide matches to your advantage<br /><br />Freddie is a team player, he will involve his team in his decisions but he has also been a top player for years, so it is quite obvious that he knows how it works. He knows he is the one to decide at the end and he is the one who will be responsible</p>
