  <p><a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> is sitting in the corner of a nondescript Chinese restaurant, nursing a small plate of salmon and steamed broccoli. It was the only option on the menu he’s currently allowed to eat. It’s a Monday afternoon, Dec. 11, 2017. In 18 days, Nurmagomedov needs to weigh no more than 156 pounds for a nontitle lightweight bout against Edson Barboza at UFC 219 in Las Vegas<br /><br /><a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> closed 2016 with a remarkable performance in New York, literally demanding a title shot from UFC president <a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a> as he beat up a respected opponent in Michael Johnson. The UFC gave Nurmagomedov what he wanted after that: an interim lightweight title fight against <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> at UFC 209 on March 4. But he was hospitalized during his weight cut<br /><br />According to Nurmagomedov’s manager <a href="ali-abdelaziz.html">Ali Abdelaziz</a>, the team cut weight the day before the UFC 209 weigh-in and had returned to the MGM Grand Hotel to rest. The plan was to cut an additional 5 pounds the following morning, but complications arose. ‘We were going to wake up the morning of the weigh-in and make 155 pounds. When we went to the room, <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> couldn’t sleep. He was in a lot of pain. It was an ugly, ugly night. I don’t even want to talk about it’<br /><br /><b>[But]</b> if <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> accomplishes that winning against <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a>, would he unintentionally become the biggest fight for <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a>? With his dominant grappling-based style and nearly 3 million followers on social media – many of whom are based in Europe and Asia – Nurmagomedov has always been an attractive opponent. <a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a> has talked about the two fighting in Russia. <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>’s head coach, John Kavanagh, once referred to <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> and Nurmagomedov as a ‘perfect collision’</p>
