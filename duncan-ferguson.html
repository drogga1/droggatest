  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> caretaker manager Duncan Ferguson reiterated that he is not planning to put himself in contention for the permanent position despite a 3-1 win over <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> on Saturday]</b> No, honestly, I won’t be saying that. That’s not what I’m saying. I’m here for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, I’m here for as long as they want me here, and I’m sure they <b>[the club’s hierarchy]</b> are out there looking for their candidates, and rightly so. We want the best guys in the world managing this football club, but this was an incredible experience for me, an unbelievable experience I’ll never forget<br /><br />I’m just looking to get home and lie down, I think. We’re not looking ahead - I was just looking at this game and that is it, we’re savouring the moment. It’s three fantastic points. I think you saw on the touchline how enthusiastic I was, but you know it’s one game, one result. I think I’ve answered the question <b>[about going for the position]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Asked if beating <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> 3-1 when taking temporary charge for the first time last week has given him a taste for management, Ferguson replies]</b> Yeah, definitely, I think in the future, I think I’ll look to progress to be a manager. Of course, now I know I can do it for one game, but of course it’s only one game. It was emotional, it was exciting, it was fantastic and, yeah, in the future, possibly I can move into management.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> boss Ferguson explains reason for substituting Kean just 19 minutes after he came on]</b> It was not because of his performance. I just needed to make a substitution to kill a bit of time. I have a lot of strikers on the bench, it was nothing against him personally<br /><br /><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> may have missed out on the chance to make it two wins out of two against United, but Ferguson was nevertheless elated with what he saw at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> I am delighted at the moment. We have got a point. Of course we were winning but I cannot complain. They came on strong in the second half but I thought we looked good on the counter attack. The boys were absolutely amazing. We beat a top team in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and now we’ve come to <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> and got a draw</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> boss Rodgers, meanwhile, has now progressed in 29 successive cup matches across spells with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> and <a href="leicester-fc.html">the Foxes</a>, but he praised his counterpart for his impact since <a href="marco-silva.html">Marco Silva</a>’s dismissal]</b> I think what you’ve seen in these last few games is that <b>[Ferguson]</b> has given the crowd and the team real spirit. He was great on the touchline. When I saw him from the outside, he’s a true <a href="everton-fc.html">Evertonian</a>, but he’s also a very good coach</p>

  <p><b>[In the final seconds of the game the pair spoke while the ball was still in play, <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Ljungberg</a>’s hand cupping his mouth and Ferguson with his arm around his counterpart]</b> I was telling I hoped the whistle would go because we were all happy with a draw. It wasn’t a great game so let’s get it finished<br /><br /><b>[Ferguson’s final act as caretaker manager was to hook another of substitutes, as he did last week with <a href="moise-kean.html">Moise Kean</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>. This time Kean came on for <a href="cenk-tosun.html">Cenk Tosun</a>, who had been introduced earlier following a hamstring injury to <a href="alex-iwobi.html">Alex Iwobi</a> that is expected to rule him out of the Christmas fixtures. The Turkey striker did not look impressed as he headed down the tunnel]</b> I can understand why they are upset but at the end of the day I make the decision. I do it for the benefit of the team as I see it, it might be the wrong call or it might be the right call. As far as I’m concerned we’ve got another point and a clean sheet<br /><br /><b>[Duncan Ferguson post match after <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> share points in dull]</b> Ideally we wanted three points but what a fantastic performance. Never quite had the legs but it was a game of few chances, they didn’t have dug in. They’ve been incredible for me. Both sides struggled for a bit of quality but we’re asking the same players to play week in week out.<br /><br />I’m glad I’ve ended not with a defeat. We’re undefeated since we’ve been in so we’re delighted</p>
