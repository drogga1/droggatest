  <p><b>[Captain Wes Morgan insists Leicester City star Harry Maguire has not been affected by links to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> He has been the same Harry that we know and love. You can see in the games he’s putting 100 per cent effort into everything he does and his quality is there for everyone to see. I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future but for now he’s still a Leicester player and we enjoy having him here. He’s said nothing. There’s going to be speculation because he’s a top-class player who has done well at international level. Big teams are going to take an interest and that goes for many of our top players. People want our best players and he is one of them. In training, it’s the same old banter, the same old training. He’s part of Leicester so we just treat him the same</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City will not use government furlough scheme during coronavirus crisis]</b> As soon as conversations started, it was clear we all wanted the same thing - to make sure all the staff at the club were looked after, to do our bit for the people of the city and to make sure the club’s in the best position possible when football is ready to return</p>
