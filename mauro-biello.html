  <p><b>[Montreal Impact ready for life after Didier Drogba]</b> We’re still going through it. There’s a possibility that in a half or at the end of a <b>[preseason]</b> game we may have a look at it, but it takes time. The 4-3-3 is just now starting to find rhythm and understanding after a year of putting things in place. We do have the profiles for this type of system, but our principles won’t change. But understanding the timing, the shifting, <b>[and]</b> the movement is going to take time. We want to move that along, but at the same time we want to fine tune the 4-3-3.</p>

  <p><b>[Mauro Biello frustrated after Impact blow two-goal lead against Sounders]</b> It’s as if my team was just waiting for the final whistle - that’s what pissed me off. But in the end, you’ve got to play with urgency all the time … you can’t be casual ever in this game</p>

  <p><b>[On Ballou Jean-Yves Tabla]</b> He scored a fantastic goal, but the fact that he defended and was able to be in the right spots without the ball was fantastic. He did all the little things well without the ball, and that’s going to help him because if he does that he’s going to create his own space.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea target Tabla leans on Drogba to become brightest young MLS star]</b> We knew we had a special talent for sure, that’s why we signed him last year. As coaches, we get to see him every day on the training field. And when you see him every day on the training field, you think if he’s able to reproduce that in the game, that’s a player with quality.</p>
