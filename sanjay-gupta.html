  <p>[Star India’s Sanjay Gupta - ‘ISL has brought about a revolutionary and seismic change in Indian football’] Football! A sport which has been around on TV in this country for the last two decades but seen as an ‘elitist Sport’- the kind of interest, excitement around it has never been seen before. The Indian Super League, for the first time, has managed to bring the game to our doorstep.<br /><br />It has been the largest breakout in the Indian footballing ecosystem - from an all-time high television viewership to huge stadia attendance and enabling a superior experience for fans<br /><br />419 million people in this country switched on their television sets to watch the first season of ISL. It is now the third most attended football league in the world! ISL has managed to bring football to the radar of our national consciousness, where it is beeping brightly. This is not merely unprecedented. This is a revolutionary and seismic change<br /><br />The fact is we are doing better than before but nowhere close to where we should be. In the ranking of sports playing nations we are at #67 in the Olympics medal tally. Except Cricket and Kabaddi India has not been in the top three of any major sport. Our kids are playing for an abysmally small period of time, if at all. And when they do, it is with pitiable infrastructural support. Even in football, let us not look away from the glaring statistics that our global ranking is #130<br /><br />Parents continue to believe, even today, that sport is at best a recreational indulgence largely unproductive and unrewarding. Schools do not give it its due in their poorly designed curriculums and inadequate facilities<br /><br />A school kid in India plays for less than 40 mins a week. In countries like US and Australia, this number would be closer to 12 to 14 hours. Our entire system, of education and societal norm outside, has been designed to reward excellence in academics, but be indifferent to and at times, even punish an interest in sport</p>
