But it is something between the club and Ney. I am the coach, it’s my player. If he is in the locker room, this is my player and I work with him. I’m ready for everything. We have to be flexible.

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel has deflected talk on Neymar’s future and instead enthused about his reshaped midfield]</b> There is nothing new <b>[to report]</b> about Neymar. For me, he is our player, we train with him. It’s a question for the club and Neymar. For me, he’s in the dressing room, he’s training, he’s still my player. There is nothing new<br /><br /><b>[After seeing the deal for former Everton man Idrissa Gana Gueye over the line]</b> I’m very happy with his arrival. It’s no secret that we tried to sign him in the winter. He’s a player with a lot of quality and determination and they’re features that we need<br /><br /><b>[Tuchel also moved to answer concerns that Gueye and former Manchester United midfielder Herrera are similar and could not feature together]</b> They are not the same type of player. They don’t play in the same position. Herrera is a No.8, a box-to-box player. Gueye is a holding midfielder, who gives us the opportunity to play with only one player in front of the defence. His best position, for me, is No.6 but he can also play with another player alongside him <b>[in central midfield]</b>. His ability to recover the ball means he’s a different type of player to Herrera<br /><br /><b>[Tuchel is hopeful Gueye will be available for PSG’s French Ligue 1 opener against Nimes on August 11]</b> I hope he’ll have enough time to recover. He should be back with us around the time of the first Ligue 1 game. The PSG boss also hinted that his recruitment for the new season may not be finished.<br /><br /><b>[The PSG boss also hinted that his recruitment for the new season may not be finished]</b> I’ve never finished a transfer window at the end of July. Things can be crazy in football<br /><br /><b>[Tuchel also answered questions over why Neymar has not featured in recent pre-season games]</b> It would have been a big risk. When we travelled to Macau he’d not trained. From a medical point of view we decided it was a big risk to play him so he stayed at home in Shenzhen to improve his fitness. It would have been the same here in Suzhou <b>[against Sydney]</b>. He and Presnel Kimpembe will train on Wednesday for the first hour with the team</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Tuchel applauded the early impact of new signing Pablo Sarabia following Paris Saint-Germain’s Trophee des Champions win over Rennes, though he is staying patient with Ander Herrera]</b> We can see that their mentality is good. Herrera has yet to adapt to us. We play differently to Manchester United, so he has to adapt to our style of play. Pablo is really impressive. He runs well, with and without a ball. His game without the ball is a great example. He plays with a lot of intensity and does not stop <b>[working]</b> defensively<br /><br /><b>[But, following the signing of Idrissa Gueye from Everton, Tuchel expects to see Marquinhos return to his centre-back role with more regularity]</b> I hope so. That would mean that Idrissa is playing at the level we expect. He <b>[Gueye]</b> plays exactly at this No.6 position. But Marquinhos, it is important that he is on the pitch. He’s only done three workouts and is already playing like that? It’s extraordinary. I like him a lot in the midfield, because he thinks of the right way and his passing quality is top</p>

Great players are like that<br /><br /><b>[Abdou Diallo, Pablo Sarabia, plus Premier League pair Ander Herrera and Idrissa Gueye have been brought in as the German looks to build a squad capable]</b> I am satisfied with my team. We bought players like Herrera and Sarabia, who have good mentalities. Diallo also has responsibilities and is brave. And he can play with Gueye or Marquinhos. Gueye is the midfielder we have been missing, yes. He has a good state of mind. It’s important to have guys like that</p>

I saw <b>[the public’s reaction on Neymar]</b> on my colleagues’ phones because I hadn’t heard that during the game. Can I understand that? Yes and no, that’s the way it is in our lives. The emotions are serious, the emotions are still there, okay. But on the other hand, Neymar is still our player, still my player, and I will always protect my players. He’s in the locker room, he’s here and I’ll protect him. I can understand that not everyone likes what he said and what he did. I understand, but we have to express a level to express our emotion<br /><br /><b>[Asked if PSG missed Neymar against Nimes]</b> He is still missing, because he can find solutions that only he can find. He can open spaces with movements, accelerations, one against the other. It was a little lacking today to be more decisive in the first half. But we have to find other solutions, we have to give rhythm with passes, with intensive runs. But it’s clear, he’s Neymar, and he has extraordinary qualities. If he is not on the field, he is missing, but it is our challenge to find solutions. We still have to improve<br /><br /><b>[After Cavani broke the deadlock via the penalty spot in the first half, Mbappe and Di Maria put the result beyond doubt following the interval]</b> The best thing is that they <b>[Neymar and Mbappe]</b> play together. It is not a question of whether Mbappe can give more when Neymar is not there. Kylian gives a lot, he’s been very focused for four weeks now. He puts a lot of intensity into training, into matches. It’s great for the team to improve. But the best thing is that Neymar is next to him<br /><br />As I said last year, Mbappe is invited by the club to take more responsibilities every day. Taking responsibilities does not mean taking every penalty, hitting every corner or every free-kick. It’s not like that, there are many ways to take responsibilities, and he does that. He started this season with a lot of concentration, I’m very happy. He’s here, I have a feeling he’s happy. He has objectives for himself and the team, and he does everything to achieve them. He gives his opinion, and we’re going to keep developing that. He has a good relationship with everyone, he is reliable</p>

There were small situations where space opened but we were not decisive<br /><br />I always say the same thing, the transfer window is open even more than 10 days and you think it will be settled tomorrow or the day after tomorrow? What I think is not important. Today my player cannot play because he has not done any training like the others.

Goals either side of half-time from M’Baye Niang and Romain Del Castillo handed Rennes all three points]</b> It was a difficult match, but we expected it. We do not have everyone available. Some players only participated in two weeks of training. These situations are normal in August. We are not at our best. Against a physical team like Rennes, who gives everything, whose players run like crazy, in a match in prime time, it’s normal that it was complicated for us. We scored the first goal, we controlled the match and made mistakes. We had to close the match after the first goal. We were not able to do it. We conceded a goal with a two against one in the area. We got very close to the Rennes area, but we lacked tenacity to win against some offensive. In these conditions, it was difficult to create opportunities. We can lose a match like that, but we could win it too<br /><br /><b>[Despite a run of five away defeats in six league matches stretching into last season, Tuchel insisted he does not fear the sack and called for some patience]</b> I’m a very happy man. There is no one who is putting more pressure on myself than me. It’s the same for every coach. We can play better than today. Things are not easy - everyone has improved in Ligue 1 and the Champions League. It’s time to be patient and to keep your confidence. We cannot question everything after a bad result</p>

On the other hand, I have to think about the team, to balance it. I cannot promise him he will play 15 or 20 minutes. It depends on tactical circumstances and injuries. It’s hard for me to know. I know he’s disappointed, but he does not show it in training. I hope he will stay with the same state of mind and I will try to give him some minutes. He needs it to regain rhythm</p>

He always thinks about others and their happiness. He’s a team player. Coaching Marco is the best that can happen to a coach.<br /><br />To give you an example, ahead of our game against Nice, he played with Italy. It was a Friday evening, both games were very close <b>[Italy played the 15th and <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> on the 18th]</b>. He came back on Thursday. On Friday I talked to him and he said to me: ‘No, no, no! I’ll play against Nice, I’ll play!’. We’ve decided then that he will not play.<br /><br />Back in the training on Saturday he was there giving everything during both small and bigger exercises. We’ve got a small session with eight players, we walked, we played a few games… and he trained like a youngster about maybe 18 or 19 years old trying to prove to the coach that he can play. This is what Marco is about. It shows a lot in my opinion. I’m delighted to be his coach. I’m really pleased he’s with us because he’s an extraordinary player with a very rare mindset.

This is not the first time that the side last in the standing has beaten the side in first - and it won’t be the last time. I think we lost the game in the first half because we had three shots, compared to 17 in the second period - a big difference. I was expecting more in terms of speed, mentality and duels. We played better in the second half but we conceded two goals in the match and allowed too many shots - it’s not normal<br /><br />In the first half we were too passive. Scoring a goal without having opportunities was perhaps the worst thing for us. We were never in control of the game and did not play with the precision, speed or mentality that is necessary<br /><br />If we play like this, anything can happen - that’s football. People told us we were in another league, but that’s only if we play at 100 per cent. If we don’t play together, or with the intensity that is needed, anything can happen. As I said, maybe the worst thing today was that we scored a goal because it was not deserved. We did not play together and we lacked structure.

  <p><b>[Thomas Tuchel expects <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Edinson Cavani</a> and Leandro Paredes to remain <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> players beyond the January transfer window]</b> Paredes played a lot during the end of last year. He showed he is capable of being an important player and can influence our game. As for Edinson, I’ve said it before - it was difficult when he picked up an injury as he lost his rhythm and others played well. But he is here, in a good frame of mind and everyone has to prepare in the best way to be ready when needed. I trust them and think they will stay with us. It is not necessary to imagine anything else<br /><br /><b>[Tuchel is not pushing for new signings]</b> Anything can happen, but I haven’t asked for anything. I love my team and my players. I like working with them and we have a good connection. There is no need for players to leave or arrive. If players are coming, okay. But as <a href="leonardo.html">Leonardo</a> said, he takes care of that and I take care of training. I’m calm with that<br /><br /><b>[And with a run of seven matches in the next month, including back-to-back <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> games with Monaco, Tuchel says it is inevitable his squad will be hit by injuries]</b> We will do everything we can to protect the players, but honestly I think injuries will happen because it’s always like this<br /><br /><b>[Tuchel is demanding respect against the unknown quantity]</b> We are the favourites to win, that’s clear. But we will play with respect and seriousness. We want to win and I’m waiting for us to win. To show our respect to the opponents, we will have to play seriously and regain our hunger to win. It’s a cup game, a decisive game and we’re here to win. I haven’t seen their ground. I don’t think it will be like the <a href="psg.html">Parc des Princes</a>. I hope it won’t be dangerous, but it’s okay - you have to adapt</p>

We don’t like to change during the winter. It’s not monopoly, it’s a locker room, men who get on well together and who have formed a spirit. Each player entering or leaving creates uncertainty.

  <p><b>[‘Super reliable’ <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Mauro Icardi</a> impact at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> impresses coach Tuchel]</b> I’m very impressed with <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Mauro Icardi</a>. I met him here for the first time. The guy is super reliable and very, very professional. He understands football tactically, works defensively and is very, very efficient. His work and his reliability for the team is very impressive, but I don’t want to talk about the purchase option<br /><br />We are more reliable and beefier than in 2019. Our team has matured with the recruitment of the pre-season. There is a good frame of mind. We have a great team with healthy competition and I want to maintain this good level. We attack together and we defend together. This is perhaps one of the most beautiful things in football. A team cannot win with five players. The best level requires playing as a team.<br /><br />If you want to play 4-4-2, there are a lot of things to do and spaces to protect. Everyone has to do what is necessary and the players are doing it at the moment. With 4-4-2, the sides have to be more careful about defensive replacement than when playing in 4-3-3. <br /><br />I want players who are free to attack, but who also protect the spaces. I’m asking of my offensive players that they try to chase the ball in order to achieve a high pressure and recover the ball quickly. We have players capable of doing this counter-pressing. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is smart enough to do it, <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Mauro Icardi</a> or Angel Di Maria and Pablo Sarabia, too. We always find the best possible mix for us to keep this balance</p>

Kylian moves more, he moves fast on the wings. It’s a good combination, it’s good for both of them, they like to play together and they are dangerous together. It’s good because we always have two players in the last third and it’s hard to defend against. It’s a good mix<br /><br /><b>[Tuchel must shuffle his pack with four consecutive away games on the agenda before the end of this month]</b> It’s bad for the players, they’re dead! They never sleep. We always have to manage when we train and when we let them sleep because sleeping well is the best thing to recover. It’s been proven. But we never sleep. We lose the rhythm. If we do it once, okay, but if we do it four times during two weeks, we go to bed at 3am, 4am, 5am. It’s tough</p>

We need to wait a few days until he is fit again. Then he will have to fight to find a spot on the team and during the season it is not easy. He has been injured too many times but it is not his fault, nor was it our fault.

We will discuss and decide on Friday, the latest possible time to do so. We can’t risk his fitness<br /><br />We aren’t going to take risks against Amiens, it’s clear. We will have a strong team, but if we have little doubts, we won’t take risks<br /><br /><b>[PSG sailed into the Coupe de France semi-finals thanks to the midweek demolition at Dijon]</b> Dijon started very aggressively, took a lot of risks and put in a lot of effort. We were also very focused, and battled for second balls. We were very careful but were able to step up our tempo. We were patient and played quickly, simply and created space in the second half. We controlled the game and scored two more goals quickly</p>

  <p><b>[PSG boss Tuchel confirms <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> set to feature against Dortmund]</b> For <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, we have to decide with the doctor after the test. Whether he plays tomorrow or not <b>[…]</b> he will be in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> for sure, but maybe not at his best like he was two weeks ago. But I am convinced he will help us and with this game we will keep going, and we hope he will be uninjured and be able to play a few games in a row until the end of the season<br /><br /><b>[Tuchel explained he wanted <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> to play in every game]</b> Yes, but I cannot push him. I have the advice of the medical staff but we decide together. I want him to play all the time. There are a lot of things to think about. There is the opinion of the medical staff, the player, the feeling that the player is not worried about playing. We need to talk to one another and think about it, but in the end we have to make very clear decisions. No risks against <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> and no risks against Dijon. In the end he agrees and I think it is a good thing because we will make the common decision together<br /><br /><b>[Tuchel stressed he had no complaints over <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s trip to Germany on Thursday to promote a clothing range]</b> I knew about it for a few weeks. It was organised with the club. It was clear for almost six weeks. It’s not a problem</p>

  <p><b>[Tuchel throws doubt on <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> availability]</b> I can’t say today. We’ll have to wait until tomorrow’s training session. We have to check everyone tomorrow. We weren’t focused enough at the start of the match, that’s all. It shows that we’ve played 21 or 22 games while being very strong and focused, but today was not like that. There are reasons. We chose to have absentees, we left a lot of players at home. It’s normal, it’s a situation before a decisive match in the Champions League. Because of that, we didn’t find our real mentality in this match</p>

He trained today <b>[Monday]</b> and will be playing tomorrow if nothing happens during training. Obviously, it changes everything if he plays and I hope it will be a positive thing. If we have Ney on the field, he has the ability to do decisive things. That changes everything: for his team-mates, for Kylian. It gives me confidence, but also the team. That seems obvious to me<br /><br />The bigger the match, the greater the pressure, the less you have to add. Before a match like this we have to prepare, but prepare for it several months before kick-off. I have the feeling that we have been ready for several weeks. Now is the time to prove it. It’s difficult in this stage, I don’t know if it’s possible for 90 minutes but we have to play with a lot of intelligence. Things get emotional, we will have to adapt. It’s a very high-level match in a stadium with huge supporters. We have to stay calm and attentive</p>

  <p><b>[Thomas Tuchel felt <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s lack of competitive matches]</b> We have made twice as many matches as <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> in recent weeks. We have had injury concerns with key players, they lack the rhythm, the hardness of the competition, as we saw with <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. Our possession of the ball was not stable enough for this not to be a physical match. There was this physical side to this match, in addition, we made too many mistakes in unnecessary positions. We were lacking in timing. We lost a little confidence, and form. I thought it would be a more open game<br /><br /><b>[Tuchel, who felt his side played with fear, also backed <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> to learn from a difficult outing]</b> I knew it would be a tough game for him. He had to be very, very patient. We know that the technical relationship between him and Ney is good. Ney lacked rhythm, competition. Kylian made an assist. It’s a tough game for him, a game to grow. I trust him. We’re going to have a good game at the Parc <b>[des Princes]</b>.</p>

You can be sure that we talked internally. I don’t want to talk about it now, but we talked about it within the club and it has to stay that way<br /><br />You can be sure that we are not happy with this image. We talked together as a team and it is now an internal matter. I am here to improve my group. I cannot give advice to the club, that is not my role<br /><br />The leaked footage was a mistake. However, it had been planned for a long time. We needed to get together. We must be careful, though, as there are people who travel miles to follow us. There has been frustration at the result and poor performance <b>[against Dortmund]</b>. We know our strengths, especially at home. We must work hard and with a good mentality<br /><br /><b>[Neymar insists he was ready to return to action earlier]</b> As I said before, it was a discussion between the club, medical staff and myself. With each injury we have to make many decisions, that’s the way it is. Imagine if we let him play, the injury got worse and he was out for three months. You would have asked the same questions, whether it was a mistake to play him. We have to think about why we are making these decisions and you have to trust me. We have talked a lot and it is the same with every player. Obviously I want him to play every game and we have to make decisions together. This is the decision we made between us. Now he needs to regain his rhythm.<br /><br />It is never easy to start again after a defeat, but that is the challenge. I have the impression that all the players want to prove themselves. Sometimes the players are more competitive when things aren’t comfortable. That is exactly the mindset we are looking for</p>

He must not, but it is human. And the Bordeaux player does not even get a yellow card<br /><br />The victory is the most important thing now because there are things to improve, it is clear.

We saw that his capacities increased after the first match against <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. Sadly, he was injured before that and hadn’t played before the first leg. But between the two legs, he improved physically and his capacities were enhanced. He gave everybody the impression that he was there, that he was taking on his responsibilities.
