  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> vs Inter be played this week amid coronavirus confusion]</b> The Government gave <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> two options: postpone or play behind closed doors<br /><br />The league opted to postpone, also to avoid having big games played in empty stadiums. It was an autonomous decision. It sets a precedent and I understand those who say it ought to be maintained now for everyone, but from next week fortunately it’ll be for three regions and no longer six<br /><br />When the country has over 1,000 cases and almost 30 people dead, having the football games all play at the same time is really not my first priority. I understand the fans are angry, but they cannot use that as their main thought process when judging difficult decisions</p>

We did it as a government to protect interests. Now there is no longer any controversy because some of the players have the virus. We would have preferred to have stopped the league sooner, but better late than never. Many teams today are giving donations for the emergency and we are happy, they are gestures of solidarity that we appreciate.

I can say for certain that, if the resumption of sporting events will exist, it will certainly start again behind closed doors. It’s not possible to think otherwise, but I also have some doubts with respect to the date of May 3. Unfortunately, this medical emergency is constantly related to its evolution.

On Wednesday I will meet the <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a>, who will present its training protocol. We will evaluate it together. We have to understand if football is ready to restart training.

  <p><b>[Spadafora says Unpopular decisions necessary amid wait for <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> return]</b> I too am a fan who misses watching his team. I was waiting for the Euros <b>[European Championship]</b> this summer with great enthusiasm, but that tournament was postponed, along with the Olympics, the Giro d’Italia and all sporting competitions in our country. It is enormously disappointing, within a far stronger and deeper pain for the awful tragedy that has struck the nation, Europe, the entire world. I can assure you that maintaining this approach of being extremely prudent is the most unpopular thing I could do, but we have the duty and the responsibility to make sure the whole country and world of sport can get through this emergency as soon as possible. There are many rights to be protected, workers who are having financial difficulty and deserve the right consideration. I met with the <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a> today, but also 19 presidents of various sporting disciplines who deserve attention too. I will do everything to ensure that in the upcoming government decree, we include all the regulations that guarantee the world of sport and its workers the necessary support so that not one single club, federation or person has to lose their job</p>

  <p><b>[Vincenzo Spadafora warned that the easing of measures would depend on safety protocols being respected]</b> We’ll resume training for team sports from May 18, but only if the conditions of safety and security can be confirmed over the next few weeks. I don’t wish to penalise or slow down the resumption of football, but I have to say we’ll see because there need to be rigid and certain protocols in place on the safety of the athletes. The <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a> (Italian football federation) presented a protocol last night and the scientific committee considered it insufficient, so it needs adjustments. Only from that moment, when the protocol is agreed, can we decide whether or not to restart football. Many leagues around Europe have terminated their seasons early, but <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> is not inclined towards suspending the season or even training. We are receiving very strong pressure to resume. We realise that the world of football deserves respect and support, as it is one of the largest economic resources in the country.</p>

  <p><b>[Italy sport minister Spadafora says it would be much easier to end <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> season]</b> Resumption must be gradual. Opinion polls would like football to stop here. I’m not a person who gets influenced by opinion polls. I don’t decide along the lines of common sentiment. It would be much easier to end the season immediately and the scientific community would agree. Carrying on the world of football is a very important thing for our country, but we must do it safely. Remember when <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> didn’t stop? How many teams have gone into quarantine? The <b>[Italian Football Federation]</b> <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a> submitted a protocol and it was considered. Today we’re at the end of April, we can’t know for sure how the virus will evolve and how the rules will be respected, therefore we can’t know when the season will resume. We’ll find out at a later date, when we have the data from the implementation of protocol. The protocol has very high costs, how will Serie B find it? It’s not true that there isn’t full consistency with the words of President <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> and my own. Claims of a plot against <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> are ridiculous and whoever says there is one is just as ridiculous.
