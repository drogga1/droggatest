  <p><b>[Samantha Kerr talks about Australia’s objective of lifting their first <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Women’s World Cup trophy at France 2019]</b> I think we can go all the way <b>[in France]</b>. The only thing that’s going to stop us is ourselves. The exciting thing is we are young. This is probably our best shot we’ve had so far. We’ve got so much potential in this team and we’ve just got to keep going at the rate we are and hopefully 2019 will be our year</p>

  <p><b>[Samantha Kerr reflects on her breakout year with the Matildas]</b> We play such a good brand of footy that Australians love to follow and support. The Matildas are household names now and you see not only young girls, but young boys wearing Matildas jerseys - everyone wants to jump on board and be a Matildas fan. I think we connect with all different audiences, from young to old, male to female, which is very unusual in sport</p>

There was a lot of critics talking about us but we’re back so suck on that one! It’s just outside noise, we don’t listen to the haters. The reaction from the girls, you can see what it means to us. We were so disappointed after the first game.</p>

  <p><b>[Australia vs Brazil vs Italy: The engrossing three-way fight for Group C supremacy. Asked whether Australia had sent a message to the rest of the tournament by beating Brazil]</b> Hell yes. Brazil are one of the best teams in the world, they’ve got the best player probably ever in the history of the game, so if people don’t keep watching the Aussies, we’ll come get you like we did them.<br /><br />Coming back from two goals down with the pressure we had on us? It’s pretty special. But there’s been some pretty good wins so I’d have to sit down and think about it</p>

It’s an amazing feeling (to score four goals). It was a team effort, it wasn’t just about me today. It’s a team effort that’s got us through to the next round. We’re confident in whoever we play.</p>

I play my best football when I’m at home. I’m a Real Madrid fan, so it doesn’t really mean anything to me (the Barcelona offer). I was honestly leaning more towards Chelsea, when I was thinking of those two, just based off what fit me best.</p>

  <p><b>[Sam Kerr responded to rumours linking her with a big money move to Chelsea after Australia’s heart-breaking Women’s World Cup exit]</b> That’s just media speculating. That popped up yesterday too. Everyone’s been speculating about Europe but I’m really happy in the U.S. I’m playing well there. I have a great club behind me and I love where I live. That’s just speculation.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether she felt the team had underachieved]</b> Any time you don’t win the WC you’ve underachieved. We’re obviously really, really disappointed and feel like we’ve let ourselves down. Right now, I can’t really think about those things. I’m just thinking about the loss<br /><br /><b>[The striker is confident that she and the team will bounce back though, despite the manner of the exit]</b> I’ve been trusted to take <b>[the first penalty]</b> and I was confident in taking it and I just skewed it. I’ll grow from this and become a stronger person mentally. The girls have already gotten around me. I feel like I let the team down, but they’ve been quick to cut that out. It’s obviously disappointing but I’m proud of the girls. They fought back hard to get into this game. Fought back hard to get into this entire tournament. It’s been a roller coaster ride the last few months but we’ve stuck together and we’ve had a lot of support. I’m just grateful for everyone that’s done everything for us. What can you do? Penalty shootout obviously sucks. It’s the second time and disappointing. We’ll come back</p>

But I missed a few <b>[chances]</b> there, so I’ll have to sharpen up on my shooting! I was nervous. It was my first one-on-one in a few months - I haven’t been playing much so I was nervous - but it will come, get the jitters out and it’s only my first game, I can go from here. I’m still finding my feet in England, I’m just getting used to it. It’s freezing to be honest! But I’m enjoying it. The girls are quality and they’ve really welcomed me so I’ve settled in the best I can in nine days. I always want to play. I was just going to put my head down and do what I could at training to start. I’ve been a bit rusty coming back from a break, but I always want to start.<br /><br /><b>[One of the main takeaways from Kerr’s debut was the way she linked up with Beth England]</b> It was awesome working with Beth England. I feel like we’ve just connected really quickly. She’s a quality player and hopefully she can keep scoring, because we need her</p>

  <p><b>[Kerr eyeing up treble after Conti Cup victory]</b> The last few times I’ve been to a final I’ve lost so it feels really good. Obviously, it wasn’t easy tonight, but we got the job done and that’s all that matters really. The whole team already knew we had that in us, but it shows a lot of other people we have that in us. We showed we’re not going to give up and tonight was a team effort, not just for tonight but for however long it’s taken us to get here. To do it with this group, it’s an amazing feeling. It’s no secret I came to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to win trophies and this is one of three boxes ticked for this year. We’re definitely going to celebrate tonight but come tomorrow and come after the international break it’s back to work. You’ve got to enjoy these moments, they don’t come around often as a footballer, so we’ll enjoy this one. It does make us hungrier and there’s a lot to do.<br /><br />We see it every day at training, she’s quite annoying to practice against! That’s no surprise to us, we were lucky to have her in goal tonight<br /><br />Any time a striker is scoring as many goals as Beth, they’re going to get all the media attention and she deserves it. She’s worked hard, she’s been unbelievable, she’s a good team-mate and she does a lot of work off the ball too. She scored the two goals, but she gets through a lot of work<br /><br />I’ve been really enjoying it. The team has been amazing, they’ve helped me a lot, the hardest part has probably been the cold. It’s just been hard to adjust to, I’m not used to it or playing in freezing cold weather and I’ve picked up a few injuries from it. But the club’s amazing, the staff are amazing, the team is amazing and I’m actually really enjoying living in London. I came off a break because I needed a break, I hadn’t one in eight or nine years. I still think I have so much more to give and honestly the hardest part is just getting to know how the girls play. As a striker, I want to score more but I’m not putting pressure on myself. I feel like I’m impacting the games and that’s what’s so great about this team, there’s so many players who can have an impact. I think more of the tiredness hasn’t come from not having a pre-season, it’s come from all the travelling around the world. People don’t realise it takes me 25 hours to get home! I did that 10 days ago and I’m doing it again tomorrow. It’s not easy as an Australian footballer but that’s our job and we do it for the love of it</p>
