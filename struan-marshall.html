  <p><b>[Struan Marshall, the agent at the centre of the <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> transfer saga]</b> My job is to carry out the wishes of my client. You’ve got to remember the clubs are skilled negotiators and it’s only fair the players have someone experienced working on their behalf. I know football can be a murky business and agents are an easy target for a kicking. Sometimes clubs can be outside forces making it that way, not just agents. It’s inevitable you’re going to get that in a case like this because you’re talking about one of the most wanted players in the world and the biggest clubs wanted to sign him<br /><br />On Wednesday morning I took a call from one BBC correspondent following Stevie’s decision to stay, and his first question was ‘are you disappointed?’. That probably sums up the image an agent has. People think we’re just trying to get money out of these deals. Of course I’m not disappointed. We’ve managed to reach the agreement which Steven wanted, so I’m happy.<br /><br />The way we got there was a real shame for everyone. If we’re all honest, whether it’s myself, the club or Steven, no-one’s going to give themselves 10/10 for the way it was handled. I’d be struggling to give myself 5/10 over the last few weeks. There was a build-up of events which could have been avoided. I admit I gave a substandard performance. The main thing at the end of it is we got to the place we’d all intended, even if none of us want to go through anything similar again. It’s the nature of the game that it’s always going to be the messy deals which make the headlines<br /><br />I became an agent in 1991 and in the last 10 years I’d say I’ve probably arranged between 18 to 20 deals with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. This is the only one which has been untidy. My first client at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was <a href="dominic-matteo.html">Dominic Matteo</a>. He introduced me to <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Jamie Carragher</a>, who in turn told <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> about how I worked. I brought <a href="emile-heskey.html">Emile Heskey</a> to the club and arranged his move away last season and I’ve represented <a href="gary-mcallister.html">Gary McAllister</a> for many years<br /><br />There was never a problem in any of those deals. But, like everything in football, when you arrange a deal without any fuss you’ve not likely to get headlines saying how well it’s gone. I consider these people friends, not just clients. These are people I invited to my wedding. <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Jamie Carragher</a> invited me to his wedding last week. Any <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan can see the likes of Steven, Jamie and <a href="gary-mcallister.html">Gary McAllister</a> are nobody’s fools. They wouldn’t work with someone they didn’t trust. They wouldn’t employ me if they thought I was just doing it for myself<br /><br /><b>[Marshall was today completing two of the most significant contracts of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s closed season. Both <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a> and <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Carragher</a> are penning four-year deals. Two of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>’s greatest sons trusted the 36-year-old Scot to agree the terms]</b> I don’t want to be seen as some whingeing agent complaining about the reputation of agents. This story was never about me. But I’m sure people can understand we’re not all like Eric Hall with a cigar in his mouth shouting ‘monster, monster’. Like any profession, there are good agents and bad ones, just like there are good and bad journalists. There was a lot of rubbish printed over the last few days which didn’t help any of us. I know I was getting stick, but to be honest, the thing I’ve been getting battered for most is that awful photograph they’ve been using of me on Sky Sports. It looks like a mugshot so I’ll need to put that right</p>
