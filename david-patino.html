  <p><b>[David Patino has had brief spells in charge of Pumas before but after earning a draw and a victory in his first two matches of this spell as the interim]</b> I’m the ideal manager for this project, to be able to capitalize on everything I’ve learned since I’ve was part of the Pumas youth teams, everything I’ve learned from Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez, Miguel Mejia Baron, Memo Vazquez, Hector Sanabria and so many other coaches I’ve had. I hope this can last for a long time. I’m enjoying this.</p>

  <p><b>[It’s the first time since the 2011 Apertura that Pumas have won their first two matches]</b> I’m really happy with the two matches, but this is just getting started. We’re not going to (celebrate prematurely) or change our style. Humility above everything and work. That’s it</p>

  <p><b>[Club America not afraid of Liga MX leaders Pumas as Clasico Capitalino captures attention once more]</b> There’s a discussion in the group every day with an element of confidence. This game is very important for the institution, not just for the first team. e’s a war on Sunday. Let’s go! I’m going with you, brother. Together to the war.</p>

  <p><b>[Pumas winger Jesus Gallardo continues making Mexico case]</b> My job is to make the team competitive against any team and today we did it against America. This game was very different from the other two we’ve had.</p>

  <p><b>[Pumas in risk of another failed tournament]</b> I’m ashamed about what happened and about the bad form we’re in. I’m pissed off about what’s happening and we’re going to win every fucking point that’s left.</p>

  <p><b>[America vs. Pumas headline Liga MX quarterfinals]</b> For us the prize, despite the fact we wanted to win <b>[today]</b> is that the tie means we’re facing America and it’s a Clasico for both teams. That’s very attractive and we want to win. We’re already getting prepared for this match with the intention of playing well, taking advantage of the opportunity and winning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[David Patino quietly putting Pumas in contention for Liga MX title]</b> I really respect my opponents. Miguel has had really great seasons, he’s a winning manager and I like the challenge of facing America<br /><br />I’m expecting a match that’s similar to the first leg. America’s strength is on the set piece, where they’ve scored a lot of goals. I’m not expecting them to change too much. We have to stand up for our work as a team, our intensity, to run so we can neutralize them. That’s the plan that I’m seeing for the weekend</p>
