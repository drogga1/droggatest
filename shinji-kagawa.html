  <p><b>[Shinji Kagawa has urged his Japan team-mates to show their quality at the upcoming World Cup in Brazi]</b> This is the first World Cup I have competed in. All we have to do is be fully prepared for our first game. Since Japan is little known in football in the world, we want to play good football and make a huge impact so that we can make the world realise the presence of the Japan football team. Personally, scoring goals creates confidence and I gain the mental stability and get poised from it. And I would like to go into our first game with strength and need to be well prepared to do so. I personally think it is a completely different kind of pressure. When playing for Japan, it means that I carry my country on my shoulders and I feel a different kind of pressure as I am expected to do more when playing for Japan</p>

  <p><b>[on Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> He normally left the training to the coaching staff. The day or so before the game, he just turned up at the stadium or hotel. Although I had heard about the <b>[hairdryer]</b> rumour before going to Manchester, I hadn’t seen any managers shouting that hard. It really was like a hairdryer, as it is called, he shouted really hard with his face really red, especially at the core players. It was my first season, so he maybe overlooked me a little bit and I didn’t get shouted at very much. The fact that he can shout at leading players such as <b>[Wayne]</b> <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>, <b>[Ryan]</b> <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a>, <b>[Paul]</b> <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a>, Rio <b>[Ferdinand]</b> shows his presence. Those players have to take it in and cannot say anything, so the players respect him that much. His aura and his driving force are really great and I thought that’s why he had the ability to manage those players. I think it was a great experience for my football life that I played his last season with him, someone who has the greatest number of titles in football and is a legendary manager. It really was a big moment to be with that kind of person</p>

  <p><b>[Kagawa the latest to join Mata’s Common Goal]</b> Football has given me so many opportunities in life and now I want to play my role in supporting others through the game. Common Goal is quickly growing around the world and I’m proud to help lead the movement forward in Japan. I’ve been fortunate enough to have football lead me all over the world… If there’s one constant I’ve witnessed throughout the journey, it has to be passion. <br /><br />Football inspires and excites people like nothing else on the planet, and what I love about Common Goal is that it channels this passion in a way that makes a real difference to disadvantaged communities around the world</p>

  <p><b>[q: <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> are leaders in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, can you beat Bayern to win the league?]</b> The season has just begun so nothing can be said yet. Look at last season, we started well, then dropped and couldn’t recover. The season is very long and nobody is thinking about winning the league yet<br /><br /><b>[q: What do you think of Atletico?]</b> They are a very solid team who are always alert and never rest. I have the impression that they are a team who always get goals against any big team. This match will be a big challenge for us<br /><br /><b>[q: Is <a href="diego-simeone.html">Diego Simeone</a> well known in Japan?]</b> In Japan there isn’t much attention given to European football, I don’t know if that’s known here in Europe. There isn’t a habit of watching foreign football and I think that’s why people don’t know much about <a href="diego-simeone.html">Cholo</a>. I speak mainly of the general public though and those who live for football know<br /><br /><b>[q: The Champions League final is at the <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Wanda Metropolitano</a>. Do you see you opponents as a favourite?]</b> Any big team has the chance to win it and Atleti have shown their ability in recent years. They have a lot of quality and they know how to win<br /><br /><b>[q: You are an offensive player and Atleti have a reputation for shutting teams out well. Have you studied them?]</b> We are in a very good moment as a team. We will play at home and for that reason have an advantage. Surely we will create opportunities. I don’t know if I’m going to play but I’m convinced that we are at a good level and have a chance to win<br /><br /><b>[q: Do you think <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a> should win the Ballon d’Or?]</b> Yes, he deserves it. He won the World Cup and always scores goals. What else can he do? <br /><br /><b>[q: You have had many Spanish teammates. What have they taught you?]</b> I love Spanish players. At United I met David De Gea, <a href="ander-herrera.html">Ander Herrera</a> and <a href="juan-mata.html">Juan Mata</a>. Now at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> I have Mikel Merino, Marc Bartra, <a href="paco-alcacer.html">Paco Alcacer</a>, <a href="achraf-hakimi.html">Achraf Hakimi</a> and Sergio Gomez. I love their character and imagination in their game. <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a> and <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> are examples in Japan and they are the players we all want to be and they give relevance to technique and imagination. Spanish football is a big influence in Japan and when I was young I watched your football and learned.<br /><br /><b>[q: You started playing at FC Miyagi <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. Who is your favourite Spanish player?]</b> <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>, he’s an idol. I would have liked to play with him. I faced him at United and swapped shirts with him and it is one of my treasures. Now, he plays in my country and in the city where I was born, Kobe. It gives me great joy and I’m proud that he plays in my city. Andres has a lot of influence in Japanese football. Everyone respects him and wants to be like him on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[q: What about Spain grabs your attention?]</b> I went to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> on my last holiday and I love the food, the people, the weather… it has everything that I like. It is a beautiful country and I would like to play in <a href="laliga.html">LaLiga</a> someday<br /><br /><b>[q: Back to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, do you think <a href="paco-alcacer.html">Alcacer</a> will be the top scorer in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>?]</b> He has a lot of ability and if we do a finishing exercise in training he scores eight of ten shots. If he continues at this rate he will surely be Europe’s top scorer, but the season has just begun so we’ll see what happens</p>

He knew me well, so maybe he knew that I was not OK. He told me that my style would be suited for Spain – I told him that I’d always wanted to play there<br /><br />He told me that <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> became champions of Germany because I had played for them. Of course there were other players, but that really lifted my confidence. ‘You don’t need to worry,’ he told me. I didn’t worry. Those words made me happy, I’ll never forget that moment<br /><br />I never lost a game against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> until <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> arrived. He made them better. Bayern had more money, more history and a better level of players than us<br /><br /><a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> said: ‘Bayern Munich are the champions of Germany, always. We are not the champions, we are the challenger’. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> never wanted us to get carried away. He never wanted us to think of ourselves as champions, even though we were top of the league.<br /><br />He wanted us to focus on ourselves, not to listen to what people were saying about us. It was all about the next game and only the next game. There was a lot of passion with <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, I felt that most in the dressing room before games<br /><br />He always had a big smile. He hugged every player. I loved his attitude – he was never nervous. He gave us confidence</p>
