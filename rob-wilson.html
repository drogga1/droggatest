  <p>[Whether clubs like City and PSG could feasibly challenge FFP through the courts] Yes they can is the answer to that question. I think both Man City and PSG, when they originally subscribed to the regulations, could have said: ‘We’re going to challenge the legality of these regulations through the European Court’. They chose not to do that for one reason or another, so I think you could see that. I think what we will find now is if the [Football Leaks] allegations are proven and the evidence formally comes to light then what we’ll see is UEFA having to take a much stronger position on the sanction, but then you will also see Man City and PSG challenge the legality of Financial Fair Play at its very core.</p>

  <p>[Rob Wilson says there is a chance the UK government could be moved to look at Manchester City] They’re likely to at some point get on the train that says we should have an investigation but I don’t think they can formally do anything. They might raise it, they might have a chat in the House of Commons about it, you might get one of the Manchester MPs saying it’s harsh or otherwise.<br /><br />I think there’s a good chance. There’s going to be a lot of public pressure now to investigate both<br /><br />[On Goverment] I would say it’s unlikely in terms of formal input. Because these are all private sector businesses, ultimately, the [UK] government doesn’t actually have any jurisdiction over what they should and shouldn’t do. Damian Collins [MP for Folkestone &amp; Hythe, Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee] a couple of years ago complained about Leeds United and Ken Bates and saying this is in the public interest, but this is essentially a privately owned company, what right do the government have to say how they should or shouldn’t be running their business?<br /><br />[Wilson and Dr Garcia believe City and PSG would have grounds to challenge the very principles of UEFA’s Financial Fair Play regulations either in the Court of Arbitration for Sport or the civil courts]. I think what we will find now is if these allegations are proven and the evidence formally comes to light then what we’ll see is UEFA having to take a much stronger position on the sanction because of the breach, but then you will also see Man City and PSG then challenge the legality of Financial Fair Play at its very core</p>
