<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are prepared to trigger the buy-back clause in Angelino’s <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> contract.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> have confirmed the signing of left-back Angelino, one year after they sold him to <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>]</b> I am thrilled to have rejoined <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, a side playing incredible football under <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>. Watching them while playing in Holland has been a pleasure. City’s performances over the last two seasons have been incredible and I am very excited about returning and contributing to the Club’s bid for more success. I believe my own game can develop under Pep’s management and I am very confident that the Club will go from strength to strength over the next few years.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> defender Angelino makes <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> loan]</b> Angelino will spend the rest of the season on loan at <a href="rb-leipzig.html">Red Bull Leipzig</a>. The Spanish wing-back has played 12 times for City this season after re-joining the Club from <a href="psv.html">PSV Eindhoven</a> in the summer. With City’s injury problems clearing up over the past few weeks, Angelino will have more opportunity for senior football with the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> side during his loan move. Everyone as the Club wishes Angelino good luck for the remainder of the campaign</p>

  <p><b>[Angelino refusing to give up on <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> future despite being loaned out to Leipzig]</b> I went to Manchester when I was 16, and I got a headache from not settling down. But I’m still a City player and I don’t give up on getting a place there<br /><br /><b>[He feels his competitive mindset having been enhanced in Manchester]</b> I acquired that in training with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>. I thought: ‘Well, I’m here to fight, to see if I can get minutes’. I worked as hard as I always have. But now I see the result. I am a better player thanks to his methods<br /><br />He said he was going to be delighted, that it was the perfect setting to see me again. It was an option that was there and that eventually came to fruition. It was the best option. Spectacular. Perfect for everything: the style, the team, the coach, the stadium, the fans … It took a while, but I’m very happy</p>

  <p><b>[Angelino suggests he will push for permanent move away from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>]</b> Since the first day Julian has given me a lot, I’m very grateful to him, the staff and mostly the club. They gave me this chance in January and I wanted to go somewhere and play and enjoy football again and thanks to this club I did it so I’m very grateful. I want to play, hopefully I’ll be stable soon. I’m very happy at the moment and I try to enjoy my time here, we will see<br /><br />I spoke to him (Guardiola) before I joined the club. He speaks more with Julian and I think they keep more in contact than me with them, but it’s a good relationship. These last six months I didn’t play much but I feel as a player I improved a lot with him (Nagelsmann) once I arrived here and started playing again, I can see an improvement. It was a project (Leipzig) that I was following for a few months already and the project they had the last few years and this year they did great in the Champions League. The project, and obviously the coach and his ideas really suit my style. So it wasn’t a hard decision to come and join Leipzig</p>

Since the first day Julian has given me a lot, I’m very grateful to him, the staff and mostly the club. They gave me this chance in January and I wanted to go somewhere and play and enjoy football again and thanks to this club I did it so I’m very grateful.
