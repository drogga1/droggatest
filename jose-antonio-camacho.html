  <p><b>[Vicente del Bosque should stay on as Spain head coach beyond Euro 2016]</b> The coach who I like the most now is Vicente del Bosque and I think he certainly has to continue with the national team.<br /><br />I hope Spain win the Euros. All their rivals will be going for our team. I’ve seen Germany, Holland and France recently, and they all know that they have to play against Spain in a way where everyone has to run and sacrifice themselves<br /><br />I know the list because I imagine it and I like it. And I say this because the list I would give only differs from Del Bosque’s in one or two players</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid have been urged to make a move for Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar]</b> I think that Madrid should always sign the best and Neymar is one of them. If I could I would sign him. You have to have those that can fight for the Ballon d’Or<br /><br />PSG now has changed a lot. Before it did not have the roots it has now. With the arrival of Arab money, it has signed a lot of talent and is trying to command world football</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and Spain coach Jose Antonio Camacho says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> cannot be considered the greatest of all time as an Argentine without a World Cup win to his name]</b> He’s a very good player, but you can’t be the best in the world, let alone in history, if you are Argentinian and you don’t win a World Cup. There are countries with less tradition where not winning the World Cup is less significant, but Argentina is a dominant force. No, without a World Cup, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> can’t be the best. A World Cup is the best you can aspire to and Argentinians will always demand it<br /><br /><b>[While disputing that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is the greatest ever, Camacho concedes that he is probably the pick of the modern era]</b> He can decide a game at any time. There can be total balance between two teams but he is <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and he can break that balance suddenly. On top of that, he’d make me look like a good coach<br /><br /><b>[<a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a> delivered where <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has failed, on a World Cup stage, and is considered to have boasted ability that remains unmatched by those who have followed in his footsteps]</b> With the talent that he had. If he had taken his career as seriously as <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> or <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, he would still be playing and winning every game</p>
