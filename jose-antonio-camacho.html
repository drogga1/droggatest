  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid and Spain coach Jose Antonio Camacho says Lionel Messi cannot be considered the greatest of all time as an Argentine without a World Cup win to his name]</b> He’s a very good player, but you can’t be the best in the world, let alone in history, if you are Argentinian and you don’t win a World Cup. There are countries with less tradition where not winning the World Cup is less significant, but Argentina is a dominant force. No, without a World Cup, Messi can’t be the best. A World Cup is the best you can aspire to and Argentinians will always demand it<br /><br /><b>[While disputing that Messi is the greatest ever, Camacho concedes that he is probably the pick of the modern era]</b> He can decide a game at any time. There can be total balance between two teams but he is Lionel Messi and he can break that balance suddenly. On top of that, he’d make me look like a good coach<br /><br /><b>[Diego Maradona delivered where Messi has failed, on a World Cup stage, and is considered to have boasted ability that remains unmatched by those who have followed in his footsteps]</b> With the talent that he had. If he had taken his career as seriously as Cristiano Ronaldo or Messi, he would still be playing and winning every game</p>
