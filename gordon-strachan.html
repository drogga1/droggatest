  <p><b>[Gordon Strachan on Paul Scholes]</b> <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> has been the best England midfield player for 30-odd years. You’d probably have to go back to <a href="bobby-charlton.html">Bobby Charlton</a> to find someone who could do as much as <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a>. When the ball arrives at his feet he could tell you where every player on that pitch is at that moment. His awareness is superb</p>

  <p><b>[Gordon Strachan on his Scotland side’s 3-2 defeat by Germany and hopes of reaching <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> EURO 2016]</b> When you play the world champions, you need a wee bit of luck. You don’t need deflections coming off somebody’s foot and creeping in the back of the net. They never had that, but they went through that pain barrier. To go behind against the world champions. To go behind again. To keep coming back. They can be proud of their performances. It was like in boxing, when <b>[one]</b> keeps smacking the other and <b>[he]</b> keeps getting back up. And even near the end, the heavyweight boxer is getting annoyed with the flyweight. And I could see it in <b>[their]</b> management thinking, ‘This could go wrong’. And let’s get this straight before the next question comes up: we’re still in this. Trust me, we’re still in this</p>
