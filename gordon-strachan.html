  <p><b>[Gordon Strachan insists Scotland are approaching their opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Germany without any trepidation]</b> I’m really looking forward to the challenge because I can see the players are. I’m encouraged by that, there’s no fear whatsoever in the camp. There’s a reality obviously that we’re playing the world champions but there’s no fear and I like that. They know they have to work hard to get a result and that’s been showing in training. We’re not scared of the occasion and where we’ve got to go. When you play the game you have a fear of getting beat and when you have the ball you should have no fear whatsoever and that’s the way we’re going into it. When we have the ball we won’t have any fear and when they have the ball we have a real fear of them scoring a goal and we’ll do everything possible to make sure they don’t score one.<br /><br />I thought Argentina were terrific and it was a wonderful game to watch but we didn’t take anything into it because it will be a completely different team and it’s a competitive game. I think when you say you have to compete, they are a different animal and they come alive when it becomes a real game</p>

  <p><b>[Gordon Strachan insists Scotland have a platform on which to build their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign after a battling defeat to Germany]</b> We played with freedom in the second half. We rectified that and the game became more comfortable for us, particularly in the second half. I thought we were going to get a point and I actually thought we were going to win it at one stage. We’ve got no points, we have a performance, but the next game <b>[against Georgia]</b> is a big game. We’ll look forward to that challenge when that comes around<br /><br /><b>[Strachan would not be drawn on the performance of referee Svein Oddvar Moen]</b> It’s not for me to talk about the referee. That’s for the referee’s assessor. I’ll let other people discuss that.</p>

  <p><b>[Scotland manager Gordon Strachan is in a confident mood ahead of Saturday’s Euro 2016 qualifier with Georgia]</b> The players make me feel confident. They make me feel good and they determine the mood of the coaches most of the time. They have satisfied me this week. They have made me happy; watching good players training hard, training intensely and asking questions, which is good. We are in a good place at the moment but is not just the training - it has been the performances over the last year that have allowed us to feel good about ourselves with the understanding that, after watching Georgia, we are playing against a good side, who can count themselves unlucky not to get anything from the first game, beaten only by a wonder goal by <b>[Ireland midfielder]</b> Aiden McGeady.</p>

  <p><b>[Scotland manager Gordon Strachan felt the vast majority of his side’s 1-0 win over Georgia on Saturday was a dream performance]</b> It was always going to happen at 1-0 against some good players <b>[that]</b> they threw caution to the wind. But I don’t think David <b>[Marshall]</b> had a save. They had a chance towards the end but they put it wide because we had two guys putting our bodies on the line. To get a great performance like that is fantastic because after losing the first game there is pressure on you. Whether it’s Germany or not, the pressure is on. But to play that way is absolutely outstanding. If you were to say to me we’re going to get that many chances against a good Georgian side…it was a manager’s dream that first 70 minutes.</p>

  <p><b>[Gordon Strachan revelled in his Scotland side winning an epic duel against the Republic of Ireland in Euro 2016 qualifying]</b> I am <b>[a proud man]</b> because that was an epic duel. From early in the game we knew what was going to happen but we dealt with that most of the time and we tried to get on the ball and play. They’re a big strong side, they’re professional, well organised, it was going to be hard. We kept persevering and trying to play and eventually, from a Stuart McCall corner kick we scored a goal. You’ve still got to get in that position and you’ve still got to be a great player to finish from there, setting the ball outside the goalpost and bringing it back in, so Shaun can be delighted with himself.<br /><br /><b>[On Steven Fletcher]</b> We’re not going to be able to risk him for <b>[the sake of]</b> Sunderland, that’s for sure. If he’s walking out of here with one of the protective boots on we won’t risk him for Wednesday</p>

  <p><b>[Gordon Strachan on his Scotland side’s 3-2 defeat by Germany and hopes of reaching <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> EURO 2016]</b> When you play the world champions, you need a wee bit of luck. You don’t need deflections coming off somebody’s foot and creeping in the back of the net. They never had that, but they went through that pain barrier. To go behind against the world champions. To go behind again. To keep coming back. They can be proud of their performances. It was like in boxing, when <b>[one]</b> keeps smacking the other and <b>[he]</b> keeps getting back up. And even near the end, the heavyweight boxer is getting annoyed with the flyweight. And I could see it in <b>[their]</b> management thinking, ‘This could go wrong’. And let’s get this straight before the next question comes up: we’re still in this. Trust me, we’re still in this</p>

  <p><b>[Gordon Strachan insists that Scotland are not scared of Robert Lewandowski as they prepare to face Poland next week]</b> People point out that they have Lewandowski and that’s true but they have not beaten us yet. You can take it as a sign of his <b>[Lewandowski’s]</b> brilliance, being sometimes that wee bit quicker than anyone else, a sign that we’re worried when he gets the ball. For every good player, you want to make teams scared. But we’re not scared of him so long as we do our unit work well. And if we keep the ball longer than them then we’ll restrict his chances. It’s about cutting his supply off and keeping the ball ourselves because if we keep the ball longer than they have it then the less chance there is of Lewandowski doing something to hurt us.</p>

  <p><b>[Scotland have taken the decision to part with Gordon Strachan and Mark McGhee after missing out on the 2018 World Cup]</b> I said on my first day as Scotland manager that it was the proudest moment of my career and that I wanted to put a smile back on the nation’s face again. I share the profound disappointment at missing out on the play-offs, especially having worked so hard to fight our way back into contention.<br /><br />The players should receive immense credit for that resilience in coming back from a difficult start and I would like to thank each and every player who has come in to represent their country. Together we have shared some really magical moments and those memories will live with me forever.<br /><br />Of course, what made those moments special was the unwavering support of our fans. Through highs and lows you have stayed with the team and my biggest regret is not being able to provide the finals tournament you deserve.<br /><br />I would like to thank the Board, the backroom staff and everyone at the Scottish FA for the help and support they have given me as national coach. It has been a real privilege.</p>

  <p><b>[Marcus Rashford is paying the price for being a versatile asset at Manchester United]</b> His problem is he can play in a few positions. At this moment he doesn’t know what he’s best at either. And at Manchester United at the moment with Jose, he likes that big powerful striker up front to hold it up. I don’t know if Marcus is that type of player. Can he play off the left and right? He certainly can. Can he play at number 10? I don’t know. At that point you’ve got to find where your best position is. Some players go ‘I can only play there’ and some ‘I can only play there’. But he can play in a lot of different positions.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba needs to stop spending time being an Instagram personality]</b> I think he has the highest transfer fee, is probably one of the highest earners and he is the captain. I’ll tell you what you do then, you become the personality not on Instagram and not getting your picture taken, you become THE person, all round the club. You become the hardest worker, you become the best team-mate you can be, you set a standard that everybody follows. That’s what you do when you’re the captain at Manchester United. You’re the best trainer, best player, most highly driven, that’s your responsibility as a captain, but especially at Manchester United. When you are talking about the Messis, Ronaldos, Iniestas, and Silva they get man of the match <b>[awards]</b> on many occasions. For that type of personality with what you pay for and the hype, very rarely is Pogba the man of the match, where he takes the game by the scruff of the neck. Even when he’s had a shot at goal, and someone says, ‘well at least he’s trying’, he’s had a shot. They’re clutching at straws looking for things that he does great.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United midfielder Gordon Strachan has counselled David de Gea to leave Old Trafford]</b> I think he’s way past the stage of worrying about money. I think what you need now is job satisfaction and as a goalie he’s got another 10 years in it. I think he wants to go and be in the top games, the Champions League, cup finals, winning leagues. That’s what he’s after. I think the problem United are having just now is because they are not up there with the top clubs in Europe. They are one of the top clubs, but not one of the top teams at the moment - he’ll go back to the Spanish squad and he’s got the guys from Real Madrid in the Champions League final, Barcelona, they are winning leagues. He’s not winning leagues anymore.<br /><br />He deserves the right to choose where he goes and he’ll have a few clubs after him. But he deserves it after a sticky start where young players can crumble going to Manchester United, we’ve seen it before - they crumble, they disappear and we don’t see them again. He dealt with it, physically got better but mentally got stronger. Over the last couple of years, I’m sure he’s had approaches and he’s dealt with it in the right way. OK, it takes you a little while to get over a knock-back if you really want to go to Barcelona or Real Madrid or wherever it is, but he’s dealt with it, he’s got on with it. He’s been a great team-mate and a great servant for the club, so I think it’s right that he decides where he wants to go.</p>

  <p><b>[Brendan Rodgers has been warned that he may live to regret leaving giant club Celtic for Leicester]</b> I’m disappointed Brendan has left Celtic for Leicester - I would’ve wanted him to at least have stayed until the end of the season. I thought Brendan would wait a wee while longer, and get a club somewhere around the world that guarantees you Champions League football. But I understand that he, and the club, have probably made a decision to remove the uncertainty from the situation. The club can now move forward. Let’s get one thing clear: Celtic are a giant club. One of the biggest in the world. Far bigger than Leicester. But that’s not the comparison - the Premier League is so far advanced of Scotland’s that it’s unreal.<br /><br />There’s a point when you’re in Scotland when you say ‘I’m at a huge club here, but is it enough?’ Was the league still testing Brendan? It did for the first season or two, because it was fresh, but it mightn’t have felt fresh anymore. His best team was probably in his first season. It’s a blow to the club, but they’ve lost managers before and dealt with it. There’ll be a mad rush around the world now, of people wanting to apply to work at Celtic. The people behind the scenes at the club have seen it all before. They’re so good at their job, it’s like working with chess players. They can see problems coming, they’ll have prepared for this - they would’ve known it was coming. There’ll be a lot of great managers they talk to. They’ve hired people before with links to the club, but also without links. The next appointment will say a lot about how Celtic see themselves. Do they keep playing the same way that Brendan had them - that might be a good idea. They have the means to buy players better than the rest of the division, so it’s a great job</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho needs to re-evaluate what he was up to at Manchester United]</b> We all agree that, over the last 15 years, Mourinho has been one of the best tacticians in football and I thought it would be hard for Ole to replace someone like Jose and the presence he has got. I did not believe any manager could, actually. I didn’t think the kind of negativity coming from Jose could get to a group of players the way it did. I thought it needed more to rectify than man-management. I don’t know Ole that well but I couldn’t see him and his group being as good as Mourinho tactically<br /><br />For all the seminars you get in sport psychology, all the systems, all the ‘Players have to drink x-amount of water, they have to be sleeping by such a time, they need two grams of rice’ - and the rest of it - it basically comes down to man-management. It just reaffirms that good people can change football clubs with drive. The attitude of the players has just changed completely, which is why Mourinho has to go away now and re-evaluate what he was up to at United<br /><br />I’ve heard Ole isn’t the world’s greatest coach but Sir Alex wasn’t the world’s greatest coach. He knew how to coach but for 25 years he didn’t do much coaching - he left that to others. He brought presence, discipline and footballing philosophy - things like passing the ball forward more - and that’s where modern football is at. It’s a lot simpler than people are making out. You’ll get caught up in it if you believe all these stats, but it’s the Emperor’s New Clothes. We know Ole is talking to Sir Alex and that’s good. He won’t be asking about tactics, he’ll be asking how he deals with being United manager on and off the park. When Alex first went to United, he had a similar set-up with Sir Matt Busby. Nothing technical, just how to deal with being the manager at that club. As a top manager, sometimes you can think you’re getting all the problems in the world and that it’s horrible. So it’s nice to sit and have a cup of tea with somebody who has been there, done that and survived - he’s okay, he’s not nuts. It’s just nice to talk to somebody who has been in your shoes and there are not many who have walked the road Ole is right now. Sir Alex may say, ‘I had that with David Beckham or Jaap Stam, this is how I solved it - try that’. There’s nothing wrong with getting help because if we’re saying players need psychologists, why can’t a manager get help? Your family doesn’t understand it, the coaches around you don’t really understand it. You need somebody who really knows what it’s all about</p>
