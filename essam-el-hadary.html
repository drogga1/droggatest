  <p><b>[Essam El Hadary speaks after becoming the oldest player to make an appearance in the CAF Africa Cup of Nations]</b> I’ve got more objectives beyond playing in my seventh Cup of Nations. I want to play at the 2018 World Cup too. We have the chance to qualify for the biggest competition of them all for the first time since 1990. I want to be a part of that and wear my country’s jersey there</p>
