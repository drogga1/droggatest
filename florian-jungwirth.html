  <p><b>[San Jose Earthquakes defender Florian Jungwirth recalls <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> insulted his ‘scared’ LA Galaxy team-mates for the entire 90 minutes of a match]</b> I think it was in 2018 when we played at Stanford against <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> first time - and he was like really insulting all his team-mates. For 90 minutes - he was yelling at everyone. It was just funny. Everyone was so scared of him and I was just laughing because everyone was like a little kid. They were like, ‘Daddy, can I get something from you?’<br /><br />He was quiet against us - I didn’t say anything. But I think that’s actually the worst you can do as his opponent. I think if you go for that, that’s exactly what he wants and then he takes you. I think you always have to study your opponents. Some opponents you have to provoke them, they maybe have a temper. But when you start playing games against <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a>, there is no way you can win</p>
