  <p><b>[Turkish striker Burkak Yilmaz could be forced to leave Beijing Guoan due to an ongoing child custory case]</b> Our club did receive an offer from Trabzonspor but we rejected it without any hesitation. We have talked about it with Yilmaz and our president Zhou Jinhui also discussed the matter with him, hoping to persuade him to stay.<br /><br />Yilmaz said he wanted to stay and was unwilling to leave, but he was forced to deal with family issues. If he doesn’t return <b>[to Turkey]</b>, he will lose custody of his child. We are eager to help him but the lawsuit was filed in Turkey, there’s nothing we can do. If Yilmaz has to quit for family issues, we won’t make things difficult for his transfer. He is one of us, who has made a contribution to Guoan. We’ll try to understand his grievances. The coaching staff have been made aware of the issue and will prepare for all possibilities. The final decision will be made in two days</p>
