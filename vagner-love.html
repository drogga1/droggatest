  <p><b>[Flamengo striker Vagner Love has launched a scathing attack on <a href="zenit-st-petersburg.html">Zenit</a>, labelling them the most racist club in Russia]</b> The monkey chants in the match against Emelec did not affect me because that was not the first time this has happened. It happened to me two or three times when I played against <a href="zenit-st-petersburg.html">Zenit</a>, the most racist club in Russia. I never said anything, I was never angry. That is just their way. Unfortunately, some players could not get over it, but thanks to God, I never had a problem. It goes in one ear and out the other. Life goes on</p>

  <p><b>[CSKA admitted that selling <a href="vagner-love.html">Vagner Love</a>, who has been on the club’s books since 2004 and signed a new deal earlier this year, was difficult]</b> This decision wasn’t made easily by the club or <a href="vagner-love.html">Vagner Love</a>. The forward has been offered unprecedented personal contract terms, while CSKA received a very lucrative offer from the Chinese side. Vagner has made a huge contribution to all of CSKA’s recent successes but we understood this was a once-in-a-lifetime offer</p>

  <p><b>[Vagner Love ditches CSKA for China in €12m move]</b> It was definitely not an easy decision for me. I had dreamed about playing with my team-mates again in the Champions League and fighting for another league title. The club did everything to keep me, but I have to accept that my career will not last forever and I need to think about my family and the future. I am making a sacrifice to some extent, but I will never receive an offer like this again. I have agreed to move, but my heart and soul will be with CSKA forever</p>

  <p><b>[Flamengo star Vagner Love held nothing back in a frank talk about his sex life in Brazil and Russia, affirming that orgies involving up to 14 people were common in his days as a single man]</b> Does it happen? Now I am married, but <b>[orgies]</b> do happen. If there were six men, we would say that we were going to have eight women, more or less. The <b>[groupies]</b> want to take advantage. They want to get a footballer and then talk about it to their friends: ‘Hey, I was with this guy, I was with that guy’. There is a lot of competition between them. They all want status and a little bit of fame<br /><br /><b>[The former CSKA Moscow player also revealed where his nickname came from after an ill-advised tryst in the days prior to a match]</b> The former CSKA Moscow player also revealed where his nickname came from after an ill-advised tryst in the days prior to a match.<br /><br /><b>[The player concluded the interview by talking about the difficulties of sex in Russia and in Siberian temperatures]</b> You can still do it. At home, in restaurants or in shopping malls there is always heating, so no problem. The issue is out in the street. I did not mess around doing that in the street because I’m not tough enough to do it when it is -27, -30°C.</p>
