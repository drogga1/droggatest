  <p>[Legendary goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon should look back on his career with satisfaction] Buffon was a little bit down on his luck this season. Italy didn’t make it to the World Cup, then Juve didn’t make it to the semi-finals of the Champions League. He’s had a tough couple of months. He was struggling. I think he is going to stop after this year. I don’t know if it’s sad for him to end like this, because he has won so much previously. I think he is happy with his performances during all these years and has been playing for so long. He has been one of the best goalkeepers during a lot of time so he should be satisfied.</p>

  <p>[Sweden legend Thomas Ravelli says his country can’t take Mexico lightly in the World Cup group stage] The Mexican team always had very good individual players but they never worked really well as a team. If they can achieve good team spirit and work for each other then Mexico can be as good as South American football teams such as Brazil or Chile or Uruguay. It’s up to the coach to get that kind of feeling in the team, for the players to work for each other. It’s always like that if you want a good performance in the World Cup.<br /><br />My thoughts about that is If Zlatan comes back with the same shape he had before the injury, then yes. But I don’t think Zlatan wants to play in the World Cup if he is not in a good shape. But it’s up to him and up to the Swedish manager to take that kind of decisions. By gaining back the shape he had before, then maybe he can play in the World Cup</p>

  <p>[Sweden have the potential to go deep into the 2018 World Cup] If we can make it to the second round, anything can happen. It will depend on the kind of teams we’re going to meet and play against and it will depend on our team’s shape. If we can play as we did against France and Italy in the qualifications, we can go very far.</p>
