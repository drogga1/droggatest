  <p><b>[Shahrel Fikri surprised at national team call-up]</b> I’m thankful for this opportunity. I was surprised but happy to have done it with PKNP. I’m thankful to my parents who always tell me to just do my best and I’m very happy that my hard work has been rewarded.</p>

  <p><b>[Shahrel Fikri notched his first professional hat trick in the match against Felda as PKNP showed they are serious contender for the Malaysia Cup]</b> It came as a surprise to me. When we go up against a Super League side, we don’t target to get a hat trick. But when you get it, it gives you a very big boost to my confidence.<br /><br />When I was with the national team, I take in all the advice from coach Nelo <b>[Vingada]</b> and I’m glad it has helped me. Even though PKNP were the underdogs, we showed that we can match some of the Super League teams<br /><br />The second leg will not be easy. Felda will come looking for goals and that means we have to keep our focus to ensure we get the win</p>

  <p><b>[Shahrel Fikri talks on his progression as a footballer]</b> It was in 2004 when I was 10 years old that I started playing football, mixing with kids older than me in the fields around where I stayed. It went well for me and before long I was playing for my school, SK Ayer Tawar. I stayed in the team until 12 years old and it was then that I made it to play for the district. We didn’t win any tournaments but I’ve always been a starter<br /><br />When I went to Form 1, the football program is school was full and I had to choose another sport. So I took up sepak takraw. But because I can’t go far there, I went back to playing football in Form 3 and managed to get selected played for the school up to the Under-17 level. After taking my SPM, I started playing in the Manjung League for a club call Manjung Junior Club. When I was 18, i tried out for the open selection for Perak Youth but wasn’t selected and thus continued back in Manjung League<br /><br />When I was 19, tried out for President’s Cup team and it was Abu Bakar Fadzim who selected me. Then I started playing in the King’s Gold Cup. The President Cup started in 2013 and I couldn’t be happier with what happened. I managed to score 10 goals. Perak got into the final but we lost to Kelantan. After the league finished, coach Burn said he will send a few players for selection at Young Tigers B. So i went but it was there I got stuck with the medical. I was diagnosed with a heart condition and thus failed to make the team<br /><br />I have never had any checks before that. I had to discuss with the family but we decided that since I didn’t feel troubled by the condition, that we do not go with the surgery. Yes, it’s a risk because it’s related to the heart. I have never fainted nor blackout. Of course I feel tired but like any normal player would do after training or after a match.<br /><br />I rested 2 - 3 months after the report. But then I got a call from Perak FA asking me to come into office and they told me to get another checkup at Ipoh General Hospital. After the second checkup, I was told that I can play again. I wasn’t given any medication<br /><br />Abu Bakar Fadzim is the one who has helped me the most. He’s a great characters and helped me tremendously both physically and mentally. All he ever wants is for the players that he guides to be successful. He gives a lot of motivation and only ask us to perform in matches to what we can do<br /><br />In my career, I have always been a striker but now a left forward in PKNP. When we were in the FAM League, I was the striker but when we reach Premier League and were allowed to get imports, I was moved out wide<br /><br />It hasn’t affected me. It’s different of course, there’s more space to exploit out wide compared to being marked tight as a central striker. I’m now able to show my dribbling skills as well<br /><br />Coach Tan <b>[Cheng Hoe]</b> called Coach Burn and then he told me I was selected. I was surprised because I’m playing in the lower league and I thought I was being pranked. It was during the briefing for the game against Perlis in Penang. After the briefing, he told in front of everyone and my team mates all clapped<br /><br />The difference between PKNP and others are our close relationship, team spirit and our hard work. Everyone know that Coach Burn works us like crazy in training. But we get the benefit on the pitch and the result. We are a team that doesn’t give up until the end<br /><br />In the league, I’ve scored most of my goals through headers. I can shoot well but my headers are my best attribute. I have to admit that when I was young and where I was staying, it was hard for me to follow Malaysian football. Sometimes I do go to ipoh and watch Perak, Khalid Jamlus is the player i admired last time. Wan Zack Haikal is my idol because he plays in the same position. he’s a silky player who has got pace, characteristics which I also have</p>

  <p><b>[Shahrel sees Safawi as main challenger for highest scoring local player]</b> I did not expect to be in this position of being the only local player among the top two scorers of the season but it is still very early and I cannot be too comfortable. If possible I would like to continue to challenge the foreign forwards but as well from a local perspective I think the challenge will come from someone like Safawi.<br /><br />In the team I have been given the trust to be one of the main attackers alongside Guilherme de Paula and it is up to me to use this chance the best I can, to continue to score goals and keep my place in the starting eleven in the team</p>
