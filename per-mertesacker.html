  <p><b>[Per Mertesacker talks about life in London]</b> That’s what I love, getting the tube, not getting any recognition, trying to be as normal as possible. Sometimes you get a big <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fan and they tell you they have a season ticket or want to have a chat, which is fine. Some want a selfie, but sometimes I just want to say: ‘Let’s just shake hands. It means more than a picture’. But not a lot of guys ever think that way!</p>

  <p><b>[Mertesacker assesses <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s methods]</b> When we lost one game, we often lost a few in a row. We could show off our class across six FA Cup games, but 38 League matches in 10 months were a different matter. We simply lacked the consistency all top teams need. You couldn’t win the League on eight defeats a year. <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> was always the kind of manager whose belief in his team’s qualities was steady as a rock and who approached matters with never-ending patience. He didn’t lose his nerve during losing streaks, either. He stuck with his convictions and his players, no matter how strong the wind was blowing. It was his greatest strength.<br /><br />Wondering whether it was also his greatest weakness and whether he was he too lenient with us is, in my opinion, a little too simplistic. If the fans had got their way, there would have been five new top signings every year. ‘Spend some f***ing money!’ they would chorus from the stands after defeats. But <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> trusted the players he had. I never met another manager who believed more strongly in his squad’s ability<br /><br />First and foremost, <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> saw us as human beings and he had a lot of faith in us, which is why he stood by us. Ultimately, we as players need to ask ourselves whether we did everything possible to justify his trust. Did we implement his instructions perfectly? Were we pulling together? Did we learn from our mistakes? No. <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> has won three <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> titles, which is proof enough of his standing as a ­manager. The team, on the other hand, had fallen short since 2004</p>

  <p><b>[Per Mertesacker says <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> will learn from the mistakes he has made early in his <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> career]</b> I think he will learn from his mistakes on the pitch, but he is very comfortable being at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. That’s what I have been seeing. So we are happy to have him. He brings something different to the table right now. So I think he is able to learn and excel his level of being an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> player<br /><br /><b>[Lacazette and <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> scored to help <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fight back from 2-0 down to claim a draw at home, but Mertesacker feels the Gunners may need a tactical rethink]</b> I think we have a lack of balance right now, where you feel like, OK we have amazing strikers but they as well need to understand that we need to have a certain compactness. It’s not only about our three strikers providing an offensive threat. It is about these front three as well, leading the first front line as being a defensive unit. So I think we need to be cautious of that. No matter how much striking power you have got, you need to have a sense of defensive compactness from everyone</p>

  <p><b>[Per Mertesacker is sure that genius <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> can still make an impact at the club]</b> Yeah <b>[I understand <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans’ frustrations with Ozil]</b> because probably they don’t understand him. I know how to take him and how to try to pinch him when needed. But ultimately it has to come from him if he wants to go to the next level. But he can deliver. He loves playing football, it doesn’t come across so often. He is a genius in terms of what he can produce with the ball and you can see that in every training session. Once he gets the ball, he’s rested. He thinks he plays in the park. He can deliver that ball that no one else can deliver. He has got that magical sense. He wants to be OK with everyone. He is not the kind of guy who approaches people and says: ‘You need to do this, that and that’. He’s a different character and sometimes I struggled with that. Sometimes I was really p<em>**</em>d with him for days and weeks<br /><br /><b>[Mertesacker admits that the relationship with the club’s fans deteriorated under <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> and expressed his regret that he and his team-mates could not perform well enough]</b> I think that connection got lost, definitely. It was difficult. You feel almost responsible. ­Responsible for the lack of success and probably that <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> might have to leave at some stage because we’re not delivering what everyone wants. I always felt really, really bad when a manager was sacked.<br /><br />I was fortunate to play under Thomas Schaaf at Bremen. And I played for <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>. So I always felt, let’s say more ­responsible than others towards the manager and his succession. And you could almost feel that day would come one day, because the expectations were different - we needed to come back and compete for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> titles, not for FA Cups. So that shift, you could almost feel it was coming. You really want to build the best connection between players and fans, so everyone feels this is the best club. A culture where everyone trusts each other, that we can be world class again</p>

  <p><b>[Mertesacker opens up on how Robert Enke’s suicide is shaping <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s academy 10 years on]</b> He encouraged me, he pointed out my qualities - which one sometimes no longer sees himself as an insecure 19-year-old. He let me feel that he felt safe with me in the defence. I think a more beautiful experience can hardly be done at work, no matter what job you do: he gave me his trust<br /><br /><b>[When discussing Enke’s death]</b> It was devastating, it felt really heavy at that time. I was sad, he was a very close friend of mine. It’s a very sensitive topic but I felt devastated. You question a lot. You question your life, you question your ability to connect with people. But I hope what I can learn from this is that you need to be very careful with the people living alongside you and you need to care. That’s something we are really keen on in the academy, to be the most caring academy in the world and that’s the challenge we put on ourselves<br /><br />It’s one horrible example where people can be athletes and play to a high, high level on a weekly basis, but could suffer something else that we don’t know about. And that’s a big lesson for everyone, <b>[it shows]</b> that everyone is really in danger of mental illness. We need to be really cautious about this topic. Now we are here and sometimes it feels like the media will maybe do a campaign for a week to put an emphasis on it, but we then operate as usual the week after. It’s really about the people who live in the here and now to make it work<br /><br />When I was playing there were sometimes people you could speak to like psychologists, but it was not as open an environment as it is right now. The chance we have now is to influence the next generation, so we’re really keen on bringing it all out and being conscious about mental health. When I struggled before games I was not really comfortable with the situation. I was always thinking that speaking about yourself or seeking help shows a weakness. We are trying to get rid of that notion by bringing out more stories about myself, about others, bringing more attention <b>[to the fact]</b> that top athletes struggle, bringing it more to life in a normal way and encouraging youngsters to speak out because we are a club that cares<br /><br />When we look at the mission of the academy, <b>[which is]</b> to create the most challenging and most caring youth academy in the world, then you can see from the statement that we want to prepare for life. We want to be the most challenging for the kids to push them on to the next level, but as well in that challenge, we have to be caring in the sense of how can we support every single individual to live up to the expectations and support them in every aspect of their personal and individual development. There is a huge objective in our mission to build these strong individuals to cope with any scenario in life. That’s why we think our vision of strong, young Gunners is perfect in that sense. We try to put everything in place here to make sure there is an open forum to mental health<br /><br />On the one hand we want to be the best football academy, where we build youngsters up to play in the team, to play football, to play the game they love. But we teach them to do it with respect, discipline and humility, and in these words already are a lot of things that indicate we want to do it the right way. We speak about physical health, but the mental part of it plays a huge part in that. How do we interact with each other, how do we keep that open forum alive, how do we develop our players, our coaches our staff and raise their awareness about how we talk to each other? We have a range here of Under-9s to Under-23s, how can we learn from each other, how can an Under-9 learn from an Under-23 in terms of his journey, on the struggle and the adversity that will kick in? So we do a lot of stuff that makes them more aware and hopefully more happy to live a more fulfilling life</p>

His leadership is fantastic and I felt it myself, just being vice-captain and learning from him, how to handle situations, how to man up, be the captain and show it, but as well to have the empathy and the feeling for people. I learned a lot from him and I can only say that our working relationship is great and our personal relationship is great, so I can see a fantastic future for us. It’s just building pieces with <a href="edu.html">Edu</a> as well, so I think we’re in a fantastic position. We don’t take anything for granted, now is the time to really push on and make sure we come back to where we belong, and that’s the Champions League and having world-class players in the building, and having world-class young players. We want to build on our DNA that was developed over centuries, so we cannot forget the history and the greatness of the club. We are inheriting that and we are sons of so many greats that have led this club to greatness, so it’s a big responsibility, not only for myself but for Mikel, <a href="edu.html">Edu</a> and all the great leadership we have.
