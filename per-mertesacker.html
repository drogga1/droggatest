  <p><b>[Per Mertesacker believes defensive discipline has been lacking at Arsenal this season]</b> The encouraging thing is that we’ve shown that resolute defence at times this season. We have the potential so let’s utilise it. You can’t do what we did against Watford, where we gifted them two goals, or what we did against Chelsea, where we lacked that bit of intensity at times. But I’ve had a good feeling in training and I’ve sensed how this squad demands the best from one another.<br /><br />Saturday’s game was crucial for us and the Champions League is massive for us too, because we want to prove that we can perform on an international level, when the floodlights are on. The Bayern Munich tie gives us a real chance to do that again. That’s what we want to do, that’s why we play in the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Why all those laughing at Per Mertesacker may eat their words in FA Cup final]</b> When I came back in the new year, you want to give everything you can and try to support the team as much as you can. Trying to lift them no matter what happens. We went through difficult periods throughout the season but everyone is eager now.<br /><br />I haven’t played this year. But I have done this for 15 years so I expect myself to be absolutely ready no matter what comes. That is my mindset, no matter what happens or what is facing me on Saturday, I am going to go for it. I owe it to this team and to this club. I want to make sure I will be ready and my mindset is ‘120 minutes plus penalties<br /><br />What are we looking at? A final where we have to turn up on that day. I think that’s the best for a competitor to have such a game at the end of the season. No matter what the situation is with the manager and with the team, who’s fit and who’s not fit, I think this team needs to be ready. That’s all I care about – and what a fantastic game to have to finish the season</p>

After that, I look forward to the exciting challenge of helping produce young players good enough to play for the Arsenal first team.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal hero Sead Kolasinac could be the bargain of the summer]</b> He is a presence! He fits well into this team. He’s a great character. His physique, yeah, he’s massive but also quick. Even going forward he looks comfortable, but he can play a deeper role in that back three because he’s got that tactical education from Germany. You can feel that in training. Going forward he plays the clear pass but is still dangerous. He never gives up, you know, <b>[you could see it]</b> on that play where Theo scored. He’s a guy that never gives up and a great addition to this team. Just muscle doesn’t work at all, you have to use it well. His physique is quite outstanding for a guy like him.</p>

  <p><b>[Per Mertesacker insists nobody at Arsenal has paid any attention to accusations from Troy Deeney of the club lacking cojones]</b> I don’t know what he said. I don’t pay attention. Anyways it was after the game I think, so I didn’t watch it. We should concentrate on ourselves first of all, there are so many guys involved and so many opinions, which is fine, but we need to focus on ourselves and learn lessons from that.<br /><br />If we start to listen to too many people it’s not worth it, honestly, I need to look at myself and think what could have been done better. Afterwards, it’s easy to judge and easy to say words and think we are lacking something. We have to think how we can provide better performances, especially away from home, where it gets tight and difficult.<br /><br />We need to be mentally tougher in front of goal. We create the chances, but sometimes we need to switch on quicker. I believe we have that mental toughness but we need to switch on and do our thing. We were not good enough against Watford because we missed a chance and the majority of players were still thinking about that chance. Those things, switching on, need to be quicker.<br /><br />We had everything in place. We scored from a set-piece away from home, we protected the goal well for the first 60 minutes, we had a couple of chances to go further ahead - but we didn’t. Then you need to be really resilient in those tight moments, and make clever decisions, but that’s what we lacked basically. We want to be more clever in defending our own goal</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker has confessed that the pressure before big games can have an adverse effect on his stomach]</b> Some days you realise that everything is a burden, both physically and mentally. That it’s not about fun, but you have to deliver without a doubt. Even if you are injured. In the moments before a game starts my stomach turns around as if I had to vomit. Then I have to choke so violently until my eyes tear.<br /><br /><b>[He admits that, despite losing to Italy, he was relieved to have got through the semi-final match in one piece]</b> Of course I also was disappointed when we were beaten by Italy. But above all I was relieved. I still remember it as if it were today, I just thought: It’s over, it’s over. Finally it’s over</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil can get even better]</b> Often it’s Mesut who is the creator and on Thursday he showed how lethal he can be in the final third. He has that eye, that vision. It’s up to us to put him into the best possible position to be able to have maximum influence. We have to give him that platform in every match and Thursday was an example of why. It’s not just Mesut’s creativity that benefits us though, he’s also a threat when he penetrates the box and he came close to scoring in the first half too. It’s good to have that variety.<br /><br />There’s still more to come from Mesut, as I’ve always said. There is so much potential there but he still has more to give. He was heavily involved in all four goals against CSKA and we need him to be as valuable as that in every single game<br /><br /><b>[On Aaron Ramsey]</b> I enjoyed seeing the way Mesut linked up with Aaron Ramsey. Aaron is at his best when he makes those brilliant late runs into the box and shows how dangerous he can be. He has almost perfect timing and is great at that late arrival into the box. We have many offensive qualities - but we can’t neglect the defensive balance, and the same goes for Aaron too. It’s all about picking when to go forward and when not to, to get that balance right</p>

  <p><b>[Per Mertesacker has posted an emotional tribute to outgoing manager Arsene Wenger]</b> It is only right that I begin these notes by paying tribute to a man who has taught me so much, both on the pitch and as a human. We were only informed on Friday about the manager’s decision to step down at the end of the season, so it’s still quite emotional. Obviously he has been at the club for such a long time and he has been so supportive to me. One major reason why I’m here is because of him. It’s been emotional and there will be time to digest it but it is a sad feeling right now. He’s been the major figure of this club for more than 20 years. He’s been so impressive for me and he has trusted me so much throughout my career, in bringing me here and making me captain even when I was injured. He also gave me a future role here at the club so I am very grateful and humbled for the opportunity he gave to me.<br /><br />It is a sad day for me but we’re also moving forward for the future. It is in Arsene’s interest as well that this club will give positive memories to the fans and the people. The boss has brought in the right people at the right time and has had continuous success. That really amazed me, in terms of his football knowledge and what he has brought to this country and this club. It was so instrumental for what followed in the coming years. The people that he hired and the players he’s signed have always made a difference. I was just amazed how a coach could be such a main figure to the club, which needed him to grow as quickly as the club did. There’s now an emphasis on us doing it for him too. We want to give him the send off he deserves: with a cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Per Mertesacker admits the Arsenal squad are in one way responsible for Arsene Wenger’s decision to step down as manager]</b> The message he gave to the team was that we want to win every single game and leave in style. We, as players, gave immediate feedback that we feel the responsibility to fight for him every time we step on the field. We had an atmosphere that ‘we want to do it for you to send you off in the best possible way’. It is not about a single person, this club is built on a lot of people who worked here for a long time and he was one of those. His story is unique so we want to give him the best possible send off because in one way we are responsible for the situation as well.<br /><br />We were surprised, first of all, and then emotional and sad. You can feel that he has got a lot left in him in terms of the power he gave to the team. He has power in himself. He is ready to step up and stand in front of the media every single time we cannot produce a performance</p>

  <p><b>[Former defender Per Mertesacker has played down reports of racial division amongst the German national team]</b> I never heard anything about ‘potatoes’ or ‘kanaken’ during my time in the national team. However I have been called ‘potato’, too. It should be understood that it is just a bit of fun, however. There were separate groups within the team during my time, too. You simply have to be careful that this does not lead to division, like: ‘you are one team, we are the other’.<br /><br />Everything is possible. I am curious as to how the DFB is going to approach the building of a new team. I never experienced racism or discrimination during my time, so I was surprised by Mesut’s allegations and that they were so harsh. Mesut and I played together at Werder Bremen and Arsenal for so many years. There is no other player that I shared so much time with. We were important for each other. I’m sad about what happened. We had a special relationship, no matter how different we are</p>

I was happy about not necessarily playing, just training was enough for me. It’s not right playing these games to have that fear about what’s going on with me. The fact that I actually felt better after saying: ‘I’m going to stop,’ I had less pain.<br /><br />Sometimes you don’t feel like doing sports or don’t feel like doing workouts <b>[where you are]</b> spending eight weeks together and you just don’t see your family. So it <b>[football]</b> has taken some bits and pieces as well - my health at one or two stages where you give absolutely everything and your body is just exhausted and you try to continue but your body says: ‘I’m done.

His farewell was also the players’ fault because we had many chances to get better results. We failed while he backed us all the time. I was the first who felt the need to say something and said I deeply regretted it. It was important for him to see that we had something to say as a team and that we stood by his side<br /><br />No. Not a second too early or too late. When the news of his departure was finally out, the atmosphere changed. It was said what a great man he was, who changed this club extremely. You could not have had more success with this team.

  <p><b>[Reiss Nelson made the best decision in leaving his comfort zone at Arsenal]</b> It was the best decision for him to go there. When you compare the Bundesliga to the Premier League, there are similarities but there are differences. At the moment the Bundesliga suits him, and he went to a club where they are used to bringing up young players, educating young players and giving young players a chance in their first team. He has a young coach who will educate him and give him an insight.<br /><br />Reiss is getting out of the comfort zone he was in at Arsenal, so the loan system should work brilliantly for us. Some Bundesliga clubs are very interesting for us and the way he could make an impact at Hoffenheim was by starting on the bench but then scoring immediately. Through scoring those goals, he gained trust from the coach, from the fans, by learning some German and earning the right to start and make an impact. I think he has done a brilliant job but that all fell into place because he wanted to go.<br /><br />He had a great opportunity but you need to take these opportunities and make sure you learn from those moments. Instead of being a first-team player between the under-23s and the first team, this is something different. It’s difficult to manage and I’m really pleased and glad that it’s worked right now for him. We have other prospects we really need to think about. What’s their best path towards making an impact for our first team? There are different ways, different challenges. Those are individuals. But I feel we are in a good place right now and those situations show us how big an impact a loan can make on a player. We need to select wisely.</p>

  <p><b>[Per Mertesacker believes Unai Emery’s willingness to play youngsters is proof that he is the right man]</b> At the moment we are really happy with him. How he evolves the game and brings something different to the club. Being here I am trying to support him as much as I can with my focus and my years that I’ve had being here. <b>[Under-23s manager]</b> Freddie Ljungberg has the closest link to him because, on a day-by-day basis, he needs to provide players, or not. I am trying to guide it in a way but Unai is open to talking to me at any time. So I can come to his office when I want. He knew before he came that it is required, in a way, that he trusts the youth. That he promotes that at the club. I think that came naturally to him at the club as well. If he sees good talent and trusts it, then he will let them play.<br /><br />With the Europa League, we have the chance this season. On the one hand, we want to reach the Champions League. On the other, we have the chance to promote youngsters, but we are trying to get back to the Champions League, to prepare the youngsters for the highest level. I watch his training sessions and he is open to talking. He is talking about the days where we faced each other or played each other. He coached Valencia and I played for Bremen. These bonds and connections you have as football people are nice. All of a sudden you feel this great connection between him and myself. But we are building because we are in the early stages. He wants to reach Champions League football with the first team, he is very intense and bringing a lot of energy.<br /><br />It is a new chapter and era right now. It is a difficult job so we are trying to support him as much as we can with what he requires. Sometimes that’s good young talent and he is willing to promote them if they are ready. It is our job to give him a headache, make him think ‘where are all these youngsters coming from?’. That’s our job. That’s my job to make it easy for him to see these good young talents and that he can trust them. So the connection is growing and we are just at the start. It is not easy for him with the heritage of being the successor of Arsene Wenger. Being in that position, we have seen other coaches struggle at other clubs, with that scenario so I am trying to do as much as I can to support him. That’s my focus. I am very busy with that.</p>

  <p><b>[Per Mertesacker has made it clear that Arsenal are as concerned with preparing their academy players for life off the pitch]</b> If we can have a doctor in America, that is a success for us as an academy too. That’s how I see it. If we get someone who doesn’t make it in football and has a successful career somewhere else in the world, that’s also a success. I wouldn’t measure it like that <b>[only on who we bring though]</b>. Obviously, everyone looks at whether we bring young footballers into the first team, that’s one of the goals. But I wouldn’t discard someone who is successful in life, that’s big. The hall of fame in the academy should be a wide variety of stories. I am open to winning the FA Youth Cup. I am open to winning the Premier League 2 title and trying to get people winning in life. That’s a huge task working in football and coming up with that broader idea of what success means for us. We have people who want to win the next game but can we have successful youngsters? Can we build them? Can we trust them with relationships? To have real values and contribute anywhere in the world..<br /><br />We are starting step-by-step to pick and choose the right clubs with the right players and we are building some relationships with clubs abroad. Still, we could loan them out here in England. So we are seeking out the opportunities for young players. I think for Smith Rowe that it is really important to see him go on loan for half a year to see him have this great experience in the Bundesliga <b>[at RB Leipzig]</b>. That sits right below the Premier League, in terms of tempo. I think to go from the Under-23s to Germany and then coming back to the Premier League gives a good step between. Leipzig are a team that play with tempo, a lot of pressing and they want to win the ball quickly back. We think that suits him quite well. We see it as a big advantage for our youngsters to have a big step in between, where they will be regular first-team players. Sometimes you get stuck in the U23s, first-team training bubble, where you are with the first team which looks nice but you need the competition. If the U23s competition is not good enough for you, in terms of the tempo, then you need to have a different step in between when you are not quite ready to play regular Premier League football. It’s very individual so not every player will go to Germany. That’s not what I am saying. We need to pick the right clubs at the right time for these youngsters. It is something we are looking into deeper, as other clubs are doing this regularly and more often. We are trying to promote it and it creates more trust and gives them a little bit more time. Rather than forcing them into the first team, we have another step to evaluate these players<br /><br />The more English players go onto another journey that might help the national stage. They might come back. Not everyone is made for the pathway in an English club. Maybe it is somewhere else for the benefit of him. You have to sometimes lose a player for a lot of money, he has not played regularly, but still there’s always that decision to make. Do we think he could make it somewhere else? Do we think he can make it here? You have to weigh up these options, we are not shy to let these players go when it is beneficial for their development. I think it is so beneficial to English and British football when youngsters see different cultures and environments. Then Sancho comes back and plays for England because of that journey because he has learned a lot and used the facilities. I am quite excited about that for English and British football. The heritage of Arsenal, to believe in our academy and to really promote our academy. That’s important and that’s why I am here as well. I wouldn’t waste my time just to know that we are not having successes here at Arsenal. Of course, you are trying to develop these youngsters to be ready for football anywhere in the world at other clubs as well. Our first goal is to put someone in the first team and create that identity with our fan base. That’s really important and that’s what we believe in. So that’s the path we are on right now. It is great that the club believes in the academy so we can promote and develop youngsters who are going to challenge the first team, that’s really the target</p>

City have the big goal to win the Champions League and I don’t think Tottenham will spoil that. I actually believe the final will be Man City vs Barcelona.<br /><br />Liverpool and Klopp have a had a certain journey so far and that journey absolutely calls for success. They’ve had a fantastic season and have kept up with Man City - the best team in England. I count a lot on Liverpool in the Champions League, because in knockout matches they are always able to bring that intensity into their game. Also I am convinced of Klopp’s skills as a motivator. He is able to make the players even more hungry in these matches. In the Premier League I’d rather go with City. Liverpool’s intense style makes it problematic for me to see them fighting for the title until the end<br /><br />I think there could be another surprise, but I expect the Ronaldo factor to be decisive in the end. Still, Juventus were not too experienced for Ajax. Ajax’s calm way of playing can be very dangerous for Juve. Ajax definitely have a chance away from home and Juve know that. Real Madrid’s exit is a good warning. I expect Juve to defend deep, while Ajax lacked some patience in the final third in the first match. They must improve in that area</p>

  <p><b>[Mertesacker backs Arsenal to lift Europa League this season]</b> Definitely. The team is in the midst of the fight for the top four in the league, has the Europa League and has grown throughout these experiences. The first leg was great, but in Naples - the city, the fans, the special atmosphere - it can quickly go in the other direction. We are glad that we did not concede a goal. Nevertheless, the chances for the semi-final are good - and we have to make up for that after last year’s elimination.</p>

  <p><b>[Hoffenheim wonderkid Nelson showing he is ready to star at Arsenal]</b> We are starting step-by-step to pick and choose the right clubs with the right players and we are building some relationships with clubs abroad. It’s quite interesting for Reiss, the journey he’s facing in Germany. He’s describing it as a tough time. Every day in training there’s something he takes on. With a young manager who really believes in him and gives him chances, sometimes he comes off the bench and makes the difference. So, for him, the next step is really to play regularly, playing from the start. That’s his next challenge but at the moment he’s making an impact coming off the bench, he’s getting minutes, he’s learning a new culture, a new language. I think it’s very beneficial to him.</p>

  <p><b>[Mertesacker reveals Germany’s World Cup plan to stop Messi]</b> If Messi has the ball, he is fantastic to watch and difficult to stop. You have to double up on him, triple up on him even, stay with him constantly to block his way to the goal. Never tackle, never go down, we’ve heard it over and over again. You have to try to keep Messi away from the goal and block him with multiple players while being as close to him as possible. He is too quick, too fast, too intense with the ball.<br /><br />You need good communication between the lines - I’d have to say to the number six ‘Sorry, but now you have two opponents’. In Argentina, they have never managed to combine the strengths of their defence and attack. The attack does their thing and the defence does their thing. We’ve <b>[Germany]</b> always managed to do that very well. You just get the feeling Messi never had full control. He won the trophy for the best player but not for the best team. <b>[Not winning the World Cup]</b> is maybe the only thing you can hold against him</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil could have grown into the role Luka Modric has taken on at Real Madrid]</b> Mesut makes Arsenal a better team when he is in top form. What he certainly has to work on is his play when without the ball. European-level teams know exactly how to defend, which positions they need to be in. Mesut is offensively, for me, one of the top players and can make the difference in games. For him, it would have been good to play for many years at a club - more than just five, six years. Then he would have had the chance to grow into the role of Luka Modric. But even a Modric struggles to maintain his level after a top year. It would have been a big challenge for Mesut. But Ronaldo might have stayed with Real because he would always get the best assists <b>[from Ozil]</b>.<br /><br />It’s a very difficult story, because Musti feels incredibly comfortable in England, or abroad in general. I would not recommend him to go back to Germany because he has such great experiences abroad. Whether London, Spain or Italy - he has felt comfortable everywhere. That’s why I think his primary footballing ambitions are overseas. Yes, he was recently criticised in the media, but who was not at Arsenal? I can speak from my own experience. He knows he has to work hard on himself. It is up to him to get out of this situation. I have complete confidence in that</p>

  <p><b>[Per Mertesacker says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have been urged to stick with the side that has allowed them to ‘over-perform’ in the Champions League]</b> It was definitely thanks to the whole team that they reached the final.

Then there was <a href="lucas-moura.html">Lucas Moura</a> scoring a hat-trick <b>[against <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in the semi-finals]</b>. They gave players space for development and they took the next step. Now <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> comes back and the coach has to ask himself what to do.

I would keep the things which have worked out in the last games and change not too much as the players have deserved it.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on whether he would snub <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> in his starting XI]</b> Yes… If I were the coach I would do that. Yes, I think it will be a huge task for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to win against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Because they learnt a lot last year and that often leads to a situation you can capitalise on the next year. So I hope <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> come well prepared. They have to use their chances, especially at the beginning of the game. I think <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> can only win if they have a good start, if they are able to put pressure on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, get an early lead and play using counter-attacks.

To all different areas. That took some time as I said, but the willingness to run, the clarity on how to play with the ball, which players are needed and which would best fit the club. That’s an ideal model, something you look at. Which players have been signed and how they have been integrated into the system. I think he has a very close connection to the players. They know it’s intensive and they can’t take shortcuts with this guy. That does not work. Even if I play I have to go to the training ground the next day and make some runs. It’s not a happy-go-lucky-culture, not a loose culture. He gets the best out of his players.<br /><br />He developed that in the recent years. That’s a culture based on work, combined with his great knowledge of the game. He gained that in the years when he played in Spain and France. There, he gained this appreciation for detail and his extensive football knowledge, not only the culture and the importance of having a hard-working group. It’s about what goals you want to reach on the football pitch. He brought consistency to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. He saw the team can take another step forward, the players can improve again. They’ve massively over-performed for years, especially when you see the budget they have.
