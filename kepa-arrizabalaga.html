It’s an accumulation of things, and I am very glad Chelsea has decided to trust me and to take me in as well.</p>

It is a very important moment. for me and for my career, I am happy that after a long negotiation everything has come to fruition. Since I was little I’ve been an Athletic fan and always will be. Those who are close to me or more know me know that I am a person who likes to analyse everything before making a decision. I have taken my time and I want to thank the club that respected it to make my decision.</p>

  <p><b>[Kepa Arrizabalaga is enjoying life at Chelsea since his £71 million <b>[$93]</b> move from Athletic Club]</b> There are differences with the Spanish football. The player is less protected, inside the box as well. So, the rhythm is high but at he end of the day is football and it is the atmosphere around very nice. I am happy, especially for the victory of the team. It is true it has been tougher than it should have been. It has been hard to get the goal, even though we did have some chances to make it earlier, but we didn’t get the goal. However, I think we did a good game and we control the possession. I am happy to get the three points. I am really happy how the things are going right now. How this experience has begun, the results, my feelings and the team’s ones. It’s still early, the season is long but I am really happy how the things are going. It’s normal that when someone pay that amount of money they talk about your transfer. You have to show your value but I am not focused on my price, I am just trying to do my job. I am really grateful for his confidence to sign me. Obviously he was key for me joining the club. I feel really comfortable on the way he likes to play, I am so happy and grateful.<br /><br />Yes, obviously I follow Athletic, how couldn’t I? I often speak to my team mates and friends who are there. I was back to Bilbao last international break and I will be back again for this one to meet them. I will carry on doing this</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea signing Kepa Arrizabalaga insists he can handle being the world’s most expensive goalkeeper]</b> The Premier League and La Liga are very different. The style of play is different, the person training me is different, everything is different and new. But all in all, so far I feel very happy. I think I’m adapting very well to being in the team, which is the most important thing, and I’m really looking forward to spending a long time in the Premier League with Chelsea. Leaving your environment, and the place where you have grown up, is always going to be difficult. But I felt moving to Chelsea was an important step in my career so that’s why I wanted to do it, but of course I will always be grateful to Athletic Bilbao for all the years I spent with them, and for all they’ve given me<br /><br />I made my senior Spain debut against Costa Rica in 2017. The day I was called up by the national team was very special for me. For any player their debut for the national team is incredibly important. It gives you confidence and you feel good about the trust being deposited in you. It’s also rewarding and tells you that all the work you’ve done to get to that point was worth it</p>

  <p><b>[Kepa Arrizabalaga has come out to explain his on-pitch row with Maurizio Sarri]</b> I don’t know how it went out, it is not the best image. I have spoken with the boss. I think it was misunderstood. I understand that on television, on social media, they’re talking about this but I am here to explain it, to say that it wasn’t my intention to go against the manager. We have spoken now, and I was only trying to say I’m fine. He thought I wasn’t fine. It was in tense moments, with a lot happening. Of course I did <b>[see my number go up on the digital board]</b>. But because of that, it was until the medics had got back to the bench to explain I was fine, that I could continue. It wasn’t that I was refusing to be substituted, it was a way of trying to tell the bench that I was fine.<br /><br />I think it was just misunderstood, and unfortunate, because now people are talking about this … I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know what to say, other than to say it was not my intention in any moment <b>[top refuse]</b>. It has to be understood, too, that these were the last few minutes of a final, and I didn’t realise the reactions. It was only when I say they were going to change, I tried to say I was fine. It was the final minute, with a lot going on. I know the image it’s given, but I never intended to refuse to go off. It was only to say I was fine. I don’t think it has to be the major act of this final. I understand we played a good level against one of the best teams in the world. We were close to winning, obviously we’re sad that we didn’t, and I think the team needs to continue playing like this, because today we’ve shown we can compete against the best teams. Among the negatives, we have to take the positives.<br /><br />Well, I think we competed well, against a great team, we were close, the luck of the penalties was we couldn’t win and I think the team competed well</p>

I was right behind Willy and supported him and the team as much as I could. Of course, that was the only thing I could do. It was something I did in the heat of the moment. It’s something I am not very proud of. It was a difficult moment which I’ve learned from and I’m still learning from. Now it’s time for me to look forward. I said I was sorry. Football goes on. We all make mistakes<br /><br />It wasn’t until I looked back for the first time at the images that I realised. I saw it from a different perspective. Until that point, it was like I was in a bubble and wasn’t conscious of what was going on. I started to see it all when I arrived home for the first time and saw the video. That was the first time I realised what happened. I’ve learned a lesson and the next time it will be different<br /><br /><b>[Chelsea are battling for a top-four place]</b> That is our target. To finish in the top four, reach the Europa League final and win a trophy. We know it’s not easy but that would be a good first season.</p>
