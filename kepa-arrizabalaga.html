  <p><b>[Kepa Arrizabalaga says <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> is among the top five players in the world and the very best in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> He can do everything. <b>[He can]</b> mark, assist, play as a false nine, play on the left, on the right, he is very fast, powerful, great in one-on-ones, plays well coming from deep. He is, for me, the best player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether he is as good as the five-time Ballon d’Or winners]</b> I could not say, but he is close. I put him among the five best in the world. He is a great player, and above all a great person. He is a guy that always boosts the dressing room. He’s fun, quiet, and at 28 he’s in a great personal and sporting situation, and it shows in the way he is playing</p>

We have all been called up by <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> and we all want to play. We train hard and then it is the coach who decides. My relationship with De Gea is very good, we have worked well together. In addition to competing, we usually talk on the phone. We have a fluid relationship.<br /><br />Sweden and the Faroe Islands have a similar profile. We assume that Sweden is going to be more difficult, but the conditions that we are going to find <b>[in the Faroe Islands]</b>, with artificial turf, will hinder the game. We have two important matches that may not come at the best time, but our goal is to reach Euro 2020. The team is confident and we will do the best we can<br /><br /><b>[Kepa refused to be substituted during the Wembley showpiece, and the former Athletic Bilbao man admitted it was a decision he regretted]</b> It has been several months now. It’s true, that was a bad week for me. Of course it was a day I’m not proud of. I said sorry to him and from then on our relationship has been very good, like it was before. I’ve kept his confidence, we’ve accomplished our targets and I think our season was very positive. It has been a step forward in my career in every sense <b>[moving to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b>. I’ve had a lot of games, we accomplished our targets for the season and now, looking backwards, I think it has been a positive year</p>

I’m happy to be playing, to help the team, and finish this season in the best possible way. I’m going to keep working as I’ve done to now, trying to do as best as possible with my club, and hopefully, keeping the trust of the national team coach. At the end, we all want to play. Pau Lopez, David De Gea and I train to play, and after all, it’s a coach decision. It’s his responsibility</p>

Whoever plays will do very well. Of course I understand that David is sad, we all train to play and then it is the decision of the coach, and it is up to you to respond well. We are always surrounded by such controversies. But we must take it naturally. I’m happy to play, to help the team and to finish the season in the best way possible. The season has been very long, but before we left we had these two very important commitments. We are happy to finish in the best way possible.<br /><br /><b>[The <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> man was keen to stress that his inclusion in the side over De Gea has not caused any strain between the two men]</b> I have a great relationship with David. We train a lot of the time together apart from the team, as well with Pau Lopez, because we are keepers. We have a relationship from many years ago and we don’t need to say anything to each other to help each other<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he feels like Spain’s number one keeper]</b> I just felt tonight because I am not feeling the main goalkeeper now.

I don’t know when or how or what, but playing at Athletic obviously I’d like that. I have great memories<br /><br />For several months my grandma saw more of me in the newspapers than in the flesh. There was a lot of talk about me. I was also injured for a while so it wasn’t a good moment for me. My contract was due to expire and from January onwards I was able to start talking to other clubs. I couldn’t see myself joining <b>[another]</b> club. I ended up renewing my contract with the idea of staying, but six months later I left. That was the only contraction</p>

All players want to be in the starting XI. I am obviously confident and want to help the team. If I am one of the eleven chosen, my goal is to win a match and that will not be easy against Norway. I feel good and I’m confident. It is true that I barely participated at the World Cup and now I’m able to help the team more<br /><br /><b>[Both players have staked a claim to start regularly and Kepa says rotation is to be expected]</b> Whenever there is a debate over a position for the national team, it is a good thing - the beneficiary is the team. Since the policy of rotating in the goal has become common, you have to trust yourself. All these comments in the press, I don’t get involved in that, we simply have to do our talking on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[Kepa left Spanish side Athletic Bilbao for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in August 2018, in the process becoming the most expensive goalkeeper in world football]</b> I have matured as a person and as a goalkeeper. I have become accustomed to playing in a different way. I’m now seeing more physical opponents, also of great quality, and I keep developing because I’m young</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> Goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga talks about thing that give biggest impression on him since coming to west London]</b> What I’ve found in this country is that great value is placed on keeping a clean sheet. In Spain, things are valued differently than here - they calculate how many goals you concede over the course of the whole season and judge goalkeepers on that, but in the UK they count how many clean sheets you had during the season. It’s very valuable for us as a team and everyone seems to appreciate that<br /><br /><b>[Kepa Arrizabalaga reveals he rarely feels pressure or nerves ahead of a match]</b> I’m not really a person that is prone to anxiety, or feeling nervous. I generally don’t feel that way before a game. What I always think is, at the end of the day, it’s football - that’s what it is - and football is what we do, it’s what we like, and it’s what we enjoy. Of course, when there are really important games there is a bit more tension, a bit more adrenaline, but I wouldn’t call it nervousness</p>

  <p><b>[Kepa Arrizabalaga has outlined his ambitions to win everything with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> The relationship with Frank is very good. He has shown me confidence from the first moment. He must make decisions, but I feel I have his confidence, both his and that of the whole club. We all like to play in every game. It is true that, in the last 10 years, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is the English team that has won the most titles, and I think we should have that ambition. In fact, I came here for that and in the first season, we already achieved the Europa League. We have a young team. Then came the penalty of not signing players (the transfer ban) but you have to keep fighting for titles. I want to win everything with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and with the national team.<br /><br />We play 50 or 60 games a year and it is difficult to stay on the same level. The important thing is to be very clear about the objective, to work and put everything into improving. There may be obstacles along the way, but when you have a clear objective, it is easier. The only thing that can be done, in these cases, is to take it professionally, respectfully and work harder to turn it around<br /><br /><b>[No firm dates for the resumption of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football]</b> It is difficult to talk about dates, the players cannot control that. In Germany, it is seen that the teams are already training together; in France, it has been suspended. We are waiting and it will be decided with the health of everyone in mind.

  <p><b>[Kepa Arrizabalaga confident <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will challenge for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title in the future]</b> Let’s hope we are talking in a year’s time and that we are candidates to challenge those two teams (Liverpool and Manchester City). We have a great squad and we have a great manager. We can’t deny the gap, in points, between us and the top two, but I’m confident we can close that gap next season. We know we need to improve, but it is a hope we all have. There’s a confidence that it is possible<br /><br />The manager is there to choose what he considers the best XI. Whenever you are left out of the side, you take it in the spirit it is intended. You put it down to experience, a fresh experience in your life, and you just keep working hard. I’m ambitious and I’ve always had the attitude that through hard work and training hard you are ready for the next challenge. I’m young, I’m lucky enough to be playing for a fantastic club. I’m part of the national set up with Spain as well. The team (Chelsea) have been having a good feeling about ourselves. There’s a good spirit about how we’ve been playing. And individually I feel good. I want to help the team achieve its targets. We feel strong mentally and very fit physically, and we hope for an end of season that is great, positive and can be celebrated. We were one of the first teams because <b>[<a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a>]</b> had a positive test. It all happened very suddenly. I didn’t want to put members of my family at risk by travelling. I just took things step by step. I paid close attention to the news. I saw it as an opportunity to do stuff I never normally have time for. Tidying the house and doing some cooking</p>
