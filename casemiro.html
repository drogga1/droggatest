  <p><b>[Casemiro on winning U20 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup in Colombia]</b> I gained a lot of experience playing for the youth sides of the Brazilian team. I developed a lot as a professional and as a person. That title was very important for my career and for that whole generation<br /><br /><b>[Casemiro on quarterfinals of the Champions League, Porto losing 7-4 on aggregate to Bayern Munich]</b> All defeats have a bitter aftertaste. Nobody likes losing. But we have a calm conscience, because our team did not lack desire to win. We tried to do our best. It was a positive season, but it lacked a title as a crowning achievement of our work. I managed to have a sequence of games and I could develop my football even more. It was a very positive and productive season for me, both from a tactical and technical point of view<br /><br /><b>[Casemiro on his approach to being part of the Selecao]</b> A player has to approve every minute at the Brazilian team and always do the best he can do, be it in training or during games<br /><br /><b>[Casemiro on playing a role for Brazil during the Copa America]</b> The Copa America is one of the most traditional tournaments in the world, with a very big representative value. We have to think in terms of doing our best in each game with the motivation of winning the matches and fighting for the title. I am with my head with the Selecao, thinking about having a good performance at the Copa America<br /><br /><b>[Casemiro on unforgiving Brazil 7-1 defeat at the World Cup against Germany]</b> The shirt of the Brazilian team has always been respected the world over. That defeat won’t change that. The best way forward is to work a lot, because work gets you good results, wins and titles. I think that Brazil is on the right track to have a good Copa America<br /><br /><b>[Casemiro on <a href="dunga.html">Dunga</a> and Brazil the Copa America in 2007]</b> <a href="dunga.html">Dunga</a> formed a very strong team and won the title. Robinho played very well<br /><br /><b>[Casemiro on Copa America 2015]</b> Colombia had an excellent campaign at the World Cup. Venezuela have grown year by year and Peru always present quality football</p>

If the kid is OK, I’ll tell you, it’s almost impossible to stop him. He is a player of extreme quality, already demonstrated for all, already demonstrated in the Brazilian squad. But, of course, we have other great players. We have great players. If Neymar were here, it would be better for us and it would help a lot more, but he isn’t and we have to overcome his absence, overcome this difficulty. We have created a game identity, but if he were here it would be much better.<br /><br /><b>[Casemiro, who opened the scoring in that win in Sao Paulo, said Brazil needed to avoid changing their approach in the final]</b> You have to know the time to suffer, you have to know the time to attack, you have to know the time to defend. Above all, we are creating a very solid team at the back. When I say solid back, it’s not just the defenders, everyone is committed. That’s it, don’t lose our characteristics. We don’t have to do anything different from what we’re doing, not only in relation to the last matches, but for the last two, three years. We built a good average of wins, few losses. We don’t have to do anything different. We have to play our football. We know there is a great team as an opponent, but it is our football.</p>

And then when he asked about strikers, I saw about 40 people raise their hands and I thought: ‘I’m not a striker, there’s a lot of competition’. The same thing happened with midfielders and I thought the same thing. Then the coach said: ‘Who is a defensive midfielder?’ About seven or eight hands went up and I said: ‘I’m a defensive midfielder’.

  <p><b>[Casemiro confident <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> season will resume]</b> It’s a really significant step, not just for football but for society too, to show people that it is possible. It’s not just about playing football, it’s about people being out of their houses. I think that if we comply with the measures that we have to follow, we too are going to be able to do it.<br /><br />The work at home was important and we did the things that the club and the coaching staff passed on to us. The guys are working well and it shows now that we’re back that players have worked at home. The physical level has been maintained and you can see that on the <b>[training]</b> pitch<br /><br />I have tried to help people as much as possible because of the difficult time we are going through. Not only me, the other players and the club too, that is the most important thing. It’s also important to put smiles on people’s faces in times as difficult as these</p>

  <p><b>[Benzema’s backheel assist is one of the plays of this season]</b> What Karim did, for me is normal. We all know that the qualities he has aren’t of a number nine, but of a number 10. I know him, I know how he plays and the quality he possesses. I asked for the ball in space, and his backheel pass was incredible. It’s Karim’s goal. It’s the backheel pass of a number 10 and you have to congratulate him</p>
