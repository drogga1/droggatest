  <p><b>[Casemiro on winning U20 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup in Colombia]</b> I gained a lot of experience playing for the youth sides of the Brazilian team.

Nobody likes losing. But we have a calm conscience, because our team did not lack desire to win. We tried to do our best. It was a positive season, but it lacked a title as a crowning achievement of our work. I managed to have a sequence of games and I could develop my football even more. It was a very positive and productive season for me, both from a tactical and technical point of view<br /><br /><b>[Casemiro on his approach to being part of the Selecao]</b> A player has to approve every minute at the Brazilian team and always do the best he can do, be it in training or during games<br /><br /><b>[Casemiro on playing a role for Brazil during the Copa America]</b> The Copa America is one of the most traditional tournaments in the world, with a very big representative value. We have to think in terms of doing our best in each game with the motivation of winning the matches and fighting for the title. I am with my head with the Selecao, thinking about having a good performance at the Copa America<br /><br /><b>[Casemiro on unforgiving Brazil 7-1 defeat at the World Cup against Germany]</b> The shirt of the Brazilian team has always been respected the world over. That defeat won’t change that. The best way forward is to work a lot, because work gets you good results, wins and titles. I think that Brazil is on the right track to have a good Copa America<br /><br /><b>[Casemiro on <a href="dunga.html">Dunga</a> and Brazil the Copa America in 2007]</b> <a href="dunga.html">Dunga</a> formed a very strong team and won the title. Robinho played very well<br /><br /><b>[Casemiro on Copa America 2015]</b> Colombia had an excellent campaign at the World Cup.

But they are both very good players, and very good players are always welcome at Real Madrid.<br /><br />A world-class player at his level can play in any team. If he comes to Madrid he would be welcomed very well - we know he is a great player. For sure he is now thinking about his next Champions League game, that is the type of person he is. We must respect Manchester United also<br /><br /><b>[Neymar]</b> is a great player, and it would be great if he came here. But this is a question for the president, and for Neymar himself.

But a great player like him would be an automatic pick in any team<br /><br />Of course not. Those who have failed this year are the same as those who won three Champions Leagues in a row.

We don’t have to do anything different from what we’re doing, not only in relation to the last matches, but for the last two, three years. We built a good average of wins, few losses.

When I returned, I was a completely different player<br /><br />When I arrived, I was 12 or 13, and there were 300 players in the trials, with just 50 players chosen. I introduced myself as a striker. And then I remember the coach asked who played as a goalkeeper - three hands were raised. And then when he asked about strikers, I saw about 40 people raise their hands and I thought: ‘I’m not a striker, there’s a lot of competition’. The same thing happened with midfielders and I thought the same thing. Then the coach said: ‘Who is a defensive midfielder?’ About seven or eight hands went up and I said: ‘I’m a defensive midfielder’. The coach called me and said: ‘You’re not a defensive midfielder, you’re here as a striker,’ but I insisted that I was and that’s where it all began</p>

You enjoy football just as much in every position, my goal is to steal the ball.

  <p><b>[The home side threw away a 1-0 lead in their 2-1 defeat at the Bernabeu]</b> The explanation is obvious. We did 75 minutes really well and then we didn’t have any intensity, we lost control of the game, we sat back and they are a great rival, they attacked twice and scored. There’s no excuse. At the weekend we’ve got a tough game against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. We need to start thinking about that<br /><br /><b>[On the second leg]</b> If there’s one team capable to turning this around it’s <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. But I think what’s important is that we played really well for 75 minutes, against a great side, and for 15 minutes we didn’t do what we had to. And they came back to win. It’s not over, but there’s a lot of work ahead</p>

Many times, when it’s 50-50, he looks for Karim. If Karim is in a better position, of course he should pass. But if it’s 50-50 he has to go for goal. After the goal, he told me that he had Casemiro in his said saying ‘Shoot! Shoot!</p>

  <p><b>[Casemiro confident <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> season will resume]</b> It’s a really significant step, not just for football but for society too, to show people that it is possible. It’s not just about playing football, it’s about people being out of their houses. I think that if we comply with the measures that we have to follow, we too are going to be able to do it.<br /><br />The work at home was important and we did the things that the club and the coaching staff passed on to us. The guys are working well and it shows now that we’re back that players have worked at home. The physical level has been maintained and you can see that on the <b>[training]</b> pitch<br /><br />I have tried to help people as much as possible because of the difficult time we are going through. Not only me, the other players and the club too, that is the most important thing. It’s also important to put smiles on people’s faces in times as difficult as these</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a>’s backheel assist is one of the plays of this season]</b> What Karim did, for me is normal. We all know that the qualities he has aren’t of a number nine, but of a number 10. I know him, I know how he plays and the quality he possesses. I asked for the ball in space, and his backheel pass was incredible. It’s Karim’s goal. It’s the backheel pass of a number 10 and you have to congratulate him</p>
