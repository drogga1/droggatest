<blockquote>
  <p>[Bayern Munich turned down €24m Neymar in 2010, claims agent Predrag Racki] It was the January transfer window in 2010 when Danny Budimir from Golden Goal Sports &amp; Marketing agency in Chicago made contact with Neymar’s agent Wagner Ribeiro. And at the same time, with help of my friend Giovanni Trapattoni, I arranged a meeting with Bayern’s director for football Christian Nerlinger. At the time Neymar was 17 and you could tell he was top class, great technique, great skills … he was only far thinner than he is today.<br /><br />I met Nerlinger in Munich after talking to him twice over the phone. He told me they were aware who Neymar is, one of biggest talents in the world, but got stuck with the price, which was €18m, with bonuses up to €24m. Nerlinger told me they will keep following him but that Bayern is not willing to give that much money for a player who is not 18 yet.</p>
