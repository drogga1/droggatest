  <p><b>[New <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> signing Andrej Kramaric enjoys a joke at the expense of his fellow Croatian, who flopped at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>]</b> I hope to score at least one goal and be better than Bosko Balaban!</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester will never repeat last season]</b> Hoffenheim compared to my former team Leicester? There are some similarirtes, but it is different in England, Leicester was trashing everyone from start until finish, they will hardly ever repeat that season.<br /><br />It is not simple to be only undeafeted team in the top five leagues. There are a lot of candidates for Champions League and Europa League spots: Bayern, us, <b>[RB]</b> Leipzig, <b>[Borussia]</b> Dortmund, Eintracht <b>[Frankfurt]</b>, Hertha <b>[Berlin]</b> and Koln! So it will be very interesting until the end<br /><br />Hoffenheim play well but we are only thinking about next match, and it is Leipzig. I can’t say Leipzig thrilled me with their performances so far, but they play very good, have a young team, full of energy and are biggest surprise in Europe</p>

  <p><b>[Andrej Kramaric says he is in no rush to architect a move from Hoffenheim to Bayern Munich]</b> xxI saw what the media have said <b>[about Bayern links]</b> but take it easy, there is plenty of time. My priority is the World Cup now. There is plenty of time to discuss a potential transfer. I’m very happy and enjoy being here, I’ve always loved the Bundesliga and coming to Hoffenheim was a great move. This is a perfectly organised club. The whole team had dinner together yesterday and now we are free for a holiday. We deserved it after the great season we’ve had. I have 11 days until Croatia start training camp for the World Cup<br /><br />I’m satisfied with my goals and assists this season. Last season I scored 15 goals but this season I’ve also played some matches as a midfielder. This was a very, very good season</p>
