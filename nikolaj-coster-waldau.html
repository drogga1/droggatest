  <p><b>[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is a passionate supporter of the Peacocks]</b> My friend Joe is to blame. Joe was dating my sister when I was 17. We became friends and he took me to <a href="leeds-united.html">Elland Road</a>, and I thought it was fantastic. They had some good years, and then it all went pear-shaped. But now it’s good. We’ve had a great start to the season</p>
