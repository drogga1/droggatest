  <p><b>[Former Argentina international Lucas Biglia says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> can make 2022 World Cup his Last Dance]</b> I finished The Last Dance the other day, it was excellent. It got me thinking that in a few years, hopefully we will be able to watch something similar with our own phenomenon <b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b>. <b>[We could]</b> learn a mountain of things about his day-to-day. Because you see him train, you see him play but so many things happen on a day-to-day basis that you don’t know about, as we see <b>[with Jordan]</b> in the series. The scene that I would like to see in the future is the one when Jordan is hugging the <b>[NBA]</b> trophy and crying. I would like to see that with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and the World Cup. That I would like to see. I know what it would mean for him and for the Argentine people<br /><br /><b>[Comparisons between the respective careers of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and Jordan]</b> He <b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b> always puts himself at your level. Not just because of his humility, but to make you feel comfortable. He looks to build a relationship with his teammates by relating to them. That’s what makes him great. There are no words to describe him as a player. As a person, he is 10, 100 times better<br /><br />The good memories are saved, of course, but the bad ones will always remain, too. Why does a person have to suffer so much? In the last World Cup, to see how the elimination hit him, that’s when you ask yourself why? That stayed with me. Not just on the pitch, but off it. It hurts me to see him suffer so much and makes me ask myself why he has to suffer in that way. I pray to God that we can see him at the next World Cup in two years’ time</p>
