  <p>[V Soundararajan paid homage to Bengaluru FC and stated that his team was relishing the chance to play them] Now, BFC is one of the best sides and have experienced Indian internationals. It’s a golden chance for us to test ourselves against one of the best sides. They are well organised. But we are bottom and we need to go all out. It is an incentive to go and beat the best. So we will try and do that.</p>

  <p>[Chennai City’s Soundararajan - ‘Haroon Amiri refused to play for the team as a substitute’] I don’t have a replacement for the striker position. In the last match against DSK, Amiri played very good and gave us the maximum level. But we did not have good substitutions, especially Raegan who has not played well of late. But today I wanted to give Raegan a chance and wanted to bring Amiri on later. But unfortunately, he was expecting to play in the main eleven and he doesn’t want to play as a substitute. He refused to play. He did not want to do the warm up<br /><br />I thought it would be useful if Amiri came as a substitute as he is better than Raegan and would have an impact. If I start Amiri and then bring Raegan on, he would not have played up to the mark and we wouldn’t have a good substitution. We were playing a well-organised team in Bengaluru. So I changed my strategy<br /><br />After I declared my team, he was not happy and I said it depends on him [whether to play or not]. I have not found any mistakes with Amiri but he wants to play only in the main eleven. According to my strategy, it was not possible. Once we declared the final team, he went out of the room. It is not a good manner to have. After that, we did not want to talk to him much. But he felt a bit bad after the game and we talked to him<br /><br />I told him the substitute role was very important. If he had come on, it would have been useful for us but he refused to do warmups. Even though we are not against him but he thought so<br /><br />[Soundararajan said that he did not choose Raegan Albarnas over Amiri because of any pressure from the management to play local players and it was purely a tactical decision] There was no pressure from the management. I did not want to start a valuable player and then bring him off for Raegan. This way, a valuable player like Amiri would have been there at the end of the game. I thought Amiri would have been our strongest substitution. But he is not able to understand the situation</p>

  <p>[The home team coach Soundararajan sounded upbeat and said he was eagerly anticipating playing East Bengal] Compared to us, they (East Bengal] are a well organised and better side. So, we are eagerly waiting for a chance to play them. We will draw inspiration from Bengaluru result. It was a morale boost for us and will help us on Sunday.<br /><br />We had a moral support while playing in Chennai. With the relatives and friends of the players coming, it was a conducive environment for us to play football</p>
