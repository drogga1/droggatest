  <p><b>[Rickie Lambert has penned a farewell letter to Southampton fans for helping his to realise a ‘lifelong ambition’ of returning to his boyhood club Liverpool]</b> What can I say? Southampton has been my life for the past five years, in which we have achieved all of our dreams and more. First I have to thank Markus Liebherr for saving Southampton then <a href="alan-pardew.html">Alan Pardew</a> for bringing me to the club. Thank you to all the staff involved in making me the player I am today. Without your knowledge and commitment I would not be here right now at a World Cup with England. Thank you to all the players, past and present, who I have had nothing but good times and success with driven by our club captain, Kelvin Davis. I love every last one of you<br /><br />Thank you to the managers I have worked with - Alan <b>[Pardew]</b>, Nigel <b>[Adkins]</b> and Mauricio <b>[<a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>]</b> - and their teams for helping me and Southampton step up and adapt to every challenge that has come our way the past five years. When I grew up there was only one club I loved. I can honestly say now I have two clubs which will always be in my heart and that is thanks to the Saints fans. The people who support this club have been nothing short of amazing towards me and, when I look back in years to come, it will be the relationship I had with the fans here which will stand out the most. Southampton have allowed me to realise a lifelong ambition by joining <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool FC</a> and taking my family home. The five-year plan when I arrived was to get this club from League 1 to the top half of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Against all the odds we have achieved that. Now, under Katharina Liebherr’s leadership, the club has the chance for new plan, a new chapter, and I wish them all the success in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and England striker Lambert retires]</b> I feel lucky to have been involved in this sport for as long as I have. I have had some ups and downs in my career but to have represented clubs like Southampton, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and playing for my country in a World Cup were beyond my wildest dreams. Playing and scoring for England is probably my proudest professional moment and I will look back at every aspect of how I got there with fond memories. I would like to thank the fans of all of the clubs I played for but especially at Southampton where I enjoyed my best years as a footballer and had a special relationship with everyone connected to the club. Thank you to all the players I have played with and managers I have played for throughout my career, it was an honour to work with you all</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Liverpool man Lambert reveals he fell out of love with football after Reds switch]</b> I was getting well paid but I never started playing football for the money. And when I decided to go to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> I sacrificed a regular first-team place and that was when I started to fall out of love with it. I never should have accepted being on the bench, even though <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> had made it clear to me I would be back-up for Suarez and <a href="daniel-sturridge.html">Sturridge</a>. I was never as quick or as technically good as the best players, but in my own head, when it came to actually playing, I could convince myself I was the best. But when I joined up with England I felt lucky to be there, and it was the same at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. And when I look back now I realise I lost something mentally as a player by allowing that to happen</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah should stay and be a hero at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> after being backed to beat Kevin De Bruyne to the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> Player of the Year award by Rickie Lambert]</b> Without a doubt <b>[Salah should win the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> Player of the Year award]</b>. Two months ago, I think De Bruyne and him were level. Let’s be honest that Salah has gone ahead, especially with the amount of goals and the level that he is playing at. De Bruyne has had a little dip as well. I would be very surprised if he doesn’t get it. I would be very, very surprised. Salah is a superstar. I just hope that obviously <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> keep hold of Salah. I think he can be a hero in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I think the relationship that he has with the fans, he can’t get anywhere else. To see <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> doing so well at the minute, it is good to see. Some of the football they are playing at the moment is the best in Europe<br /><br /><b>[The ex-striker has started his coaching badges but he says he has not yet got plans to return to any of his former clubs]</b> I don’t know, it is too early to say. I would not like to put any pressure on myself because I am very chilled out at the minute. I don’t know what I am going to do, I am just going to see how it goes</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Henderson is stronger for having faced the challenge of succeeding <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain, says Rickie Lambert, with the Reds skipper considered to be a great professional]</b> I’ve always been a big admirer of Jordan. When I first saw him - technically superb, mentally superb and physically superb. It was always going to be a little bit difficult taking over the reins from <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Stevie G</a>. I thought he handled it brilliantly; he just kept his head down, came through it better, stronger and more determined. To see him lift the European Cup made me a little bit emotional. Seeing Adz <b>[Adam Lallana]</b> go over and hug him, it was a bit emotional because I know where he’s been. I was quite close to <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> and obviously Adz when I was here. To see them two like that and especially <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> lifting the trophy was unbelievable</p>

  <p><b>[The standards currently being set by <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> leaders <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are unbelievable, says Rickie Lambert, with the quality bar having been raised to never before seen heights]</b> It’s unbelievable what’s happening. I can’t believe the levels they’re getting to, I’ve never seen it before. To see the Reds doing it this year has been unbelievable. The city is buzzing. My household is buzzing. It has been brilliant to see. A few of the lads who were there in my time are still there and to see them doing so well, it’s absolutely superb. I’m made up for them. The work-rate they are going through is incredible. I cannot believe the levels they are getting to; I know what it’s like to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and to see any team get to those levels, I’ve never seen it before. I’m made up<br /><br /><b>[Klopp is considered to have <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> playing in his own image, with the expectations of a demanding German tactician being met in some style]</b> It’s the belief installed through <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>, it’s the rules and standards that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has put in that the players have taken on board and probably raised it even more with the characters he has been able to bring in. There are a few managers within the team who push the standards on or don’t let the standards drop. And all the players are on form. The camaraderie between them is spot on. When everything like that comes together you see something unbelievable - and that’s what we’re seeing right now. I’ve been in good teams where the camaraderie is well and it helps, you stay to the standards. But to see these standards getting hit by these lads is incredible</p>

  <p><b>[Rickie Lambert has labelled <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a>’s training habits a disgrace, while admitting his frustration that the Italian started ahead of him at Liverpool]</b> It was great. I returned to my home city as a different person than when I left. I was a lot more professional of course. And it went okay at first, I scored a couple and was quite happy. But I could tell that the players were all shocked at losing <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>, and how much of their game revolved around him. I was never going to replace someone like that, was I? Going in after him was hard, very hard. And then <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> brought in <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a> and put him in ahead of me, and it done my head in to be honest. I couldn’t understand<br /><br />The way he used to train was a disgrace. Off the training pitch he’s quite infectious, a lovely lad. But his persona on the training pitch is not good. When he played he did try, and I have come across players with that attitude before, but they are usually good enough to get away with it, but he wasn’t. I just didn’t understand how Rodgers was letting him get away with it, and picking him ahead of me. It affected me directly, but it had a negative impact on the team<br /><br />If I am being honest I know I didn’t do good enough at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I wasn’t ruthless enough with the chances I was given, and it wasn’t a good time. And pretty early on Rodgers tried to get rid of me to Crystal Palace where <b>[Alan]</b> <a href="alan-pardew.html">Pardew</a> was, so I knew I wasn’t ever going to be top priority. I said no immediately, why would I leave a club like Southampton after several years to come to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and leave after several weeks to go to Palace? After that I was in shock, and I didn’t get selected for about three months I think. I didn’t come off the bench, I didn’t touch a ball the whole time. But it was amazing to join an amazing club, and despite all that Rodgers was actually a brilliant manager, so it was all set up for me to succeed, but I was devastated not to be able to maximise my stay. I am disappointed, but I am grateful I was ever able to put on the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> shirt. I will be proud of that until the day I die</p>
