  <p><b>[Paul Pogba remains a match-winner]</b> When I was out ill I worked for six months with the reserves with Warren Joyce, and that’s what we did. We gave him a free role. We said to him, go and play, get on the ball and make things happen. Obviously he worked hard as well, that was asked of him. But we didn’t play him as a central midfielder, somebody who was controlling the game, we played him higher up the pitch as a number ten, he could go left, he could go right. We let him be a free spirit and he was a match-winner. He could win games, he could create chances and he loved getting on the ball and trying things, but at least he was doing in the attacking third. So hopefully we see that Paul Pogba now, but he has got the ability of being a box-to-box midfielder, he’s matured now and I’ve seen him do it for France, so there’s no reason why he can’t do it for Man United.</p>

  <p><b>[Fletcher says I looked like I’d been bitten by Mike Tyson!]</b> My ear looks like I’ve been bitten by Mike Tyson! But I’ll be all right for Sunday. My ear was hanging off a little bit, so it definitely needed to be bandaged up or it would have been flapping around. I got a few stitches but it will heal up and should be all right for. I signalled to my kids in the stand at the end making sure they knew I was OK. When you see your dad go off with blood, you might be worried. I needed three or four stitches and some glueSunday.<br /><br /><b>[A win over Slovenia will see Scotland secure second place in their World Cup qualifying group and, with a play-off place up for grabs, Fletcher says the team are confident of getting the job done]</b> Beating Slovakia was a massive boost and puts us in a great position but we still have a job to do in Slovenia. There’s a feel-good factor about the country at the moment but we’ve still got one game to go and even after that there is still the play-offs. There are still a lot of challenges ahead of us and what we want to achieve. If we could reach the play-offs that would be great but it is all about getting to the tournament in Russia. We still have a number of games to get to Russia and Slovakia was a small step towards getting there<br /><br />It will be tough but this team believe we can go and win the game, and that’s the biggest thing. Momentum is a good thing in football and it is with us now. Once you score a couple of late goals you start to believe in yourselves as a team, and that is showing</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba was not considered disciplined enough to play central midfield as a teenager]</b> The first time I spent out with my illness I did a spell coaching the reserve team when it included Pogba, <b>[Jesse]</b> Lingard, <b>[Ravel]</b> Morrison and we played him higher up the pitch in attacking areas. We felt like he was the one who would win us game, coupled with the fact he was ill-disciplined in the middle of the park. It goes back to a famous game when we felt like he left off the back of against Blackburn. Paul was on the bench and the boss picked Park Ji-Sung and Phil Jones in midfield. We didn’t think he was disciplined enough for the reserve team, never mind the first team at that time.<br /><br /><b>[Fletcher still believes Pogba has a lot to offer going forward]</b> I like to see him in the final third and creating things. He played for Juventus <b>[on the left]</b> and I spoke before about his connection with <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial. Pogba can easily drift out wide. He can also get in the box, he’s a big lad. I’d love to see him with a bit more freedom to express himself</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Fletcher says he told West Brom to sign Virgil van Dijk in 2015]</b> With my Scottish connections, I watched him play for Celtic. We <b>[West Brom]</b> were looking at centre-backs after the first summer we’ve been there, and I recommended Johnny Evans who we managed to get, which was fantastic. And I also said to go and get Van Dijk. I think it was before he went to Southampton for I think it was £10 or £11 million, and obviously West Brom felt it was maybe a bit too much. They were umming and ahhing about £6 million for Johnny Evans. So you can maybe see the dilemma. There wasn’t much money. I don’t think you’d call them Tony Pulis centre-halfs though, Johnny Evans and Van Dijk!<br /><br />He’s made a massive difference to Liverpool. He’s a monster. He’s so big and powerful. He cruises through games. He’s top class</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United were worried Wayne Rooney would be snapped up by another club]</b> Wayne was fantastic. We were two of the youngest in the dressing room and we built up a good relationship very early. There were a lot of experienced winners in the dressing room, and me and Wayne were close in age with similar backgrounds and we just got on and clicked. You could tell Wayne was going to go on and be a Manchester United great. The only worry was would a Real Madrid or someone like that come in for him, because that was quite possible. But there was no doubt that he was going to go on and win everything, go on and be club captain and end up England and Manchester United’s leading goalscorer - what an achievement<br /><br />I don’t think he gets the appreciation he deserves. Still, people don’t realise how good Wayne Rooney was, and always was, at Manchester United. And again, he was a team player. He sacrificed himself at times for the good of the team</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo was desperate to become the world’s best player during his time at Manchester United]</b> He had a mindset that he was going to be the best player in the world from the day when he came into the club. He took training to another level. At first, people loved the desire but he did get stick for it with people saying: ‘It’s easier said than done’. But people respected it and liked that mentality of wanting to be the best.<br /><br />There were times when he was putting ankle weights on for training and doing fast feet. The lads were laughing at him but he didn’t care and it didn’t deter him. Ultimately people respected it. The lads saw it as a bit of banter but deep down they respect that work rate, that desire and that sheer determination to be the best player in the world, and he went on to achieve it</p>

When he’s not there they look questionable and that’s the difference that one top centre-half can have.</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Fletcher has questioned the conduct of Paul Pogba after he appeared to revel in Jose Mourinho’s departure from Old Trafford]</b> Pogba’s social media posts were a scheduled event, part of a marketing campaign. <b>[It was]</b> immediately taken down once it became apparent that it could be misconstrued as disrespectful to Manchester United and Jose Mourinho.<br /><br />He has not conducted himself well recently and he needs a kick up the backside. And I think his post today, whether it was his team or whatever, it was totally out of order. That’s a big concern for me. It’s another concern because everyone talked about who is going to go - Pogba or Mourinho? Someone needs to get hold of Pogba and tell him this wasn’t a battle between him and Mourinho and he’s won. A new manager has to come in and demand more of Pogba to lead the team forward<br /><br /><b>[On Mauricio Pochettino]</b> He ticks all the boxes for United as he has proven at Southampton and Spurs he can develop young players; he’s got an attacking style and he’s had confrontations with players but dealt with it fantastically. If Pochettino has ambitions of winning things then, if United come calling, he’d be more than interested<br /><br />I’m not saying that’s necessarily his fault. Maybe it’s to do with the modern player - but I’d love to see Mourinho have a good break, come back and try to evolve a bit to bring back the old Mourinho that everyone loved</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher has revealed what went on during the infamous bust-up between Roy Keane and Arsenal’s Patrick Vieira in 2005]</b> I heard Gary Neville come into the dressing room, saying that a few of the Arsenal lads had just started on him in the tunnel. It sounded surreal because that doesn’t happen. It hadn’t happened before and hasn’t happened since. It was a unique situation. Gaz didn’t seem too bothered by it, he just let out that laugh that he does. But it was game time, so Roy did what he does.<br /><br />I think it was kept among the players. He didn’t broadcast what he was about to do. It was just said to a few of the lads; it wasn’t as though Alex Ferguson had sat us down and spoke about it. Roy took it upon himself. So we get into the tunnel and it all kicks off. Suddenly, Roy Keane starts having a go at Patrick Vieira, before we’re even on the pitch. In that one moment, you’re in complete shock. All sorts of things run through your head. Is it going to kick off again, like at Old Trafford last year? What’s the ref going to do? Are they going to come to blows? You’re on edge, getting ready to rumble or hold somebody back. In that moment you don’t know what’s going to happen. Everything’s on a knife-edge..<br /><br />When you look back at the footage, it doesn’t look like Roy’s in control. He is. You saw the Arsenal players almost telling Vieira to leave it, not to get involved, whereas we didn’t need to do that with Roy. We knew Roy. We knew he’d be on it. We were backing Roy but letting him do his thing. He’s our captain, our leader, he would always do what was in the best interests of the team. It wasn’t Roy going in on his own, trying to make himself look good, it was just Roy defending his team-mate. That brings out the best in him. We were ready to back him no matter what, and none of us would ever have held him back. No chance. We knew he would be cool, calm, collected. So in that moment, you’re not sure which way it’s going to go, but you know you’re on the right side, however things pan out<br /><br />When that moment passes and you’re getting ready to go out onto the pitch, you’re thinking: We’re not losing this now. No way</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Fletcher​ has pointed to a gulf in class between Manchester United and Barcelona]</b> There was a gulf in quality between the two sides. PSG were the better side over two legs in the last round but United rode their luck. Tonight, Barcelona were on top and two wonder goals from Lionel Messi and Philippe Coutinho were the difference. <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> has a lot of work ahead of him tonight but he will have seen little things from his players tonight about who kept battling and who kept playing. Man Utd are way off Man City and Liverpool but it’s about how they bridge the gap now. Do they go down the route of recruiting the best young talent and try to mould them in the United way rather than buying ready made players who maybe don’t have their heart in it? Scott McTominay did not stop all night and if you can put that work rate and attitude into players who have more ability, that would be great. Roy Keane and Paul Scholes had it but they were world class players as well.<br /><br />It was 4-0 over the two legs but it hasn’t been an embarrassment and it could have been more if Barca wanted to turn on the style. United shouldn’t lose too much heart from this tie and they have to concentrate on the top four now. These players have to show they are part of Manchester United’s future in the remaining games of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Fletcher says Old school <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a> has shaken off <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> stick]</b> He looks like the first name on the team sheet. From the games I’ve seen, like <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, it was a bit flat and he went thundering into a tackle and got the crowd up. He’s a little bit old school. He’s got drive and he gets on the ball and doesn’t hide. His goal was fantastic and he’s starting to find his voice as well; you can see his arms pointing at people and different things like that. It’s fantastic to see.<br /><br />Obviously he is the one who has confidence in his game now and he’s taken the onus on himself to drag the rest of the team with him. Credit to the lad because he was getting a bit of stick when he first came into the team, as everyone does as the pressure is big, but he’s come through that and now is definitely leading this <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> team. Others should look to him to know how to do it<br /><br />The difference these young lads have got is that all those young players, and myself, we came into a team with men - established winners and world-class players - who carried the burden and the pressure for us. We floated under the radar and it was easier. Whereas these lads are dealing with that pressure straight away themselves, and it is pretty difficult as a young player. You might have two or three good games but then a bad game as the consistency is not there yet. But the positives this season for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have been the young players - especially <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a>. He’s been a standout player from day one this season; he drives the team forward and tries to make stuff happen.<br /><br />It’s great for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s future with the academy, but with young players you just have to be patient. And when you are playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> not many people have got patience. That is the challenge laid down to them; they know that and they try their best and will get there, hopefully sooner rather than later</p>

Relative to how people think he’s performed - whether he’s lived up to the price tag or not - <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> creates on the pitch, makes things happen, and tries things with his passes. They’ve missed that, 100 per cent</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Fletcher warns <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> youngsters sinking in toxic atmosphere]</b> The scenes in the stadium weren’t good. The chanting, the atmosphere really turned toxic for the first time<br /><br />At the minute you can see with every setback these youngsters <b>[Brandon Williams, <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a>, <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> and <a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a>]</b> are just sinking. The scrutiny and the pressure that these kids are under - it was difficult for me coming into the team and I was surrounded by world-class players left, right and centre. These lads don’t have that support network around them and they are really finding it difficult. It might make a few of them, but at the same time it will probably break a few of them as well, which is really disappointing</p>

  <p><b>[How not punishing fouls in training turned <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> into a team player at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>]</b> You could see this charismatic kid, you could see the ability, you could see the drive to become the best player in the world - but he frustrated the life out of everybody.

  <p><b>[Darren Fletcher says Perfect opportunity for a European breakaway league]</b> You can speculate about cup competitions and things like that but the biggest thing for me is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and the leagues have to be finished. Even the knock on effect of that for the Champions League next season, forget about that, these are easier things to delay and cancel and postpone. When you’re 30 games into a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season, it’s very difficult not to see it out. It will all come down to money, as everything does. The powers that be, the money involved, sponsorship deals. The Champions League are not going to just accept that, there is no way they are going to accept that. The powerful clubs, there will be breakaways and even more of a push towards breakaway leagues on the back of it - 100 per cent. If you turned around to the Champions League and said it’s not happening, they will propose a breakaway and invite the teams that they want. It may actually be an excuse to get what they want anyway. They want that, a breakaway league. This may be the perfect opportunity to get that and go ‘we’re doing this next season if you want to cancel the Champions League next season, who’s in?’</p>

I’d be very concerned about that, but at the same time I love playing.<br /><br />It’s a massive concern. We’re not out of this situation by any means. Footballers will not only be concerned for themselves and their lives and the rest of their careers but they’ll be worried about bringing it back to their family. Sport is important to everyone and we’ve all missed it but we’re talking about matters of life and death here and I think that guarantees would have to be in place - but who can guarantee that players are going to be safe?

Great players can come together. Somebody might have to sacrifice a little bit of something - that’s part of being in a team, it’s not an individual sport. When you play with a certain midfield, whether it’s a midfield three, you adapt your game to complement each other. That’s what I had to do at United.

His ability has been there for everyone to see. For me, it’s been his personality and his attitude. He tries things, he tries difficult passes but, when he gives it away, it’s his reaction after he does it. It’s fantastic, his hunger to try and get the ball back. He doesn’t throw his arms up in the air or sulk and moan. He’s bossing people on the pitch, he’s taking responsibility. He’s looked like the epitome of a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player. He wants to be there, he wants the ball, he demands the ball. He’s seen <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> as his theatre and he’s relishing it. He’s sort of been a breath of fresh air with personality more than anything, which is what you need to play for Man United. Ability’s not enough.
