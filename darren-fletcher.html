  <p><b>[Fletcher says I looked like I’d been bitten by Mike Tyson!]</b> My ear looks like I’ve been bitten by Mike Tyson! But I’ll be all right for Sunday. My ear was hanging off a little bit, so it definitely needed to be bandaged up or it would have been flapping around. I got a few stitches but it will heal up and should be all right for. I signalled to my kids in the stand at the end making sure they knew I was OK. When you see your dad go off with blood, you might be worried. I needed three or four stitches and some glueSunday.<br /><br /><b>[A win over Slovenia will see Scotland secure second place in their World Cup qualifying group and, with a play-off place up for grabs, Fletcher says the team are confident of getting the job done]</b> Beating Slovakia was a massive boost and puts us in a great position but we still have a job to do in Slovenia. There’s a feel-good factor about the country at the moment but we’ve still got one game to go and even after that there is still the play-offs. There are still a lot of challenges ahead of us and what we want to achieve. If we could reach the play-offs that would be great but it is all about getting to the tournament in Russia. We still have a number of games to get to Russia and Slovakia was a small step towards getting there<br /><br />It will be tough but this team believe we can go and win the game, and that’s the biggest thing. Momentum is a good thing in football and it is with us now. Once you score a couple of late goals you start to believe in yourselves as a team, and that is showing</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Fletcher says James Garner is a name that people will know by the end of the season]</b> People talk about the leaders and who is going to help them, which is an important side <b>[to the argument]</b>, so it’s a difficult one but I’m sure as the season goes on you’re going to see more of James Garner because he’s top class. I’m surprised he’s not featured so far but by the end of the season I’m sure that people will know who he is without a doubt, if you don’t by now<br /><br /><b>[With pressure mounting on <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> amid poor results and disappointing performances, Fletcher thinks the youngster could help ensure the manager retains the goodwill of the Old Trafford crowd]</b> I think the history of the club says they demand and they want young players in the team and they support that. It does give you more time when you give youngsters a chance because people see it as refreshing and see it as building for the future. I think that they are more than ready to play, it’s just that, can you have too many at once?</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Fletcher says Old school <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a> has shaken off <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> stick]</b> He looks like the first name on the team sheet. From the games I’ve seen, like <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, it was a bit flat and he went thundering into a tackle and got the crowd up. He’s a little bit old school. He’s got drive and he gets on the ball and doesn’t hide. His goal was fantastic and he’s starting to find his voice as well; you can see his arms pointing at people and different things like that. It’s fantastic to see.<br /><br />Obviously he is the one who has confidence in his game now and he’s taken the onus on himself to drag the rest of the team with him. Credit to the lad because he was getting a bit of stick when he first came into the team, as everyone does as the pressure is big, but he’s come through that and now is definitely leading this <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> team. Others should look to him to know how to do it<br /><br />The difference these young lads have got is that all those young players, and myself, we came into a team with men - established winners and world-class players - who carried the burden and the pressure for us. We floated under the radar and it was easier. Whereas these lads are dealing with that pressure straight away themselves, and it is pretty difficult as a young player. You might have two or three good games but then a bad game as the consistency is not there yet. But the positives this season for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have been the young players - especially <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a>. He’s been a standout player from day one this season; he drives the team forward and tries to make stuff happen.<br /><br />It’s great for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s future with the academy, but with young players you just have to be patient. And when you are playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> not many people have got patience. That is the challenge laid down to them; they know that and they try their best and will get there, hopefully sooner rather than later</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Fletcher has called <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> the current side’s most dominant and influential player]</b> If you look at the stats over a season - goals, assists, chances created, passes - he is <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s most dominant and influential player. Without a doubt it is a big blow <b>[that he has been missing]</b>, he is a leader, a World Cup winner. His performances get scrutinised to the level where it is a little bit unfair. People probably expect too much from him but if you look at the stats he always delivers and makes things happen. That’s probably where the criticism comes because he always tries things. Great <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> players have always done that, they’ve never gone simple or safe. Paul is maybe trying a little bit too hard</p>

  <p><b>[He reveal <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> was worried about how he was perceived at Old Trafford]</b> I think we’ll see a slightly different Jose. I think the Jose that had been affected by <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and almost resentment of players, different to the Jose of Porto, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a> where he was a player’s manager, players were ‘us against the world’, there was a real closeness and things like that, we haven’t seen that for a while<br /><br />I know for a fact after he left United he did a little bit of reflecting and asked a few people, ‘tell me the truth, tell me what I was like, give it to me straight’<br /><br />And that, for me, a sign of somebody who realised he’d gone a little bit too far in that way. I’m sure he had his own frustrations towards <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, just as many as the players and people had with him and the things that went on towards the end. I think you can see it from both point of views. But the fact he was asking people for an honest opinion of what he was like says to me that’s somebody who is reflecting and a little bit of a rest and a little bit of self-reflecting we’ll see a different <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a><br /><br />Whether it’s the <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> of old … I don’t expect it to be the Jose we’ve seen in the last couple of years<br /><br /><b>[Asked if <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> were right to sack Mauricio Pochettino]</b> Yes because I feel like he’d run his course at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>. I feel like too much has gone on. I saw it coming at the beginning of the season, all the contract situations with the players, losing the Champions League final and the affect that’s had on them. The players are hearing the same messages all the time, same formation, it just seems to be everyone has lost their way, players, manager, everyone associated with the club<br /><br />I feel <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> need a restart, somebody to come in and kick-start their season and take them on the next part of their journey. I just feel it’s a case of the manager having done five successful seasons at the club without winning a trophy, made <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> an established Champions League side, taking them to the final, the one question mark against him is the fact he’s not won anything and <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> said that in his comments ‘we’ve brought in a winner’, so he obviously thinks the next challenge for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> is to start winning titles</p>

  <p><b>[Darren Fletcher says Perfect opportunity for a European breakaway league]</b> You can speculate about cup competitions and things like that but the biggest thing for me is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and the leagues have to be finished. Even the knock on effect of that for the Champions League next season, forget about that, these are easier things to delay and cancel and postpone. When you’re 30 games into a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season, it’s very difficult not to see it out. It will all come down to money, as everything does. The powers that be, the money involved, sponsorship deals. The Champions League are not going to just accept that, there is no way they are going to accept that. The powerful clubs, there will be breakaways and even more of a push towards breakaway leagues on the back of it - 100 per cent. If you turned around to the Champions League and said it’s not happening, they will propose a breakaway and invite the teams that they want. It may actually be an excuse to get what they want anyway. They want that, a breakaway league. This may be the perfect opportunity to get that and go ‘we’re doing this next season if you want to cancel the Champions League next season, who’s in?’</p>

He doesn’t throw his arms up in the air or sulk and moan. He’s bossing people on the pitch, he’s taking responsibility. He’s looked like the epitome of a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player. He wants to be there, he wants the ball, he demands the ball. He’s seen Old Trafford as his theatre and he’s relishing it. He’s sort of been a breath of fresh air with personality more than anything, which is what you need to play for Man United.

When you play with a certain midfield, whether it’s a midfield three, you adapt your game to complement each other. That’s what I had to do at United. I was in the team with lots of different midfielders, lots of combinations and, if a certain midfielder was playing, I would try to take up positions to allow him to benefit and he would do things to allow me to benefit. It’s all about being compatible and recognising the strengths of your fellow team-mates and how to get your best performance, but, ultimately, you might be sacrificing what you do best to allow someone else to excel, which helps the team win</p>
