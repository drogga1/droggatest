  <p><b>[Blow for Brazil as Dani Alves ruled out of World Cup]</b> Following Daniel Alves’ right knee injury, which occurred yesterday during the French Cup final, the tests performed today showed a high detachment of the anterior cruciate ligament with posterolateral sprain. Close examinations confirmed the initial diagnosis of an anterior cruciate ligament injury, requiring surgical treatment. Considering the alternative recovery options within the timeframe, it confirmed the impossibility of calling Daniel Alves up for the period of preparation, friendlies and the World Cup.</p>

I hope the VAR and referees don’t play any part in the final and that Peru can compete but it looks tough to me. I did not want to be part of this corruption, we shouldn’t have to be part of this disrespect we suffered during the Copa America. We could have gone further but we weren’t allowed into the final.
