Tite denied a report Brazil had used a drone to spy on Peru ahead of their third and final Copa America group stage match on Saturday</p>

<p>: 2019 07 03
Who is Brazil vs Argentina referee Roddy Zambrano? Roddy Zambrano will be the referee in charge of a blockbuster Copa America semi-final clash between Brazil and Argentina on Tuesday. The Ecuadorian has been FIFA listed since 2012 and began his career in Ecuador’s Serie A competition. At 41, Zambrano has already officiated 250 senior games, dishing out 1203 yellow cards and 60 reds during that span</p>

Barcelona star Lionel Messi tried his best to steal the show but a poor overall performance from Argentina has seen Brazil triumph 2-0 in their Copa America semi-final</p>

<p>: 2019 07 04
Conmebol has confirmed problems with the VAR system used in Brazil’s controversial Copa America semi-final win over Argentina, with reports that Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro’s security team were to blame for communication issues. The South American continental governing body has insisted that the problems were fixed before kick-off in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday night</p>

Edu has been replaced by Juninho as general coordinator of Brazil amid reports he is set to become Arsenal’s technical director</p>

<p>: 2019 08 02
Lionel Messi has been suspended from Argentina’s next three matches and given a $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his controversial comments made during the Copa America</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[After being sent off against Chile, Messi skipped the Copa America medal ceremony, clearly still upset about his red card in the third-place game and what transpired in his nation’s semi-final defeat to host country Brazil]</b> There is no doubt, the whole thing is set up for Brazil. I hope the VAR and referees don’t play any part in the final and that Peru can compete but it looks tough to me. I did not want to be part of this corruption, we shouldn’t have to be part of this disrespect we suffered during the Copa America. We could have gone further but we weren’t allowed into the final. Corruption, referees and all the rest stopped people from enjoying the football</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi’s inflammatory comments claiming that there was corruption within the federation relating to the Copa America tournament. CONMEBOL responded to Messi’s comments with a withering statement of their own]</b> In football sometimes you win and sometimes you lose and accepting the outcome of a match with loyalty and respect is a fundamental pillar of fair play. Same goes to the refereeing decisions, that are human and will never be perfect. Said accusations represent a lack of respect for the competition, all the football players involved and the hundreds of professionals of CONMEBOL, an institution that since 2016 has been tirelessly working to professionalise and develop South American football</p>

Former USWNT boss Pia Sundhage has been revealed as the new head coach of Brazil</p>

<h4 id="2019-07-25b-retrieve">2019 07 25b Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Vadao’s re-appointment followed the sacking of the team’s first ever female coach, Emily Lima, who was relieved of her duties after just 13 games in charge. Her dismissal prompted five players to withdraw themselves from selection for the national team, while an open letter criticising the Brazilian federation was published and signed by eight players, including stars such as Cristiane and Formiga]</b> We, the players, have invested years of our own lives and all of our energy to build this team and this sport to its strength today. Yet we, and almost all other Brazilian women, are excluded from the leadership and decision-making for our own team and our own sport</p>
