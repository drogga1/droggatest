  <p><b>[Cultured midfielder Ariel Ibagaza is determined to help his side secure three points this evening in a crucial clash with Real Betis]</b> We must ensure that we are concentrating, playing well and create opportunities so that we make them nervous. Rotations are good for everybody. We are doing things right at the moment, and when it is my turn to play I will help out the team as best I can. The important thing is to win the three points. It will be complicated, but we hope to handle it from beginning to end</p>

  <p><b>[Ariel Ibagaza says <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> Cannot Concede Against Arsenal]</b> It’s vital we keep things tight at the back with no errors in defence. If we concede a goal in London the challenge will become more difficult. Our inspiration is our match in Athens in the previous round. Against a hard rival and the atmosphere we were able to score two goals. This spirit is vital for Wednesday. The team travels in good spirits without fear. We say that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are a big team but in <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> they did not dominate on the pitch. We are not focussing on <a href="cesc-fabregas.html">Cesc Fabregas</a>. It’s true that he’s a key player for the Gunners but we believe they have many dangerous players. We need to shut down a lot of their players and stamp our authority on the match. If we can put in the effort I’m convinced that success is possible. The injuries may have damaged our midfield but now is the real moment for us to demonstrate that our bench has quality. We must now show that we merit a place in the semi-finals</p>

  <p><b>[Ariel Ibagaza has acknowledged that <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> have to win nearly all the games they have left this season if they are to finish in the top four]</b> The table says that we have to win nearly every game, and that is very difficult, because we have to play against strong teams. So, we have to first of all get a win against Recreativo <b>[Huelva]</b> and then see where we go from there. I do not know if the fixture list will be good or bad. We will see when the season is finished, but what is important now is to beat Recreativo and then Getafe. The only thing that is wrong is that we haven’t got the results - simply, we haven’t won. We do seem tired and that makes it worse, and also it seems that everyone else is fresher and better, but we know we have to get results, and we are not doing that</p>

  <p><b>[Ariel Ibagaza Reveals Ernesto Valverde’s Plan Of Attack For <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>]</b> We have been working very well and the pre-season has been very positive so far. <a href="fede-valverde.html">Valverde</a> has asked us to press more in attack, move our lines further forward and make it more difficult for our rivals to get out of their own area. It’s very good that he arrived here at the back of a league and cup double with his former team <b>[Olympiakos]</b> and I hope that he can continue that winning streak. When the internationals are back, things will be much easier. They are the most important players for <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a> and they can help us prepare better for the early rounds of the Europa League</p>

  <p><b>[Ariel Ibagaza Ready To Return To Action For <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>]</b> The truth is that I’m fully recovered. Now I have to use these days to the full so that I can play against Valladolid. I will be playing with a ball in the coming week and I’m very happy to be able to train with the team. I think that if everything goes to plan, I will be available to play in the next match<br /><br />In the last few matches, the team has risen up a lot. We are on the right track and we are hoping to go on a winning stream to move up to the top. The important thing is to pick up three <b>[points]</b> again and again until the end of the year, and then keep improving in order to finish the league in the top six</p>
