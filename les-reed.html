  <p><b>[Southampton have completed the signing of Mouez Hassen on a five-month loan deal from Nice]</b> Mouez is a promising young goalkeeper, and we are very pleased to have been able to bring him to Southampton. He has built an excellent reputation during his time with Nice and also in his country’s youth teams, and will provide us with further depth in the months ahead. As well as adding to our squad, we believe Mouez can continue his development in his time at Southampton and make strides in his own game under the expert guidance of our Head of Goalkeeping, Dave Watson, as well as working alongside Fraser Forster. Harry Lewis has had opportunities and gained great experience while Alex McCarthy has been injured, and Stuart Taylor has brought excellent experience to the group, and now Mouez will add to our strength in depth</p>

  <p><b>[Southampton have completed the signing of Juventus midfielder Mario Lemina for an estimated €18 million]</b> Mario is an outstanding talent who has already achieved a great deal in his career, winning a number of titles and gaining experience of playing on some of the biggest stages in world football.<br /><br />Investing in a player of Mario’s quality and buying from a club like Juventus is a significant statement of intent from the club, and this is a purchase that has set another club-record fee.<br /><br />Mario still has his best years ahead of him, and we believe that he will not only be an excellent acquisition for us in the immediate future, but that he will also be able to realise even more of his potential here in the years to come.<br /><br />In a volatile market with some extraordinary and inexplicable transfers taking place, we are determined to go about our work in a diligent and correct way. This is a player who has won trophies and played in the Champions League final less than three months ago and he has signed for Saints amid a host of suitors.<br /><br />Mario will complement what is already an extremely strong group of midfield players in our squad, and we are excited about what he will bring to the group</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="fa.html">Football Association</a> technical director Les Reed conceding that <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> vultures will likely circle at some stage. If that proves to be the case, then Reed admits that the lure of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> will be difficult for <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a> to turn down]</b> It would be a tough ask depending on what he was offered. But I know Gareth’s mindset at the moment is that he wants to be an England manager that wins something. I think the attraction of being the next England manager to take us to a World Cup final is a strong pull and also I think he knows that by doing that his stock’s not going to go down. Obviously it’s something that we have in the back of our minds all the time but I know that Gareth’s motivation is with this team and developing this team moving forward</p>
