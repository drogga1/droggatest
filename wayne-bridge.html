  <p><b>[Wayne Bridge skillfully dodged an awkward question on ‘I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here’ on Sunday as fellow contestants questioned him about which footballers he did not like]</b> Footballers aren’t all dicks to be honest. There are a couple of people I might not have liked but you don’t get on with everyone. I got on really well with Shaun Wright-Phillips and Micah Richards… I get on well with Scott Parker.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea defender Wayne Bridge has partly attributed the club’s recent struggles to a lack of leadership]</b> When I think back to that time, I think of a whole team of leaders. We had Michael Ballack, Didier Drogba, Claude Makelele, John Terry, Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole …<br /><br />I think there is definitely a leadership problem, 100 per cent. I look at Chelsea now and I don’t see a lot of leaders. I think it’s something they need to address if they are going to compete for titles. They need to spend money and look to bring in those types of players. Not just good-quality players, but players who have got a bit of character, players who can lead the team through difficult moments. You don’t just want one player leading the team. A major part of being successful is having a group of players who can provide leadership<br /><br /><b>[On Antonio Conte]</b> He came in and did really well last year and everyone wants long-term stability, but I’ve said for a while that I didn’t think he would be there next season. I look at the signings the club made. When Conte has talked about them, he has never been that positive, which suggests he didn’t sign them himself. From the outside, it looks like there have been issues there</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea parting with Eden Hazard and Willian during the summer transfer window would leave them needing to buy a whole new squad]</b> The two players I wouldn’t let go is Willian and Eden Hazard. Those two are brilliant and how Willian didn’t play more games is beyond me. If he goes and Hazard does, Chelsea would need to buy a whole new squad. You’d need to replace them with world-class stars and that will cost a lot of money.<br /><br /><b>[On Eden Hazard]</b> I don’t know what’s going through his head. Real Madrid is a massive club. But I think Chelsea will be doing all they can to keep hold of him. It’s a case of weighing up the options for Chelsea. If he really wants to go are you going to keep a player who doesn’t want to be there?<br /><br /><b>[On Maurizio Sarri]</b> Everyone needs to know who the new manager is and then hopefully you can get some top quality players. To me it all seems a bit up in air and it’s a bit worrying really - especially with Roman Abramovich not being allowed in the country</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Bridge thinks that Leicester City’s Ben Chilwell needs to work with Pep Guardiola at Manchester City]</b> He is very good and he has shown that at Leicester. I think if he does make that move then it will make him a better player, but I also feel if they do get him in and they do want him, that Pep will want to improve him and make him that player that fits them. It will make him a better player and then I think he could become England’s undisputed best left-back.<br /><br /><b>[On Luke Shaw]</b> He broke his leg and has had a tough time at United, but he has come on a long way since his injury. To come back from that, all credit to him. I have to mention Ryan Bertrand who I still think is a talented player and deserves to be in the mix. I think Luke Shaw is England’s best though. What I expected is that he would move on and get better at United, it has taken him time, but I still think he is a better player overall than other left-backs in this country. He is quick, strong and intelligent. He has progressed of late for Man United and he is one of their better players. He should be Gareth’s first choice left-back</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Wayne Bridge doesn’t think that Chelsea are capable of replacing Eden Hazard]</b> If Chelsea lose Hazard, I don’t know how they could replace him. I couldn’t think who they would sign because Hazard is one of the best players in the world. I would think only Messi or Ronaldo could replace him. I think if they do lose him, they can’t replace him. That’s why I worry that Chelsea could struggle even more than they are doing at the moment. He has been a huge part of the club’s season with goals and assists. I would love to see Hazard stay to help the club compete and he has been so good for the league, but we don’t know what will happen.<br /><br />I am surprised that the manager is still at Chelsea, to be honest. Especially after what has happened at Chelsea, you have had the goalkeeper undermining his manager where he should have been dragged off. The fans aren’t happy with the style of football. You have the issue with Jorginho and <b>[N’Golo]</b> Kante. Are they getting the best out of each other? Kante is good at getting around the pitch, but his final ball isn’t suited to playing further forward and fans aren’t happy with that. <b>[Callum]</b> Hudson-Odoi and <b>[Ruben]</b> Loftus-Cheek maybe should have played more and sooner. You have got a situation where they and Man United seem to be on the slide. The ownership of the club has entered an awkward spell. Something is going to have to change, you would look to transfers but you worry about the ban. Could another manager get more out of the players and make them a better unit? Perhaps, but I still would worry that they don’t have enough to compete with Liverpool or Man City. You look at those two teams and with the age of their players and they will add to it. Pep Guardiola improves players and City keep signing quality players so it is hard to compete. Liverpool are giving it a good go at the moment but the style of City’s play is unbelievable. I feel Bernardo Silva has been the best player in the league, he is so technically gifted, so comfortable on the ball and a credit to himself. Pep has also improved him a lot<br /><br />You go from playing football to have nothing to do but pick your kids up and take them to school. If there is something I would go back and change it would have been to have lined up some other interest outside to go into after football. That’s one bit of advice I give to young professional footballers, to set that up. Luckily, I have been able to go on to do TV stuff. I am into coaching and punditry, but I do miss being able to run around and kick a football which I can’t do because of my knee. I had always been alright but it plagued my last season at Reading. There were a lot of problems in the whole of the last season, I had a load of operations that they thought would fix it. I had a problem with my cartilage. I thought I could play again but I just couldn’t. I wore all my cartilage away so I ended up just having bone-on-bone. So there was no chance of getting back and playing football. Retirement was something that was forced upon me rather than something I chose to do. I think if I had an option to be still playing, I think like most people I would. Even now in everyday life, it effects me. When I am playing with the kids in a kickabout, I come away sore for a couple of weeks. I can run in straight lines but with football and the change of direction, impact on the joints and the stop-start, it just causes too much pain, and I don’t have much movement in it</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Chelsea man Wayne Bridge has said he is ‘very surprised’ to see Maurizio Sarri still in a job at Stamford Bridge]</b> Some say it’s been successful but it’s been very up and down. They’ve been very inconsistent and consistency is what you want of a big team. That’s what’s going to win you the Premier League.<br /><br />They are third <b>[in the Premier League]</b> and they are in a final but as an ex-player and a Chelsea fan, I would like to see them higher up in the table. I know it’s third but I want to see them competing <b>[for the title]</b><br /><br /><b>[Add to this the chants by Chelsea fans expressing their dismay at Sarri’s style of play]</b> I don’t really know where he <b>[Sarri]</b> stands. I’m very surprised that he’s still there</p>

  <p><b>[Bernardo Silva is so underrated at Manchester City]</b> One player I think is so underrated is Bernardo Silva. Every time I watch him I just think technically he is amazing. There wasn’t enough talk about him being player of the year. As an ex-footballer seeing some of the positions he’s in and when he’s got players around him, his feet, his vision, I just think he’s brilliant. He’s Iniesta-like, where they have people around them and they just get out of any situation.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he has any doubts about the ability of Guardiola’s men to make history on Saturday at Wembley]</b> No. Quite simple! City are playing amazing football, it’s amazing to watch. I go back to when we were at Chelsea. Every game I went into, nobody ever thought we were going to lose a game. Everybody thought we were all going to win. It wasn’t that overconfidence where you’re too overconfident and you make a mistake. Everyone was so switched on the whole game mentally - always focused - everyone worked hard for each other. You do see that with the City players as well. They look solid. They do close down well, they do press well, they do work hard. I know they’re amazing to watch but they do work hard as well. I guarantee they probably have the same feeling that I had back then that you’re walking down the tunnel and you think: ‘Yeah, we’re going to win today’. There’s not one thing enters your mind thinking we’re going to lose</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Bridge says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> manager <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> has been urged to avoid the temptation to splash the cash when the club’s transfer embargo ends next summer]</b> It looks like it was a blessing in disguise for Frank that he couldn’t sign players because the young lads have been doing so well and I hope the club stand by them for the long term. Some people were surprised when Frank got the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> job last summer, but it was a no brainer for me. They were on a transfer ban, so could they really bring in an expensive foreign manager and expect him to produce miracles? Probably not. What they did with Frank is appoint someone who knows the club and knew the quality of the young players who were already on the books at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. The club have not gone down the route of bringing on young players in recent years, so this is something very different and it’s working. Everyone is enjoying what Lamps and his assistant <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> are doing and I’d hope they continue with this policy when the transfer embargo is done with and they can sign players again. We are seeing a different <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> this season and the fans are loving it. Now we are all asking what can they achieve? They are in a great spot right now and maybe they can get in the mix to challenge for trophies. If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> slip up at the top, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are not too far behind them, so there is every reason to believe they can finish the season successfully<br /><br />I don’t know if I expected him to be a manager because when you are playing alongside someone, it’s hard to predict who can make that transition. He was one of those players who lived and breathed football, which is not the case for every player. The surprise is that he has been given a chance to get the job at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, as have <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> at Rangers and <a href="scott-parker.html">Scott Parker</a> at Fulham. It’s great to see and I hope they all make a success of it.<br /><br />What Lamps has always been is a leader and those qualities are shining through now that he is in his new role. He was always a model professional. He was one of those players who would stay on and do extra training, shooting and crossing every day. That incredible goal-scoring record he has at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is due, in part, to the hours he put in to get the best out of his career and at the start, a lot of people told him he would never make it.<br /><br />I think that inspired him to prove a few people wrong and, if the young lads working under him at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> now follow that example, it will stand them in good stead. He was talented as a player, but he was also a grafter and that is why he got so much out of his career. He is Mr <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and will know the staff from top to bottom. He’ll know the ticket ladies, the chefs at the training ground and he must have walked in there on the first day and thought, ‘yes, this is home for me’. He was also always going to get the backing of the fans, even if things didn’t go well at the start. Everyone wants Frank to do well and that is a massive plus point for any manager. I’m buzzing for Lamps and Jody and I can’t wait to see where they can take it this season. If they could finish in the top four and challenge for trophies, that would be beyond most of the expectations set for them when they took over</p>
