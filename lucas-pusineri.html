  <p><b>[Independiente head coach Lucas Pusineri hopes <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> star <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> one day returns to the club]</b> With <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> and Lucas Biglia I have a beautiful relationship. We were partners and I have a lot of respect for the trajectories they have taken with Argentina and in Europe as well<br /><br />Of course it would be nice to have them tomorrow. In the future, it is hopeful to count on them</p>

  <p><b>[Head coach Lucas Pusineri says <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> is to have his favourite number 10 jersey reserved for him at Independiente]</b> Hopefully it will be my turn to be the coach of <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Kun Aguero</a>. I was a team-mate of his and hope that in the future I will get to be his coach. Hopefully in my stay at Independiente, I can come to <b>[reunite with]</b> Sergio. We are keeping him the number 10<br /><br />In recent days I did not speak to him. We spoke two months or so ago, when I congratulated him on a good week he had had with many goals. It will depend on the desire or will that he puts on his return, that is why I say that one is excited to <b>[prospectively]</b> see Sergio again at Independiente, continuing to give joy to the people of Independiente<br /><br />To have Sergio again would be wonderful for all of us who love Independiente. If I put Independiente in the Copa Libertadores, it would be an important challenge to play with <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> and for all the people who love him. People love him and he is an idol. Hopefully if we manage to be competitive on a slightly higher level, <b>[we will]</b> also be able to count on his help</p>
