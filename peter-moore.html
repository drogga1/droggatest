  <p><b>[Peter Moore tells <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> will not get into a spending race with their <a href="epl.html">English Premier League</a> rivals]</b> There is money to back the manager and the sporting director. The key ingredients are already in place at this club, you can expect the team to be strengthened, but we won’t be spending £100 million just because <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> has spent £100 million. I have worked in a company that was involved in a $1 billion buyout and it didn’t quite work out. I have lived through a lot of merger and acquisition activity, and what I have learned over the years is that it is not how much you pay, but what you get for your money</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Moore says he will meet with UEFA president <a href="aleksander-ceferin.html">Aleksander Ceferin</a>, with Champions League final ticket issues to be high on the agenda]</b> We talk to UEFA every day. We have been talking to UEFA for 40 years as you well know. But we do want UEFA to understand this city, which they do. <a href="aleksander-ceferin.html">Ceferin</a> was here last year for the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> home game and I spent a lot of time with him. I will see him next week. Today our football club is focused on helping our supporters everywhere. It was about getting the M&amp;S Bank Arena all done and sorted <b>[for a fan screening of the final]</b> and that was done today. There are a lot of logistics involved there. Then we are getting our fan park ready in Madrid - our team is right there now, helping supporters. I will see him <b>[<a href="aleksander-ceferin.html">Ceferin</a>]</b> and usually when I see Alek there are 20-things <b>[to talk about]</b> and it is all the things that you think: what do we do for allocations, what do we do for this? All of the normal stuff. It is a long list. The good news is we are going to a Champions League final but there is a lot of work to do to make it work.<br /><br /><b>[Moore believes the partnership comes at a time when <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s profile is as big as it has ever been]</b> Success on the pitch helps enormously. It provides a global spotlight. What we’re about to do next week amplifies that again. These players, and this club, is more loved than ever. It’s the way you play, the way we hold ourselves, our manager in particular, and the players, who let me tell you are educated from the moment they walk through the door. They know who <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Kenny Dalglish</a> is, they know who Ian Rush is, they know all about Hillsborough and Heysel. Three weeks ago, Margaret Aspinall <b>[chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group]</b> sat them all down at the training ground and talked them through what Hillsborough was all about. Margaret spoke for the 30th anniversary. She told them about James not coming home, and to hear it from a mother and someone as powerful a speaker, it reinforces it. Playing for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has responsibilities, and wearing the badge on that field is about more than just playing well. You’re carrying people on your shoulders<br /><br /><b>[Moore went on to point out the work Mane, for example, has done in helping the fight against AIDS in Senegal and Malawi, and the way <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> recently spoke out backing women’s rights]</b> Mohamed realises that he has a platform and a voice, and people love him and listen to him. He realises his responsibility. He has a window of time to do something, in a time when this world is being torn apart in some places by populism and nationalism. Mo does it, we love having Jordan around, we have <a href="xherdan-shaqiri.html">Xherdan Shaqiri</a> as a Kosovan-Albanian, we have three Muslims in the team <b>[<a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>, Mane and Naby Keita]</b>. So we have this amazing soup of players, a forward line from Senegal, Egypt and Brazil. When I was a lad it was exotic if they were from Wales! It’s brilliant, and the manager makes it all come together. They all understand what it means to play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Reds CEO Peter Moore claims <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> is a ‘world-class manager’ and will deliver more major silverware for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in the years to come]</b> What has struck me in my second full season here at the club is that the ­chemistry and the talent within the squad - all brought ­together by a world-class manager ­- provides us with great optimism that they will bring even more silverware to this wonderful club. Let’s hope that like the old saying about London buses, when one comes along, there are always two or three close behind. There is so much to look forward to from this brilliant team. You really cannot help but see us winning more trophies, although it is easier said than done. Having said that, we have exactly the right infrastructure at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to give us a chance of making it happen.</p>

  <p><b>[CEO Peter Moore used his Twitter account to update on the condition of Allan, saying he would not be leaving the hospital until he was satisfied the supporter was okay]</b> I’m at the hospital with Steven Allen right now. We will not leave him until we are comfortable that he’s fine, so can everyone stop worrying for now. Trying to get him seen by a doctor, but there’s a distinct lack of urgency here from the police and medical staff<br /><br /><b>[Twenty minutes later Moore tweeted]</b> Update to this. The hospital staff and the police have now helped Steven and been very cooperative. He’s been seen and will be monitored throughout the night. He asked me to thank everyone for their concern</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s controversial application to trademark the name ‘Liverpool’ has been unsuccessful]</b> It should be stressed that our application was put forward in good faith and with the sole aim of protecting and furthering the best interests of the club and its supporters. Nevertheless, we accept the decision and the spirit in which it has been made. I would also like to take the opportunity to reiterate our thanks to all those who engaged with us throughout this process, most notably independent traders and local football clubs<br /><br /><b>[Moore admitted the club had underestimated the kind of backlash their application would prompt]</b> We underestimated the reaction to it. We had, in very good faith, looked at what we were seeing on a global basis and particularly stuff that was coming into the UK. We felt obliged to protect the football club and had looked at other similar situations for clubs that had trademarked their place names in a football context, there are numerous examples. We felt that on behalf of the club we needed to do that - but I think it’s fair to say that we underestimated the emotional reaction to it and that’s our bad. Whilst we continued with the filing, we received the rejection from the IPO and we accept that and move on - we have got plenty of other stuff to do<br /><br />There was no deliberate action to slip it through, we had looked at other precedents where it had gone through with almost zero noise whatsoever. We filed and got on with our business and obviously as things unfolded the reaction was pretty quick and we immediately engaged with the independent retailers and the local football clubs and met with them - and reassured them that this was not aimed at them and offered them legal protections for if we had been successful. But we were not and now we will move on</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> chief executive Peter Moore claims to have no interest or need to get involved in transfer deals]</b> I don’t know nor do I need to know who we are looking at. I need to know whether we’re going to get the next sponsorship deal that we’re looking for. I need to know whether our relationship with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> City Council is on a good footing so we continue to build the commercial elements of things. I need to know whether our community teams are taking care of the people of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I need to know whether our legal, H.R., comms teams are doing well. I run the business<br /><br /><b>[That has not always been the case at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, with Moore’s predecessor as CEO - Ian Ayre - flying to Chile in the summer of 2015 to complete the signing of <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> as he formed part of Brazi’s squad at the Copa America]</b> There’s a difference between dabbling and interfering. My view is there’s 24 hours in a day, and if you’re flying to Santiago for three days - that’s what Ian did, and that’s fine, we were organised differently - then who’s looking after everything else that’s going on? I stay out of the way</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Moore says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will not be exploring the option of bringing <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> back to the club so that he can claim a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> winners’ medal]</b> Let me explain what would have to happen. So the question is, ‘can we bring <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> back to get a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> medal?’ and the question I ask you is: which player do you want to cut from the squad to make that happen?<br /><br />If you haven’t noticed, he’s the employee of a different football club at the same time as well. Look, we all love <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Stevie G</a> and we’re all very proud of him for his managerial career, but I keep seeing this ‘bring him in on a five-day contract so he can win a medal’ <b>[but]</b> it just doesn’t happen that way. Chemistry in a dressing room is important. Can you imagine that? That you have to cut a player, to say ‘you’re not going to get a medal’? It’s not like they’re handing these things out to everybody, you’ve got a squad, right? And thirdly, you can’t add a player to a squad once it’s locked. Other than that, it’s really possible<br /><br />I think what you see what <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> on the television - a lot of managers, what they are like in front of the cameras or when they’re being interviewed, they’re different than in real life. Well, that’s not the case with <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>. The situation with Jurgen is that you’ve got a German manager that has all the Germanic tendencies of detail, of focus, of looking at the opposition in an incredibly analytical way</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Moore on <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title triumph in 2019-20]</b> Many congratulations to the whole first-team squad, manager, players and backroom staff. It’s a phenomenal achievement to win this hugely competitive league by so many points. The football played this season has been exhilarating and the team fully deserves the plaudits and recognition. Over the past year, we have been crowned European champions, club world champions and today champions of England. A truly incredible achievement. I am also delighted and eternally grateful to our supporters for their unwavering commitment, season in, season out, and for playing a crucial role in our recent success. They were there when Sadio <b>[Mane]</b> scored a stoppage-time winner at Villa, they were there when Mo <b>[<a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>]</b> sealed victory with a last-minute goal against United. They were with us every step of the way, just as they have been for the last 30 years, until events prevented that from being possible</p>
