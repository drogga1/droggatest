Carlo can get angry if the situation calls for it. Carlo knows what he has to do. He knows when he has to be nice, show his players affection and when he has to tighten the leash a bit. We are talking about a coach who has been coaching the best teams in the world for 20 years or so and who has won loads of silverware. He can adapt to any situation</p>

  <p><b>[Former AC Milan boss Arrigo Sacchi has boldly claimed that the Barcelona King is dead]</b> The Barcelona King is dead. There is another sovereign who continues to impose his rule, Real Madrid, but <b>[there is]</b> also space for a newcomer to slip on to the throne. I see Juventus perfectly suited for that role. They are improving and, at the moment, are the favourites along with Real Madrid to take the trophy. For some time, Barcelona have not been the old Barcelona. In La Liga they also beat the weak clubs with ease, but struggle with stronger sides. You no longer see that aggressive, organised and hungry team we so admired. The Catalans dominated for 10 years, imposing a style of play that was at times truly marvellous. They gave a football lesson to the whole world. Now they’ve hit a brick wall and even Leo Messi can’t skip past his man anymore, because the whole machinery of the team is broken down. I always say that to succeed you require, in order of importance, a club, good football and the players. Without an idea of what football to play, the individuals will get you nowhere.<br /><br />Juventus have a strong club with clear ideas. Their coach Max Allegri is capable, intelligent and efficient, with players who interpret the instructions well. It’s true I criticised Allegri, because I knew he could give more. He wasn’t very generous in terms of entertainment before and was too prudent. He did the bare minimum, a goal and then clam up. Now his team seeks more goals and is aggressive</p>

This decision makes me doubt not just his personal integrity, but also what his future career will hold. I want to remind him of all those who put money before all else, for example Kaka and Shevchenko, who left Milan for Real Madrid and Chelsea only to later bitterly regret it.</p>

  <p><b>[Bianconeri are too cautious for their own good]</b> I like Juventus very much when they take the initiative, but they only play like that for 15 minutes and then retreat, just defend and seek the counter-attack. They’re not making the most of their attacking potential or feeding the strikers. I would love to ask Max Allegri why they do that. I fear it is a physical issue, so the team cannot handle playing in a certain way for an entire half of football. Many Juventus fans ask me the same question and I’d honestly love to know.</p>

  <p><b>[Arrigo Sacchi has told Paris Saint-Germain that they need more than just Neymar if they hope to win the Champions League]</b> A player, no matter how strong, is not a project. Neymar, he’s not a project! Milan won Serie A in 1988 with Marco van Basten, who had only just signed, and who played only three complete league games out of 30. If our project had been Van Basten, we’d have won nothing. We won the European Cup with Ruud Gullit in 1989-90 and you know how many matches he played? One out of nine! We beat Barcelona in the European Super Cup without Franco Baresi, Carlo Ancelotti and Gullit. Music without a score is not possible. <b>[Playwright]</b> Bertolt Brecht said that even the greatest actors need a director to express themselves fully. With what they spend, the day that the Parisians have a complete organisation worthy of the club, they will go forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Arrigo Sacchi has defended the methods of Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho]</b> Mourinho, Sarri and Guardiola are all three great coaches but they are different. When Mourinho does not win, people begin to say he has an old-fashioned style, but it isn’t true. He is a coach who prefers the result to the game, but he’s great: a great leader, very good tactically, an extraordinary character as a whole. The others are more like teachers.<br /><br />Maurizio is doing a great job at Chelsea. He is a great loss and it is a pity for Italian football where most coaches rely heavily on their managerial skills, tactics and the qualities of the individual to remedy the collective poverty of ideas. This does not help to raise the level of the game which remains the same. So whoever has the best players wins<br /><br />I cannot see into the future. If City were an orchestra I would listen carefully. They play with harmony, the right tempo and the correct movements. The experience is lacking to win the Champions League. To improve you have to take a risk. It is the base of every adventure. One has to evolve and innovate. When this road isn’t followed you remain tied to the past</p>

It’s only right, because in my view, winning when in debt is like match-fixing, you are buying results. I’ve always thought that a Coach must be both screenwriter and director, whereas others view the role differently. I have a predilection for those who give a specific style to their teams. There are only four or five of those in Italy, whereas the others are simply tacticians and all look the same. <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> is an excellent strategist and he told me the other day ‘we need to be more courageous, run more risks.<br /><br /><b>[Former Empoli boss <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>, meanwhile, steered <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to third in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> is a Coach who proved he can give his teams a specific identity.
