  <p><b>[Cardiff CEO Ken Choo hope that Sala will give the Bluebirds the attacking potency they have sorely lacked so far this season as they battle relegation]</b> It’s obviously been a long process to secure the services of Emiliano, but I’m very pleased that we’re now in a position whereby we can confirm his signature and officially announce him as a Cardiff City player. I’d like to thank those involved for making the signing happen, especially Tan Sri Vincent and the rest of the transfer committee. We see Emiliano as a significant acquisition and welcome him wholeheartedly to the capital city of Wales. I’m sure all Cardiff City fans will join me in that and we can look forward to seeing our record signing in a Bluebirds shirt.</p>

  <p><b>[Cardiff have now released a statement from the club’s executive director and CEO Ken Choo, insisting that they are distressed at the situation and praying for positive news]</b> We were very shocked upon hearing the news that the plane had gone missing. We expected Emiliano to arrive last night into Cardiff and today was due to be his first day with the team.<br /><br />Our owner, Tan Sri Vincent Tan, and chairman, Mehmet Dalman, are all very distressed about the situation. We made the decision first thing this morning to call off training with the thoughts of the squad, management staff and the entire club with Emiliano and the pilot. All of us at Cardiff City FC would like to thank our fans, and the entire footballing family for their support at this difficult time. We continue to pray for positive news.<br /><br />He’s such a great person. He was so happy to join Cardiff City. You can see from <b>[his]</b> face that he’s so, so happy to be here, and so ready to start. Words cannot describe the look on his face. When he met us and we walked him around the grounds, he was absolutely ready to give it a go. And we knew him then, and we really feel sad<br /><br />We are waiting for some news that we hope will be positive. We are very touched by all the support received since this morning</p>

  <p><b>[Ken Choo explained the use of the daffodil on Friday, highlighting its significance for both Wales and Nantes]</b> It is a yellow flower, the flower of Wales and has significance to Nantes. We feel for FC Nantes, their fans and players. They definitely know Emiliano better than we do and it is tougher for them at this point in time.</p>
