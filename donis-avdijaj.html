  <p><b>[The rise of football in Kosovo as they prepare for their biggest ever game]</b> For many people in Kosovo, football means everything. To see us win makes the people incredibly proud. The tickets for our game against Azerbaijan in the Nations League were sold out after 32 minutes. The demand was so high that as players we did not even get some tickets for our families. We have a lot of big talents and I believe that our team has the potential to make a splash in the coming years. We have to take small steps, even if it is going very well in the Nations League. We are still behind in many things. There is still a long way to go to the top nations. Most pitches are so bad, sometimes we have to drive two hours to train at the best training ground in the country but when I was there for the first time, I was shocked because this place was also miserable!</p>

  <p><b>[Former Schalke youngster Donis Avdijaj has revealed he had offers to join some of the top sides in the world]</b> At that time <b>[after signing his first contract at Schalke in the age of 18]</b> everyone wanted to be my friend. Everyone wanted to tell me what’s best for me. I did not have an agent at the time and did not know exactly how to handle the hustle and bustle<br /><br />In my youth, I scored more than 20 goals each season. I also scored 13 times in the junior national team in 13 games and I thought it would go on like this as a professional as well. When I was 15 or 16 years old, I could not properly classify this pat on the back, especially since the very big clubs were already trying to sign me and offering millions. Not going crazy in such a phase is much harder than going crazy. Before signing for Schalke, I had offers from Juventus, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool. No matter what game or tournament, scouts were always there to watch me</p>

  <p><b>[Turning down <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s mega offer was my biggest mistake]</b> My biggest mistake, which I bitterly regret, was turning down another mega offer from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> before I signed the long contract with Schalke, which was a matter close to my heart. I also had one from Real Madrid<br /><br /><b>[However the winger remains optimistic about his future, as he has already received several offers for next season]</b> I already have a lot of requests from clubs. I have to probe first. I have to make a plan for myself, where I want to go, what is best for me, and how to proceed. There are a lot of talks going on.<br /><br />I’ve never doubted myself. I am still convinced of myself. In most of my past stations, the sporting side speaks for itself. I convinced athletically in Netherlands. After a long break without football, I played 20 games at <a href="trabzonspor.html">Trabzonspor</a> and almost played through in the Europa League. I also had 10 or 12 games at Hearts and you don’t know how things would have gone if the coronavirus pandemic hadn’t intervened. I could have had a bit more luck in Scotland, but if I continue to believe in myself, train hard and play well in the next club, I’ll get back that little bit of luck that I might have been missing lately. I know that it is up to me what my sporting future looks like. It certainly doesn’t matter whether I’ve played at one club for five years or have 10 clubs in five years. In the end, only one thing counts for me, namely that I can play football and show what I can do</p>
