  <p><b>[Joel Matip gives insight into manager <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s tactics and personality]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> knows what he wants from every player - fast counter-pressing with direct attacks, but also a clean and structured build-up with specific position-play. But of course, if we lose the ball, the first step is towards the ball and not back to defend at our box. We are defending very high. It begins with the strikers, who run up to the opponent and cover a lot of metres, which allows us defenders to play very high too. It’s hard to describe <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s aura. He is very affable, yet direct. Even when there is something wrong, he is straight with you, but in a cordial manner. He’s straight but cordial. It’s hard to say that in one word</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk is a complete defender]</b> He is a great person. We can laugh together - he is good for the team and with his quality he will help the team. We now have more players at centre-back, so we can change if somebody is not in the best shape and there is no loss of quality. He will help the team, he has done it from the beginning. He is a complete defender. Maybe in a few moments he is more physical, but he is a complete defender, of course, who can help us in every situation.<br /><br /><b>[Matip added on the Reds’ challenge against the Saints]</b> There are a lot of really good teams in this league, everybody knew it before. They have a lot of quality. But we don’t have to hide. We’re doing our job and looking forward. We’re confident we’ll do a good job in the league. Southampton are not in the best shape at the moment but it will be a hard and tough fight. We have to go 100 per cent to get something. We have a good feeling, we have enough self-confidence and we are looking forward to the game. We have to always stay concentrated. We have enough quality to be in front after 90 minutes</p>

  <p><b>[Joel Matip is ready to fight for his Liverpool place this season]</b> Of course there is competition. We had the quality before and now we have a lot of self confidence. But I also have no doubt of my quality! And with a team like ours, there are always so many games, so you try to get the chance. I’m on a good way, of course. The fitness is not at 100 per cent but I’m not the only player who needs this time. But this is preparation to get a good fitness level, I’m on a good way and feel self-confident. I still need some time.<br /><br />Nobody wants to see games like this from the stand as a player. But you still try to fight and to do what you can from the bench or the stand. It is what it is. Of course it’s not the best part of being a player if you’re injured and have to look on, but this is part of a player’s life<br /><br /><b>[So does Matip feel confident they can fight for major honours again in the coming years?]</b> Of course, these are the goals. We want to achieve something. We will see how the season starts but we have to be there from the beginning. A lot of things are possible if we start the season properly. The new players have looked great from the beginning and they will help us. We have a really big and high-quality squad. This will help us through the season because we have a lot of games and injuries belong to the game, so some players will always miss a game. But it’s good if another player can come directly in without losing that much quality</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk will be fit to line up for Liverpool against former club Southampton]</b> I think he is not too bad. After the game, a few players always have some small injuries but I’ve heard nothing else, so I think he will be fit.<br /><br />We have all made it quite good. Virgil has had a big impact on the whole defence but it starts at the front, we put pressure on the opponent. It makes life easier for us. The whole team is defending much better<br /><br />I think it will be hard for both teams to play these kinds of games without dropping points. But we are only looking to our next opponent. That is the most important thing</p>

  <p><b>[Joel Matip has vowed to continue taking calculated risks at Liverpool]</b> I’m a defender but I really enjoy to have the ball in all situations. We have the ball quite often and I try to help my team-mates and try to do something for the team to create something. I really enjoy it. I think it’s not bad if you enjoy the way you play. When I was young I tried to play from the back. I think that’s just the way I am, the way I play. Sometimes it helps and I hope that it will help our team. Maybe I should not do it every few minutes but I think he <b>[Klopp]</b> trusts me. If I step in and the risk is not too high and I can help the team then it’s helpful.<br /><br />I know what I can do and shooting is not my favourite part, so I think it’s better to leave the shooting for some others! But maybe one day I will be in a better position and also can score with a shot.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool centre-back Joel Matip is confident his team can finish off a fantastic season by beating Tottenham and winning the Champions League]</b> It was a great season and we can finish it. It’s the biggest game during this season and we will do everything for this. It will be a completely different game, but we know we can beat them and we are looking forward.<br /><br />At the beginning of the season I was struggling with injuries and other lads did very well, so there was no reason to change. But in the second half I could play and could improve. I feel good. You are waiting for this. And then if you can use it, it’s not a bad feeling - it’s not the worst feeling</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s Joel Matip has praised manager <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s impact on both the team and the city]</b> Everyone in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has worked very hard for this. But <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is the decisive factor. He has put the team together and led it to where it is now. No question: <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is the mastermind of this title. He is a ‘human catcher’ who conquered the whole city of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - or maybe even whole England - with his enthusiasm. The club, the city, the team, everyone is straight behind him, unconditionally. It’s something like Kloppomania here! Because he is how he is. Genuine and real - simply Kloppo.<br /><br /><b>[Matip admits the scenes in Madrid - and back in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - were like nothing he has ever seen before]</b> It is still hard to realise. It’s simply madness what our win has triggered. The whole city was dressed in red when we came back from Madrid. The pure joy, like an ecstasy. These pictures will always remain in my mind. An unbelievable experience<br /><br /><b>[Matip joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in 2016 from the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and revealed he could one day return to the German top flight]</b> In football nothing is impossible. At the moment I still have two years remaining in my contract here at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. After some problems and injuries at the beginning meanwhile I feel very comfortable here. And I’ve been more mature as a player and as a person here in England</p>

  <p><b>[Matip reveals awkward encounter with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> star after <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> comeback]</b> After the game, we lined up arm-in-arm in front of the Kop together and sang ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ with the fans. That was one of the most beautiful moments of my career, maybe on the same level as my debut for Schalke in Munich. I didn’t care about anything; I was floating on air after singing with the fans. And when I came into the doping test room, there was a guy sitting there pretty depressed - <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>. You know each other from the pitch, but it’s not like you sit around with them every day in a small room like you’re getting coffee. Everyone is celebrating, and I’m sitting in a cubicle with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> and his players still aren’t always on quite the same wavelength]</b> Sometimes I’m the only one in the dressing room who understands his jokes straight away. I sit on the side and watch the others thinking about it. When the coach says things like ‘that was not the yellow from the egg,’ which means ‘that wasn’t exactly brilliant,’ only the assistant coach and I burst out laughing. Then I have to explain what the sentences mean to the others<br /><br /><b>[Matip also reserved some praise for <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>]</b> The boy dresses as if he had completely stripped a mannequin.

I thought maybe in 20 seconds there would be a corner coming in or something like this; I came forward and had a nice view of the whole situation. It was crazy. I couldn’t believe it, I didn’t know what had happened because he just put the ball in. I thought, ‘What is this?’ Then I saw Divock there and the ball in the net afterwards <b>[…]</b> I was a little bit confused, to be honest. But after a few seconds, everybody was celebrating so I just joined in<br /><br />I think after Gini’s <b>[<a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Wijnaldum</a>]</b> first one it was like, ‘Oh, we’re going to win this game’ because we’d played well. After his second, I thought, ‘OK, today we can do it’. But you never know because you know who you play against and you don’t even have to play badly, these strikers can have a magic moment and can score.<br /><br />Of course, the game in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> was not bad but they scored three goals and we knew it would be a really tough, tough game at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> - we knew we’d need something special to happen if we were to reach the final. We thought, ‘Let’s win this game’ but we never could have imagined how it would turn out in the end. Of course, we’d played so well there, in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>, against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, against one of the strongest sides in the world at home, so there was something to be positive about - but they scored the goals and we didn’t. We knew if we repeated that performance, make a few adaptations and use our chances, then for sure everyone was confident we could beat them on the night, but we didn’t think about the result in the end. Of course, if you miss some players with the quality of Bobby <b>[<a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>]</b> and Mo <b>[<a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>]</b>, every team would miss them and it’s not perfect.
