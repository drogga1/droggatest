  <p><b>[From ‘invincible’ at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to ‘movie star’ status in India: Graham Stack’s remarkable story]</b> I’ve never been someone who just settles. I’ve always wanted to test myself<br /><br /><b>[It’s that type of attitude that saw Stack play for 12 different clubs during a career which begun at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in 2000 and ended with non-league side Eastleigh in 2018]</b> I was always keen to just go and play. My career reflects that because I had loan move after loan move. I always wanted to test myself.<br /><br /><b>[For the past two years he has been doing a degree in sports writing and broadcasting at Staffordshire University]</b> It was tough. It was late nights, early mornings. Days off were never days off because I had deadlines, research and reading to do. So, it was hard, but I wanted to prove to my kids I could do something. I was really motivated to pass and to show them that I wasn’t just an ex-footballer. I also wanted to do it because if I do go into broadcasting in the future, I didn’t want to just rock up without knowing what goes on behind the scenes in the industry<br /><br /><b>[And although he didn’t play a game in the league, he still feels he played his part in a feat that would earn <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s legendary side the nickname ‘The Invincibles’]</b> I felt a lot of responsibility that season because we never took a goalkeeper coach to away games. We never had a coach to warm Jens up for home games. I was in charge of making sure one of the best goalkeepers in the country was revved up and ready for a game. I took that very seriously, it was a big job for me and I always felt under pressure to do it right<br /><br />Saving and scoring a penalty on your debut at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Highbury</a>, that was what dreams are made of. All my family and friends were there. Even now it gives me shivers. <br /><br /><b>[Chelsea’s failure to win at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> earlier in the day meant that a point would be enough for <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s side to be crowned champions at the home of their north London rivals - and they secured it following a dramatic 2-2 draw]</b> That was unreal. It’s one of the greatest memories I’ve got. I’ll never forget on the way to the game being sat at the back of the coach and there were bottles and bricks coming at us. There was police everywhere and the coach got absolutely battered. I think they smashed the window at the back. It was hostile, but I always thought our lads thrived on that. I was thinking, ‘Don’t upset this lot, don’t make them angry, because it will come back to hurt you’. That was the type of group we had, <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a>, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>, <a href="sol-campbell.html">Sol Campbell</a>, <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>. They don’t get fazed by stuff like that, in fact it turned them on a little bit. Being out on the pitch during the celebrations was incredible. I’ve never claimed to be a key part of that squad, because I wasn’t. I wasn’t integral. But I was certainly part of it and nobody will ever take that away from me<br /><br /><b>[His contract expired in 2016 and while he was waiting on an offer of a new deal, a phone call arrived from an old friend which gave him an opportunity to take his career in a completely different direction]</b> Steve Coppell called, he was going to India and wanted a keeper/coach. He said, ‘We play in front of 70,000 each week - do you fancy it? I said, ‘I’ll have some of that’.<br /><br /><b>[So, Stack joined the Kerala Blasters, an Indian Super League team which at the time was owned by cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar]</b> It opened my mind up. It gave me a focus - I found a love for writing because I had time on my hands and that led on to me starting my degree, really. I got over there and it was people from all round India, different cultures, religions, languages all thrown into one team. We lived together in the same hotel, the whole squad. We did absolutely everything together. It was so intense.<br /><br />Going to games was mental. The streets were mobbed, grown men with their faces painted, scarves, flags, everything. I was mobbed just going to get my hair cut and the local shopping centre. I felt like a movie star! I didn’t have my family with me, so it was tough, but I got to see the backwaters of Alleppey, I played cricket in the streets of Mumbai with locals, I was there for Diwali. I did things I never thought I would experience</p>
