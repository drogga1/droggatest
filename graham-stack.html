  <p><b>[Graham Stack - Indian Super League needs to invest more in infrastructure for youngsters]</b> It’s the same for so many footballers. You are getting to that nervous stage where your contract is coming up quickly and you are thinking, is this it? I had loved my time at Barnet and wanted to stay, but then the contract came up and I spent a summer without pay trying to earn another one. I eventually was offered one with Barnet, but I also had this offer which came out of nowhere with Kerala. I decided to take a gamble and go to India.<br /><br />It was incredibly difficult leaving my family. I was missing my son’s first day at school and my wife’s birthday. It was especially hard knowing that I wouldn’t see them for months. I arrived in India and, within the first hour, it was sensory overload just like everybody tells you. I was shoved out of the way in a queue, then I got in a taxi with a driver going at full speed through the city. I just felt I had to go with it and embrace it. We were often travelling to different cities and you saw a lot of things. Some things really upset me. As a dad, it’s very difficult to see children hungry on the streets with nothing, and then in contrast there’s huge wealth. That contrast is something that everyone talks to you before coming to India, but you can never get used to it<br /><br />You have to be patient. The facilities and coaching that we take for granted in England aren’t available in many places, so we’d focus a lot of the basics. Once we got those done, you could see the improvement was incredible. They are doing the right things with the league, but they need to invest in a solid coaching infrastructure for young Indian players<br /><br />In India, cricket remains number one and there is nobody quite like Sachin there. He has to be guarded everywhere he goes such is the adoration that people in India have for him. We were lucky to get to spend some time with him and he couldn’t have been anymore humble or welcoming to all of us playing in Kerala<br /><br />I had let in a hat-trick from Diego Forlán. It was an away game, so when we returned to Kerala I was a bit nervous about facing our fans. First time I see them after this bad defeat, they’re all profusely thanking me for trying my best and assuring me that the team would come back stronger. I thought I’m seriously a long way from home now.<br /><br />I never realised just how passionate the Kerala fans were going to be. They model themselves on Dortmund fans and create this huge yellow sea of colour. Every single fan wears yellow for games. We played in front of 60,000 fans who couldn’t have been any more passionate or loyal. I remember going to Starbucks with my missus and she couldn’t believe it when we got surrounded for autographs and selfies. That’s the level of passion there.<br /><br />There would be games when we would play badly and lose, and fans would still come up to you and thank you. They just have such a love for the game that their optimism would eventually rub off on you. It’s certainly a difference from the abuse I’d normally have been used to after a bad run of games</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal goalkeeper Graham Stack has thrown open the possibility of him returning to the Kochi-based franchise]</b> We <b>[Kerala Blasters]</b> got to the final of the ISL and lost but it was a great experience. I could potentially go back and link up with Steve Coppell if he went there but I’m under contract here so I don’t know.<br /><br />Obviously you have bigger teams in the league like Delhi Dynamos, Mumbai City FC and Atletico de Kolkata but in Kerala and Kolkata, football was predominant. You’d think cricket would dominate but it doesn’t<br /><br />Cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar was our owner but even then, it was completely football in Kerala. They are fanatical about football. On the way to games, even the police are there singing and dancing with the crowd. They don’t think they are superior. There was never any trouble I faced with respect to security either. The biggest thing for me in Kerala was playing in front of 70000 supporters<br /><br /><b>[Stack spoke about why he decided to sign up for the ISL challenge back in 2016]</b> I was at Barnet. I was offered another year at which stage Steve Coppell was announced as Kerala Blasters manager. I had already worked with him as a player. Also, having done my coaching badges, I thought we could do something together over there. He actually came to watch me play and wanted to see if I was capable. Then I had a chat with my family and decided to move. It was a big decision moving to the other side of the world, leaving my wife and four children.<br /><br />There were some really good Indian players there and certainly in our team and I think if they were allowed to play here, they would be able to play in the top half of the championship. We stayed in five star hotels and were treated like movie stars. We were looked after very well but the training facilities were poor and the grass needs a lot of work. But they have this U17 World Cup coming up and I’m led to believe they’ve invested a lot into improving the facilities</p>

  <p><b>[From ‘invincible’ at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to ‘movie star’ status in India: Graham Stack’s remarkable story]</b> I’ve never been someone who just settles. I’ve always wanted to test myself<br /><br /><b>[It’s that type of attitude that saw Stack play for 12 different clubs during a career which begun at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in 2000 and ended with non-league side Eastleigh in 2018]</b> I was always keen to just go and play. My career reflects that because I had loan move after loan move. I always wanted to test myself.<br /><br /><b>[For the past two years he has been doing a degree in sports writing and broadcasting at Staffordshire University]</b> It was tough. It was late nights, early mornings. Days off were never days off because I had deadlines, research and reading to do. So, it was hard, but I wanted to prove to my kids I could do something. I was really motivated to pass and to show them that I wasn’t just an ex-footballer. I also wanted to do it because if I do go into broadcasting in the future, I didn’t want to just rock up without knowing what goes on behind the scenes in the industry<br /><br /><b>[And although he didn’t play a game in the league, he still feels he played his part in a feat that would earn <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s legendary side the nickname ‘The Invincibles’]</b> I felt a lot of responsibility that season because we never took a goalkeeper coach to away games. We never had a coach to warm Jens up for home games. I was in charge of making sure one of the best goalkeepers in the country was revved up and ready for a game. I took that very seriously, it was a big job for me and I always felt under pressure to do it right<br /><br />Saving and scoring a penalty on your debut at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Highbury</a>, that was what dreams are made of. All my family and friends were there. Even now it gives me shivers.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s failure to win at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> earlier in the day meant that a point would be enough for <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s side to be crowned champions at the home of their north London rivals - and they secured it following a dramatic 2-2 draw]</b> That was unreal. It’s one of the greatest memories I’ve got. I’ll never forget on the way to the game being sat at the back of the coach and there were bottles and bricks coming at us. There was police everywhere and the coach got absolutely battered. I think they smashed the window at the back. It was hostile, but I always thought our lads thrived on that. I was thinking, ‘Don’t upset this lot, don’t make them angry, because it will come back to hurt you’. That was the type of group we had, <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a>, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>, <a href="sol-campbell.html">Sol Campbell</a>, <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>. They don’t get fazed by stuff like that, in fact it turned them on a little bit. Being out on the pitch during the celebrations was incredible. I’ve never claimed to be a key part of that squad, because I wasn’t. I wasn’t integral. But I was certainly part of it and nobody will ever take that away from me<br /><br /><b>[His contract expired in 2016 and while he was waiting on an offer of a new deal, a phone call arrived from an old friend which gave him an opportunity to take his career in a completely different direction]</b> Steve Coppell called, he was going to India and wanted a keeper/coach. He said, ‘We play in front of 70,000 each week - do you fancy it? I said, ‘I’ll have some of that’.<br /><br /><b>[So, Stack joined the Kerala Blasters, an Indian Super League team which at the time was owned by cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar]</b> It opened my mind up. It gave me a focus - I found a love for writing because I had time on my hands and that led on to me starting my degree, really. I got over there and it was people from all round India, different cultures, religions, languages all thrown into one team. We lived together in the same hotel, the whole squad. We did absolutely everything together. It was so intense.<br /><br />Going to games was mental. The streets were mobbed, grown men with their faces painted, scarves, flags, everything. I was mobbed just going to get my hair cut and the local shopping centre. I felt like a movie star! I didn’t have my family with me, so it was tough, but I got to see the backwaters of Alleppey, I played cricket in the streets of Mumbai with locals, I was there for Diwali. I did things I never thought I would experience</p>
