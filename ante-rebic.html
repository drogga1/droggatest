  <p><b>[Eintracht Frankfurt’s DFB-Pokal hero Ante Rebic has suggested he would find it difficult to turn down any approach from the team he conquered]</b> Niko Kovac and I have always been a good match. We were in the U-21 team, and in the A class. I enjoy working under him, Thanks to him, he is going to Bayern and we will see what a new season will bring. I’m not even thinking about it <b>[a transfer]</b>. Now I just want to rest well, the season has been long and arduous. Bayern? You all know, it’s hard to resist the call of a large club like Bayern.</p>

  <p><b>[Ante Rebic was so disappointed in Argentina’s performance and conduct in Croatia’s 3-0 win over them that he decided not to ask Lionel Messi to swap jerseys]</b> To be honest, I wanted to get Messi’s jersey for my friend, who is a big fan of Leo. But the Argentines made such a bad impression on me that I gave up on asking Messi for his jersey. Honestly, I expected much more. At least of those players from the Premier League, who are used to a high tempo and duels. You saw Nicolas Otamendi - in the fourth minute Mandzukic passed by him and he was rolling on the floor. I am disappointed by their behaviour and lack of fair play, not to mention how they provoked us. An athlete should know how to deal with defeat.<br /><br />The referee was not of a quality level and it is not the first time it has happened at the World Cup, with many referees without experience in some of biggest competitions like the Champions League. We felt a lot of decisions went Argentina’s way, so I was sure he wasn’t going to show me a second yellow card. I appreciate this is the World Cup and you have to have referees from all over, but it’s important that these matches be led by referees who can match the importance and the pace of the match. For example, the referee didn’t even have football boots but only regular sneakers! That shocked us. I feel sorry to be nervous about some referee’s decisions now rather than enjoying my goal and the fact we smashed Argentina. When Otamendi deliberately kicked Rakitic with the ball, that was clear red card. But, it only makes our victory sweeter<br /><br />I don’t even know how many messages I received after the match! This was the best game I’ve played for Croatia and, along with the recent German Cup final against Bayern, the best in my career. I’ve looked at my goal 100 times by now. Turned out pretty good, didn’t it? I thought defenders would catch me if I was to bring the ball down and control it before shooting, so I shot first time without thinking much. I had big chance at the end of first half. I did everything wrong: first touch, shot, I didn’t pass the ball… Luckily the half-time break arrived, I needed it to pull myself together. After the Nigeria game we didn’t celebrate much. I spent most of the time at the doping test, but this time we celebrated in the locker room, the bus, the plane… But, we shouldn’t stop here, now that we’ve passed the group stage</p>

  <p><b>[Thank you, Croatia, for the most beautiful World Cup fairytale]</b> We’ve been together for 50 days and not had the smallest incident! Believe me, I know from my clubs, that usually never happens. After a week of so many guys together, things start to crack.</p>

  <p><b>[Croatia’s World Cup hero Ante Rebic has admitted he has received concrete offers to leave Eintracht Frankfurt]</b> I am obviously glad to hear and read about how many big coaches and clubs are asking about me. Honestly, I think I deserved it! I had a great World Cup and an even better club season with Eintracht. Yes, I know there are concrete offers, I keep in regular contact with my agent. I’m glad I proved that everyone can count on me, but as I said there is enough time left until transfer window closes.<br /><br />Transfer offers? It’s still early for those stories, the transfer window is open for almost another month. When I moved to Fiorentina the transfer was completed on August 29, and my transfer to Eintracht was done on August 31. Most transfers are done during the last days <b>[of the window]</b> so that is when my situation will be more clear. Now I am an Eintracht player and I have returned to training with my team<br /><br />We are still not aware of what we did in Russia. Only a few days after the final I watched the match and saw the way we conceded the first goal, then the second and it was not easy to get back into the match after such obvious refereeing mistakes. But we gave our best and have no regrets</p>

  <p><b>[Ante Rebic snubbed the likes of Manchester United and Tottenham to sign fresh terms at Eintracht Frankfurt]</b> “I didn’t want to go anywhere. I feel great in Frankfurt, am playing well and I’m happy. There were a lot of offers this summer but Eintracht showed how much they appreciate me. They offered me a new contract, I signed it, although they always knew that I would. There’s enough time in my career to make a move, perhaps as soon as next summer.<br /><br />I have a good relationship with new coach Hutter, he seems like a nice guy and, for sure, he is a good coach. My life without Niko Kovac? I don’t have a problem with that and I wish him all the best at Bayern<br /><br /><b>[Luka Modric earning him the Golden Ball and FIFA Best Award]</b> Luka really deserved it, with his work, approach and ultimately his displays. He won the Champions League with Real Madrid, took Croatia to another place in the world game, but he remains the same person and I’m very happy for him. He deserved these individual awards and we can all be proud that we have the honour to play with the best footballers in the world while with the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Frankfurt’s forward trio more potent than Liverpool trident]</b> The three of us are doing very well in Frankfurt, we and the whole team have a lot of fun together. It’s an enjoyable time. Nobody knows what’s going to happen in the football business. Luka and Ante have certainly gotten the attention of other clubs. If an offer were so good for them that they had to leave because of it, everyone here would be happy for them</p>
