  <p><b>[Former Manchester United defender Paul Parker believes Wayne Rooney has to consider leaving Old Trafford]</b> It all depends on what Wayne wants to do. Does he want to stay at Manchester United and get the odd opportunity to make his record even harder to beat or is he saying that he wants regular football? I would like to think that he doesn’t want to sit on the bench because being successful and winning things then sitting and watching it is an awful feeling. I know what it’s like to taste that then become a bit-part and it must be even worse for Wayne. So does he want to stay and just pick up his money with the camera panning to him on the bench while everyone wonders if he’ll get a game? Then if he does everyone expects him to score.<br /><br />If he’s not playing regularly then somewhere down the line England can’t pick him. I don’t care what Gareth Southgate is being told by the FA, if he picks him he would be deemed a puppet. If someone isn’t starting regularly for their club to then pick him for a full international qualifier doesn’t make sense and it wouldn’t fare well with the other players.<br /><br />Seeing the calibre of players who have gone out there to China, it’s never too early and we know the reasons why, but if we’re considering his international career then it doesn’t make sense to go to either China or the MLS. Yes, David Beckham still played for England regularly while in the MLS but we know that was down to marketing reasons, with the FA insisting he had to be involved.<br /><br />Under a Bobby Robson or a Terry Venables they would have known you cannot pick someone playing that level of football and Wayne will look at this and realise it just gives people ammunition to say he’s too far away and playing an inferior level of football to represent his country<br /><br />You have to say Manchester United are winning games now and are definitely competing for a Champions League spot especially with the confidence you get from an unbeaten run. And who knows, with a lot of luck Chelsea can still be caught because we’re not into March yet and there are still enough points. The main thing is they are competing, which is what we weren’t getting in previous seasons. The League Cup is always big when you need to win something and Manchester United need to win something. Mourinho knows how important it is because he knows what it means for a big club to win trophies. The FA Cup aside it’s been a while now</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is yet to justify his £89 million price tag and sums up Manchester United’s problems]</b> Pogba sums up United’s problems. He is not a holding midfielder. So much has been taken away from his game. I think he’s tried too hard to impress this season after that world record £89m price tag. He’s been having too many touches of the ball which isn’t really in his nature. He’s also been giving away silly fouls because people are working harder against him. He hasn’t had the greatest of seasons. Expectations are high. United have got to kick on, Mourinho has to kick on and he’s got to kick on. He can do what he wants with his Twitter emoji, dancing and his hair when he is part of a United side that are the real deal</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba’s positional troubles at Manchester United are frustrating but he may be perfect for a No. 10 role]</b> When I joined United, Sir Alex <b>[Ferguson]</b> signed me because of my defensive qualities and what I could add to the team from that perspective. The improvements I made and tweaks to how I performed were implemented along the way, and I guess in Pogba’s case that’s what we are not seeing at the moment, because he’s being asked to play in a position he’s not entirely comfortable with. We know he’s got outstanding qualities but while he isn’t being played in his favoured role, on the left hand side of a midfield three, he finds it difficult. Certainly defensively anyway. It’s frustrating if you’re a United supporter because we’ve seen what he can do in that role for Juventus and at times for France. The game comes very easy to Pogba and I just wonder, if long-term, he might be better suited in the number 10 role, where he can do what he likes more or less in that final part of the pitch.<br /><br />Pogba’s at his best when he can be creative and make things happen going forward. Remove the shackles and get him in positions where he can go at players one versus one, or has the freedom to run in behind and ask questions of the opposition defence that way. We know already that he gets on well with Romelu Lukaku, so why not try and get them nearer to one another on the pitch too, and see how that works. Footballers are commodities and it’s a very different game to when I played. But somehow, Mourinho has to get Pogba playing in a way that makes the team better, and in the end, I think he will. Mourinho has a track record of success everywhere he’s been and he’ll know he has a better chance of continuing that run with Pogba in his starting XI..</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has not evolved as quickly as arch-rival Pep Guardiola]</b> When you look at the gulf in points and the manner in which it’s all been done it just hasn’t been good for Manchester United. City have done it in a fashion that is good on the eye and the way every team would love to play. Everybody has thoroughly enjoyed watching it which makes it even worse for United. In the modern game it doesn’t allow you to be physical and that affords City to play as they do. As far as I’m concerned it’s been like watching Barcelona in the Premier League.<br /><br />Without a doubt the modern game suits Pep Guardiola more than Jose Mourinho. The style of it. The lack of physicality. When you look at Pep and Jose you have to say there is a massive gap. Pep is evolving and he realises that the game offers him more scope now with what he wants to do because of how the game is going. As a coach Mourinho has not really evolved and he’s still doing what he did at Porto and Inter Milan. You have to move on. Sir Alex moved on and got different coaches who had different coaches and because of that United still won titles and still dominated.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is yet to justify an £89 million price tag at Manchester United]</b> Can Pogba become the player he wants to be? He can but his priority has got to be his football - that should stick out more than his hair. It’s fine to have all the haircuts and emojis and whatever but to earn all that, go and do your talking on the pitch. Everybody knows he can do it because everybody saw him at Juventus. He was fantastic in that style of play and the players around him helped him. So he needs help and his first priority when he’s asked what he wants to be and replies that he wants to be the best player in this team is to say, ‘well forget your hairdresser for a while’. Just go out there and become a player first then you can do what you want with your hair because people won’t notice anyway because they’ll only see the player. De Bruyne won’t do anything with his hair and he doesn’t have an emoji: he’s playing football and when you talk about the best five players in the world you’ll mention Messi, Ronaldo, <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah and De Bruyne will be in there. When you mention Pogba people will have a little bit of a laugh then talk about his hair and the problems he has with <b>[Jose]</b> Mourinho. That’s not really what you should be known for when you cost £89m.<br /><br />You have to wonder whether Gareth Bale would fit in. Where would he play? He’s not a wide player anymore and likes to do his work through the middle. There are a lot of players who are already placed in the middle and the problem is a need for someone who is happy to provide width and stay out wide. <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial wants to come in. <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford wants to come in and is very good at it. Bale would just be another player who wants to be a centre-forward. From a marketing side it makes sense but you have to ask if Gareth Bale would be comfortable there and given freedom. He’s not a player to track back and his first thought is always offensive and to run at people with pace and will he be given a chance to do that?</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has failed to adapt sufficiently to the rigours of the modern game]</b> They have been a million miles apart, not just with points but with ideas and the way they want to play have gone out of the modern game. The changing of the game has worked in the favour of Manchester City. Manchester United haven’t really moved forward in their game. It is very much very regimented in what they are trying to do. It could in some times guarantee some results, but not in today’s football. It hasn’t worked for Manchester United. Next season they need to change up their game for them to get anywhere near Manchester City.<br /><br />The Bournemouth game: I have seen Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester City go there and totally dominate Bournemouth, but Manchester United just got over the line. Just got a result. There has been too much of that this season. They need to get back that fear factor</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United need to part with Jose Mourinho]</b> There has been so much poor football. Performances have been poor and too many people are out there saying he is a winner and it is just about winning. Manchester United are not just about winning. They’re about a style, the manner they win in. It is about a swagger. They are not doing that any more. That has been taken away from them, that has been virtually coached out of them. There is no self expression any more, they do not improvise. You are paying players millions and millions and still trying to control them. That does not make sense for a club like Manchester United. At the end of the day, Manchester United have to change. Their style of play is not going to change while Jose Mourinho is in charge. It is the way in which he manages which is pulling the players down.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba’s reluctance to commit to Manchester United amid talk of interest from Barcelona is making the Red Devils look amateur]</b> What’s coming out of Manchester United PR-wise is something you expect from a club five or six levels below - it’s not top-level PR. Sometimes you can’t give the devil what he wants and if that’s what he’s looking for, if he’s trying to dictate and control, you don’t give it. Footballers in today’s game are commodities and a group of them together speak louder than any one manager. It wouldn’t have happened 20 years ago, because players were there just to play football and we knew where we stood. If we shouted too loud, we were lucky if we were only shouted down, but at the worst we’d lose our jobs. But today, players don’t lose their jobs.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho was never right for Manchester United]</b> When you’re playing the game, you want to give 100 per cent and you should be trying to give 100 per cent but it may not be good enough on that day. If Jose is saying he’s giving 100 per cent, it’s not good enough for Manchester United at this moment and quite a bit before that as well. Manchester United haven’t evolved really since he’s been there. We can talk about two trophies, two trophies which he deemed meaningless before he joined Manchester United but he absolutely adored them when he became Manchester United manager. We have to look at performances and performances from day one haven’t been good enough. I don’t think it should have allowed a club like Manchester United to go the way they are. The reason why they have gone the way they are is that they did go a little bit against the grain with three managers in a short space of time but what they’ve gone and done is, more than anything, when they went to the all-important one after <b>[Louis van Gaal]</b>, they went to somebody just for the sake of what they believed and what everyone called him was a winner. When you employ Jose Mourinho, you might get someone who can maybe win you trophies but you have to put up with everything else that goes with it. He was never right for Manchester United and that has been proven by what has happened now. There are too many unhappy people. People can blame up top, they can blame Jose but at the end of the day you have to look at the person who is actually failing the ship and that is Jose Mourinho. He has not done his job properly..<br /><br /><b>[Asked if defeat to Valencia in the Champions League on Tuesday could spell the end of Mourinho]</b> Winning or losing against Valencia shouldn’t make any difference at all. I think everything is there in front of them already to know that this isn’t going to be a long-term relationship anymore. This isn’t going to be able to carry on. It’s just ridiculous what’s going on. The club is not going to be able to get itself back to where it should be in the way it’s being run in this moment in time. It needs a change now. Is it a change like straight away going and playing the swashbuckling football? No, because that can’t happen. It needs a change to go and get a bit of love back in that dressing room where the players want to come in, get in the dressing room, laugh and joke, get on the training ground and have a smile, but know when it’s the right time to start working. <b>[They need to know they can]</b> get on the pitch and play with the shackles off. So that, if they make a mistake, <b>[they know]</b> they’re not going to get cussed or persecuted for it. I think that’s all it needs and the rest of it will follow, but slowly. You don’t suddenly become Manchester United of old because you’ve suddenly changed the manager. Zidane, as he’s been mooted everywhere, is no guarantee. You have to remember what he walked into when he got his first proper managerial job. It was incredible what he walked into and he sustained it at Real Madrid which is a difficult job and you have to respect him for that. But now, if he’s going to come into Manchester United, he’s going to be a novice and people have to remember that. But football doesn’t allow anything like that. If you’re Zinedine Zidane and you come into Manchester United - sorry, there’s no time for you to get your tracksuit on, you’ve got to go out and win your first game</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino could have his own statue outside the ground at Tottenham]</b> Everyone will talk about Mauricio Pochettino taking on the Manchester United job at the end of the season. Poch is moving into an unbelievable stadium with Spurs. If the chairman Daniel Levy can give him a little bit of money in the new stadium to improve certain bits of his squad with the young players, why would he leave there? If he can win a first English title with Tottenham since 1961, suddenly he’s going to have his own statue outside the ground. If he wins it for Manchester United, they will say ‘we expect you to do that: that’s why you are here’. Why would Pochettino want to go straight to United after all he has built at Tottenham over the past four years? People will shout about the size of United and the money he would have to spend, but football is not like that any more. People don’t automatically go and play for United because of the name. First of all, they think they want to be in London and secondly, they think who the coach is. They all want to be around London. Even Mourinho stayed in London as United manager.<br /><br />If the coach is right, the players are there. Look at Liverpool. Why have Liverpool brought all those exciting players to Anfield? It is Liverpool to a point, but it is mainly because of Jurgen Klopp. Liverpool’s history comes in after that. If United get the right coach, they can attract better players. If Mourinho had stayed on, he wouldn’t have signed any great players because they know it is was going to be a dispiriting existence. United need a coach that connects with the players, and makes them the priority. Games are won and lost by what happens before players go on the pitch. If you get them tuned up physically and mentally right, the football takes care of itself. The problem with United is that those players were not prepared properly mentally, being run by a manager whose face was screwed up like a bulldog chewing a wasp. That is not a good look. United need a proper coach, a figure who can develop young talent without constantly demanding money. Pochettino fits the bill for United, but I’m not convinced he will give up what he is building at Tottenham</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United have been urged to embrace their brighter future by appointing Edwin van der Sar as sporting director]</b> Looking ahead, I feel they need a sporting director in the European model. Someone who has been around, is respected by agents, and knows them well enough to go and get the very best players because of his reputation. Manchester United would be in a position then to attract serious players when they are competing against similar heavyweight clubs in the market. I really think the sporting director model can work for United. Fergie is obviously there for advice whenever Ole needs it, but a sporting director would be a big help for a young coach moving forward. I think someone like Edwin van der Sar, the Ajax chief executive, would fit the bill because he has football and business experience which would make him the ideal candidate. He knows the club very well, is well respected at Manchester United as a person and for the fact that top players know his name too.<br /><br />Players look at the present and how they are moving forward in their careers. They are not like Mourinho, living in the past with his treble from Italy. United and Liverpool are moving forward now. We have to say that if you get the right manager, you can get the right personnel. You look at the impact Jurgen Klopp has had on Liverpool. Players look at Klopp first as a coach. Secondly, they look at Liverpool as a club. It is vital to get the right people in the right positions. The more bling you have round your neck, around your football club, you will attract the top talent to play at that club. United have to compete again in attracting the top talent. Players can see adulation, and they can smell success that brings more adulation. That is what you want as a player at any club. You want the feeling that you are joining a club on the up. If United have Van der Sar involved on the business side, and Solskjaer on the coaching side, it would be an attractive proposition for any player</p>

United have never won a game against Barcelona in the Camp Nou. The spirit of the 1999 final and their success in the Champions League against Bayern Munich doesn’t come into it. The mentally strong players that were there in 1999 don’t really exist these days. Not just at United, but across football. Fred has produced better form in Europe than he has been offering in England. Scott McTominay has excelled against Paris Saint-Germain and Barca, and was more confident on the ball than most United players, but they were up against a Barcelona team that was way off. United have a lot more squad players than players that can be trusted to play regularly in the first team, and that is an issue that will take time to change</p>

Somewhere down the line it was always going to come out in the wash that he’s not good enough for that position - and it’s come out at the worst possible time when United were playing very poorly. It’s easy to pick on that individual because everyone knows his weaknesses. United have got two right-backs there - one in Matteo Darmian and one in Diogo Dalot - they should trust in them to play in those positions and say, ‘right, you’ve come as a right-back, go and prove you’re a right-back’. When I’ve seen Dalot play at right-back for United he hasn’t looked assured, but he might need time to play in that position</p>

He was acting like he was at Carlisle United, not Manchester United.<br /><br />Things might have tailed off for United under <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>, but Mourinho doesn’t get it. When you come in as an interim manager, your job is to fill a role. You have to pacify players and you don’t do that by going in and shouting at everyone. You calm things down at the club and then start to earn the respect of the players. To be fair, Mourinho might have a point about some of the players, but it doesn’t mean he was right to carry on as he did. They might have been difficult to work with. Some of them were stale, some of them were bad apples, and some of them weren’t good enough to challenge at the top, but <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> didn’t ruin the atmosphere at the club, instead he gave them hope.<br /><br />Look at the game against Paris Saint-Germain, they could never have done that under Mourinho. You have to work with what you’ve got, whether you think there should be improvements or not. He was the one to blow his golden opportunity - it’s not anybody else’s fault. He didn’t buy well, and he bought Alexis Sanchez, which was a disaster for the club’s finances and the team. He was fitting a square peg into a round hole, and it was totally unnecessary. Nobody made him do that. The problem with Mourinho was that he wanted to be a manager, which misses out at least half of the responsibility of the job, which was to be a coach.<br /><br />He’d worked under one of the great man managers, Bobby Robson, but it seemed he learned nothing from him. When Bobby saw weakness, he managed it and mitigated it, he didn’t scream and shout. The very best managers plan for a year ahead, they don’t burn all their bridges in anticipation of problems</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Parker says <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> is the best right-back in the country]</b> I saw <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a> play a lot of times last season, both at home and away with <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>, and I’ve said constantly that, for me, he’s the best right-back in the country.

He’s the best full-back in the one against one situation, without a doubt. People can get past him, but he’s got good pace, he knows when to tackle, he does slide in and he does remind me of Des Walker in the way he defends - long-legged running style, but covers the ground quick. He enjoys defending, which is a rarity as most players now like to make their name going forwards, being great crossers, overlapping and scoring goals. His priorities are defending and he thrives on making tackles.<br /><br />Playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, he’ll soon realise the difference it makes in your life. It puts more pressure on you, and it’s important you use that and take it forward, because if you do that, and it goes the right way, there’s no better place to be. He has to close everything off around him, because the game’s changed so much now. He’s got to understand that there’s going to be pressures on him both on and off the pitch. He needs to keep everyone he knows close to him. He has the opportunity to go on and compete to become England’s right-back, because there’s no certainty over who is England’s guaranteed right-back at the moment - it’s still open. The move gives him a better chance as he’s gone to United, and if he starts delivering there, that puts more pressure on <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> to choose him.

They capitulated - their performance at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> (a 4-0 defeat in April) was like an ostrich sticking its head in the sand, it was awful.

There’s been talk of <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> coming in there, and then up front, <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> wasn’t the ideal frontman that United need. If you take <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>’s goals away, there wasn’t enough substance. They need another centre-forward as at the moment they’ve not got anywhere near enough, they can’t rely on what they’ve got unless someone hits the ground running and keeps at that pace throughout the nine months of the season</p>

So the only way realistically that they can qualify for the Champions League is via the back door. However, it won’t be easy, having watched Rangers and <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. I tell you what, if everyone’s talking about United winning the whole thing, both those sides will be saying it too because they were excellent. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are still left too and there is also serial winners <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>. It’s not an easy competition to win but it is United’s way to the Champions League<br /><br />The United boss needs to decide on his best 11 or 12 players, get consistency and get points on the board and try to play that 11 as often as possible. At the end of the day when you look at some of the sides in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, we are not talking about five or six great players in each team, we talk about the whole team. With United, they don’t have great individuals but they’re not a team either, so they’re playing games of football off the name of Man Utd</p>

They’re still the number-one talking point but Ole and his players just need to ignore the criticism and focus on winning games of football because there’s still so much to play for.<br /><br />Anything can happen in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and remember that United won the Europa League under <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> with a poor team - and a bit of luck. I certainly wouldn’t have <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> down as home bankers to beat them at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>. The English press always seem to want to write great things about <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> but if it was someone else doing a similar job at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> then they might be under more pressure. They have not been great at home this season and United’s record in these big games is decent</p>

They just need it to move on. It’s not about when he comes back, don’t even wait for that. Just move him on now and take his agent with him. His agent has said a lot of stuff, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> hasn’t said anything. There are enough opportunities for him to come out and set the record straight. If he came out and said he wants to leave, a lot more respect would be had.

If the real <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> was there, with <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> and <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> around as well, that would be a good combination.

He’s bringing too much negativity to the club. His quality is incredible, but he’s averaged about one performance in 10, that’s how bad he’s been. I think they need to shift on from him now, I see any comeback now as being very, very difficult. He’s been a bad fit all round.<br /><br />When you see <b>[Romelu]</b> <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> now scoring loads of goals, he had to leave because he was affecting the club and the dressing room - it was the right decision. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>’s agent says he sees <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> as his home. He left his home for a package holiday, the package was the big package and now he wants to return - that’s what it seems like<br /><br />There’s been a lot more lowlights than highlights. I put it down to the unstable running of the football club. Everything from above has been massively negative, which is reflected on the pitch. They’ve been signing the wrong players, not as footballers but as men, mentality-wise. Prior to Ole Gunnar taking over, there were some terrible signings<br /><br />The moment you bring in someone who is very inexperienced, they get absolutely persecuted. For Ole Gunnar, everything has to be right. He has the biggest rucksack in the world. Just let him do this job with the tools he’s got. When he came in, the club were in a bad state. There were a lot of scars there from the previous regime, and he built bridges that were broken from the previous manager <b>[<a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b>. Frank <b>[<a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>]</b> at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> can say he uses young players and no one wants to close the door on him, it’s strange really</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Parker is not convinced that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should be looking at investing £100 million ($125m) in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> winger <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>]</b> Is <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> worth the money that is being talked about? All people have seen is flashes in an England shirt, and all of a sudden they think he is the next best thing. He is English, so we have to hype, hype, hype. I am not 100 per cent sure, given what I have seen. At the moment, I am just being honest, I am not 100 per cent sure about him.<br /><br />There are clubs like United who are willing to spend big money, but this sort of fee could leave them with egg on their face. £100m is a lot of money for a player that an English club have let go already. If you look at <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>, who United let go before, then having to spend an extortionate amount of money to bring him back - look how that has turned out, so far. On the playing side, it will be a risk. Let’s see what happens after all this (the coronavirus lockdown), as that will affect it. Agents are starting to get concerned about when they are going to start earning money again. People talk about the value of the player going down, it just remains to be seen which clubs will have enough money to spend this sort of cash. Let’s wait until footballs have been kicked and see<br /><br /><b>[Parker added, with it unclear where <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> would fit into <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s plans given the attacking options already available to him]</b> United have wide forwards. If <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> comes in, you have got to ask where is <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> going to play? Where does <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> play? Given how he likes to start wide and then come in.<br /><br />What about <a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a>? When you then go and spend £100m on a player who is younger than him. That will affect him, mentally. Would it be a backwards step to ruin all the progress they have made?<br /><br />Look at other areas, like the centre forward position. You can buy as many wide players as you like, but you still need a centre forward who is going to score you a minimum of 19 league goals a season<br /><br />It is a problem at United. They have <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Odion Ighalo</a> at the moment, but he is not the long-term solution. This position may well be the priority than bringing in a fashion statement like Sancho</p>

If he plays for United it will not be out wide. Then, in the middle, is he going to win the ball back? Can you have him and <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> in a midfield two? Fernandes is a far better player, and wins the ball back. He wants to get on the ball and does it with the ball.<br /><br /><a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> is still, at the moment, a big fish in a small pond, it would be interesting to see how he gets on at a bigger club. Maddison has done really well at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> but is happy there. He is definitely more of a guarantee than <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> as he has proven himself at a bigger club. He is a better proposition for United. He is more adaptable, he plays at a higher energy than what <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> does. <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> spends long spells out of the game, and only comes into the game when he is on the ball.<br /><br />If you are going to spend the big, big money, then Maddison should be the target.

It seems he wants to stay, but if somehow United can persuade him and <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> otherwise, he should be the main target.

You talk about <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>, he’s been mentioned of late. I’ve seen that he’s been speaking on TV, he’s about and people are trying to push him towards jobs. You throw him in at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and it’s an easy one to do, to say that something could happen, but things at United have shown, with how they finished before this situation started, it would have suggested they would have been there until the last kick of the ball to get into the Champions League. They had turned around, <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> had turned them around as a team, as a club, the whole place was definitely moving forward.

When you trust your defence, you play much better. I think that United need to make changes in the transfer window. <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> should not be on the left of the central defence. He should be on the right where he is more comfortable. I’d drop <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Victor Lindelof</a> and bring in <a href="nathan-ake.html">Nathan Ake</a> from <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> don’t seem to want him, so now is the time to make a move. He has proven that he is a good defender in a poor team. He’s comfortable on the ball. Being left-footed, he would bring the ball forward better than <a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a> does from that side, which is needed because <a href="luke-shaw.html">Luke Shaw</a> isn’t good enough in attack either. Ake would balance the whole side. Every player has a blip, and it’s up to the manager to coach De Gea, to sort him out and stick him out. He can’t just throw him out. De Gea knows he needs to justify his contract, and the club can’t afford to stick his £300,000-a-week wages on the bench.</p>

He is on the periphery now. Once he was delivering for club and country, and he became big news - a local boy who took his opportunity. But now when he gets his chances he can’t stand out and lead a group of young players, and nor do senior colleagues help him raise his game. He’s in a rut. When the team are playing well, that will be killing him.
