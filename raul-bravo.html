  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid star Raul Bravo is one of several high-profile figures to have been arrested as part of a match-fixing investigation by Spanish authorities. A La Liga spokesman has said]</b> The police action follows complaints about possible match-fixing in a May 2018 match from La Liga to the Spanish authorities. La Liga is very active in combating match-fixing. It is important to us to have a fair competition.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid star Raul Bravo is one of several high-profile figures to have been arrested as part of a match-fixing investigation by Spanish authorities. Spanish police informed that]</b> Several soccer players from Spain’s first and second divisions have been arrested on suspicion of having taken part in match-fixing, National Police sources told EFE on Tuesday. The sources said raids had begun early in the morning in an operation against alleged soccer match-fixing that had been set up in a bid to obtain financial benefits from betting on the outcome of games.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> defender Raul Bravo has denied that he was behind the attempted shooting of ex-Serbia international Darko Kovacevic]</b> A magazine in Serbia reported it and I was stunned that it said I ordered the murder of Darko Kovacevic. The only thing that matters <b>[to them]</b> is selling <b>[magazines]</b>, and saying I wanted to kill Darko sells more. It’s a crazy story, it’s nonsense<br /><br />I will say it again, the relationship is great. It <b>[the report]</b> is something that his neither legs nor a head. It is a complete invention, madness. He hasn’t gotten into any trouble and he doesn’t know why this has happened. He has earned a lot of money from football <b>[…]</b> I’ve told him to stay calm<br /><br /><b>[Bravo also claimed that he and Kovacevic have spoken about the incident]</b> At home they’re a little scared. But I knew that Darko was going to laugh when he saw the news. It took him two days to call me</p>
