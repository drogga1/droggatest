Managers now, you have such a short time span in your job, you don’t worry about kids. When you can spend £150 million, you’re not going to worry about leaving out kids.<br /><br />He plays the game simple. He will have to quicken up a little bit, when he gets higher up but that’s the whole object of playing games. When you play with the type of players he plays with, it does help his education. I think he is ready to play in the Premier League, as I thought Tammy was. I thought they would be two good players <b>[to sign]</b>. I’ll be speaking to someone at Chelsea about one or two things<br /><br />I spoke to Eddie Newton who is in charge of the loan deals and I was told I would be kept in touch, but I wasn’t. The situation developed and I think at this level the least you should do is make a phone call. Surely playing for us 20 or 30 times in the Premier League would have far improved him, no disrespect to the Championship</p>

  <p><b>[Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock has attempted to kickstart a war of words with Pep Guardiola]</b> I totally agree with Guardiola (on protection). Sane missed three games, but there was a tackle from Kevin De Bruyne on Jazz Richards that put him out for 17 games. So I would say which is the worst? That sounds like a worse tackle than Bennett’s, but we didn’t make a song and dance about that. There were one or two naughty things we didn’t get and everybody wrote about the one tackle that Benno knows was a disgrace. De Bruyne didn’t even get booked, but he caught his knee badly.</p>

He cares, he is passionate. He pulls some faces, doesn’t he? He’s got everything really. It must be lovely being in charge of a team like that but he’s created it. They haven’t always been like that. He saw what weaknesses there were and he’s shored them up. He’s an exceptional manager. We’re very lucky to have the managers that we have in what is the best league in the world</p>

Nineteen shots at the Emirates, it’s definitely our best performance of the season.<br /><br />It is a very unusual situation, a big tragedy.

There were mistakes from our point of view. But that’s what happens at this level. If you make mistakes, you get punished, and we were.

  <p><b>[Neil Warnock has said that he would play Callum Hudson-Odoi against his Cardiff City]</b> I would give Callum a game after his England performance. If Callum is playing, then I think it’s on merit. It’s an exciting time for all the kids coming through in Gareth Southgate’s <b>[England]</b> squad. But Chelsea have such a choice, don’t they? Whoever plays in the first two positions, I’ll be quite pleased to see the other two on the bench. They are sixth in the table and not guaranteed a Champions League position. They are under enormous pressure as well. After the Everton game - where they could have been 4-0 up and ended up losing 2-0 - I would imagine they will be looking at this fixture and thinking they can get back on the road. That’s understandable when they look at our results against the other top sides and, if everything goes to plan on a good day for them, they will beat us. But if we get ourselves up for it, we can give these teams a good game - especially at home.<br /><br /><b>[Cardiff are 18th, five points behind 17th-placed Burnley, but have two games in hand on their relegation rivals]</b> It’s not just Burnley or Southampton who could be caught. There are other clubs above us who could also be feeling nervous. Anyone could have a disaster, lose four or five games and then find themselves in trouble. West Ham was our best performance of the season and that was because we all turned up. We need that again</p>

  <p><b>[Neil Warnock furious at referee in Cardiff’s defeat to Chelsea]</b> It’s difficult because I am really flat. I am so proud of my players. To get let down by the officials… roll on VAR. We worked three weeks for this but to get let down by decisions. No major decisions went for us. They don’t realise what is at stake. If I was a Burnley or a Brighton fan, they will be absolutely loving it today. It’s not our fault an official can’t see that <b>[Azpilicueta’s goal]</b>, it is the most obvious offside I have ever seen or the most certain penalty I have ever seen. What goes through my mind? Is it payback time for me over the years?<br /><br />It’s the best league in the world but the worst officials. They don’t understand what is at stake. They shouldn’t make mistakes at this level. Why am I working at 70 years of age for things like that to happen? It’s not very often I am lost for words. My players feel like they have been kicked in the teeth. We’ve been kicked so many times. I don’t deserve officials like that today. There is no excuse for that, it’s criminal. If my players feel like they look in the dressing room, that’s the end of our season. But how many times have we bounced back this season?</p>

There would be a lot of penalties in matches if you give things like that. It’s a soft penalty. At the end of the tugging, the theatrics of the dive were a solid 9.9. It’s a Tom Daley job, that. It’s not just the <b>[Liverpool]</b> penalty, I think we should’ve had a penalty after half-time. When you look at the way <b>[Andy]</b> Robertson’s pulled his shirt, all of the television pundits say it’s a penalty by the letter of the law. But they get away with it. They say the sun might’ve been in the linesman’s eyes.<br /><br />I can’t ask my players to give any more than what they’re giving. The fans have been amazing and I’m really pleased that we put in a performance today. We didn’t want to sit back, we wanted to be positive and I thought we were.

I was listening to David Moyes last week at some stage… are they any better off than when David was there? And they’ve spent about £400m since then. You’ve got to have a structure where you try and sign the best players that can be available for your job to actually move the club forward. It does seem that over the past few years, I’m not sure how much thought has gone into some of the signings. It might take - people say two or three windows - I think it could be 10 years.

They’ve done the other way, they’ve spent £300m or £400m on players who are supposed to be world stars, and yet they haven’t got a team. They haven’t got a team at all.
