  <p><b>[on Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> I once rang him up and was on for 10 minutes about players and he told me about every player, their strengths and their weaknesses. I put the phone down and I said ‘I bet he even knows the Dunfermline groundsman’ so I rang him back and said ‘Hey Alex, I forgot to ask you about the Dunfermline groundsman’ and, by God, he did know his name and where he came from!</p>

I fined her a week’s wages because she can’t say things like that.</p>

  <p><b>[Ampadu’s recent rise saw him attract interest from another <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> side before the transfer window closed, with Cardiff manager Neil Warnock singing his praises]</b> I think they should loan us him. He plays the game simple. He will have to quicken up a little bit, when he gets higher up but that’s the whole object of playing games. When you play with the type of players he plays with, it does help his education.</p>

  <p><b>[Neil Warnock admitted that Cardiff are interested in Nathaniel Clyne]</b> We spoke about Clyne months ago, but then he got back into the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, then they had a few injuries, so things change. But honestly, we’ve got nothing set for any position at the moment, I’m hoping that changes this week.</p>

  <p><b>[Neil Warnock believes basic errors cost Cardiff, who have shipped eight goals in their last two games and will slip into the bottom three if Southampton avoid defeat against Fulham]</b> You shouldn’t concede the second goal which is like a Sunday League goal. There were mistakes from our point of view. But that’s what happens at this level. If you make mistakes, you get punished, and we were. With ten games to go, we’ve still got a chance <b>[of survival]</b>. It’s up to me now to make sure that we play the right team and have a go. We’ve got a lot of character and we won’t give in without a fight</p>

  <p><b>[Neil Warnock says Shanghai Shenhua forward <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Odion Ighalo</a> isn’t the right type of player for Manchester United]</b> I tried to sign <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a> when I was at Cardiff. His salary was over six figures a week, £100,000, something like that. His agent tells you one thing, then the other. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> won’t have that problem with the terms. I’m not sure he’s the right player for United. He’s not consistent and isn’t the right type of player. They want young players. Why didn’t they go for Danny Ings? He’s someone similar to <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>. It’s desperation</p>

  <p><b>[Neil Warnock enjoyed a perfect return to management as Middlesbrough swept aside fellow Championship strugglers Stoke 2-0]</b> We’ve still got seven games left to play so we just need to keep going. Don’t forget I’ve been in the game a long time now and I’ve been in jobs where we’ve lost the first two or three games<br /><br />In that situation it’s just about sticking to your principles. I would have done that whatever the result here today. It was a good team performance from our lads. They flung their bodies on the line and I love to see that. Nobody likes to see their manager going, but you just have to get on with it</p>

  <p><b>[Mallik Wilks’ stoppage-time strike earned Hull a vital 2-1 victory over Middlesbrough in the battle to beat the drop in the Championship]</b> I would’ve been disappointed only getting a point, but that’s football. They got the break at the end and we should have put it to bed earlier. That’s why we’re down where we are.<br /><br />There are six games left and I think we can win every game. We won’t get too down, but <b>[the players]</b> are disappointed because we were the better team and we should have won the game</p>

  <p><b>[Middlesbrough manager Neil Warnock revealed defender Djed Spence suffered a broken nose during Wednesday’s 2-0 win at Millwall]</b> Djed had his nose smashed but I have not really looked into that. He was worried at half-time about his good looks! I said the best way to answer that is to get the win. You don’t come to Millwall and mess around. You know you’re going to be in a dogfight here and, if you don’t, you might as well put the white flag up</p>

  <p><b>[Britt Assombalonga’s controversial finish handed Middlesbrough a Championship survival boost in a 2-0 win at Millwall]</b> I had a chat with the players afterwards on the pitch, you have to look at yourselves sometimes in the mirror. It’s not all about managers, you’ve got to want to be a winner, it doesn’t just come to you<br /><br />Djed (Spence) had broken his nose in the first half and he was a bit worried about his good looks I think at half-time. I said to him, ‘The only answer to that Djed is to win the game, win the game and know you’ll come off the pitch having played your part’</p>

  <p><b>[Nahki Wells scored his 20th goal of the season to keep Bristol City on the fringes of the Sky Bet Championship play-off race and leave Middlesbrough scrapping for dear life]</b> We can’t afford to rely on others. Not at all, no. They are all tough games. We have got three tough games. When you don’t score enough goals and you concede silly goals like we do, it’s a bad recipe. But there are other teams down there, I think, in a worse situation and we have got to capitalise. We haven’t got to feel sorry for ourselves, we haven’t got to worry about what’s said about us or anything like that. We’ve just got to re-group and get the points</p>

  <p><b>[Middlesbrough boosted their chances of avoiding relegation from the Championship with a hard-earned 2-1 win at mid-table Reading]</b> It sounds a bit silly when I’ve only had a few games here. But it’s the hardest job I’ve ever had. I couldn’t really say that beforehand but the lads have given everything for me. I just can’t fault them at all<br /><br />That win was relief, a big relief. It was really hard work. I know we’re not there yet (safe from relegation) but that was a massive three points for us. It was important tonight for us to get something. And to get the three points, I thought that was deservedly so</p>
