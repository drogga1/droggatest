  <p>[Stephen Constantine is in ebullient mood, considering the Blue Tigers climbed to a record 129th in the FIFA year ending rankings table of 2016] A quick look back at 2016 saw our Indian National Team make significant steps forward both in the FIFA rankings and on the pitch. We started the new year ranked 129th our highest position for 10 years, and won 9 from the last 11 games. Of course, there is still much to do.<br /><br />So many positives came from last year and we are moving in the right direction, but we really need to kick on and make sure we are doing the right things both on the domestic front and internationally. The I-League is in full flow and I will be trying to attend as many games as possible. Over the last two years, we have created competition for all positions and there are no guarantees for anyone<br /><br />Last week the AFC Cup draw for the final group stages was made in Abu Dhabi and we came out of the pot in Group A with Kyrgyzstan Myanmar and Macau respectively which on paper I feel gives us a decent chance to make to the finals in the Emirates in 2019. As always, I go into these games knowing that we need to be at our best and of course prepare for some difficult games home and away. We are I feel in a position where we can qualify from this group and I will do everything in my power to make sure we do. The players the fans and all Indians need to get behind our national team and help us take the next step we will all benefit one way or another and India in the Finals is the ultimate goal<br /><br />We have quite a full program and we will need to be very careful in our preparation, both on and off the field. It’s imperative that we play games and try and keep the team together so that we give ourselves the best possible chance to qualify for the finals. I have already started to plan the national team schedule and look forward to everyone pulling in the same direction<br /><br />I have also renewed my contract in India for another 14 months that would take me up to the end of March 2018 when we would be playing our last game away to Kyrgyzstan. Somewhere in between the AFC qualifiers, we also have the U 23 AFC Championship qualifiers and we will need to prepare for this as well as the senior team. All the best and Jai Hind!</p>

  <p>[India to play friendly against Cambodia ahead of 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers] I appreciate the efforts of the AIFF in helping me secure the match. The International Friendly will help the players understand each other better ahead of our tough challenge against Myanmar. The idea is to play against a team close to Myanmar with regards to climatic conditions</p>

  <p>[Stephen Constantine - the coach of the Indian national football team - is set to take over at the helm of the Indian U17 national team as well] The under-17 team is not in my domain and hence I don’t want to react to what happened. However, I have told the AIFF [All India Football Federation] that I am available. Now, it is really up to them.</p>

  <p>[Stephen Constantine summoned a 31-man list of probables to train in Mumbai from 12th March onwards in preparation for their first group game in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers against Myanmar] Mumbai will be hot and humid much like what we will experience in Yangon when we play Myanmar in our first match.<br /><br />The last time we camped and played in Mumbai, the Western India Football Association headed by AIFF President Mr. Praful Patel and Mr. Aditya Thackeray were so supportive and helpful, arranging and providing all what the National Team needed and asked for. I appreciate their passion and feeling for the National Team<br /><br />We have recruited players on basis of their consistent performances both from the I-League and the Indian Super League. I reiterate that the door is open for anyone who is eligible to play for India. But for that he must be prepared to do the work we need. We have selected the players from what we have seen over the last few months</p>
