  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine is in ebullient mood, considering the Blue Tigers climbed to a record 129th in the FIFA year ending rankings table of 2016]</b> A quick look back at 2016 saw our Indian National Team make significant steps forward both in the FIFA rankings and on the pitch. We started the new year ranked 129th our highest position for 10 years, and won 9 from the last 11 games. Of course, there is still much to do.<br /><br />So many positives came from last year and we are moving in the right direction, but we really need to kick on and make sure we are doing the right things both on the domestic front and internationally. The I-League is in full flow and I will be trying to attend as many games as possible. Over the last two years, we have created competition for all positions and there are no guarantees for anyone<br /><br />Last week the AFC Cup draw for the final group stages was made in Abu Dhabi and we came out of the pot in Group A with Kyrgyzstan Myanmar and Macau respectively which on paper I feel gives us a decent chance to make to the finals in the Emirates in 2019. As always, I go into these games knowing that we need to be at our best and of course prepare for some difficult games home and away. We are I feel in a position where we can qualify from this group and I will do everything in my power to make sure we do. The players the fans and all Indians need to get behind our national team and help us take the next step we will all benefit one way or another and India in the Finals is the ultimate goal<br /><br />We have quite a full program and we will need to be very careful in our preparation, both on and off the field. It’s imperative that we play games and try and keep the team together so that we give ourselves the best possible chance to qualify for the finals. I have already started to plan the national team schedule and look forward to everyone pulling in the same direction<br /><br />I have also renewed my contract in India for another 14 months that would take me up to the end of March 2018 when we would be playing our last game away to Kyrgyzstan. Somewhere in between the AFC qualifiers, we also have the U 23 AFC Championship qualifiers and we will need to prepare for this as well as the senior team. All the best and Jai Hind!</p>

  <p><b>[India to play friendly against Cambodia ahead of 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers]</b> I appreciate the efforts of the AIFF in helping me secure the match. The International Friendly will help the players understand each other better ahead of our tough challenge against Myanmar. The idea is to play against a team close to Myanmar with regards to climatic conditions</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine summoned a 31-man list of probables to train in Mumbai from 12th March onwards in preparation for their first group game in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers against Myanmar]</b> Mumbai will be hot and humid much like what we will experience in Yangon when we play Myanmar in our first match.<br /><br />The last time we camped and played in Mumbai, the Western India Football Association headed by AIFF President Mr. Praful Patel and Mr. Aditya Thackeray were so supportive and helpful, arranging and providing all what the National Team needed and asked for. I appreciate their passion and feeling for the National Team<br /><br />We have recruited players on basis of their consistent performances both from the I-League and the Indian Super League. I reiterate that the door is open for anyone who is eligible to play for India. But for that he must be prepared to do the work we need. We have selected the players from what we have seen over the last few months</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine announces 24-man squad for Cambodia and Myanmar matches]</b> It was lovely to be back to train in Mumbai. I need to thank the Western India Football Association headed by Mr. Praful Patel and Mr. Aditya Thackeray for their hospitality and help. I admire their passion for the National Team. We didn’t face any obstacle during our training process.<br /><br />The character showed by the boys in the Camp has been exemplary. They worked very hard and we are looking forward to getting a result in both the matches. We are ready for the dual challenge</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine was content that his wards knew what they were required to do, even when they on duty with their clubs at a different level]</b> We haven’t had access to the players, so when they go back to the clubs <b>[between national camps]</b>, it is a different level and intensity is different. The boys know what is expected.<br /><br />We have an app by which we know what each player is doing at every club. They feed in the information, which comes to me and others <b>[national senior team coaches and support staff]</b>. So when the player returns to the camp, we know what needs to be done and he can recover quicker than we did before<br /><br />They are young, quick and tough boys. They are here <b>[national camp]</b> now, does not mean they will be here tomorrow. It is a very good learning experience for them. We have had 30 players over two years, some are here and others are not. The door <b>[into Indian team]</b> never closes <b>[on players]</b>, unless they close it<br /><br />We need a continuation. The U-17 boys playing the World Cup will come into the U-19, then U-21. Players are being scouted at the Santosh Trophy <b>[Senior Nationals underway in Goa]</b><br /><br />My personal opinion is that the national coach should lead all the national teams, in <b>[football]</b> philosophy, selection of coaches, methodology. They <b>[talented age group boys]</b> are going to come to him. There is a side to the argument which asks what happens when a national coach gets sacked. Till 17 years, the boys are learning different systems anyway. The philosophy may change <b>[when a new coach comes in]</b>, but continuity is essential<br /><br />The best example of continuity is Myanmar. They qualified for the U-20 World Cup 2015 on merit, average age on the senior national team is about 24 and have got a coach <b>[former U-19 coach Gerd Ziese put in charge of Myanmar senior side]</b> for the last eight years.<br /><br />I need to see players <b>[before selecting]</b>. As a team, they are playing very well. I have a group of players I am comfortable with. For somebody to come in, they need to be better than what I have. I wish them <b>[Aizawl]</b> well and am sure in future, there will be players to catch the eye</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine reveals why Cambodia were the perfect choice as opponents]</b> For us it is an important friendly. We have a difficult game after this with Myanmar. Coming to Cambodia means similar conditions, similar weather. I think it will be an interesting game for us. I wish Cambodia’s new coach <b>[Leonardo Vitorino]</b> all the very best and good luck except not so much good luck tomorrow. We are taking this game very seriously and we are trying to give our best performance.<br /><br />My first views to play Cambodia was that it is very close to Myanmar and the conditions are very similar. They have recently played them in the AFF Suzuki Cup so it will be a good experience for us and will be close to how Myanmar play. Although Cambodia have a new coach and he will look to change somethings, but this was the main reason<br /><br />Yes, we have two or three players who are 50-50 for this game<br /><br />Well, we wanted to stay here. We won’t be able to train the same way over there. I am sure they <b>[Myanmar]</b> do not want us to be there too early. So, we decided that we will stay here for two or three days. It is better for us<br /><br />I did not come here to lose. I wish him all the best from the day after, but not tomorrow<br /><br />All of them. Anyone can hurt you anytime. I have seen them play two or three times and they are a good team with good intensity</p>

  <p><b>[India overcame a stiff challenge from a defiant Cambodian team to win 2-3 on Wednesday night at Phnom Penh]</b> Congratulations to Cambodia. I thought they played very well for long parts of the game. Considering they have a new coach and it has been only two-three weeks for him, I think it was a good start for them. I think they all played very well. If I am the coach of Cambodia then I will be very happy only after two weeks.<br /><br />For us, it was an opportunity to introduce some new players and it was not so easy for us because of the work the Cambodian players did. We played better in the second half and when we scored the third goal we thought we might get another one or two so we got a bit relaxed. But the important thing is that we won the game and we do not have any injuries and next week we have a very difficult game against Myanmar.<br /><br />Every time you play for the national team, you want to win. Results matter and it is nice to continue the winning streak. We need to start quicker. It is a must in international football. We have a habit of taking it a bit lightly and starting the game slowly. We can’t afford to do that. If you do that, you bring about your own downfall. At the end of day, it’s a win and I am very happy for the boys and all who have been involved in the process. But there is no place to go over the moon. We have a sterner test next week, an acid test in fact</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine - ‘Myanmar are the favourites for AFC Asian Cup Qualifier’]</b> Myanmar are definitely the favourites. Playing at home is always an advantage for any team. They have been together for some time and the familiarity with each other is so much beneficial when you take the field. They certainly have the advantage.<br /><br />They work very hard and love to press. When you combine with the two with the ability they have and add the crowd and atmosphere to it, the combination is just deadly<br /><br />But at the same time, I cannot deny history; in fact, nobody can. But we can’t bring it back. Yesterday will always stay yesterday and at the same time, today is an another day<br /><br />We hope to have a very good day and hope they have a very bad day. To beat them, we have to play very, very well and hope that they don’t play very, very well<br /><br />Considering the last 18 months, we are in a good place at the moment. Nothing is too serious and the players are ready</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine, the coach of the Indian national team, believes his squad has the ability to beat any team on their day]</b> We’ll prepare like we have for the last two days. We’ve been working hard. We understand the game will be very tough. Myanmar has a very good team, very good situation here, on the field and I think Myanmar are the favourites for this game.<br /><br />I believe we have a chance to qualify and I like to think Myanmar has the same. I’m not sure about Kyrgyzstan or Macau. It’s the first game of the competition, it’s an away game and we didn’t come here to lose. We have big respect for Myanmar we come here to play. They’ve shown big improvement over the last few years. But we come here to play<br /><br />If I didn’t think we could beat them, I wouldn’t beat them. We can beat anyone on our day. We have to do our work. We have to hope Myanmar has a bad day and we have a good one to win. We have planned for about 10 days for this game<br /><br />I do think the home games are must wins - 9 pts, we have to win. So 9 points will take you to the final, in UAE<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the facets of the Myanmar team]</b> I’m not gonna tell you that. They work hard, quick. The work that’s been done by my colleague <b>[Gerd]</b> Zeise is very good. We expect a very difficult game home and away<br /><br /><b>[Finally, asked if pressure from the home support was enough to rile Constantine up]</b> Pressure from the home fans is on the home team</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine - ‘Myanmar couldn’t take their opportunity, we did’]</b> It was a very difficult game as we expected. Myanmar had several chances to score. They couldn’t take the opportunity and we had maybe three or four of our own and we took ours. Overall it was a very good game. Thanks to the Myanmar Football Federation for treating us so well and we will make sure they get the same treatment when they come to India.<br /><br />Any coach makes substitutions to try and change the game and our substitutions were brilliant on the field today. We put <b>[Sunil]</b> Chhetri more towards the left and that worked out well for us. We have to get nine points in this group in away matches. Having secured three points away gives us a lot more confidence to move forward. Now we move onto play Kyrgyzstan and Macau after that, this doesn’t change anything and we are still six points short. We can beat anybody at home</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine - We have a team that will take us hopefully to the Asian Cup and beyond]</b> The scouting workshop that we are trying to put in place will be here long after I am gone, and the coach after him, and the coach after him. This is what I want. I want us to have a pathway for Indian players who are spotted, correctly spotted the right age and the right candidates for the team. So, I think there needs to be a consistency and we are starting to get there. It takes time. But we are on the right track at the moment, so, so far so good</p>
