  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine is in ebullient mood, considering the Blue Tigers climbed to a record 129th in the FIFA year ending rankings table of 2016]</b> A quick look back at 2016 saw our Indian National Team make significant steps forward both in the FIFA rankings and on the pitch. We started the new year ranked 129th our highest position for 10 years, and won 9 from the last 11 games. Of course, there is still much to do.<br /><br />So many positives came from last year and we are moving in the right direction, but we really need to kick on and make sure we are doing the right things both on the domestic front and internationally. The I-League is in full flow and I will be trying to attend as many games as possible. Over the last two years, we have created competition for all positions and there are no guarantees for anyone<br /><br />Last week the AFC Cup draw for the final group stages was made in Abu Dhabi and we came out of the pot in Group A with Kyrgyzstan Myanmar and Macau respectively which on paper I feel gives us a decent chance to make to the finals in the Emirates in 2019. As always, I go into these games knowing that we need to be at our best and of course prepare for some difficult games home and away. We are I feel in a position where we can qualify from this group and I will do everything in my power to make sure we do. The players the fans and all Indians need to get behind our national team and help us take the next step we will all benefit one way or another and India in the Finals is the ultimate goal<br /><br />We have quite a full program and we will need to be very careful in our preparation, both on and off the field. It’s imperative that we play games and try and keep the team together so that we give ourselves the best possible chance to qualify for the finals. I have already started to plan the national team schedule and look forward to everyone pulling in the same direction<br /><br />I have also renewed my contract in India for another 14 months that would take me up to the end of March 2018 when we would be playing our last game away to Kyrgyzstan. Somewhere in between the AFC qualifiers, we also have the U 23 AFC Championship qualifiers and we will need to prepare for this as well as the senior team. All the best and Jai Hind!</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine summoned a 31-man list of probables to train in Mumbai from 12th March onwards in preparation for their first group game in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers against Myanmar]</b> Mumbai will be hot and humid much like what we will experience in Yangon when we play Myanmar in our first match.<br /><br />The last time we camped and played in Mumbai, the Western India Football Association headed by AIFF President Mr. Praful Patel and Mr. Aditya Thackeray were so supportive and helpful, arranging and providing all what the National Team needed and asked for. I appreciate their passion and feeling for the National Team<br /><br />We have recruited players on basis of their consistent performances both from the I-League and the Indian Super League. I reiterate that the door is open for anyone who is eligible to play for India. But for that he must be prepared to do the work we need. We have selected the players from what we have seen over the last few months</p>

I need to thank the Western India Football Association headed by Mr. Praful Patel and Mr. Aditya Thackeray for their hospitality and help. I admire their passion for the National Team. We didn’t face any obstacle during our training process.<br /><br />The character showed by the boys in the Camp has been exemplary. They worked very hard and we are looking forward to getting a result in both the matches. We are ready for the dual challenge</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine was content that his wards knew what they were required to do, even when they on duty with their clubs at a different level]</b> We haven’t had access to the players, so when they go back to the clubs <b>[between national camps]</b>, it is a different level and intensity is different. The boys know what is expected.<br /><br />We have an app by which we know what each player is doing at every club. They feed in the information, which comes to me and others <b>[national senior team coaches and support staff]</b>. So when the player returns to the camp, we know what needs to be done and he can recover quicker than we did before<br /><br />They are young, quick and tough boys. They are here <b>[national camp]</b> now, does not mean they will be here tomorrow. It is a very good learning experience for them. We have had 30 players over two years, some are here and others are not. The door <b>[into Indian team]</b> never closes <b>[on players]</b>, unless they close it<br /><br />We need a continuation. The U-17 boys playing the World Cup will come into the U-19, then U-21. Players are being scouted at the Santosh Trophy <b>[Senior Nationals underway in Goa]</b><br /><br />My personal opinion is that the national coach should lead all the national teams, in <b>[football]</b> philosophy, selection of coaches, methodology. They <b>[talented age group boys]</b> are going to come to him. There is a side to the argument which asks what happens when a national coach gets sacked. Till 17 years, the boys are learning different systems anyway. The philosophy may change <b>[when a new coach comes in]</b>, but continuity is essential<br /><br />The best example of continuity is Myanmar. They qualified for the U-20 World Cup 2015 on merit, average age on the senior national team is about 24 and have got a coach <b>[former U-19 coach Gerd Ziese put in charge of Myanmar senior side]</b> for the last eight years.<br /><br />I need to see players <b>[before selecting]</b>. As a team, they are playing very well. I have a group of players I am comfortable with. For somebody to come in, they need to be better than what I have. I wish them <b>[Aizawl]</b> well and am sure in future, there will be players to catch the eye</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine reveals why Cambodia were the perfect choice as opponents]</b> For us it is an important friendly. We have a difficult game after this with Myanmar. Coming to Cambodia means similar conditions, similar weather. I think it will be an interesting game for us. I wish Cambodia’s new coach <b>[Leonardo Vitorino]</b> all the very best and good luck except not so much good luck tomorrow. We are taking this game very seriously and we are trying to give our best performance.<br /><br />My first views to play Cambodia was that it is very close to Myanmar and the conditions are very similar. They have recently played them in the AFF Suzuki Cup so it will be a good experience for us and will be close to how Myanmar play. Although Cambodia have a new coach and he will look to change somethings, but this was the main reason<br /><br />Yes, we have two or three players who are 50-50 for this game<br /><br />Well, we wanted to stay here. We won’t be able to train the same way over there. I am sure they <b>[Myanmar]</b> do not want us to be there too early. So, we decided that we will stay here for two or three days. It is better for us<br /><br />I did not come here to lose. I wish him all the best from the day after, but not tomorrow<br /><br />All of them. Anyone can hurt you anytime. I have seen them play two or three times and they are a good team with good intensity</p>

  <p><b>[India overcame a stiff challenge from a defiant Cambodian team to win 2-3 on Wednesday night at Phnom Penh]</b> Congratulations to Cambodia. I thought they played very well for long parts of the game. Considering they have a new coach and it has been only two-three weeks for him, I think it was a good start for them. I think they all played very well. If I am the coach of Cambodia then I will be very happy only after two weeks.<br /><br />For us, it was an opportunity to introduce some new players and it was not so easy for us because of the work the Cambodian players did. We played better in the second half and when we scored the third goal we thought we might get another one or two so we got a bit relaxed. But the important thing is that we won the game and we do not have any injuries and next week we have a very difficult game against Myanmar.<br /><br />Every time you play for the national team, you want to win. Results matter and it is nice to continue the winning streak. We need to start quicker. It is a must in international football. We have a habit of taking it a bit lightly and starting the game slowly. We can’t afford to do that. If you do that, you bring about your own downfall. At the end of day, it’s a win and I am very happy for the boys and all who have been involved in the process. But there is no place to go over the moon. We have a sterner test next week, an acid test in fact</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine - ‘Myanmar are the favourites for AFC Asian Cup Qualifier’]</b> Myanmar are definitely the favourites. Playing at home is always an advantage for any team. They have been together for some time and the familiarity with each other is so much beneficial when you take the field. They certainly have the advantage.<br /><br />They work very hard and love to press. When you combine with the two with the ability they have and add the crowd and atmosphere to it, the combination is just deadly<br /><br />But at the same time, I cannot deny history; in fact, nobody can. But we can’t bring it back. Yesterday will always stay yesterday and at the same time, today is an another day<br /><br />We hope to have a very good day and hope they have a very bad day. To beat them, we have to play very, very well and hope that they don’t play very, very well<br /><br />Considering the last 18 months, we are in a good place at the moment. Nothing is too serious and the players are ready</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine, the coach of the Indian national team, believes his squad has the ability to beat any team on their day]</b> We’ll prepare like we have for the last two days. We’ve been working hard. We understand the game will be very tough. Myanmar has a very good team, very good situation here, on the field and I think Myanmar are the favourites for this game.<br /><br />I believe we have a chance to qualify and I like to think Myanmar has the same. I’m not sure about Kyrgyzstan or Macau. It’s the first game of the competition, it’s an away game and we didn’t come here to lose. We have big respect for Myanmar we come here to play. They’ve shown big improvement over the last few years. But we come here to play<br /><br />If I didn’t think we could beat them, I wouldn’t beat them. We can beat anyone on our day. We have to do our work. We have to hope Myanmar has a bad day and we have a good one to win. We have planned for about 10 days for this game<br /><br />I do think the home games are must wins - 9 pts, we have to win. So 9 points will take you to the final, in UAE<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the facets of the Myanmar team]</b> I’m not gonna tell you that. They work hard, quick. The work that’s been done by my colleague <b>[Gerd]</b> Zeise is very good. We expect a very difficult game home and away<br /><br /><b>[Finally, asked if pressure from the home support was enough to rile Constantine up]</b> Pressure from the home fans is on the home team</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine - ‘Myanmar couldn’t take their opportunity, we did’]</b> It was a very difficult game as we expected. Myanmar had several chances to score. They couldn’t take the opportunity and we had maybe three or four of our own and we took ours. Overall it was a very good game. Thanks to the Myanmar Football Federation for treating us so well and we will make sure they get the same treatment when they come to India.<br /><br />Any coach makes substitutions to try and change the game and our substitutions were brilliant on the field today. We put <b>[Sunil]</b> Chhetri more towards the left and that worked out well for us. We have to get nine points in this group in away matches. Having secured three points away gives us a lot more confidence to move forward. Now we move onto play Kyrgyzstan and Macau after that, this doesn’t change anything and we are still six points short. We can beat anybody at home</p>

This is what I want. I want us to have a pathway for Indian players who are spotted, correctly spotted the right age and the right candidates for the team. So, I think there needs to be a consistency and we are starting to get there. It takes time. But we are on the right track at the moment, so, so far so good</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine: ISL, I-League running parallely is best for India]</b> I think it will be extremely beneficial. With more Indian players playing in the top divisions of Indian football, the more beneficial it is for me and national coaches. It is also good for the younger players. At the moment we have one under-23 player playing per team, I think with two conferences or two leagues, whichever way you want to put it, there will be more young Indian players playing and competing which is exactly what we want. As for me, it is a very good move.<br /><br />In this case, a prolonged season is about the duration of the league. It is about how much time the coaches have to coach. This is because that’s not happening in the current format as the games are scheduled too close to each other. A longer league will give players more time to rest, recover and also improve their skills daily with their coaches. A longer league allows you to spread out the season and give time to the players to understand what the coach wants better. It’s so much better<br /><br />There is no time for these guys to even train properly as they play and then have to travel for the next match. By spreading the season to a longer period, it will allow the coaches to impart their knowledge to the players. For sure, the Indian players will benefit from some of the good foreign coaches. This is really what I would have wanted from the beginning<br /><br />I am absolutely delighted that the powers that be put their heads together and came up with the best solution for Indian football.

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine trying to protect Sunil Chhetri as much as he can]</b> I don’t think there are any easy teams at international level. Every team has a different challenge. We expect a tough game from Nepal as always. Nepal is a very hard working team. They give everything they have in every game they play. I know the mentality there, so we expect the usual from them, which is fight until you can’t fight anymore. This is an opportunity for me to thank Nepal for taking this match up in the last moment. We need the games, it’s important for us.<br /><br />I hope to get a win and some decent performances from some players who will be trying to make their claim for a starting position in the game against Kyrgyz Republic<br /><br /><b>[On FIFA rankings]</b> It is not easy to take a team from 173 to 100. That cannot be done without the hard work and commitment from the players, staff, backroom staff, people in the All India Football Federation <b>[AIFF]</b> and everybody else connected with the national team<br /><br />Being 100 does not mean we are favourites or have become a super team or that we are ready for the World Cup. It is not just dependent on just what we do. An AFC qualifier is far more important than a friendly or SAFF competition. We need to be in the big competitions. Mr. <b>[Praful]</b> Patel mentioned that he would like to see us at 50. Is it possible? Yes. We worked so hard to get 100, so the next target should be 50. We need to be in the AFC Finals, try and qualify for the World Cup. I applaud his optimism. It is possible but needs a lot of hard work. When I said we need to be in top 100 two years ago, people laughed. They’re not laughing anymore<br /><br />The FIFA rankings are just one aspect to it. It is not ‘We’re a 100 and that’s it’, that’s not my nature. We will be pushing to break the 100 and after that, we’ll see what happens. Our main priority at the moment is Nepal<br /><br />I hope he <b>[Sunil Chhetri]</b> has many more years. At 32, we have to start thinking what’s next. It will be a loss to Indian football if he decides to hang up his boots. I hope that’s not now. I am protecting him as much as I possibly can. Someone will have to replace him in the future, but who’s it? I don’t know<br /><br /><b>[Constantine mentioned the absence of the three players of the Southern Eagles]</b> CK Vineeth is definitely out. Udanta <b>[Singh]</b> is also definitely out. We are being cautious with Sunil <b>[Chhetri]</b>. He will not play any part against Nepal. He is not 22 anymore, so I’m just trying to protect him</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine - ‘Robin Singh could have scored a hattrick’]</b> These friendly games are very important for us to get us back in the rhythm. I can’t stress how important these games are to us. Obviously when you win it makes things better but I reckon we got a good lesson today. We dominated but we didn’t put away the chances we had.<br /><br />It was a friendly international and you have to take it in that context. Are we progressing? We want to get better. The next big test will against Kyrgyz Republic, a completely different game and atmosphere<br /><br /><b>[On Robin Singh]</b> Robin is a fighter. He will give you everything he has. He has a particular job he does. On another day, he could have scored a hat trick. It didnt happen​ but I was always going to change players because I have six substitutions. It’s not a reflection whether he played good or bad. He was always one of them who was going to come out. I am not going to go into detail about particular players or aspects of the game. It was a much needed game, we were good in patches. But there were areas we have to work upon. We will be quite different next week<br /><br />It’s just another game. My thoughts are already on Kyrgyz Republic. It’s good to see the boys win games especially after a tough start to my second stint. We were a 173 when I walked through the door and we hadn’t beaten Nepal for two years. We are on the right track. We haven’t achieved anything yet. Need two or three wins more to get to the Asian Cup and maybe then I will be happy. Two goals won us the game. Some great movements, something that we have been working on - going wide and getting the ball into the box. I think Jen’s goal was excellent build up play and great crossing by Rafique. As for Jhingan, I don’t know if he is going to score another goal like that with his left foot! He was in the right place and took it like a striker<br /><br />He is our number one keeper and is going to start next week so I wanted him to get games with the national team. I didn’t want to change too much from the goalkeeping perspective. There will be opportunities for the others<br /><br />That is the life of an international coach. Would I like one month to prepare for a game? Yes. Am I going to get it? No. For this camp, we got 12 days with the players who arrived in the first phase, then we got the Bengaluru FC players on the 2nd of June. Some of them are tired, some carrying niggles but it is a part of it. I don’t like it obviously but I don’t get what I want. Udanta is out, also he will miss the U-23 camp. CK Vineeth is also out, I am trying to protect Sunil. I don’t play players who aren’t a 100% fit</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine - Kyrgyzstan are the favourites going into this game]</b> I would say not worth the paper. I think the rankings are there for a reason. Many variables which determine the rankings. Whether we are 32 above or below will not decide the outcome but by who wants it more and how hard. Rankings are there but in these games, there are on paper.<br /><br />If it is a battle of stamina, we are very physical and quite strong. We are a fit, hardworking team. They will be difficult to break down, they will think they can win. We are in India and need to do everything we have to take the three points<br /><br />I think we have established more or less a settled squad. It’s taken two years. Obviously, there will be one or two players coming in depending on loss of form, injuries. At the moment, we have two or three players in each position. Once again, there was no guarantee about who gets to play. This was the point of my rebuilding the squad. Competition of places breeds competition in the squad. Nobody is guaranteed a place in the first eleven<br /><br />No, playing in Europe is beneficial to them, we will focus on them as a team <b>[and not individuals]</b>.We can focus on things that we can do to win. Yes, they are the favourites going into this game. We are in good form, have great atmosphere in the camp and will look to win the game<br /><br />I am quite confident <b>[about the game]</b>. I am quite charged up. I got three or four days rest after joining the camp. They checked and thought there was some scar tissue.

  <p><b>[Constantine hails ‘magnificient’ boys in blue]</b> Let’s not get greedy. Credit goes to the boys as it was absolutely a team performance from the beginning to end. We rode our luck in the first half. Chhetri made an unbelievable run just like he did in Myanmar. He is still fit and I have to thank the medical staff who got him in the position where he is today. Pleased that I didn’t play him against Nepal and maybe he couldn’t have made that run had he not been protected. I am pleased for all Indians. Six points and now take a breather, need another 6 I guess.<br /><br />I told they were better in the first 45 minutes. I have a lot of faith in the players and yet again we proved. I knew they were a very good team and it was a difficult game but we didn’t stop for a minute. 1-0 and I will take that everytime<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about the decision to replace Rowlin Borges with Rafique]</b> As you know, Borges has 8 stitches in his head and his ability on the ball is unbelievable. He wasn’t 100 per cent fit. He was brave to play today. We needed to change in midfield. Rafique did a tremendous job after coming on<br /><br />Always the last goal is the most important. As Sunil said, for us to be six points and top of the table, we still have a long way to go. Macau lost today which is irrelevant to us. Let’s not make the same mistake as we did in Guam. No one lies down these days. We can enjoy this moment and I am extremely proud of the players<br /><br />All the people in the AIFF building right from logistics, medical staff. Kishore <b>[Taid]</b> and most importantly, the general secretary and Praful Patel as they let me do what I want do with a reason. I am very happy. India deserves this and it’s about bloody time<br /><br />You saw some of the tackles coming in from them and we didn’t retaliate. We played very smart. These boys are magnificent. They really are. They deserved this. I am not someone to looks at the records. This is phenomenal at any level with 13 wins out of 15 games. But especially the boys<br /><br />We defend as a team. The entire 11 and Gurpreet made unbelievable saves. Players working their socks off to make sure we are compact. They had chances, we didn’t stop and played and won as a team</p>

  <p><b>[India coach Stephen Constantine made a bold statement on his recent blog wherein he calls for the ‘league issue’ to be resolved as soon as possible]</b> Of course we are still some way away from achieving our goal and there is work still to be done, our league issue must be resolved and quickly, I am of the opinion we need a parallel league at least for the next couple of years.<br /><br />We need to give the I-League clubs the <b>[an]</b> opportunity to adjust to the ways of the ISL as to be honest, this is how football is going to be moving forward. Of paramount importance is that clubs recognize that football will stand still for no one, move with it or get out of the way<br /><br />We need to have the two leagues running side-by-side so that more Indian players are playing. Our national U19s and U17s will, as many say surely, be signed up by the clubs, but how many of them will actually see <b>[time on]</b> the pitch? How many of them will play 90 minutes’ week in week out and this is exactly what they need - games!<br /><br />We must give these players a pathway to succeed and come in and take the places of the Sunils, the Eugeneson’s and others when their time has come to hang up their boots. In the meantime, let’s enjoy this moment <b>[1-0 win over Kyrgyzstan]</b> and remember how it makes us all feel because if we remember this feeling it will that much harder to give it up. We are currently in a good place <b>[top of the standings in group A of Asian Cup qualification]</b> but let us not forget where were several years ago and remember if we do not continue to build and focus on the road ahead it does not take much to slip back into the past</p>

  <p><b>[India U-23 national team: Vishal Kaith, Lallianzuala Chhangte among 23-member squad for Singapore tour]</b> This will be the first time when most of the boys will play an international match. The boys need to adapt quickly to the high intensity of an international match, especially that the bigger challenge in Doha lies ahead. We have treated the U-23 boys the same manner we train the senior national team with respect to the training, the meetings, the discipline and the diet plan</p>

  <p><b>[Indian coach Stephen Constantine feels that India has an abundance of footballing talent]</b> They’ll make mistakes and many don’t have club teams to play for. When we consider that, they’ve given a decent account of themselves in both these games. Four of them we took from a scouting program six weeks ago. There is talent in India and all it needs is finding them and nurturing them.<br /><br />We are a fairly young team and a new team. We’ve lost one and won one against Singapore. We will probably be the underdogs going into the tournament, but the boys are fighters. It’s a very difficult group with Syria, hosts Qatar and Turkmenistan. We will have to do a lot more against those three teams. But we will give the best account of ourselves and we will fight<br /><br />My personal objective is to qualify to the knockout stages but the main objective is to produce one, two or three players for the senior team</p>

  <p><b>[India coach Stephen Constantine hopes Indian fans will support his autobiography]</b> It’s a biography of how I started in life. It’s just not about football and it is about the struggle in my life. How I reached here as India’s coach now. I’ve coached five different national teams and India twice. There has been a great deal of hardship in between and Owen Amos, the guy who wrote the book with me, wanted me to pen this down.<br /><br />For three years, he <b>[Amos]</b> has been looking for somebody to publish it. The book gives a honest opinion on how I reached here<br /><br />We write autobiographies to have it on record what you’ve done in your life. I’ve been very lucky to be involved in football and very lucky to be in this position. But I’ve worked hard for this and I hope someone who reads this book, after they put it down, will think ‘How did he do that?’ and I hope it’s a good read. There’s two chapters on India and I would like to think that Indian fans would support the book<br /><br />If anybody orders it before the end of July, they get free delivery from the publishers. I think that shows that the publishers believe in the book</p>

  <p><b>[Syria vs India]</b> I’ve been a person who has always preferred to build a ‘team for the future.’ I am working with this bunch of guys so that a few may come up the ranks and land up with the senior National Team in the coming days.</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine heaped praise on the hosts Qatar]</b> They look very quick at times. They have an utmost quality I must say. It’ll be a big challenge for us against them. A lot of players from that batch <b>[2016]</b> might have graduated to the senior team. Their main advantage is that they’re having the same coach throughout.<br /><br />Playing a late evening match, that too at their home is really going to be advantageous for them. When you’re playing at this stage, you want the stadium to be full. It keeps the adrenaline flowing amongst the players. Personally, I hope a good number of Indians will turn out in our support tomorrow.</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Constantine says Indian football should learn from Qatar’s focus on youth development]</b> QFA’s policies led to Qatar winning an Asian U19 title and Aspire have been leaders in talent scouting in the Middle East and Africa. Their recent tie-up with Indian Super League club Delhi Dynamos is a step in the right direction. Should it work well, the next step could be for the QFA and AIFF to broaden the scope of the partnership. Indian football will welcome any external support from transparent institutions with proven expertise in talent development - the QFA and Aspire will have valuable knowledge to share in the fields of scouting, coach education, youth academy, nutrition and sports medicine.<br /><br />Talented Indian youngsters living in Doha could well be integrated into the official Indian football structure thanks to the AIFF’s overseas talent scouting programme, which was launched with an eye to identify talent for the FIFA U17 World Cup we will be hosting in October</p>
