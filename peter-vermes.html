  <p><b>[Sporting KC keeps scoring, and leaking, goals]</b> What was shown tonight was our mentality. We have a great mentality, there’s a great belief in the guys and in themselves. They believe in what we’re trying to do and to come back against a team away from home and in their home opener, there’s so much energy. You’ve got to fight through that and we did that.</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls and Timbers facing long odds to book MLS Cup places]</b> There’s nothing new that we’re going to come out with in this game and there’s nothing new that they’re going to come out with in this game. I think it’s going to come down to being very disciplined, very organized, and at the same time taking advantage of our chances and trying to minimize the ones that we give up.</p>
