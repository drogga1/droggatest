  <p><b>[Sporting Kansas City has signed 26-year-old Spanish midfielder Ilie Sanchez on a two-year]</b> Ilie is a player we have been interested in and followed for a long time. We are very fortunate to add him to our roster as we get ready for the 2017 season.</p>

  <p><b>[On Benny Feilhaber]</b> I always knew he was frustrated by the national team situation. At the end, a coach is going to make their decisions, and they’re either going to be correct or people are going to think they’re wrong. I think enough was enough at the end and told him he didn’t have to talk about it anymore. Him saying anything else wasn’t going to help. After that, he realized there was nothing more to say.<br /><br />He’s one of the best technical players, but technical is one thing. He’s a great decision maker on the field. He sees the game in ways that a lot of players don’t, and the bigger the game, the more he’ll take the ball. He’s not afraid in those moments. He actually wants it<br /><br />With us, we’ve put a demand on him on the defensive side and he’s taken that and owned the responsibility of it. He’s been accountable for it. Every year he’s gotten better. A lot of times he doubted himself early on in his time with us, he would get to a point where he didn’t think he could push himself further, and we let him know he could push himself further. He has more in him than he thinks he does from the physical aspect</p>

  <p><b>[Zusi embracing new USA role as latest Arena fullback transformation]</b> There’s no doubt, as I told Bruce, I think <b>[Zusi]</b> can absolutely play that position for the national team. He has an incredible engine, where it’s never going to be a problem for him to get up and down. He’s got a great conscience for the game.<br /><br />A lot of people don’t understand that he has an incredible engine. He’s a freak of nature in some respects. He can run all day long, and he’s strong mentally, so even if he’s tired he can push himself beyond those limits. In those positions you need guys like that because it’s one thing to have the demand of getting up and down, but there’s also the demands of the climate you find in MLS and in qualifying</p>

  <p><b>[Can a younger, faster Sporting Kansas City side rediscover the magic?]</b> It’s definitely younger. It’s got more pace to it. I think it’s going to be a hungry group. But we’ve got a lot of youth on the team because we feel that we needed to make a little bit of a turn within the group.<br /><br />We’re going to be who we are</p>

  <p><b>[Graham Zusi takes right back evolution to Sporting KC]</b> I told him, I thought the second half his 1v1 defending was tremendous on Nyarko. What Graham does so well is first off he has a great mentality no matter where you put him. He anticipates things tremendously. There were times where he stepped in front, he cut off passing lanes, he won the ball and was putting us on the counter quickly. And then he also can do something with the ball after that - it’s not like he wins it and just boots it away. He finds the next layer to play to. … If I were to play him at wing or play him in the middle of midfield, you would see a lot of the same stuff. He’s a true pro.</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Vermes couldn’t hide his contempt for FC Dallas’ tactics, and took issue with everything from the time wasting to the tactical fouls Oscar Pareja’s men committed]</b> I think there’s no doubt in this game, much different than the game in D.C., where the big difference was, it was in the management of the game. And not by our team, by any means. The rhythm of the game was broken many, many times, by different things. Whether it was a foul, or when the foul occurred the ball was kicked away. Or the ball went out of bounds and the game was delayed that way, that part wasn’t managed. When you’re asking the goalkeeper within the first two or three minutes of the game, to hurry the game up and you’re already having a talk with him, at what point are you going to realize that that’s going to be a tactic in the game and you’re going to manage that?<br /><br />A bunch of their guys went down with injuries that were suspect. That part is something, for us, we will continue to try and manage ourselves, but there is only so much you can do in those situations, and I think that broke a lot of the rhythm of the game<br /><br />I’ve been here now for going on 11 years, we’re not changing who we are. We’ve had a lot of success with who we are. That’s not the issue. At the end of the day everybody wants to score goals. If you had told me that, starting off the season, we’d have two clean sheets and we’re moving ahead the way that we are, with the kind of talent that we have, I think we’re in a great position</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto, Sporting KC take different lessons from scoreless draw]</b> Two of our goal less ties were on the road. If we can hold a team on the road with no goals it is a great thing in their own place. Any time you are away from home and you have held the home team with no goals that is very, very good.</p>
