  <p><b>[Sporting Kansas City has signed 26-year-old Spanish midfielder Ilie Sanchez on a two-year]</b> Ilie is a player we have been interested in and followed for a long time. We are very fortunate to add him to our roster as we get ready for the 2017 season.</p>

  <p><b>[On Benny Feilhaber]</b> I always knew he was frustrated by the national team situation. At the end, a coach is going to make their decisions, and they’re either going to be correct or people are going to think they’re wrong. I think enough was enough at the end and told him he didn’t have to talk about it anymore. Him saying anything else wasn’t going to help. After that, he realized there was nothing more to say.<br /><br />He’s one of the best technical players, but technical is one thing. He’s a great decision maker on the field. He sees the game in ways that a lot of players don’t, and the bigger the game, the more he’ll take the ball. He’s not afraid in those moments. He actually wants it<br /><br />With us, we’ve put a demand on him on the defensive side and he’s taken that and owned the responsibility of it. He’s been accountable for it. Every year he’s gotten better. A lot of times he doubted himself early on in his time with us, he would get to a point where he didn’t think he could push himself further, and we let him know he could push himself further. He has more in him than he thinks he does from the physical aspect</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting KC keeps scoring, and leaking, goals]</b> What was shown tonight was our mentality. We have a great mentality, there’s a great belief in the guys and in themselves. They believe in what we’re trying to do and to come back against a team away from home and in their home opener, there’s so much energy. You’ve got to fight through that and we did that.</p>

I think it’s going to come down to being very disciplined, very organized, and at the same time taking advantage of our chances and trying to minimize the ones that we give up.</p>
