  <p><b>[Sporting Kansas City gives contract extension to head coach Peter Vermes]</b> I have been extremely fortunate and I am incredibly appreciative for not only being a part of the vision of this ownership group and organization over the last 10-plus years, but also for the opportunity to continue to be a steward for the club.<br /><br />I have been involved with this project from ground zero and am exceptionally proud to be able to build on the foundation that has been created here<br /><br />We have a tremendous staff, an amazing fan base with a fantastic stadium environment, and players who are committed and dedicated to our club culture. All of these factors made the process extremely easy. I personally want to thank the ownership group so we can continue to do what we have done for this great organization</p>

  <p><b>[On Benny Feilhaber]</b> I always knew he was frustrated by the national team situation. At the end, a coach is going to make their decisions, and they’re either going to be correct or people are going to think they’re wrong. I think enough was enough at the end and told him he didn’t have to talk about it anymore. Him saying anything else wasn’t going to help. After that, he realized there was nothing more to say.<br /><br />He’s one of the best technical players, but technical is one thing. He’s a great decision maker on the field. He sees the game in ways that a lot of players don’t, and the bigger the game, the more he’ll take the ball. He’s not afraid in those moments. He actually wants it<br /><br />With us, we’ve put a demand on him on the defensive side and he’s taken that and owned the responsibility of it. He’s been accountable for it. Every year he’s gotten better. A lot of times he doubted himself early on in his time with us, he would get to a point where he didn’t think he could push himself further, and we let him know he could push himself further. He has more in him than he thinks he does from the physical aspect</p>

  <p><b>[Zusi embracing new USA role as latest Arena fullback transformation]</b> There’s no doubt, as I told Bruce, I think <b>[Zusi]</b> can absolutely play that position for the national team. He has an incredible engine, where it’s never going to be a problem for him to get up and down. He’s got a great conscience for the game.<br /><br />A lot of people don’t understand that he has an incredible engine. He’s a freak of nature in some respects. He can run all day long, and he’s strong mentally, so even if he’s tired he can push himself beyond those limits. In those positions you need guys like that because it’s one thing to have the demand of getting up and down, but there’s also the demands of the climate you find in MLS and in qualifying</p>

  <p><b>[Can a younger, faster Sporting Kansas City side rediscover the magic?]</b> It’s definitely younger. It’s got more pace to it. I think it’s going to be a hungry group. But we’ve got a lot of youth on the team because we feel that we needed to make a little bit of a turn within the group.<br /><br />We’re going to be who we are</p>

  <p><b>[Graham Zusi takes right back evolution to Sporting KC]</b> I told him, I thought the second half his 1v1 defending was tremendous on Nyarko. What Graham does so well is first off he has a great mentality no matter where you put him. He anticipates things tremendously. There were times where he stepped in front, he cut off passing lanes, he won the ball and was putting us on the counter quickly. And then he also can do something with the ball after that - it’s not like he wins it and just boots it away. He finds the next layer to play to. … If I were to play him at wing or play him in the middle of midfield, you would see a lot of the same stuff. He’s a true pro.</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Vermes couldn’t hide his contempt for FC Dallas’ tactics, and took issue with everything from the time wasting to the tactical fouls Oscar Pareja’s men committed]</b> I think there’s no doubt in this game, much different than the game in D.C., where the big difference was, it was in the management of the game. And not by our team, by any means. The rhythm of the game was broken many, many times, by different things. Whether it was a foul, or when the foul occurred the ball was kicked away. Or the ball went out of bounds and the game was delayed that way, that part wasn’t managed. When you’re asking the goalkeeper within the first two or three minutes of the game, to hurry the game up and you’re already having a talk with him, at what point are you going to realize that that’s going to be a tactic in the game and you’re going to manage that?<br /><br />A bunch of their guys went down with injuries that were suspect. That part is something, for us, we will continue to try and manage ourselves, but there is only so much you can do in those situations, and I think that broke a lot of the rhythm of the game<br /><br />I’ve been here now for going on 11 years, we’re not changing who we are. We’ve had a lot of success with who we are. That’s not the issue. At the end of the day everybody wants to score goals. If you had told me that, starting off the season, we’d have two clean sheets and we’re moving ahead the way that we are, with the kind of talent that we have, I think we’re in a great position</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto, Sporting KC take different lessons from scoreless draw]</b> Two of our goal less ties were on the road. If we can hold a team on the road with no goals it is a great thing in their own place. Any time you are away from home and you have held the home team with no goals that is very, very good.</p>

  <p><b>[Vermes couldn’t help but smile when told Orlando had been surprised by Latif Blessing’s insertion into the starting lineup]</b> It’s good when you can catch people by surprise.<br /><br />He’s obviously a very busy guy, very quick. He’s a little bit of an X-factor. He’s got a great nose for the goal, and incredible instincts around the attacking third. We expected that he’d be difficult to deal with. You look at his size, and just the quickness and everything, we figured that might be a little different player than they’re used to seeing<br /><br /><b>[Vermes said, referring to Blessing’s 82-minute shift]</b> The fact that he lasted as long as he did is really the big thing for me. He gave a great, great effort tonight. That’s what I commend him for the most</p>

  <p><b>[On Cyle Larin]</b> Obviously <b>[Larin’s]</b> athletic and all that stuff, but what he does really well is in and around the box he’s got really good movement. Like that goal he scored <b>[on Saturday]</b>, we showed I don’t know how many clips of that movement <b>[to our players]</b> and he still finds it. A lot of guys do that and they’re offside. His timing is good, but he also uses his athleticism in a really smart way and his movement in the box is fantastic.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona product Ilie Sanchez is now SKC’s invaluable man]</b> <b>[Sanchez]</b> is an incredible player. That’s great that nobody is giving him any buzz, but he is the glue of our group. He’s a fantastic player. He reads the game, is an incredible decision maker on the ball. He’s a top-level player.<br /><br />What happens when you have a guy like him, those guys - Benny <b>[Feilhaber]</b>, Roger <b>[Espinoza]</b>, <b>[Matt]</b> Besler, Ike <b>[Opara]</b> - they can play through him, and you can also higher up the field because he can play you the ball. He can link it. Whereas if the guy can’t find you then you have to come back and be further away from the goal. He’s patient, and is the most unselfish guy. He doesn’t lose himself in the match, and has a great maturity for a player in that position<br /><br />We were actually looking at three other guys, and I was in the process of making a decision between the three. We had done all our homework, we saw them live, we watched everything, and even talked to them about character. But then all of a sudden we’re in a meeting and one of my guys comes in and says, ‘I just got a phone call that Ilie Sanchez is available.’ So I go, ‘All right, we’re getting him.’ That was it. These three guys are out and we’re getting him<br /><br />I saw him live. I had been to Barcelona - <b>[assistant coach Kerry Zavagnin]</b> and I went there years ago, saw him up close and followed him for a long time. This is a guy that we always wanted but just couldn’t get to. It worked out, the timing. We got lucky a little bit</p>

  <p><b>[Why would Sporting KC trade Dom Dwyer to Orlando City after U.S. breakout?]</b> When the story was released that supposedly we weren’t getting anywhere, we were still 17 or 18 months out from his deal being done.

  <p><b>[On Matt Besler]</b> I thought he played really well. I thought the fact he played his game to his strengths, to what his qualities are, it showed that he is a player who can play at that level with the national team and that he can play - that him and Omar <b>[Gonzalez]</b> are very good tandem back there.<br /><br />He had a bump in the road. It happens sometimes. Sometimes players fall a little bit out of form.<br /><br />First of all, I think he has a great mentality. He always has a team first attitude. And he comes no matter what the situation is. He comes everyday and he works, not only hard but he’s professional. And all those things, they lend themselves to if you’re out of form, getting back into form. It also resonates with your teammates because they see the professionalism you have on an everyday basis</p>

  <p><b>[On Experience]</b> Experience is great only if you know how to use it. If you don’t know how to use it, it doesn’t mean anything. And so the fact we’ve played in a couple of these, as long as we know how to use the experience and we gain from it? Great. But if we don’t, it really doesn’t matter.<br /><br />I think the game will be fast paced. If you look at both teams and the way they play, I think there’ll be a good pace to the game. But I also think at some point the game will settle in, and then all of a sudden your play starts to come out and both teams will start dealing with the game, based on where it is and how teams are playing</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting KC fades late yet again]</b> I think that the last four or five games of the season, we fall out a form a little bit. That hurt us down the stretch, especially when you are in a good position like we were after in the LA Galaxy game. We had an opportunity to solidify first or second place, and we didn’t do that and that’s on us when you fall out of form towards the end of the season, which is something we have not done over the years.</p>
