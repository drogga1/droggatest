  <p><b>[Stuart Pearce has blasted Roy Hodgson’s decision to include Jonjo Shelvey in the England squad for their upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers]</b> He would have been asked, if you like, to step back down after, in his eyes, stepping up. I believe Gareth <b>[Southgate, the under-21 coach]</b> spoke to him and he was reticent, maybe, to play and as a result Gareth chose other people.<br /><br />I’ll ask the question why hasn’t Shelvey been involved in international football for the last year. I’d like to know the answer, he’s been fully fit. If he’s not made himself available how the hell has he got an England senior call-up?</p>

  <p><b>[Quotes on <a href="paul-gascoigne.html">Paul Gascoigne</a>]</b> The crackerjack of British football. The most talented individual I’ve played alongside. Even when he got into the England side, he was not fazed by anyone he played against. He had a real arrogance on the pitch, and loved football. Mad as a March Hare, and brilliant to have around the squad. The reason why England haven’t gone to semi-finals and beyond recently is we haven’t had another Gascoigne</p>

I would have thought other clubs might have put money down to take Hazard away from them - he’s the one player that gives Chelsea potential championship-winning ability. He’s got so much ability, and works hard for the team as well, when you throw that in the mix, he’s one of these that you need to keep educating, keep testing him in regards to whether you can improve him, but also make sure you tell him how well he is doing</p>

  <p><b>[England have to keep picking Marcus Rashford]</b> Harry Kane picks himself and you’ve got to keep playing Marcus Rashford. At the moment, I watched United against Newcastle and he didn’t have a very good game. I’ve got to say that. If anything, for the sake of English football, we’ve got to keep progressing his career I think. It’ll be a salvation for him to meet up with England and get away from Manchester United because of the cloud that’s at the club at the moment. He’s playing some games, he’s in and out the team a little bit. I think England could be a salvation to get him back on the pitch.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have been told by former boss Stuart Pearce that £50 million for Ben Chilwell will be the going rate]</b> That’s probably the going rate for an England international player, and it certainly is if Manchester City pick the phone up, you know you’re going to put £10m or £20m on to it anyway. I like the kid, I’ve seen him a couple of times this season and I’ve been very impressed by him, in an England shirt and a Leicester shirt. He’s of a great age, he’s 22 <b>[on December 21]</b> and you’re paying for the fact he could still have another 10 years. He’s got great energy and can deal with the ball really well. I think he would be a good fit for Manchester City and I can see why there would be interest.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City have been given ‘not a chance’ in their bid for an historic quadruple]</b> Not a chance. The weight of the games is just too much. I tipped Liverpool to win the league last summer and I still think they’re going to do that. There’s a lot of football to be played between now and the end of the season, and I think it will take its toll.<br /><br /><b>[A meeting with domestic rivals Spurs will present Pep Guardiola’s side with a stern test]</b> It’ll be a fantastic game. I think it’s the worst possible draw for City at this stage in the competition. I’m not sure Tottenham will be too enamoured by it either. But I think it’s going to be a very tight game. Tottenham have got to be in the game after the first leg. If they can take an advantage to go away from home, or stop City from scoring, then there’s always pressure on City being the home side <b>[for the]</b> second-leg</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany could have been ‘the best signing of the summer’ for Manchester City]</b> When I was watching Manchester City train pre-Pe <b>[Guardiola]</b>, you could see influence Vincent had on the training pitch. One thing I said yesterday was the best signing of the summer could be Vincent Kompany - to keep him at the club, keep his influence and hang on to leaders within the group. I’d be very interested to hear how that conversation went between Vincent and the club. You’d bet it would have been very amicable. Vincent’s been, arguably over last ten years, the best captain and best leader there’s been in the Premier League.<br /><br />If you’re going to bow out with Manchester City there’s probably no better season to do it than here and now with what they’ve achieved this year. He’ll have a connection with Manchester City in the future, whether that’s coaching, managing or as a statesman at the club, he’ll certainly have a future at City</p>

  <p><b>[Stuart Pearce believes reinforcements are required from back to front]</b> think all teams need to strengthen no matter who they are. Just to get a fresh face in the dressing room, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> with Kompany leaving that leaves an issue at the centre of defence, I think as well the holding midfield role as well as if they lose <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> for any period of time, which they did last season, would cause them problems.

  <p><b>[Stuart Pearce has revealed why <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> was left out of his Great Britain squad for the London 2012 Olympics, with <a href="micah-richards.html">Micah Richards</a>, <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> and <a href="craig-bellamy.html">Craig Bellamy</a> selected ahead of the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> legend]</b> The fact he was an overage player obviously played a part, but his age was irrelevant to me. Whether he was 24 or 37, it didn’t really matter to me, but it did meant he fell into the overage bracket. When I was entrusted in picking the squad, the one thing I wanted to do is have David in the squad. I wanted him to play well enough to set an example to the rest of the players in that squad with the way he carries himself, everything that he’d done to bring the Olympic games to this country. I was desperate for David to be in that squad. But, being the football man I am, I also wanted it to be a fair playing field for every player - so it was only ever going to be in my mind picked on ability. And because of the form of <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> and <a href="craig-bellamy.html">Craig Bellamy</a> and the fact I needed a good centre-half in <a href="micah-richards.html">Micah Richards</a>, they were the three overage players. I was backed into a corner in many ways and couldn’t pick David, purely because I knew I would have watered the squad down if I did.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether he was under pressure to pick <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> for his commercial value]</b> Oh, like you would never know. Honestly, it’s been the most difficult decision I’ve ever had to make in my life, certainly the most difficult decision in footballing terms I’ve ever had to make. I think discussions were had, bearing in mind Adidas sponsored the games, the kit and they were also David’s sponsor. I think conversations were also had between David’s agent and <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> about him having the captaincy - all these things were going on behind my back. And I even believe that once the decision was made by myself that he wasn’t going to be in the squad, it was even mentioned at Downing Street over whether it was the right decision or not, and whether they should replace me as manager - which I quite understand! He <b>[<a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a>]</b> wasn’t happy about it, and you can understand why. If he was happy about it, he wouldn’t be the man we all know he was. He was desperate to perform and play at the highest possible level. He was a world-class player, a world-class professional and a world-class fella as well. But I made it abundantly clear to every player when I met with them, and <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> was one of them, that you’ll be in this squad on form and form alone</p>
