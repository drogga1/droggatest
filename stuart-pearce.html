  <p><b>[Quotes on Paul Gascoigne]</b> The crackerjack of British football. The most talented individual I’ve played alongside. Even when he got into the England side, he was not fazed by anyone he played against. He had a real arrogance on the pitch, and loved football. Mad as a March Hare, and brilliant to have around the squad. The reason why England haven’t gone to semi-finals and beyond recently is we haven’t had another Gascoigne</p>

  <p><b>[Stuart Pearce believes reinforcements are required from back to front]</b> think all teams need to strengthen no matter who they are. Just to get a fresh face in the dressing room, Man City with Kompany leaving that leaves an issue at the centre of defence, I think as well the holding midfield role as well as if they lose Fernandinho for any period of time, which they did last season, would cause them problems. And I always think upfront, you can always strengthen with a striker</p>

  <p><b>[Stuart Pearce says <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> needs to really look at where he is during the January transfer window]</b> In January, he <b>[Foden]</b> really needs to look at where he is at the moment.

  <p><b>[Stuart Pearce reckons the Reds can go the season unbeaten]</b> The only thing that might stop them doing it is if they win the league and then <b>[Klopp]</b> plays around with the team at the end of the season. But at this moment in time I don’t see them being stoppable. I’ve never seen a team win the ball back in the opposition’s half as much as they did <b>[in the 4-0 win over Leicester]</b> - <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> couldn’t get out of their own half.<br /><br />The work rate from the front five is incredible. <b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold scored and provided two assists]</b> His delivery is fantastic and his energy is great</p>

  <p><b>[Stuart Pearce has revealed why <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> was left out of his Great Britain squad for the London 2012 Olympics, with <a href="micah-richards.html">Micah Richards</a>, <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> and <a href="craig-bellamy.html">Craig Bellamy</a> selected ahead of the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> legend]</b> The fact he was an overage player obviously played a part, but his age was irrelevant to me. Whether he was 24 or 37, it didn’t really matter to me, but it did meant he fell into the overage bracket. When I was entrusted in picking the squad, the one thing I wanted to do is have David in the squad. I wanted him to play well enough to set an example to the rest of the players in that squad with the way he carries himself, everything that he’d done to bring the Olympic games to this country. I was desperate for David to be in that squad. But, being the football man I am, I also wanted it to be a fair playing field for every player - so it was only ever going to be in my mind picked on ability. And because of the form of <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> and <a href="craig-bellamy.html">Craig Bellamy</a> and the fact I needed a good centre-half in <a href="micah-richards.html">Micah Richards</a>, they were the three overage players. I was backed into a corner in many ways and couldn’t pick David, purely because I knew I would have watered the squad down if I did.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether he was under pressure to pick <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> for his commercial value]</b> Oh, like you would never know. Honestly, it’s been the most difficult decision I’ve ever had to make in my life, certainly the most difficult decision in footballing terms I’ve ever had to make. I think discussions were had, bearing in mind Adidas sponsored the games, the kit and they were also David’s sponsor. I think conversations were also had between David’s agent and <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> about him having the captaincy - all these things were going on behind my back. And I even believe that once the decision was made by myself that he wasn’t going to be in the squad, it was even mentioned at Downing Street over whether it was the right decision or not, and whether they should replace me as manager - which I quite understand! He <b>[Beckham]</b> wasn’t happy about it, and you can understand why. If he was happy about it, he wouldn’t be the man we all know he was. He was desperate to perform and play at the highest possible level. He was a world-class player, a world-class professional and a world-class fella as well. But I made it abundantly clear to every player when I met with them, and <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> was one of them, that you’ll be in this squad on form and form alone</p>
