  <p><b>[England midfielder Keira Walsh has revealed how their relentless boss <a href="phil-neville.html">Phil Neville</a> is continually striving for more from his side]</b> Most people know <a href="phil-neville.html">Phil Neville</a> by now. He’s never satisfied with any performance. He kind of just told us what he wasn’t happy with and I think as players we already knew that, when we came off, the second half wasn’t what we wanted it to be like. But I think the main thing was that we got the result and three points in the first game puts us in a good position in the group.<br /><br />We reviewed the game and spoke about the areas we need to improve in and hopefully we can take that into the Argentina game. On a personal level I quite like being told what I’m not doing well. That lets you know what you need to be improving on and most of the time I can’t hear him anyway. I’m sure some of the players who are closer to the touchline probably just want him to calm down a little bit but he’s a great personality and he really drives the team. He knows what it takes to get to the top. He’s been at the top as a player for I don’t know how many years, so the players really do listen to what he’s saying whether it’s positive or negative and every individual tries to improve that in their next performance</p>

  <p><b>[Keira Walsh thanks <a href="nick-cushing.html">Nick Cushing</a> for his trust]</b> Everyone at the <a href="cfa.html">CFA</a> knows he’s a special guy. He’s had such a big impact on the women’s team and my career especially. I’ve got a lot to thank him for and I do make sure I tell him that. It’s important because I don’t think I’d be where I am now if it wasn’t for him</p>
