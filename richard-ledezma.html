<blockquote>
  <p>[When Christian Pulisic left the United States to join Borussia Dortmund at the tender age of 16, he was by no means the first young American to try his luck abroad. Another member of that talented squad who has already made the jump to Europe is gifted midfielder Richard Ledezma] It wasn’t that difficult to make the move to Netherlands. I’ve been away from my family for almost two, three years, playing with Real Salt Lake in Utah. So we were living in dorms and I don’t think it’s much harder. PSV help me with my nutrition, with my food and how I eat. It’s the quantity of food you eat, I guess. Because I came a little chubby, when I got here, I guess. They all called me ‘fatty’ and stuff, so I was like, cool, you know? So no more McDonald’s!<br /><br />[Ledezma himself, meanwhile, agrees with Ruud van Nistelrooy’s assessment of his biggest strengths] I play as a No.10 or No.8, although I can also play the No.6 role. But I’m more flashy as a player, so I like going forward more. I like to assist, to create goals. I’m not about scoring goals, but about assists, you know, that’s my thing<br /><br />[With that in mind, it’s no surprise that Ledezma idolises former Barcelona superstar Andres Iniesta, as well as his aforementioned compatriot Pulisic] Role-models? Iniesta… He’s a big player obviously. I know it’s hard to compare, but I think I could do it one day. You have to aim high. Pulisic is an inspiration too. I played Fortnite with him once, the video game. It was nice talking to him, giving me a little advice. I look up to him, he’s the number one when it comes to Americans playing soccer in Europe<br /><br />[His contract with PSV is due to expire at the end of the 2019-20 campaign] My ambition here at PSV is to convince the club to trigger that option. So hopefully I get those two extra years and move up to the first team quickly. And then just experience first-team minutes. My ideal route would be to get those two extra years, but to be playing with the first team and some games with Jong PSV obviously. And hopefully move higher and higher. [I would] play in the first team for a few years and then maybe move to Spain. Real Madrid are my favourite club in the world, but I don’t necessarily see myself playing there…</p>
