  <p><b>[Speaking to Rangers TV, Calvin Bassey paid tribute to all <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> had taught him as he looks to progress further with his new club]</b> I’m really excited. Rangers are a massive club and I am just buzzing to get started. Ever since Rangers were in the picture and speaking to my agent, I was really excited and they were one of the clubs I thought highly of and I am just happy now to get started – I cannot wait. I feel Rangers is the right place for me because I have seen players such as Joe Aribo come from south of the border and do so well. I appreciate everything <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> have done for me, and I just feel Rangers are offering me a massive platform to take my career to the next level and showcase my ability to the world. I know the fans are very passionate and want to win – and that’s like me – I always want to win. I know Rangers has a very rich history, and I have played at Ibrox before <b>[for <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> U20s]</b>, but the stadium was empty as it was just a friendly. You could feel the history though and it was a good experience – I just can’t wait to play there when it is a full stadium. I was delighted when Rangers came in for me. I know it comes with big pressure and that the fanbase are amazing. I’ve never had football the easy way – I signed for <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> at Under 16’s and I have always had pressure, so I feel like the pressure will be a blessing in disguise for me to help me take my career to the next step</p>
