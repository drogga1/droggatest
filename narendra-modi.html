  <p><b>[Narendra Modi stated that the FIFA U-17 World Cup should not remain the final objective as far as the sport is concerned]</b> India is going to host the FIFA U-17 World Cup in 2017, but successful hosting of the event alone cannot be our final objective. FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017 must be a catalyst for change, the tipping point for football in the country, which can only be done by creating a mass movement around it. The objective is to give an opportunity to every child in the country to play football.<br /><br />Mission XI Million will take the beautiful game of football to at least 11 million boys and girls around the country. Children in every state, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Arunachal Pradesh will get a chance to learn, play and enjoy football. More than 15000 schools around the country will be partners in this<br /><br />We need the support not just of children but also of every parent and every teacher to encourage boys and girls to play football and develop both skill and fitness. I am confident that these children will be able to take Indian football to its rightful place in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomes participants,encourages youth to ‘go out and play’]</b> I want our young generation to connect with sports. It is a matter of great joy for our youngsters that we are hosting the FIFA U-17 World Cup from 6-28 October. 24 teams from the world over will be making India their home for that period. Let’s welcome all the teams and enjoy the spectacle.<br /><br />Sports Ministry has developed a sports portal for budding sportspersons of the country. It will be launched tomorrow<br /><br />During this age of computer, the playing field is more important than PlayStations. Play FIFA video games but also go outside and play actual football on the fields</p>
