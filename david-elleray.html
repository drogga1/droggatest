  <p><b>[Ryan Giggs’ wonder-goal won the 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay between Manchester United and Arsenal]</b> If you can bottle that up and sell it, then that’s the English FA Cup at its best.<br /><br />There was an irony because in the first game we disallowed a goal for United that was probably incorrect and that upset them. The Arsenal one though was clearly offside. It was just one of those evenings when the emotions in the stands took over the reality and that’s why it was difficult to calm down a lot of them as they celebrated. I think everyone sensed that there was only going to be one goal in it so any goal was going to be treated like gold dust and that’s what happened there<br /><br />I’d been privileged once or twice to be with special goals. But on this night it was pretty clear that this was something very special. I was struggling a bit to keep up with him because in the first game I had collided with Nicky Butt and fallen over and slightly jarred my back. By extra time in the replay it was just beginning to seize up a bit, so I was struggling a bit to keep up with everything. I don’t know how much one remembers from the time and how much one is effected by what one sees now, but certainly when it was scored there was an air that it was something pretty special. And it was before the days when you had to give a yellow card for taking your shirt off to celebrate, so that saved me being the wet blanket in the party</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>’s attempted cross was blocked when the ball struck Sissoko’s chest and then deflecting onto his arm, prompting referee Damir Skomina to immediately point to the spot]</b> If the arms are extended beyond that silhouette then the body is being made unnaturally bigger, with the purpose of it being a bigger barrier to the opponent or the ball. Players should be allowed to have their arms by their side because it’s their natural silhouette.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[David Elleray talks about handball]</b> Deliberate handball remains an offence. In the past we’ve managed to improve the laws by focusing on outcome rather than intent. What we are looking at particularly in attacking situations is where the player gets a clear unfair advantage by gaining possession or control of the ball, as a result of it making contact with their hand or arm<br /><br /><b>[Elleray stated the introduction of the ‘natural silhouette’ rule was designed to prohibit defenders placing their arms behind their backs in fear of giving away a free-kick]</b> We’ve changed it to say the body has a certain silhouette. If the arms are extended beyond that silhouette then the body is being made unnaturally bigger, with the purpose of it being a bigger barrier to the opponent or the ball. Players should be allowed to have their arms by their side because it’s their natural silhouette</p>
