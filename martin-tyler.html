  <p><b>[on <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>]</b> He is a celebrity and probably the most famous face in sport, but first and foremost he is a footballer and he has continued to be successful on the pitch even after leaving <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, and to finish by winning <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> with <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> is a great way to end a fantastic career. You always think of his crossing but he was a better all-round footballer than he was given credit for - I had my doubts when he went to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> but he proved that he was a proper player in any climate, country or team - while he is a proper gentleman, too; he is very comfortable in the public eye but he has never been brash</p>

  <p><b>[What football team does commentator Martin Tyler support?]</b> I don’t do social media and this is one of the reasons why. They all think I support somebody. I support Woking and I am quite happy to say that. I first went to Woking when I was eight years old and it was the first football I had ever seen. They’ve always been my team<br /><br /><b>[He even denied the assumption that he was a <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> fan]</b> How can I be a <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> fan when I’ve got excited about <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a>? All I do is react to the game. It’s a great bonus to not have a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> team. I’m probably the only commentator to not have a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club<br /><br />This thing where you have to have a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> team is garbage. It’s the accident of birth. It’s the one thing that irks me when people say you must have a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> team, I absolutely, categorically don’t</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Tyler pays tribute to <a href="jack-charlton.html">Jack Charlton</a>]</b> Obviously as player he was one of the boys of ‘66, we’ve lost another one. <a href="bobby-charlton.html">Bobby Charlton</a> was much more famous earlier but he was Bobby’s older brother and that’s how he was first brought into the limelight. Then he established himself. <a href="alf-ramsey.html">Alf Ramsey</a>, the manager, saw something in him as a player quite late on in his career and suddenly he was catapulted alongside Bobby. It was an extraordinary family feat and such a football family, the Charltons and the Milburns. My sympathies go to all of them. Jack was unique, absolutely unique. As a player he was no-nonsense and as a man he was no-nonsense<br /><br />I got to know him very well, I commentated with him on England games early in my career and he put me straight a few times and he was always a pleasure to be around. He was always open, he’d always got something to say but he didn’t mince his words. Sometimes he got his words a bit muddled up actually. He was famed for getting one or two of the players names wrong, and those who played under him would tell you that as well, but that was all part of his charm. And then of course he became a very successful manager in his own right. He’d done a little bit of television and then he was a club manager and then taking the Republic of Ireland to the World Cup quarter-final in 1990 was a remarkable feat. It was just a unique way of doing it. It was simple way of playing, a straightforward way of playing, Jack’s image really.</p>
