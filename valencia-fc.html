These images <b>[are]</b> without any sort of technical rigour and offer a distorted view of the play. <b>[It’s a]</b> manoeuvre which creates a social alarm like a loss in confidence in the current VAR provider and in the skill of the Spanish referees.<br /><br />The <a href="rfef.html">RFEF</a> wants to make it clear that there can be no confusion and will raise the relevant complaint to international judicial and football organisations to analyse the situation and apply the corresponding measures.

We also wish to express our confidence in our healthcare system and the recommendations by the Ministry of Health for those cases of coronavirus infection being treated with isolation</p>

It must be remembered that this game was held behind closed doors, amidst strict measures in this regard, on the orders of the Spanish health authorities to prevent the risk of contagion by Covid-19, precisely due to the presence of persons from an area already publicly classified as ‘at risk’ at that time</p>
