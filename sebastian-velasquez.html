  <p><b>[Why Sebastian Velasquez spearheaded healing efforts in his new city after El Paso mass shooting]</b> It caught me by surprise. It was really scary in the sense that throughout the last couple of years you hear about these shootings, but they’re very far away from you. You never think you’re going to be around something of that magnitude. So, when it happened, and it’s only four miles away from home, it really shook me up. My baby daughter was already born and I have a son. It scared me<br /><br /><b>[That safety and cultural richness of El Paso had attracted Velasquez]</b> I think it’s funny, and I think it’s pretty cool that here you can go into, like, an Italian restaurant, and you can still order some tacos. Anywhere you go you can get tacos<br /><br /><b>[He started amplifying the Gooner Gals’ GoFundMe. For Velasquez, the story struck home. As a young player in South Carolina, the community had supported him by buying T-shirts to send him to try out at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s famed La Masia academy]</b> They were trying to buy tracksuits for their team for travels and for games. Then, unfortunately, this maniac came with an AK-47 and started shooting at them. Growing up, especially in this country, there’s a lot of times where you do fundraisers, and when it has to do with a sport and it has to do with kids, a lot of people help out. And a lot of people helped me out back in the day for my career to travel. It’s basically people you’d never expect to come help out and then they come do something unexpected<br /><br /><b>[Velasquez wasn’t content, however, to simply retweet or endorse a cause. He and his Locomotive teammates were tireless in finding places to connect and plug in, also taking part in a charity soccer game shortly after the shooting]</b> The soccer game was an idea from a couple of the soccer leagues here. They got in touch with me and I spoke to a couple of the guys. We ended up coming together and made this soccer game happen. At that event, we raised $16,000. I got to meet Mr. Beto O’Rourke, he’s one of the presidential candidates. He walked up to me and said, ‘Listen, I’ve heard about everything you’ve done. Thank you so much. I know you’re not even from here’.<br /><br />That’s when I kind of thought to myself, like, why did I do this? I think it’s just the fact that when people are going through dark times, I’ve always needed someone else to do something for me that I didn’t expect<br /><br /><b>[The former Real Salt Lake player has been open about his struggles with alcoholism]</b> That’s kind of how I’ve been able to lift myself through problems I had in my past or through situations where I couldn’t get out. When other people came and helped me, that was the only way I was able to do that. It’s kind of a burden I’ve always had, like, I’m going to help. It doesn’t matter if I’m from here or not, I’m going to try and help in a little way, and thankfully we were able to help in such a massive way. I didn’t expect it to blow up the way it did, I didn’t expect that much money to be raised. But I didn’t expect 22 people to lose their lives and so close to home. You’re like, ‘Do I sit on my ass and not do anything or do I figure out a way to help?’ Every single person helped<br /><br /><b>[Locomotive are an expansion team, but even before the tragedy, the club has made inroads toward becoming relevant with an average attendance of 6,783 putting it 8th in a 36-team league]</b> It’s gone beyond soccer. Soccer is an incredible game that comes with a lot of passion, a lot of different things, a lot of things come into it, money, business, sales, all that good stuff. But when this happens, you forget about that stuff. You put all that stuff aside. This is beyond soccer. Soccer is a game. This is people’s lives. <br /><br />Now, we’re like, ‘OK, What’s the next step?’ This happened. People lost their lives. Families are broken. People went through trauma. People will never forget this. If you lost someone, your life will never be the same. So as a team we kind of have this weight that we put on our shoulders and - we actually spoke about this - this happened and now we have to come out on top for the city, to give the city something to talk about, to give the city a little bit of a band-aid to try and forget about that day or forget about that weekend, about what happened for a couple of hours. <br /><br />If we win games, if we’re doing well, people are going to come out and if you enjoy a game for two hours, the food, the company, people bringing their families out, their kids are laughing and it’s just a time where you’re coming together as one, as El Paso, as a soccer community and you’re enjoying a victory, enjoying the games, enjoying the sport. That’s the weight we put on our shoulders. That’s where we’re at right now. We’re trying to play as best we can and bring out some light to the city</p>
