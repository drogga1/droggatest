  <p><b>[Johor Darul Ta’zim captain Safiq Rahim has no issues with the decision of the club to change head coaches mere days before the season starts]</b> For me, the decision is beyond my authority as a player. For us, we just need to carry our responsibility and give our full focus on the game because that’s our job. The planning is made by the management to improve the club, and for us, we must concentrate, focus and give our commitment on the pitch. As players, we have to admit and accept the decision. Whatever that the club is doing is for the benefit of the team. People come and go, either coaches or players, but the most important thing is the club. We must respect the club, our brand and take it positively.<br /><br />We respect Kedah because they are a good team. They won the Malaysia Cup last year. The important thing here is our motivation and desire to win. Playing at home, we don’t want to get a bad result and if we give our best, then we can win. I don’t know whether I’ll be playing or not. But for any players that have the chance to play tomorrow, the important thing is we play for the team. If we follow the orders, tactics and play as a team, we will get the victory. This game is important because it is the first game of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Safiq Rahim, the key for JDT now is to continue their momentum as they will take a break from the league]</b> We cannot stop here. We must maintain and keep this momentum. We will continue with the AFC Cup and FA Cup after this so we have to keep this momentum until the league resumes. We have a good full squad here at JDT. Whoever is playing, they must follow coach’s plan and remember our philosophy here at JDT and hopefully we will get positive results.</p>

  <p><b>[Safiq Rahim confident that JDT will still go through despite letting in two away goals]</b> For me, both sides have a chance. Ceres are one of the better teams. The one goal advantage is still ours. We have to be more discipline, concentrated and focus. Anything can happen over there. I hope we still can qualify.<br /><br />We have our good games before but those are in the past. We cannot take the easy way. Maybe tonight <b>[Wednesday]</b>, we have certain parts that didn’t do too well because we conceded twice. But end of the day, we can come to win and that’s good<br /><br />Among the players, we have played in the fasting month before. Even in the league we played last season. We have the experience. What is important is for us to keep our momentum and take our chances. I’m confident my team mates can overcome Ceres if we follow what is instructed</p>

  <p><b>[Safiq Rahim opens up on his time with JDT, his career best and what’s next]</b> For me, from 2013 until now - there has been a lot of changes at JDT. Whether with our philosophy or our environment, a lot has changed. I’m very proud to be part of JDT until now. I hope I can continue to help JDT and give my contribution to the team in years to come.<br /><br />We can see that in 2013, JDT made a change and we hit a great height in 2015 with an Asian triumph. To do that in 2 years is a great achievement not only for the club but also for Malaysian football. It’s not impossible that we can continue to create more historic moments for the club as well as Malaysian football<br /><br />In my career until this point - there’s no doubt that it was my best achievement. I never thought that I can hit such heights at a club level. I’m very proud to be part of the JDT team at that time and I was happy to create history for JDT. But that is not the full stop. We want more and we are hungry for more success and to continue to ink our names in the history books<br /><br />It’s more than 50% into the project. Me as player, I’m not satisfied yet with what I’ve achieved so far with JDT. I want more successes and I believe that the JDT team also want to achieve more successes in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Matured Safiq Rahim eager to make full use of time available]</b> The negative memories are the times when we can’t help JDT get the trophies that we target each season. Those for me are the not so nice memories when I can’t help the team. Not just to win cups but every game. If we can get good result in every game, that’ll be the sweet memories.<br /><br />I’m more matured now. There’s still a lot to learn because we constantly have competitive games. Every year there are targets and we are serious about achieving those targets. That makes me improve and get better. I’m very proud to be here and maybe that’s a blessing for me to further better myself<br /><br />I’m thankful to HRH Crown Prince of Johor for accepting me in JDT from 2013. He has been very helpful to the players and staffs. He also gives us a lot of motivation and that’s our advantage at JDT. Every game, our head or the father of our football gives us the motivation to give our best performance every match<br /><br />The responsibility is the same for everyone but the eagerness and the desire perhaps is a bit more for me because of my age. Time is shortening fast and I know I must make full use of the time to achieve more success in the game. I want push myself and the others to get the best performance every game. Every player, it doesn’t matter whether they are senior or junior - everyone has their respective responsibilities. Us as the more experienced players, we can guide them as individual and as team to give their best every game<br /><br />I hope myself and my team mates can retain the league title this season and go as far as we can in the AFC Cup. We want to emulate our success in 2015. We have the best squad and the best team, so we cannot waste the strength that we have and hopefully we can create more histor</p>

  <p><b>[Safiq Rahim vows that the team will improve in the next game]</b> We couldn’t keep our momentum and advantage from the first half but we gave our best. Their number 20 <b>[Rabih Ataya]</b> gave us a lot of trouble and changed the game. But this is what we need to learn and we cannot make anymore mistakes. We need to consistently play like we did in the first half. It was lapse on our part. Our confidence when we are under pressure by the opponent. I hope this is used as a lesson for the team.<br /><br />Anyone chosen by the coach need to give 100% commitment to the team. For me, there’s no problem with who selected but just need to do our best when on the field. We cannot think negative. It’s only 10 days that the coach has taken the full team and now the players know a bit what the coach’s philosophy is and I’m confident we can build up the team well. Hopefully we can improve again after this. I’m confident in the coaching staff and management but it’s down to us players. Me and my team mates will need to our best for the team and help the coach. They have already done their part and we have to do the same</p>

  <p><b>[Safiq Rahim is aiming to achieve a historic 4th league title with JDT]</b> Thankful that JDT was able to bring back three points against our nearest rival, which helped to increase the gap between us and Pahang. The win tonight <b>[Tuesday]</b> is down to the hard work from the players and the coaches. I hope we can maintain this in the coming games whether home or away.<br /><br />We cannot take things for granted. JDT still have matches left to play in the Super League this season, even though we picked up nine points in three straight matches and are top of the table. That is why we need to keep the maintain, work-rate and team spirit because we want to achieve another new history for JDT. If we can keep the same mentality, I’m sure we can retain the title for the fourth time</p>

We cannot deny that we want support from everyone. We hope the fans will turn up for the game tomorrow and with their presence, it will spur us on to be extra motivated to get a good result.</p>
