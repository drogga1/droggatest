I’m not a guy who wants to push himself into the spotlight or stand out from the crowd<br /><br />I heard it said that I wanted to play with the No. 97 shirt against Cyprus to mark the occasion, but that’s not true. I’m a normal guy who wants to play games, whether it be the first, the 95th or the 97th of my international career.<br /><br /><b>[He later added on the Cyprus qualifier]</b> I know I’ll be put in the spotlight, but I don’t know how. I’ll try to enjoy that in front of my family</p>

  <p><b>[Jan Vertonghen claims to be very happy at Tottenham, but has offered no indication that he will be committing to a new contract]</b> I just want to focus on this year, I know I have got one year left so I know a lot of questions will be asked. I have said it before, I am very happy at the club. The supporters have been great for me, the manager has improved me a lot and has a lot of confidence in me. I feel very, very good physically so I am not sure what is going to happen this year, I can only say I am happy where I am at and I feel the support from the manager, team-mates and the squad<br /><br /><b>[Vertonghen added on a familiar face]</b> You never know but I have played for so many years with Toby Alderweireld, he is a very good player and a great guy for the group. Like I said it is out of my hands but he is here now and I am happy with that<br /><br /><b>[Vertonghen believes Spurs are already strong enough to hold their own]</b> We just look at ourselves, we want to be in the best shape possible, whoever comes in or goes out that is out of our hands. We have got a great squad with great guys and whoever is here is ready to play for Spurs</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if a new contract was on the cards anytime soon]</b> No. I just want to focus on football now. When you don’t play, you realise how important it is and it’s extremely important for me. I’ve been so long with the guys, I love the club and I just want to play as much as I can. I feel great and I just want to help the club to win trophies<br /><br /><b>[Rumours of a fallout between <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> and Vertonghen have been swirling in recent weeks]</b> No, no, no – I came back fit. I played in every pre-season game and I didn’t miss a <b>[training]</b> session. Like the manager explained before the first game against Villa, it was a tactical decision and I respect that decision. We players have to accept his decisions. I’m very, very happy to be back<br /><br /><b>[Spurs squandered a 2-0 lead in their latest outing against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, extending their winless run to three matches. Vertonghen feels <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a>’s goal right on half-time was a turning point in the match]</b> I’m experienced and fit enough to get back into the rhythm and it was just the goal before half-time that gave them the spirit to get back in the game. If we just killed the first half and go into the dressing room with that good feeling it’s a different game. It was very frustrating. We did well, we defended well, we were good in possession, created loads of chances, were 2-0 up so it was just great in this derby away. So we have to go in the dressing room 2-0 up.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham’s attention is now about to shift to Champions League matters, with last season’s beaten finalists preparing to open their group stage campaign with a trip to Olympiakos]</b> We want to go as far as we did last year. We’ve got a nice group. Good games, nice challenges, teams we haven’t played against yet. Like 15 or 20 teams feel like they belong there, so we’ve got a big challenge. But we had a great run last year and we want to repeat it. We’ve earned their respect now. Teams treat us differently than a couple of years ago. But they will look at us as an outsider</p>

It went our way in the first half (when <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> had a <a href="wilfred-ndidi.html">Wilfred Ndidi</a> goal ruled out for offside), their way in the second. It makes football a different game, it takes a lot out of it. It’s for the good but it has changed a lot<br /><br /><b>[Vertonghen admitted that it was painful to see <a href="serge-aurier.html">Aurier</a>’s strike ruled out at the weekend]</b> It’s painful. City probably felt the same in the quarter-final of the Champions League. It was the same distance <b>[as Son’s]</b>. It was tough because I thought we were doing well, we thought we were going 2-0 up. We were defending well. We didn’t create too many chances but we felt comfortable. The game goes on. It takes a long time to make these decisions. I think we also deserved a penalty in the first half on Danny Rose – it looked like one. Whatever. It’s tough when it goes against you and good when it goes for you<br /><br />If you’re <b>[leading]</b> 1-0 and the way we were playing – we felt good, we were dominating – then maybe you should put the game in the bag. We need to keep clean sheets as well. We didn’t give them many chances. <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> are a very, very good team. They’ll challenge for the top places. They’ve got lots of quality and we dominated. Coming from <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a>, which wasn’t good, and bouncing back in this way until the disallowed goal is something to look at in a positive way</p>

  <p><b>[Jan Vertonghen has refused to be drawn on his intentions when it comes to a new contract being signed at Tottenham]</b> I’d prefer not to go into that, but there is always movement there, of course. It’s my eighth season and I’m feeling great. Maybe the results didn’t come our way <b>[at the start of the season]</b>, but they were tough away games and you always have to see how you bounce back from that. <b>[My future is]</b> not a distraction. I’m very aware of my age. I feel fairly young. It doesn’t distract me. I want to play as many games as possible. I’m very ambitious and I feel I’ve got a few good years left at the top level<br /><br /><b>[Vertonghen denied life at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> has turned stale]</b> I don’t agree. We improved every year. Last year we went to the Champions League final. Some new players came in and that keeps it fresh. I don’t see that it’s stale at all. I see plenty of joy in the dressing room. Everyone enjoys playing here. The mood at this point is good. It was a good win for us on Saturday. If you go down to 10 men and they score to make it 1-1, then we fought and really stuck together. We wanted to show who we are. If you see after the final whistle how happy we were, that’s how we are</p>

  <p><b>[Jan Vertonghen says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s players will have sleepless nights after their embarrassing 7-2 home defeat to Bayern Munich]</b> Bad, heads down. Everyone’s ashamed of this result. I think everyone will have a bad night’s sleep, and probably a couple, about this. I feel extremely hurt - all negative words. It’s embarrassing. It’s a very bad result. I felt like they were extremely clinical. There’s never an explanation for a score like this, but they punished us with every single mistake we made. We let the players and everyone at the club down with this result. It’s good that the next game <b>[at Brighton]</b> is already in a couple of days. We have to get back together - and I feel like the group is together - to overcome this defeat. The next game on Saturday will be a good moment to get rid of, not 100 per cent, but a bit of this feeling</p>

We’re all responsible. He put us on the pitch to win and we haven’t been doing that like we should, so everyone feels responsible<br /><br /><b>[Vertonghen did not send a public message of thanks to Pochettino]</b> I sent him a <b>[private]</b> message. That was my message to him<br /><br />Sometimes you’re a victim of your own success. He <b>[Pochettino]</b> did so well and the expectations got bigger. That’s the world of football. It’s a business world, as well. I came here and played in the Europa League and he definitely brought this club to the next level. Not being in a top-four spot is now disappointing</p>

I just can’t get my head around how people still do this. I have got no words for it. If any of their players or our players are affected then I apologise in the name of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, but they are minority idiots. We don’t identify with these people. I didn’t hear anything, but if these things are still happening it is a disgrace and we should act strongly against it. I have got no idea how people still, or ever, thought this way. Sometimes you think people are smarter than this. I am very convinced it is just a minority, but it is very wrong. I don’t know how you fix these idiots but this is an opportunity for the right people to act strongly against it. Not just here, not just in this country, but in Belgium, in Holland, in other countries where I watch football, it is a problem everywhere and this is another opportunity to make a statement<br /><br />My general feeling is that in England they act strong and maybe they have to act even stronger. I think outside of the UK, and I am talking about <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and other football associations in European countries they can do better. The way I see it is it is still everywhere, it’s not that in different countries I have played there is nothing at all. I always see England as one of the countries who are ahead in the multi-cultural society. That is why I love London, that is why I love the UK and the fact that in this country where I think they are ahead of other countries, it hurts. It is not just a problem at this stadium or in London or the UK, it is everywhere in the world and it is wrong</p>
