  <p><b>[Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen believes team-mate Mousa Dembele is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League]</b> I don’t think people know how good Mousa is. He’s a special player and I can’t think of anyone else who is a bit like him. For me, he’s up there with the best two or three midfielders in the league. He’s a very humble guy, that’s one of his main characteristics. He’s a very special player and I certainly prefer to play with him than against him. You can ask every single player in the team and I don’t think you can describe how good Mousa is. You can only know if you play with him or against him, see him train for a couple of weeks, then you’ll find out.<br /><br /><b>[Vertonghen revealed how his relationship with Dembele started as a teenager]</b> I first met him when I was 12. I went to Antwerp to play for a team <b>[Germinal Beerschot]</b> and he played for the same team. I played for that team until I was 16. We weren’t really friends then, we knew each other and you know, he’s a good guy<br /><br />I then saw him again in Amsterdam. When I was 16 I moved to Amsterdam to play for Ajax and when he was 18 or 19, he came to Amsterdam to play for AZ Alkmaar, which is close to Amsterdam. He lived 100 yards away from me, I knew him, I stopped by his house and that’s how it all started, in Amsterdam. We met again in the national team a year later when I was 20, he was already playing for the national team and that’s where we really bonded. Then he came here! He came here a couple of weeks later than me and we got close. Our girlfriends are both from Amsterdam. He became a father, I became a father and all these things helped us to get closer and closer and he feels like a friend for life</p>

  <p><b>[Vertonghen breaks Belgium appearance record with 97th cap]</b> Yes, it’s true. He came to me to tell me to take the captain’s armband. I thought that was really nice of him, but I refused. I’m not a guy who wants to push himself into the spotlight or stand out from the crowd<br /><br />I heard it said that I wanted to play with the No. 97 shirt against Cyprus to mark the occasion, but that’s not true. I’m a normal guy who wants to play games, whether it be the first, the 95th or the 97th of my international career.<br /><br /><b>[He later added on the Cyprus qualifier]</b> I know I’ll be put in the spotlight, but I don’t know how. I’ll try to enjoy that in front of my family</p>

  <p><b>[Jan Vertonghen admits to snubbing Arsenal for Spurs]</b> It was as close as it can get. My agent went to Arsenal, I wasn’t there myself but it was very respectful and in the end I had to make a choice and I chose Spurs. I chose Spurs and I think it’s turned out well. I felt I was joining a great team, with great plans and the personal chats I had with people at Spurs were great. I followed my instinct, my gut feeling and that’s it.<br /><br />I don’t want to say it on the basis of one season, maybe two seasons, but the last three - including this one - we’ve done very well, we’re building a great team with the manager and the new stadium is coming up. I am very, very confident we will win a trophy very soon. You want to win trophies. I want to play in a cup final. That’s what happened at Ajax to be fair. We were a team with a lot of quality that was waiting for a few years for a trophy. Sometimes you need that trophy or a big win against at Real Madrid or top six side to realise how good you are. I am convinced that if you win one trophy, then the rest will follow. We are going to challenge for both (the FA Cup and Champions League) and then we are trying to finish in the top four, so we have three targets. This is what we are playing for and very confident we can keep it going</p>

  <p><b>[Jan Vertonghen insists he holds no concerns over the future of his Tottenham centre-back partner Toby Alderweireld]</b> Whenever we play we understand each other. When I left for Tottenham, Toby left for Atletico <b>[Madrid]</b> and Southampton but we found each other quite quick after that, so no stress. We’ve been playing together for a long time and we know how to play together, but I don’t want to speak about this because it might sound disrespectful to whoever is playing next to me or next to Toby in other situations.<br /><br />You speak about that peak here at Tottenham and it is even more so at Belgium, especially defensively. I am one of the youngest! We have players like <b>[Vincent]</b> Kompany, <b>[Thomas]</b> Vermaelen, myself and Toby Alderweireld who are around our 30s, when you should be at your best. I think we are now. This could be the year where we need to reward ourselves. We have had great compliments before and now everyone knows what we can do. With Kevin De Bruyne, Eden <b>[Hazard]</b> or all the other guys where we are at, we should reward ourselves</p>

They dropped off a bit then that early goal in the second half helped. We had the confidence to keep going. It was <b>[my first goal]</b> since the first game this season and I had to wait for goal-line technology then so I was happy that I could just go <b>[to celebrate this time]</b>! It was at Wembley too in the Champions League so it was special. It was one of those nights. We were able to keep them quiet in the second half and they weren’t able to be clinical.

  <p><b>[Son Heung-Min is one of the best players in the Premier League]</b> In a way, you get that, because everyone knows how big of a player Harry is, how big of a player Dele is, so important for us, and to be fair we struggled a bit to kill games early in the Premier League, but we gave a chance to other players, the biggest example obviously is Sonny who has stepped up and scored so many goals since Harry got injured. I can think of a couple more, Fernando Llorente, another massive goal, and yeah, gives us the opportunity to see other people.<br /><br />I’ve played with some great players and against some great players, and Sonny is special, he’s so humble and I think that you underestimate that because of the work he puts in, then his quality, outstanding left foot, right foot. He can play striker, left wing, right wing, he can play as a 10, he played as a wing-back here, so we feel each other there, but no, he’s an outstanding player. I’m not going to say he’s at the level of whoever, but he’s one of the best in the Premier League<br /><br />I’ve seen him stop smiling… I’m not going to say when! But, no, he’s a very happy guy. He’s so loved in the dressing room. He gets on with everyone and you can see why, he’s a great player to have around</p>

But they spend it in a responsible way. They attract good players, young players and they cost a lot of money. But I think we have got a very very good team with an unbelievable mentality. We all want to fight for each other, I hope it’s going to stay like this in the coming years<br /><br />We have started well, we haven’t conceded yet. Hopefully we can start a reputation. Everyone is counting on Sonny. We’ll have Harry coming back from injury hopefully soon. Everyone needs to step up like we did before. We won I think all of our Premier League games without Harry and hopefully we can do it again.</p>

It’s been the craziest one ever and being at the end of that crazy campaign now is something unbelievable. We all played our parts and hopefully we can hold the trophy at the end of the game. In the group stages, we should not have lost that away game at Inter, we got one point after three games, the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> away game… there are so many I can’t tell them all, but it’s been crazy. To be playing in a Champions League final is something to cherish. How many games have we played to get here eventually? Twelve games? In every single one of them, something crazy happened.<br /><br />At the end of my career, I’ll hopefully look at this and think this was the most beautiful and craziest year of them all. I don’t know about destiny. We have to win it, if it is to be destiny. We feel very confident because of our campaign as well.

If we just killed the first half and go into the dressing room with that good feeling it’s a different game. It was very frustrating.

Not just here, not just in this country, but in Belgium, in Holland, in other countries where I watch football, it is a problem everywhere and this is another opportunity to make a statement<br /><br />My general feeling is that in England they act strong and maybe they have to act even stronger. I think outside of the UK, and I am talking about <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and other football associations in European countries they can do better. The way I see it is it is still everywhere, it’s not that in different countries I have played there is nothing at all. I always see England as one of the countries who are ahead in the multi-cultural society. That is why I love London, that is why I love the UK and the fact that in this country where I think they are ahead of other countries, it hurts. It is not just a problem at this stadium or in London or the UK, it is everywhere in the world and it is wrong</p>

  <p><b>[Jan Vertonghen offers <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> contract hint as he prepares to weigh up ‘pros and cons’]</b> I’m in a process right now that I have to grab a piece of paper and write down the pros and cons of the options I will have soon. I will really have to decide what I want in my career. In three to four years, I will go to the place where I will likely settle down. I have to start thinking about where I still want to live, what language I want to learn, what culture I still want to live in. And also, very importantly, which competitions and prizes I still want to win. I don’t want to regret anything in my career</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> defender Jan Vertonghen has admitted he is open to leaving the club]</b> I want to sign with the right club. It could be <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, or another club. It must be a club with ambition. I want to play in Europe, as the national team is important for me. I want to play in Europe and learn another language. Spain and Italy are options. And the duration of the contract will also play a role<br /><br />It might sound weird, but since the corona crisis there is more interest. I’m a free agent and some clubs might not have a lot of money</p>
