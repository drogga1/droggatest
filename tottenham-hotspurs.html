  <p><b>[The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust (THST) has thanked <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> following his sacking]</b> We’re shocked and saddened to hear our club has sacked <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> and his coaching staff. During his time at Spurs, Poch gave us many of our best moments as supporters, made Tottenham Hotspur a force to be reckoned with again, and forged a strong link with the fans. We will never forget the joy he brought us. Of course, results in the league have been disappointing for some time. But many fans thought Poch had earned the right to turn it around in the first sustained period of poor form we’ve had during his time at the club. We now have to look forward and take stock. But there are questions that must be asked of the board<br /><br />The club’s statement makes it clear the board has decided to sack the manager and coaching staff. It is their decision. We question why this decision was taken at the end, rather than the beginning, of the international break. We question whether the timing of the decision leaves the club with much choice in who takes over. To take the decision it has, the board must have a clear plan for what and who comes next. It needs to tell this club’s supporters what that plan is. And the board also needs to consider its own role in this.<br /><br />Is the manager solely accountable? How much has the board’s line on wages and transfers contributed to player unrest and disaffection? How much did it contribute to the situation we now find ourselves in? And will it change to help support a new manager? We’d like to put on record our thanks to <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>, Jesus Perez, Toni Jiminez and Miguel <a href="gaetano-d-agostino.html">D’Agostino</a> for the fantastic football and magical moments they have brought us over the last five years</p>

  <p><b>[Spurs confirm Son to complete military service in South Korea during <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> coronavirus break]</b> The club can confirm that <a href="son-heungmin.html">Son Heung-min</a> will commence his mandatory military service in South Korea this month. The forward arrived back in his home country at the end of March where he is currently in quarantine. Our medical staff are in regular contact as he concludes his recovery after fracturing his arm in our 3-2 win against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> on February 16 and continues to train. Sonny had surgery on his arm in South Korea before returning to the UK at the end of February to continue his rehabilitation, prior to the initial announcement of the professional game in England being suspended as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> has since announced that the 2019/20 season will only return when it is ‘safe and appropriate to do so’ and is under constant review. Son will return to London following the conclusion of his military service in May</p>

  <p><b>[How each <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club is handling coronavirus pandemic football shutdown]</b> We are acutely aware that many supporters were against the decision we made regarding furloughing staff… and our intention to apply, if applicable, for the CJRS (Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme). In view of supporter sentiment regarding the scheme it is not our intention to make use of the current CJRS that runs until the end of May. We shall consult with stakeholders, including the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust <b>[THST]</b>, with whom we have been in dialogue over the past week and who share our desire to protect jobs, should circumstances change going forward</p>
