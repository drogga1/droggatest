But it’s not the physical structure of the stadium that’s really the emotional part of it; it’s the years of going there, the experiences you’ve had going there, my dad taking me as a kid and me now taking my boys. It’s walking down the High Road with my dad and sons - three generations of us going sometimes - that’s where the real emotion lies, not with the structure itself.</p>

I swear on my kids’ lives that I am not that kind of guy. I apologise if I have offended anyone from both clubs, especially Tottenham. It was a mad thing I did and I never meant to offend anyone in any way. I never meant anything by it. I have been charged with throwing an object. I am not charged with anything racist. The police were happy to accept it was not racist. I have made a big mistake and I am sincerely sorry for it. The Arsenal player was gloating in front of the away fans. He came up towards the away fans and is basically nodding his head and clapping at us. The fans at the front were getting upset and shouting and swearing. Without thinking, I picked up this banana skin and threw it on the edge of the pitch. I didn’t throw it at the players. It was just on the edge of the pitch.<br /><br />I regretted it after a few seconds. I thought, ‘shit, what did I do?’ It was not meant to be racist but it was completely wrong and I will take my punishment. I am deeply sorry. It is totally out of character. I didn’t think of the racist connotations. If I had thrown an apple or a pear, it would have been OK - but because it was a banana, it wasn’t. I phoned Tottenham to apologise and they said they would be getting in touch with me to ban me for life<br /><br />They were happy to say it was not racism. I have got black people in my family. I have got nephews in London with black partners and they have kids. I grew up in Tottenham, where 70 per cent of people are black. I have been friends with black people all my life. I do not have a criminal record and I have never been in trouble with the law in my life</p>

During his time at Spurs, Poch gave us many of our best moments as supporters, made Tottenham Hotspur a force to be reckoned with again, and forged a strong link with the fans. We will never forget the joy he brought us. Of course, results in the league have been disappointing for some time. But many fans thought Poch had earned the right to turn it around in the first sustained period of poor form we’ve had during his time at the club. We now have to look forward and take stock. But there are questions that must be asked of the board<br /><br />The club’s statement makes it clear the board has decided to sack the manager and coaching staff. It is their decision. We question why this decision was taken at the end, rather than the beginning, of the international break. We question whether the timing of the decision leaves the club with much choice in who takes over. To take the decision it has, the board must have a clear plan for what and who comes next. It needs to tell this club’s supporters what that plan is. And the board also needs to consider its own role in this.<br /><br />Is the manager solely accountable? How much has the board’s line on wages and transfers contributed to player unrest and disaffection? How much did it contribute to the situation we now find ourselves in? And will it change to help support a new manager? We’d like to put on record our thanks to <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>, Jesus Perez, Toni Jiminez and Miguel <a href="gaetano-d-agostino.html">D’Agostino</a> for the fantastic football and magical moments they have brought us over the last five years</p>
