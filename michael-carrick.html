If someone wants to speak to me, I will try and help them. Even if it helps someone else without me even speaking to them, it is a bonus</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United assistant Michael Carrick has stressed manager Ole Gunner <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> isn’t letting speculation surrounding his future impact him or the club]</b> That is just the way it goes. It is not something you even contemplate at all and that’s genuine. In a position like this, as a coach or player at United, you can’t be swayed by what is said outside. We are professional, focused and believing in what we are doing. It’s not an issue at all. There is a lot of work going on behind the scenes not just putting the first team together.<br /><br />I have had all this since when we were winning leagues. I remember the start of the 2007/08 season there was stick because we weren’t scoring enough goals or we weren’t playing well enough. Then we won the Champions League. So you become totally oblivious to it, that’s the truth. Some of the things said or written, it doesn’t effect us. It is the nature of the game. The beauty of being at this place is the scrutiny and expectations. And if you are fortunate to be here a period of time, you get used to it. Some of the young lads and new boys coming in, they will get used to it as well</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Carrick admits The progress made by <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> this season has been fantastic]</b> I think he’s done great. It’s not always easy, I think history tells you that. When you look through the pages of this club, when new signings have come in, sometimes it takes a little time to adapt, you know that, and it doesn’t mean they’re not good players or they don’t have real good quality in their play. I think it’s just what playing for this club brings and playing in the league. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is so different to other leagues so, sometimes, it takes time to get used to it, but credit to Fred<br /><br />He’s stuck at it, he’s learnt and he’s been willing to put the work in and try to improve. He’s been fantastic for quite some time now and I’m sure there’s more to come, because he’s that kind of boy. He wants to keep improving, he wants to keep learning and getting better and there’s plenty more to improve, like any player, so we’ll keep working at it<br /><br />This is when it counts now, the business part of the season when cup runs are coming towards the end of the competitions and you want to be in there challenging. This is the point I always loved and thrived on as a player, because this is when it really matters</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Carrick thinks with players coming back and the arrival of Fernandes they have a perfect blend in midfield]</b> I think sometimes we’ve been forced where the lads who’ve been fit have played and done well. When Nemanja <b>[Matic]</b> and <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> have played they’ve done ever so well, they’ve done terrific as a two and complimented each other and blended really well.<br /><br />It’s about getting the right mix. Certain games suit certain things, which is something for us as staff and Ole to decide what fits a certain game. I do think all of sudden now with everyone fit and Bruno coming into the squad we’ve got a lovely variety to choose from<br /><br />The beauty of it is the variety and the different options the boys give you. They’ve all got their strengths, but they can play together, there are combinations in there that can play in twos and threes together, but they all bring something different, which is the perfect blend and balance. I’m looking forward to seeing it</p>

  <p><b>[How meticulous Michael Carrick has defied his <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> critics]</b> He has helped me a lot in this process of adaptation and transition. He’s a guy who was an idol at the club and was a great player in the same position that I play. On a daily basis, he helps me a lot, always talking to me</p>

  <p><b>[First-team coach Michael Carrick admits <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> remain in the dark when it comes to expiring contracts and possible transfer dealings]</b> Honestly, I’m not sure how that’s going to work. I don’t think it’s been sorted. Contracts, for instance, how do they work? At every club, players’ contracts are up; how do you sign players? I don’t think it’s been sorted. It’s not something I’m directly involved in but we don’t even know when we’re officially going back to training yet. It’s so much further down the line and it’s a tough one to plan for. Then you start talking about: how much money is going to be left in the game to sign players? Not from us specifically, but from all the clubs, and how does that affect the whole transfer circus?<br /><br />There’s certainly a really good feeling in and amongst the players and the staff, and in the club. We’re not getting ahead of ourselves as we’ve not achieved anything yet. We’re not getting carried away, but there is certainly a nice connection about the place. We’re trying to do things in the right way. Ole has come in and he’s doing everything in the right way for the club. He’s talking about the whole club and the fans, and what it means, to have a connection with everyone. I think that’s quite powerful as it builds. I think that gets you through tough patches as well, which we’ve had to deal with, but if you do it for the right reasons and you mean well, and there’s progression, then hopefully that means more. Hopefully we can carry on with the progression we’ve been on. I’ve always felt, even when we had those runs last year and they weren’t easy to deal with, I always thought we’d be alright, and time will tell if that pans out. At the moment, I’m excited with what’s ahead</p>

  <p><b>[The potential that exists in a midfield partnership of <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> and <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> excites Michael Carrick]</b> It is understandable why a lot of the questions are ‘can they play together’ because they are two fantastic talents. We feel we’ve got a really good balance in midfield between all the lads really. It is kind of unfair to single them out asking ‘can they play together’ because the other boys have done a terrific job and will have plenty to say as well. Of course, the talk is about Bruno and Paul and I’m sure they can play together. That’s why they are both here at the club and I’m sure they are looking forward to it. But as Bruno and Paul would totally understand me saying, it is not just about them. We’ve got so many other options with lads who have already proven what they bring to the team. It is exciting to have that. They all bring something different and all have their own strengths</p>
