  <p><b>[Michael Carrick hails Rooney as he prepares to join England’s 100 club]</b> Obviously it’s a huge achievement. We’ve been lucky over recent years - we first had Becks <b>[David Beckham]</b> and then Ashley <b>[Cole]</b>, then Stevie <b>[Gerrard]</b> and then Frank <b>[Lampard]</b> - to have five players like that in such a short space of time shows that we have had some special players. Wayne is right at the top of the tree for what he has done throughout his career. He is leading <b>[Manchester]</b> United and England. Hopefully he can get <b>[Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring]</b> record pretty soon as well.</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Carrick has hailed the impact Harry Kane has made at Tottenham this season]</b> The progress Harry Kane has made has been sensational, he’s gone up two or three levels. His performances keep improving. What has impressed me the most is that as the spotlight has increased on him, his performances have only improved and improved. That’s a good sign. I’m sure that shows that this season is not a one off - I think he’s got a big future ahead of him.<br /><br /><b>[Carrick, meanwhile, is enjoying being recalled to the England squad]</b> It’s great to be back with England. We’ve had a good week at Manchester United and when things are going well you just want to keep playing games. Credit to the manager and staff here for putting a run together after the World Cup. We have real positive feelings around the squad. I am enjoying my football. You get to a certain age and you don’t know how long you have left. I feel great at the moment and have certainly got another year in me. It is special to be involved <b>[in the England team]</b>. I love seeing the younger lads coming into the squad and performing with an enthusiasm and energy. There is a good feeling around</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Carrick believes Harry Kane has been sensational for Tottenham]</b> I think he’s been sensational. If you look at the start of the season to the level he’s at now, he’s jumped a couple of levels at least. What’s impressed me most is that as the spotlight has grown on him and he’s given more praise, and as defenders are becoming more aware of him, he’s taken his game on and kept producing. He had a big call-up to the England squad and then scored a hat-trick at the weekend. It’s almost like he thrives on that little bit of pressure and expectation to do what he’s done. And it looks like there’s more to come from him. We’ve only had the one training session but he’s got a real presence and, having played against him a couple of times, I’ve been hugely impressed with him. Sometimes players have a good spell and then drop away, but I don’t see that with him. You can see the progression and see him really fulfilling that over a period of time.</p>

The game will be very special for myself and my family and I hope it will also be a memorable day of celebration for all involved.<br /><br />It is such a privilege to have this amazing opportunity and I’m excited at the prospect of bringing together some former team-mates as well as some of the best players I’ve played against. The incredible support I’ve received over the years is something I’m very grateful for and I could never thank you, the fans, enough. As much as the occasion is about football, I also see this as a chance to give something back. All the proceeds from the game are going to charity. I hope to raise as much money as possible for my Foundation to help make a difference to children’s lives. It’s something I’m very passionate about and I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to making this testimonial possible</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick has revealed he is likely to quit professional football if he is not offered a new contract at Old Trafford]</b> I don’t think there are many <b>[other]</b> places I’d want to play, if any - after this, anyway. I probably would say, ‘Yes, that would be it.’ I’ve had such a time here that I don’t think I’d go ­elsewhere. I understand I’m not going to play every game and I haven’t really got a problem with that, but I need to be playing enough. There’s pride as well. Gary ­Neville springs to mind - he stopped halfway through the ­season. He said, ‘You know what? That’s it. I can’t do it now,’ which you’ve got to respect. I don’t want to be ­hanging around too long just for the sake of it. I’d want to be going out when I still feel I’m ­contributing enough.<br /><br />I haven’t really had that much of a conversation with him yet. Obviously that will happen at some stage - pretty soon I’d have thought. That’s something I’m really relaxed about, and I’m sure he is as well.</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Carrick makes future call as he approaches end of Man Utd contract]</b> It won’t be anywhere else in England <b>[next season]</b>, no. I’ve had too many good times here to do that elsewhere. I’ve said it for a number of months now, I’m just really enjoying playing football. When you get to this age and you come closer to the end, obviously you get asked these questions but I’m just trying to play and compete in the team and be part of the squad and see how long that takes. I feel fit at the moment and we’ve got such a busy time, I haven’t really given much thought to it, I’ve just been playing and concentrating on what we can achieve this season. Anything else can be sorted out in good time. In some ways you do <b>[try to enjoy every moment]</b>, and in some ways it’s just what I’ve always done. Of course, around the corner, you’re thinking about how long you’ve got left but then you come in to training and go about your business exactly in the same way.<br /><br />You can see that Mourinho is a winner and he’s won wherever he has been. You can see that it drives him on and it’s all about winning and rightly so. That’s what you want, you want to be winning things and be successful. We’re still a bit short in the league but we won the EFL Cup already and we’re going for another one. He’s driving for that and he’s hungry, you can see he’s hungry for more and he wants more success.<br /><br />It’s the same with any manager <b>[around the training ground]</b>, you speak to him at certain times and it’s no different. There’s no special formula if you like, you’re creating relationships on a personal and professional level. I think it’s a respect thing more than anything. Obviously to respect the players and for us to respect him as a manager and his coaching staff and to get the right balance. I’m sure he will bring success whether it is this season or the next or the one after, whenever it is, he will bring success</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Carrick has saluted departed Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney as incredible]</b> Obviously Wayne leaving the club is a big deal and he has been such a massive part of this club since he first set foot in it and since making his debut, an incredible debut. I am sad to see him go. I understand why he has gone and we all fully support him and wish him well because he has been an unbelievable servant to the club and has left a legacy that is incredible. We had some great times but everything comes to an end unfortunately. It is the end at Man United for Wayne. I am sure he will go on to have a successful end to his career, but he will certainly be missed by a lot of us here.<br /><br /><b>[On Romelu Lukaku]</b> Listen, you have seen what he can bring to us. He is a big guy, he has got a big presence and he scores goals. That is what we are going to need from him, that is what he is going to bring and I am sure he will have a great time here. You don’t want to look to put everything on his shoulders, but that is why he has been brought here - to help at that end of the pitch, to score and create goals. As a team and as attacking players everybody needs to chip in to score goals and share the load a little bit, to take the pressure off the individuals. But of course, he is going to be the <b>[main]</b> one we look to for scoring goals and I am sure he will</p>

I’ve grown to love the club over the years and to be in this position is very special to me.<br /><br />I’ll just be myself, you can’t change, it’s wrong to suddenly get a role and start shouting and screaming at everyone and telling them what to do.

  <p><b>[Michael Carrick is looking for Manchester United to challenge on all fronts this season]</b> It is difficult to say what our chances in the league are but we are setting out to be on top. We have certainly improved the squad, we look stronger, we are a year further ahead with the manager and his staff, we are in a better place than we were last year, so things are on the up. For large spells of last season, we felt we should have been higher up in the league than we were and performances certainly warranted that for large periods as well. But it is too easy to sit here and say that. We need to improve because we ended up a distance away from the top. Hopefully this season we will be right up there challenging.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether the Premier League crown has become more of a priority in 2017-18]</b> The league is special because it is such a tough division to win. When you come out on top it is an unbelievable feeling to know you are the best team in the country, and you have gone through all sorts of things along the way to win that. Cup competitions are special because it is a slightly different feeling. Winning a trophy is winning a trophy and the feeling you get from it is incredible. There are obviously bigger competitions than others, but we will certainly be fighting on all fronts to win as much as we can</p>

You want to get through to the next round of the cup competitions, but it can also end there and then. It is when the pressure and expectation cranks up and it changes, but that is what we want to be involved in - the big games, the edgy games, coming out on top and that’s what makes winning so special<br /><br />There is definitely a determination to put it right. You can’t ignore the fact that, when you have a bad result or two, here there is criticism and scrutiny that comes with it. You expect it and get used to it. The feeling from me and the lads in general is a determination to get back out there and put it right and bounce back. You can’t sit and mope about it. It is what it is and that’s why we play for this club. There is a responsibility to do well and you have to deal with it.</p>

  <p><b>[Unique Lingard hailed by Carrick as England benefit from Man Utd moulding]</b> I think his movement - he moves off the ball very well. It’s something that sounds quite simple, but it’s difficult to defend against. He senses where the space is and how to use it. I wouldn’t necessarily say he’s a dribbler with skills and tricks but he’s dynamic. How he plays, he is unique in some ways. You don’t see so much of that in the game as everyone wants to get on the ball and do something on the ball. Off the ball, he’s very effective.<br /><br />I remember watching Jesse over on the back pitches <b>[at the Aon Training Complex]</b> when he was a young lad. He must have been 15 and I was seeing this tiny little kid running around. You could see then the ability he had - his movement, awareness and all that sort of stuff. It was just about his physicality and giving him time to develop. You can’t give enough credit to the staff behind the scenes for letting him take his own time to develop and nurturing him in different ways. Now, obviously we’re getting the rewards from that. He had a great season <b>[in 2017/18]</b>, scoring a lot of goals and he is now a big player for us</p>

It would be amazing to be a manager, but I am not in a position to call that. It’s not fair or respectful to be going down that route at this stage. It’s gold dust having Jose there to draw on what he’s doing and learn from him. I’m really enjoying it. It’s a role that I never thought at this stage of my coaching career that I would get. I’m not there as an intern to try and just learn. I’m there to do a job as well and at the same time try to improve myself. It’s kind of about learning what works for certain lads. Do they need an arm around the shoulder or a bit of a dig in the ribs to liven them up? Those are the skills of coaching and managing. I’m not blasé enough to think that I’m going to be a manager. The truth is: I don’t know. I’m at that stage now where I’m thinking: ‘Will he make it or will he not?’ Everyone can’t make it. I’ll just have to give it my best shot and see where it takes us. I’m not chasing it. I’m in a fantastic position right now. I’m not looking to get out of that position any time soon because I want to do something else</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Carrick has revealed that Cesc Fabregas scuppered his dream move to Arsenal]</b> Then, on the way home, we got another call. Arsenal again, asking us to meet Arsene. As it happened we were driving past his home in north London, so we arranged to call in on the way. Within an hour I was sitting in the front room of Arsene Wenger’s house, pinching myself. Could this really be happening? Arsenal! Could I really be on the verge of signing for the Invincibles who’d just gone through the season unbeaten? We talked for almost an hour about football. Wenger had the Community Shield at the weekend but was spending an hour with me, so surely he had to be interested in signing me? ‘Let’s get Cardiff out the way, and we’ll see you Monday,’ Wenger said as we left. Things were moving so fast I needed a few minutes to put it all into perspective. That night, I sat at the bottom of my bed and talked it through with Lisa, just running all the possibilities through my mind. It came from nowhere. My head was spinning. Arsenal were finishing either first or second in the Premiership.<br /><br />On the Sunday, I settled down at home in Theydon Bois, Epping, to watch Arsenal, my team to be, in the Community Shield against Manchester United. I saw that a kid, Cesc Fabregas, only 17, started in Vieira’s place. Fabregas played a blinder but I didn’t think too much about the significance. I sat at home on Sunday night waiting for the call to arrange details of the next day. Arsenal! I couldn’t wait. But I waited, and waited, and that call never came. The next day, I had to go into training at West Ham instead and, on the way, David <b>[Gold]</b> phoned to say he’d had a call from <b>[David]</b> Dein. David relayed the gist of his message, like, ‘I’m sorry, the manager says we don’t need Michael. Fabregas is coming through like he is. Sorry, the deal’s off.’ Fabregas’ performance changed Wenger’s mind about needing me. I was totally devastated as I had my heart set on Arsenal and playing with all that talent. My head was gone. Arsenal had swayed me and I didn’t have a clue what I’d do now<br /><br />Out of nowhere, Spurs’s sporting director, Frank Arnesen, called. ‘We’re bringing in good young British players, and we want you, Michael.’ I knew Paul Robinson and Sean Davis had arrived. Spurs were on the up and it was a good time to join. Arsenal’s rivals wanted me! I looked at Spurs’s playing style and thought, ‘This is going to suit me.’ I’d been thrown a lifeline. I rang Lisa and then Mam and Dad, who were on holiday with Lisa’s parents. ‘Oh, by the way, we’re going to Tottenham!’ I told them.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho is a winner and stands alongside Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson in a top three of the best bosses of the last 25 years]</b> When people ask me about him - ‘Jose, what’s he like, what’s he bring?’ - it’s winning that is the thing that strikes me the most. He’s proven it for so long, you know? To do it where he has gone and done it, it’s winning. He’s managed to win trophies at United. We’re striving now to get back to it, but as a manager you can’t hide from the fact about what he’s done. It’s up there with the very best. Fortunately for me, you look at the best managers over the last 25-30 years. You’re picking the top three, top five - two of them you’d say Jose or Sir Alex are right up there. I’ve been lucky enough to experience that and take what I can from both of them.<br /><br />I think time will tell with that one, really. It’s difficult to set out on a kind of given pathway. If you ask me now, then managing is something that interests and kind of the long game, or the end goal at some point, it’s something that I would like to get to. That’s not me assuming that that’s going to happen just because I am where I am now, and the next step is that and the next step is that, and then all of a sudden this is where I’ll end up because I know that’s not how it works. But, of course, now, just like when I set out to be a footballer when I was a bit younger and you’re on that first step of the ladder, that’s the target and you try to be as good as you can be. That’s exactly where I am at now, trying to be as good as I can be and learn from the great Jose Mourinho at close quarters. Learning but at the same time I am there to do a job and I am there to do a job for a reason, and I’m well aware that I am not there just on a learning curve. I am there to do what he wants me to do, so it’s getting the balance right.</p>

The situation I’m in at the moment, my first job after being a player so there’s a huge element of learning and trying to soak up as much as I can to improve myself. But at the same time I’m there to do a job and there’s a responsibility there. He’s been great with me. He’s given me plenty of things to do and at the same time he’s trying to help me develop. I couldn’t have asked any more of him<br /><br />It was going to be tough for anyone. It was always going to be tough because the club was so set in its ways and so stable with Sir Alex and David Gill being chief executive for so many years. With them leaving together, there was always going to be change in some way and it was just how it was dealt with. The whole thing just got unsettled and unfortunately that season it just didn’t work for us. As players, I’m the first one to blame myself. Before you blame anyone else you’ve got to look at yourself. It’s just frustrating and you think all that work you’ve put in for so long to establish that and then it can be affected so quickly</p>

We are professional, focused and believing in what we are doing. It’s not an issue at all. There is a lot of work going on behind the scenes not just putting the first team together.<br /><br />I have had all this since when we were winning leagues. I remember the start of the 2007/08 season there was stick because we weren’t scoring enough goals or we weren’t playing well enough. Then we won the Champions League. So you become totally oblivious to it, that’s the truth. Some of the things said or written, it doesn’t effect us. It is the nature of the game. The beauty of being at this place is the scrutiny and expectations. And if you are fortunate to be here a period of time, you get used to it. Some of the young lads and new boys coming in, they will get used to it as well</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Carrick admits The progress made by <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> this season has been fantastic]</b> I think he’s done great. It’s not always easy, I think history tells you that. When you look through the pages of this club, when new signings have come in, sometimes it takes a little time to adapt, you know that, and it doesn’t mean they’re not good players or they don’t have real good quality in their play. I think it’s just what playing for this club brings and playing in the league. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is so different to other leagues so, sometimes, it takes time to get used to it, but credit to Fred<br /><br />He’s stuck at it, he’s learnt and he’s been willing to put the work in and try to improve. He’s been fantastic for quite some time now and I’m sure there’s more to come, because he’s that kind of boy. He wants to keep improving, he wants to keep learning and getting better and there’s plenty more to improve, like any player, so we’ll keep working at it<br /><br />This is when it counts now, the business part of the season when cup runs are coming towards the end of the competitions and you want to be in there challenging. This is the point I always loved and thrived on as a player, because this is when it really matters</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Carrick thinks with players coming back and the arrival of Fernandes they have a perfect blend in midfield]</b> I think sometimes we’ve been forced where the lads who’ve been fit have played and done well. When Nemanja <b>[<a href="nemanja-matic.html">Matic</a>]</b> and <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> have played they’ve done ever so well, they’ve done terrific as a two and complimented each other and blended really well.<br /><br />It’s about getting the right mix. Certain games suit certain things, which is something for us as staff and Ole to decide what fits a certain game. I do think all of sudden now with everyone fit and Bruno coming into the squad we’ve got a lovely variety to choose from<br /><br />The beauty of it is the variety and the different options the boys give you. They’ve all got their strengths, but they can play together, there are combinations in there that can play in twos and threes together, but they all bring something different, which is the perfect blend and balance. I’m looking forward to seeing it</p>

  <p><b>[How meticulous Michael Carrick has defied his <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> critics]</b> He has helped me a lot in this process of adaptation and transition. He’s a guy who was an idol at the club and was a great player in the same position that I play. On a daily basis, he helps me a lot, always talking to me</p>

  <p><b>[First-team coach Michael Carrick admits <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> remain in the dark when it comes to expiring contracts and possible transfer dealings]</b> Honestly, I’m not sure how that’s going to work. I don’t think it’s been sorted. Contracts, for instance, how do they work? At every club, players’ contracts are up; how do you sign players? I don’t think it’s been sorted. It’s not something I’m directly involved in but we don’t even know when we’re officially going back to training yet. It’s so much further down the line and it’s a tough one to plan for. Then you start talking about: how much money is going to be left in the game to sign players? Not from us specifically, but from all the clubs, and how does that affect the whole transfer circus?<br /><br />There’s certainly a really good feeling in and amongst the players and the staff, and in the club. We’re not getting ahead of ourselves as we’ve not achieved anything yet. We’re not getting carried away, but there is certainly a nice connection about the place. We’re trying to do things in the right way. Ole has come in and he’s doing everything in the right way for the club. He’s talking about the whole club and the fans, and what it means, to have a connection with everyone. I think that’s quite powerful as it builds. I think that gets you through tough patches as well, which we’ve had to deal with, but if you do it for the right reasons and you mean well, and there’s progression, then hopefully that means more. Hopefully we can carry on with the progression we’ve been on. I’ve always felt, even when we had those runs last year and they weren’t easy to deal with, I always thought we’d be alright, and time will tell if that pans out. At the moment, I’m excited with what’s ahead</p>

  <p><b>[The potential that exists in a midfield partnership of <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> and <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> excites Michael Carrick]</b> It is understandable why a lot of the questions are ‘can they play together’ because they are two fantastic talents. We feel we’ve got a really good balance in midfield between all the lads really. It is kind of unfair to single them out asking ‘can they play together’ because the other boys have done a terrific job and will have plenty to say as well. Of course, the talk is about Bruno and Paul and I’m sure they can play together. That’s why they are both here at the club and I’m sure they are looking forward to it. But as Bruno and Paul would totally understand me saying, it is not just about them. We’ve got so many other options with lads who have already proven what they bring to the team. It is exciting to have that. They all bring something different and all have their own strengths</p>
