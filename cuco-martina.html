  <p><b>[Southampton defender Cuco Martina revealed he was shocked after scoring a stunning opener in his side’s 4-0 victory over <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> on Saturday]</b> I don’t have words - it was an unbelievable feeling. I saw the ball go in and I thought ‘oh my God’. It was a great feeling, for sure. I shoot and after the goal, everything was slow motion for me. I was so happy, so happy. I score I think three goals in my whole life and that is the nicest one. I am very happy to have scored and I am very happy that the coach gave me a chance. I need to improve to keep playing there</p>

  <p><b>[Everton sign Southampton’s Cuco Martina on free transfer]</b> <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> is a big club with big ambitions and I’m really looking forward to joining this group of players and the manager as we try to step forward next season. Obviously, I know the manager from my time at Southampton, so I know what he wants and he knows what I can do</p>
