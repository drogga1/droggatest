  <p><b>[Zurab Tsiklauri spoke about how his side remain unsure of just how much the government-owned stadium will cost to rent]</b> Until recently we had been playing on the old stadium that was built in the 60s. To be honest it doesn’t fit any norms or standards anymore. Therefore it’s such an amazing thing that we have this new modern stadium built in Samara. I think this stadium would be an extra motivation for increasing the number of spectators coming to watch the Premier League games of our club. If the team will play well and the club will show good football we would easily see 25,000 to 30,000 people in the stands. As far as I am concerned, after the end of the World Cup, we are supposed to move into the new stadium and start playing there. On July 30, we have a game with CSKA scheduled here at the new Samara Arena. So we’ll do our best to make our fans happy, even though it’s not that easy to do. Honestly, I know all the details about the sport part but not the construction or renting part. We are expecting the final answer. I hope that there won’t be any problems for the club. However, I have heard that for some time the government would be in charge of everything, but after a period, the stadium is supposed to go under club ownership. That’s what I’ve heard and that’s what we are expecting.</p>
