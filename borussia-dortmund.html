Those options were running until June 17, 2017 and were bought with the ID of the hotel L’Arrivee <b>[Dortmund’s team hotel]</b>. Someone who buys put-options speculates on the value of shares dropping. It allows the owner of these options to sell his shares until a certain date - in this case June 17 - to sell a fixed amount for a fixed price. If Dortmund’s shares had dropped in value massively, his profit would have been many times the investment. You could expect a massive drop in values of the shares if players had been injured or even killed during the attack.</p>

Everyone knows about the current situation about the coronavirus, which is why we do not need to say any more about it. It is more important to show solidarity and assume responsibility for society as a whole. Specifically, this means that we want to help people who currently belong to the at-risk groups reported. We are trying to help in the whole Dortmund area so from tomorrow, in a time window from 11:00am to 5:00pm, we offer to bring over your shopping or provide other courier services. Please only use this offer if you really belong to the corresponding at-risk groups or are currently in quarantine. Since we do not know how big the rush will be, we ask for your understanding that we cannot guarantee that every order will be completed.<br /><br />When our fanbase appears as a unit, really stands together in good and bad times and takes care of each other, this not only has a positive effect on what is going on in the Westfalenstadion and in the stands. We can also speak with a strong voice in fan-political matters, towards the club management or the public. In view of the current developments in professional football, with increasing commercialisation, ridiculous transfer fees and hysterical security debates, it is more important than ever to express our concerns, interests and criticism to the outside world</p>
