  <p><b>[Sudtribune Dortmund group is hoping to help those worst affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in their local area]</b> A statement on the group’s website read: Good day everybody. Everyone knows about the current situation about the coronavirus, which is why we do not need to say any more about it. It is more important to show solidarity and assume responsibility for society as a whole. Specifically, this means that we want to help people who currently belong to the at-risk groups reported. We are trying to help in the whole Dortmund area so from tomorrow, in a time window from 11:00am to 5:00pm, we offer to bring over your shopping or provide other courier services. Please only use this offer if you really belong to the corresponding at-risk groups or are currently in quarantine. Since we do not know how big the rush will be, we ask for your understanding that we cannot guarantee that every order will be completed.<br /><br />When our fanbase appears as a unit, really stands together in good and bad times and takes care of each other, this not only has a positive effect on what is going on in the Westfalenstadion and in the stands. We can also speak with a strong voice in fan-political matters, towards the club management or the public. In view of the current developments in professional football, with increasing commercialisation, ridiculous transfer fees and hysterical security debates, it is more important than ever to express our concerns, interests and criticism to the outside world</p>

The <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> players had apparently violated general hygiene and infection protection standards at home hairdressing appointments, and in particular the medical and organisational concept of the DFL task force ‘Sports Medicine / Special Game Operations.<br /><br />There is no question that professional footballers have to have their hair cut. However, this currently has to be done in accordance with the medical-organisational concept. In specific cases, the club had also provided its players with a corresponding opportunity.<br /><br />In principle, the DFL does not provide any information about the amount of a penalty in contractual penalty proceedings. Players have the right to lodge a complaint within five days. The penalties are expressly not directed against the club, for which no ‘organisational fault’ is recognisable.</p>

But it surely is a no-go, from both sides, to not wear a mask. We will remind our players about that very, very clearly. Also, the stylist should ask himself about his behaviour, too</p>
