  <p><b>[Kia Joorabchian, the agent of <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Carlos Tevez</a>, has hit back at <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a> following claims that the Argentine downed tools in his second season at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> Absolutely not, he was desperate to play. He scored 15 goals with seven assists, his record was superb. Every time, he was available for every game bar the three he missed through injury. I think the person’s professionalism to be questioned is <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a> because he didn’t do his homework on Carlos’ career or as a reporter to say why <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Tevez</a> wasn’t <b>[professional]</b>. He never made any phone calls, he never asked the question of me or anyone to know what has happened. He just makes comments time and time again. By saying things like that, he is putting a mark on the back of a player who has won double or triple the trophies he has ever won. Carlos has won trophies in every single league he has ever played in, he has been nominated as player of the year in South America more than any other player in history and now, at the age of 34, he’s just won the league and scored the winning goal with <a href="boca-juniors.html">Boca Juniors</a> again.<br /><br />Generally speaking, <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a> spoke about professionalism, the treatment table and he spoke about people being in his (Tevez’s) ear. What he doesn’t understand is, and this is when a reporter should have the correct information, no matter who was in his ear, no matter who was speaking to him, if Man United had wanted to exercise an option, all they had to do was sign a paper and send it to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He wanted to stay at Man United right after Moscow and winning the Champions League when he came on and he knew what he had to do. He had to get under <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s skin, he got <b>[Didier]</b> <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> sent off and they ended up on penalties, which they won, and it was a great moment. They came back and him, <b>[Wayne]</b> <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> and <b>[<a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> had a great combination going forward, they were very happy, but Man United didn’t exercise the option. It was as simple as that. <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a> is speaking about people being in his ear as if <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Tevez</a> decided at that point to leave during that year, but it was Man United who didn’t exercise that option. <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Tevez</a> only decided after the option had expired that he had been sitting there for nine months and no one has exercised the option</p>

  <p><b>[Neville previously claimed that <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Tevez</a> - who spent a two-year loan spell at United between 2007 and 2009 before moving to rivals <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> - had downed tools in his second season at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> after learning that they would not sign him permanently]</b> I’m here because Gary said something a couple of days ago which I think was absolutely wrong. I think when you go after somebody and you make a lot of wrong and incorrect statements, then by letting it go you do the public a disservice by letting them listen to fake information<br /><br />Gary mentioned about Carlos downing tools and his professionalism, he also mentioned about problems in his second year <b>[at Man United]</b> with people talking in his ear. I’d like to know who he thinks was talking into his ear and what they think he was saying, because unless he was hacking or taping him, it is impossible for him to know what they were saying<br /><br />Furthermore, I must apologise for an incorrect stat I gave on a previous appearance - I said Gary played four times that year, in fact he played once in Carlos’ first year because unfortunately he was injured. When Gary made a comparison between year one and year two, he could not have known too much about that first year because he was mostly on the treatment table<br /><br />Finally, I think <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> was one of the great managers of my time, regardless what side of the hairdryer you were. The one thing I learned about Sir Alex was that he had his finger to the pulse all the time, he knew what his players were doing on the training ground, off the training ground, at home<br /><br />By questioning that second year, Gary is asking whether Sir Alex had his finger to the pulse, because he picked Carlos 51 times in 2008-09. Sir Alex would not have picked someone 51 times if they were being unprofessional</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a>’s agent Kia Joorabchian has insisted that the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s defender’s future will be resolved this week]</b> The contract situation has dragged on not because of any reason, not because of the will of either <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> or David to finalise, but really because of the situation that occurred with this pandemic. Now it becomes a moment where you’ve got 14 days left <b>[until the deadline]</b> and you’re at a critical point of your career, where you’d probably three or four years left at the very top level, so that’s obviously at the back of your mind. That’s not an excuse for yesterday’s performance, but you are playing one of the best teams in England and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s lack of control on the game would have put pressure on the defence. David wanted to have a different type of game. What I can tell you is the situation from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s point of view will be resolved this week. Jun 22 is the deadline for most of the clubs to finish the season and beyond, irrespective of any other situation. It’s a case of allowing <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to sort out everything that needs to be sorted out during this pandemic. There are several issues within the whole structure that will get resolved<br /><br /><b>[Joorabchian added on <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Carragher</a>’s comments]</b> I spoke with David last night. These things happen in a game, and I’m not defending any situation but David is a guy who has won 20 trophies in his career, including <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, the Europa League and the Champions League. He’s won everything in Portugal and France too, so he’s a guy with a lot of experience and played under <b>[Rafa]</b> <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a>, <b>[Maurizio]</b> <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>, <b>[Antonio]</b> <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>, <b>[Jose]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, Unai <b>[Emery]</b> and now Mikel <b>[<a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>]</b>. If you speak to all those top coaches, especially coaches like <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a>, who had worked with <b>[Jamie]</b> <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Carragher</a> and David, and ask him who he’d choose first, I think he’d pick David all day long. Everybody can make a mistake, but I think it’s very important when you do make a mistake you come out and say sorry and hold your hands up. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have a lot of young players and it’s an incredible thing for those guys to see such an experienced guy with so many trophies to do something like that.</p>
