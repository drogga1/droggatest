  <p><b>[Patrice Evra on Bixente Lizarazu]</b> I don’t have a status in the French team, I’m just a player. Whether I have the armband or not, I do my role as captain. I’m like that. You can’t stop me from saying what I think, but there is one boss - <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Didier Deschamps</a>. There are some people, some commentators, they want to lie to the people of France, saying Evra is unloved, arrogant. That’s not true. When I meet people in the street they are super friendly. I do not know what <a href="bixente-lizarazu.html">Lizarazu</a> has against me. He was never voted the best fullback in the world like I was. With France, he did not shake my hand when I arrived, but he’s like that. It doesn’t affect me at all, but the problem is that it can affect my family. These bums should stop lying to France. They are parasites. We were children in Knysna <b>[at South Africa 2010]</b>, but when will they stop talking about it?</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United left-back Patrice Evra has opened up on his bitter departure from the club, targeting CEO Ed Woodward for broken promises]</b> I was having dinner in Dubai on my birthday and had a text from my agent. He told me to go somewhere quiet and sent me a message with the statement from United saying they were pleased to renew my contract for another year. I went mad, I was really disappointed. I called Ed and swore on the phone, even threatened him. He said I couldn’t talk to the director of football like that and that he was going to fine me. Some people won’t understand why Ed did it but I understand. Of the senior players I was the only one he wanted to keep - even David Moyes had said it before he got sacked. They said to Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, we don’t need you anymore, but in the dressing room you need a character. I understood Ed, but I didn’t understand why he betrayed me. He should’ve called me to explain<br /><br /><b>[Evra admits his future might have been very different had Woodward not thrown a spanner in the works]</b> Without that it’s difficult to know what would’ve happened. I would’ve had to deal with my wife - and I call her Roy Keane when she gets angry. When we reached the Champions League final with Juventus she said she’d told me so, but even winning three Champions Leagues with Juve wouldn’t have had the same satisfaction of playing for United</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United left-back Patrice Evra has claimed that he played with chicken in his boot for four months while at Monaco]</b> People talk about when we made the Champions League final in 2004, but the craziest part <b>[of my career]</b> at Monaco came after I had played a game for the French U21 team. An opponent had stamped on my foot and damaged it badly. In hospital I told the Monaco coach, Didier Deschamps, ‘It’s too painful. I can’t play. I can’t even walk!’. But the team needed me, so the doctors tried everything to take away the pain. Nothing worked. Then someone from the club staff said, ‘Why don’t you just go old school?’ <br /><br />Everyone said, ‘What do you mean?’. He said, ‘Just slide a chicken down his boot’. It sounded crazy but, you know me, I’m open minded. So I went to my local butcher. The butcher said, ‘What do you want?’. I said, ‘A piece of chicken. But just a tiny one’. He said, ‘A tiny one? How come?’. I said, ‘I’m gonna put it in my boot’. He just laughed. I went home with the chicken. I ordered new boots: one in size 42.5, the other in size 44. I passed the ball. <b>[It]</b> felt okay. Painful, but okay. So I ended up playing with chicken in my boot for four months. I didn’t train with it - my mother would never have forgiven me for wasting food - but before every game I would visit the butcher. ‘Morning, Patrice. The usual, yeah?’. The chicken enabled me to play so well that, in January 2006, I was signed by Manchester United.</p>

  <p><b>[Friend and former team-mate Patrice Evra says Paul Pogba needs to feel more love if he is to thrive at Manchester United]</b> I don’t know what Paul’s future holds. I do know that he felt really loved in Juventus. He doesn’t feel that love in Manchester. We always forget what a player is about. A player is about performing on the pitch. So kill him when he is not playing well but if he is playing well, concentrate on that. When you buy nice cars and a big house, you will create hate and jealousy so you have to step up your game and make sure it doesn’t affect you.<br /><br />That’s why I say to Paul: do whatever you want but if you see it affects your game, stop. Don’t try to be like a warrior. Stop. For me, money has never been something important in my life. Even at school when they give you the money for lunch, I gave it to my mum straight away. I love to share. Money helps you do things but it doesn’t make you happy. Money won’t cure you. Money is not everything. I was happy as well when I didn’t have money. Money can make you go crazy, too</p>

  <p><b>[Patrice Evra has revealed he received death threats in the wake of his racism row with Luis Suarez eight years ago. He accused Suarez of calling him a negro during a Premier League game between Liverpool and Manchester United at Anfield in October 2011]</b> I received a lot of letters of death. For months, I had a security car parked outside my house in Alderley Edge 24 hours a day. It wasn’t easy for my family but I grew up on tough streets in Les Ulis so for me it was like something normal. But maybe for another person, it was crazy. Even my brother was saying: ‘Be careful’ when we were out in the car<br /><br /><b>[Despite what happened Evra insists he doesn’t hate Suarez or bear any ill-feeling over what happened]</b> I don’t know if Suarez is a racist. I don’t know his family. I don’t know his background. But racism is so big for so many years and that day, there was racist abuse. So when we went to the hearing, they listened to me because I said I didn’t want them to punish him and I don’t know him close enough to say he is racist but he used that racist word. I don’t hate him. I never hated him. I wanted to punch him at the time but for me to hate someone is impossible. I don’t have hate in my heart. I can react but hate is a strong word for me. When I was asked to pick a team of my best players, I named Suarez as one of my XI. He was the best striker at that time. Why should I not recognise his talent even if he isn’t a good person? I don’t even know if he is a good person. We had one episode. At that time, I wouldn’t have gone on holiday with him but I can’t hate him</p>

  <p><b>[Patrice Evra says anti-racism campaigns in football such as Kick It Out are fake and ineffective in tackling the issue]</b> When I first came to England in 2006, Didier Deschamps said: ‘You will see this country is so open, you can be on the street, people can have yellow hair and red hair and nobody cares’. And I saw so many different people with crazy stuff, crazy dress, and no one cares because you are free. But when you are a football player, you are not allowed to have yellow hair. People are using this to create hate around that player even if he is performing well and I won’t accept that. The problem is in the English game. Black players aren’t abused when they walk on the street.<br /><br />I love England. I have lived so many years in England. You can’t call the people in England racist. Italy is the same. But when they come in the stadium, they start to be like animals, acting like animals. That’s when they start to use everything for you to have a bad game. Should I call them racists for that? I don’t know. There are different ways to hurt a player but I don’t know why you have to talk about his origin or colour. I don’t think it should be up to the players to fight it. It is the league. If the league keeps accepting it, one day something bad will happen.<br /><br />The answer is not those official campaigns like Say No to Racism. I don’t want to wear the shirt Say No to Racism. They ask me to do those campaigns but I won’t because they are fake. The players don’t even know what it’s about. Some of them don’t even want to do it. So when I did that first Instagram video when I was dressed as a panda, it was because I wanted to affect kids. If you’re funny, you might reach more kids. But don’t ask me to Say No to Racism like a robot because that won’t affect anyone. I am happy to do a campaign against racism but in my own way. Maybe I’m crazy but it is a good craziness</p>

We are living in 2019. It will start to be like a habit and that is really bad. We can talk about terrorism and when a bomb is somewhere, we just say, ‘Oh, another one’. We won’t be in shock because of the society we live in. Everything is a habit. But I worry that something really big will happen and that is why we have to stop it</p>

You celebrate because of the cameras and stuff, but it’s not the same. Ferguson taught us all to be like a robot. I don’t think I was a human being playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. When we won games, when I was doing something good, I wasn’t pleased. For me, it was something normal. I always say that <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Deschamps</a> taught me winning is important, but Ferguson taught me that winning is normal. I remember after big wins against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> he just said, ‘Well done, son’. He was never screaming, apart from when we won the Champions League final. It was just something normal, winning the league<br /><br />So every time I was putting this shirt on, and I know how many people have worn this shirt and won. Respect this tradition, the philosophy. I was like, ‘I can’t let down those people’. When you play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, it’s not for you.

I give you one example: once when we were in pre-season, and before we came on the bus, we were really tired, I’ll be honest with you, and there was a queue of fans. And the players were like: when no one signs, no one has to sign. So we went straight to the bus, everyone, and I look out the window and I see <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> signing each autograph. I swear he must have signed for like 45 minutes. He was signing <b>[for]</b> everyone. I say ,’Guys, when the boss comes on the bus, we are done.’ And he came on the bus, he gave us the hairdryer. ‘What the hell do you think you are?! Those people are paying your salary.

I was in Paris but living in the streets and sometimes I wasn’t even able to have some food. I remember my brother Dominique was working at a McDonalds and so I was going there and on his lunch break he was giving me his own food. I’m not scared to say that I’ve begged for money in front of shops. I’ve been in front of shops and when I’ve seen some people I’ve said, ‘Can I have a Euro?’ and sometimes they were giving me the money and sometimes not, just because I wanted to buy a sandwich. It was a tough time, but a happy time. I was always happy and always felt lucky, I wouldn’t change anything, I would keep it that way because it built the man I am. Some people, when you succeed they just see the end <b>[result]</b>, they just see on the TV the superstar, but actually, on the streets, I learned so much and it helped me to be strong. Especially after the World Cup when I was the captain and a lot of people were blaming me but I was still strong because I know on the streets I had tougher times than then, with the press talking about you<br /><br />I’m not a victim, I’m not feeling sad.
