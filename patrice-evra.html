  <p><b>[Patrice Evra on <a href="bixente-lizarazu.html">Bixente Lizarazu</a>]</b> I don’t have a status in the French team, I’m just a player. Whether I have the armband or not, I do my role as captain. I’m like that. You can’t stop me from saying what I think, but there is one boss - <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Didier Deschamps</a>. There are some people, some commentators, they want to lie to the people of France, saying Evra is unloved, arrogant. That’s not true. When I meet people in the street they are super friendly. I do not know what <a href="bixente-lizarazu.html">Lizarazu</a> has against me. He was never voted the best fullback in the world like I was. With France, he did not shake my hand when I arrived, but he’s like that. It doesn’t affect me at all, but the problem is that it can affect my family. These bums should stop lying to France. They are parasites. We were children in Knysna <b>[at South Africa 2010]</b>, but when will they stop talking about it?</p>

  <p><b>[Patrice Evra believes that if France are to win Euro 2016, they will need Karim Benzema to be at his peak]</b> For me, Karim’s a great striker. I’m not the coach, but I think in Didier Deschamps’ eyes he’s the No.1. He must assume his status. He was whistled in Nice against Armenia but scored two goals in the end. He has to ignore the critics - he can’t make everyone happy. I’ve told him to keep working. He knows that we will do all we can to make him shine.<br /><br />I don’t think one is essential. We could even discover someone at the competition. But I think players like Benzema have a big responsibility. With him we can win the competition<br /><br />It’s the first time I’ve seen him in a match. He was impressive. I told him at the end of the game: ‘I hope that you hydrate well and stretch well. Keep accelerating like that’. Every time he touched the ball, he drove and he created something<br /><br /><b>[On Franck Ribery]</b> Of course I’d recall him. We exchange text messages. He’s a player I miss on a daily basis. If Franck wants to come back, personally I’d welcome him back with open arms. But I’m not the coach. I want to see everyone trying their hardest, and to play with a spirit that will help us win<br /><br /><b>[Evra is not concerned about his status as press scapegoat]</b> It doesn’t bother me. I prefer to take the bullets for everyone. Critics won’t me stop my career. That’s what I said after the World Cup: ‘All of you go on holiday, I’ll be the only one who takes the guillotine’. No worries. I’m healthy and my family is doing well. There are no problem.</p>

It’s in his nature. I remember a match where we were both on the bench and he did not have any nails left in the end. He told me that he simply had to score when he came on. It’s the only thing he thinks about. I remember <a href="ruud-van-nistelrooy.html">van Nistelrooy</a> was just like that. They are among those players who were simply put on this world to score goals. Those who cannot sleep if they do not score. And that’s perfect for Juventus</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham have completed the signing of former Manchester United full-back Patrice Evra]</b> I’m really happy to be a Hammer, to be back in the Premier League and I love this game! It’s amazing to be back and I am thankful to West Ham for giving me the opportunity to do my job. When I wake up I know I am going to work hard, to have fun with my team-mates and give my best on the pitch. I’m just happy to be here, it’s really simple. You don’t realise how lucky you are and just to wake up this morning and know I am going to train with my new team-mates made me smile!<br /><br />It happened really fast. My agent called me and told me I needed to come back <b>[from Dubai]</b> to London as quick as I could and I had a nice meeting with the manager, who I know from Manchester United, of course, and I met the chairman, so it was really easy.<br /><br />When you have to make a deal and money is not the issue, the deal could be done in five minutes. The main thing was for me to join West Ham and to help my team-mates to win as many games as we can. It was the fastest thing I have done in my life, because both parties wanted to work together, so it was very easy to make an agreement</p>

When I was working on my own, not one time was I ever thinking about retirement. Every day I was going to training with a lot of anger. In life, nobody gave me anything for free so that’s why I know I have to work hard. I will bring my winning mentality in every game. Even in training and in the gym, you have to have that mentality.

  <p><b>[Sergej Milinkovic-Savic must show that he is willing to die for Manchester United if he is to move to Old Trafford]</b> I’m really careful when I talk about Manchester United, because to play for this club, it’s not about your ability. You need to be a character, a personality. To play for this club, you need to die for this club. The expectations are really huge and I’m afraid now. If you said to me ‘Patrice, you will play for Man Utd, but you won’t even get paid’, I would play for this club. So, if he has that mentality - I don’t ask him to say he doesn’t want any money - but if he goes there and makes sure he will die for the club, I will be really happy.</p>

  <p><b>[Patrice Evra has revealed the lengths to which Cristiano Ronaldo will go to ensure he wins]</b> With Rio Ferdinand, they were playing table tennis and Rio beat him, and we were all screaming and Ronaldo was so upset. Then he sent his cousin to buy a tennis table, he trained for two weeks at home and he came back and he beat Rio in front of everyone. So that’s Cristiano Ronaldo, so that’s why I’m not surprised today why he wants to win another golden ball, why he wants to win the World Cup. Because he’s an angry man<br /><br />I would give advice to anybody, when Cristiano invites you for lunch at his house, just say no. So he said, ‘Patrice, come over after training.’ I went, you know I was really tired, <b>[and]</b> at the table there was only salad and plain white chicken so I was like, okay, and water, not any juice and we started eating and I was thinking some big meat would be coming after that but there was nothing. He just finished and he stood up and he started playing with a ball, doing some skills and he said, ‘Let’s do some two-touch’. I was like, can I just finish eating? ‘No, no let’s play two-touch,’ we start playing two-touch. After that he said let’s go to the pool to swim, I was like okay … And after going in the jacuzzi, the sauna, I’m done. I say, ‘Cristiano why have we come here, have we come here because we have a game tomorrow, or just for lunch?’ So that’s why I would recommend to anyone when Cristiano invites you to his house, don’t go - just say no because this guy, he’s a machine, he doesn’t want to stop training</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United have been warned by Patrice Evra that their fall from grace could emulate similar slumps experienced by AC Milan and Liverpool]</b> I will be honest with you, I love all of them. I see them a lot - when I go to the games, I visit them in the dressing room and encourage them - they know how much I love them. But name me one or two players who can play for Real Madrid, Juventus or Bayern Munich? It’s a few. I would say Paul Pogba and David de Gea. I have a lot of respect for the rest of them.<br /><br />I think one of the most important things the club has to resolve is hiring a director of football. It’s going to be hard to find the right man. I’ve got the fear, even though I am positive, I don’t want United to become like Liverpool, AC Milan or Arsenal were - they have to wait many years to get back at the top.

I don’t want to blame the players because I think that some players are here and they themselves don’t even know why they are here. They don’t have leadership in the dressing room to show them what it means to play for Manchester United. In our time, I remember I played nine years for United and for seven years I don’t think I lost two games in a row.<br /><br />When I met Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill in Monaco at the time, when they interviewed me, they asked me questions like ‘are you going to be ready to not lose any games?’ and ‘are you ready to play only at the top of the game and get criticised for a normal game?’ You had figures at the club who tell you what you are going to represent. The problem now is on the pitch but also off the pitch</p>

He told me to go somewhere quiet and sent me a message with the statement from United saying they were pleased to renew my contract for another year. I went mad, I was really disappointed. I called Ed and swore on the phone, even threatened him. He said I couldn’t talk to the director of football like that and that he was going to fine me. Some people won’t understand why Ed did it but I understand.

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> left-back Patrice Evra has claimed that he played with chicken in his boot for four months while at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a>]</b> People talk about when we made the Champions League final in 2004, but the craziest part <b>[of my career]</b> at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> came after I had played a game for the French U21 team. An opponent had stamped on my foot and damaged it badly. In hospital I told the <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> coach, <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Didier Deschamps</a>, ‘It’s too painful. I can’t play. I can’t even walk!’. But the team needed me, so the doctors tried everything to take away the pain. Nothing worked. Then someone from the club staff said, ‘Why don’t you just go old school?’<br /><br />Everyone said, ‘What do you mean?’. He said, ‘Just slide a chicken down his boot’. It sounded crazy but, you know me, I’m open minded. So I went to my local butcher. The butcher said, ‘What do you want?’. I said, ‘A piece of chicken. But just a tiny one’. He said, ‘A tiny one? How come?’. I said, ‘I’m gonna put it in my boot’. He just laughed. I went home with the chicken. I ordered new boots: one in size 42.5, the other in size 44. I passed the ball. <b>[It]</b> felt okay. Painful, but okay. So I ended up playing with chicken in my boot for four months. I didn’t train with it - my mother would never have forgiven me for wasting food - but before every game I would visit the butcher. ‘Morning, Patrice. The usual, yeah?’. The chicken enabled me to play so well that, in January 2006, I was signed by <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.</p>

I don’t know his family. I don’t know his background. But racism is so big for so many years and that day, there was racist abuse. So when we went to the hearing, they listened to me because I said I didn’t want them to punish him and I don’t know him close enough to say he is racist but he used that racist word. I don’t hate him. I never hated him. I wanted to punch him at the time but for me to hate someone is impossible. I don’t have hate in my heart. I can react but hate is a strong word for me. When I was asked to pick a team of my best players, I named Suarez as one of my XI. He was the best striker at that time. Why should I not recognise his talent even if he isn’t a good person? I don’t even know if he is a good person. We had one episode. At that time, I wouldn’t have gone on holiday with him but I can’t hate him</p>

  <p><b>[Patrice Evra says anti-racism campaigns in football such as Kick It Out are fake and ineffective in tackling the issue]</b> When I first came to England in 2006, <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Didier Deschamps</a> said: ‘You will see this country is so open, you can be on the street, people can have yellow hair and red hair and nobody cares’. And I saw so many different people with crazy stuff, crazy dress, and no one cares because you are free. But when you are a football player, you are not allowed to have yellow hair. People are using this to create hate around that player even if he is performing well and I won’t accept that. The problem is in the English game. Black players aren’t abused when they walk on the street.<br /><br />I love England. I have lived so many years in England. You can’t call the people in England racist. Italy is the same. But when they come in the stadium, they start to be like animals, acting like animals. That’s when they start to use everything for you to have a bad game. Should I call them racists for that? I don’t know. There are different ways to hurt a player but I don’t know why you have to talk about his origin or colour. I don’t think it should be up to the players to fight it. It is the league. If the league keeps accepting it, one day something bad will happen.<br /><br />The answer is not those official campaigns like Say No to Racism. I don’t want to wear the shirt Say No to Racism. They ask me to do those campaigns but I won’t because they are fake. The players don’t even know what it’s about. Some of them don’t even want to do it. So when I did that first Instagram video when I was dressed as a panda, it was because I wanted to affect kids. If you’re funny, you might reach more kids. But don’t ask me to Say No to Racism like a robot because that won’t affect anyone. I am happy to do a campaign against racism but in my own way. Maybe I’m crazy but it is a good craziness</p>

The work they are doing is vital, incredibly tough and often heartbreaking. They are working on the frontline while the rest of the country stays at home and we’ve got to give our support however we can. I am proud to partner with a company like Lineage Logistics that is stepping up to help launch this important project</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> defender Patrice Evra admitted he stopped celebrating league titles properly after <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> taught him to be a robot]</b> I’ll be honest, when you start winning the third one, the fourth and the fifth, you celebrate but not the same way. You celebrate because of the cameras and stuff, but it’s not the same. Ferguson taught us all to be like a robot. I don’t think I was a human being playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. When we won games, when I was doing something good, I wasn’t pleased. For me, it was something normal. I always say that <a href="didier-deschamps.html">Deschamps</a> taught me winning is important, but Ferguson taught me that winning is normal. I remember after big wins against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> he just said, ‘Well done, son’. He was never screaming, apart from when we won the Champions League final. It was just something normal, winning the league<br /><br />So every time I was putting this shirt on, and I know how many people have worn this shirt and won. Respect this tradition, the philosophy. I was like, ‘I can’t let down those people’. When you play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, it’s not for you. You don’t use <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, and because you’re a United player so you’re famous, you’re on social media. You play for United because you have to give to those people. I give you one example: once when we were in pre-season, and before we came on the bus, we were really tired, I’ll be honest with you, and there was a queue of fans. And the players were like: when no one signs, no one has to sign. So we went straight to the bus, everyone, and I look out the window and I see <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> signing each autograph. I swear he must have signed for like 45 minutes. He was signing <b>[for]</b> everyone. I say ,’Guys, when the boss comes on the bus, we are done.’ And he came on the bus, he gave us the hairdryer. ‘What the hell do you think you are?! Those people are paying your salary. Those people are coming to watch you. Now get the f*ck down there and sign.’ And we had to sign each fan. But that’s the mentality</p>

  <p><b>[Evra: I’m not scared to say that I’ve begged for money]</b> I’ll be honest with you, it was a tough childhood because I’ve got many brothers and sisters, so it wasn’t easy living in the street. I was in Paris but living in the streets and sometimes I wasn’t even able to have some food. I remember my brother Dominique was working at a McDonalds and so I was going there and on his lunch break he was giving me his own food. I’m not scared to say that I’ve begged for money in front of shops. I’ve been in front of shops and when I’ve seen some people I’ve said, ‘Can I have a Euro?’ and sometimes they were giving me the money and sometimes not, just because I wanted to buy a sandwich. It was a tough time, but a happy time. I was always happy and always felt lucky, I wouldn’t change anything, I would keep it that way because it built the man I am. Some people, when you succeed they just see the end <b>[result]</b>, they just see on the TV the superstar, but actually, on the streets, I learned so much and it helped me to be strong. Especially after the World Cup when I was the captain and a lot of people were blaming me but I was still strong because I know on the streets I had tougher times than then, with the press talking about you<br /><br />I’m not a victim, I’m not feeling sad. I don’t want any people to give me much love, because I’m telling those things. I’m just telling my true story. I just want to motivate more kids to never give up no matter what will happen. If you believe you’re going to become someone, if you walk out, if you believe in yourself, you’re going to do it. That’s it</p>

  <p><b>[Evra reveals <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> apology nine years after Suarez racism]</b> In the end, he admitted it and he was banned for eight games, and he had a massive fine. I remember after that, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> played a game and they all wore the T-shirts saying ‘support Suarez’. He had been banned for racist abuse, had been fined and they support him that way. I was confused and upset. But, when I did the punditry on Sky and <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Jamie Carragher</a> apologised after eight years, I was so surprised. He said they made a big mistake that day and he apologised. It really touched me and now I will respect <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as a football club because, when this happened, I was really disappointed with the club. I received an email from the chairman of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> apologising for what happened nine years ago. He said I was welcome to come to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> if I need anything. It really touched me because it’s better late than never, but I was surprised that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> supported that kind of attitude.<br /><br />When you have those kind of problems, people around you just think you are crying. Even when I said: ‘You will see the report’, people thought I was still talking about it. I wasn’t still talking about it - I even named Suarez as Player of the Year that year. I could evaluate Suarez on the pitch and know the person he was. It was a tough, tough, tough time. I will never call Suarez a racist person, because I don’t know him personally. Even when we played in the Champions League final, when I was playing for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, I shook his hand in the corridor and spoke to him. I forgive really fast</p>

And when the boss came into the dressing room to talk to everyone, it’s never good news. He came, and he said, ‘I’m really sorry.
