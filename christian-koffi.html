<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Fiorentina starlet Christian Koffi reveals why he turned down move to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in 2018]</b> Everything was decided a little bit at the last moment. I was very flattered by the interest of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but I chose <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> for my progress. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is more than a big club and I was not ready at this time, especially in 2018. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s team was very good. It was not the good timing, it’s the truth<br /><br />It’s a chance to grow with a great player like him, to learn a lot with him. He’s like a legend for me, we spoke a lot about him in France. He has done so much for this sport, that’s why we can only admire his work. He’s a role model. But since childhood! And now to see him for real, it’s very special. He’s simple, very cool. He’s a very good person for the young players.<br /><br />I can’t play again with the Primavera next season, so yes that’s the idea <b>[to be regularly with the first team]</b>. I had two fantastic years with the Primavera, and for the future the most important thing is the sporting project. I want to train regularly with the first team and I know that next season will be important for me. I am 100 per cent ready!</p>
