  <p><b>[<a href="willian.html">Willian</a> Jose apologises to <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a> after failing to force through ‘dream’ <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> move]</b> I apologise to the fans for everything that has happened in the last few days. A lot of things happened, and I have to apologise to the fans, my team-mates, the coach as well, who are supporting me. I saw that it was a great opportunity for me to leave and play in the Champions League for a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> team. I have a dream of playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It didn’t happen, but I’m very happy.<br /><br />I’m always grateful to Real for everything they’ve given me, for how they have backed me, and now I just have to work as I was working in the last few weeks to win back my place. I said I wouldn’t be called up for Espanyol. I don’t know if it was the best decision, but it was how I thought at that moment. I had a lot of information in my head and I ended up telling the president that it wasn’t in my head to go to the game.<br /><br />I apologise to everyone for what happened and now, I’ll keep working every day to regain people’s trust. It’s not only the fans who’ve been hurt, but me, too. The last two weeks have been really painful for me, my wife and my family. I just want to keep working and keep helping my team-mates, scoring goals and bringing joy to the fans, and for those inside Anoeta to chant my name again - that would be a huge joy</p>
