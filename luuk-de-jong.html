  <p><b>[The Republic of Ireland can cause problems for Italy, Belgium and Sweden at Euro 2016]</b> I think they can <b>[cause problems]</b>, definitely they can. They have a team with a lot of power, with a good mentality always being compact as a team and don’t give away a lot. With the free-kicks and corners they are really dangerous so that’s also a weapon in football so I think they can cause problems against the other teams in the Euros.<br /><br />Of course Shane Long is a great player up front. He’s going to be really important for the team. What I saw today I think they played really well as a whole team. They want to work for each other and close the gaps in the midfield and the defence. That’s really important. It’s hard to get through. You can see we had a lot of problems to get through so I think it’s going to be tough.</p>

  <p><b>[Prolific Netherlands forward Luuk de Jong has signed for <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> in a deal to take the <a href="psv.html">PSV Eindhoven</a> star to <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> on a four-year deal]</b> I’m very happy to have this incredible opportunity. It’s a great step for me. I hope I can be important for the club and enjoy it here. I’ve seen many matches in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and I know of <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>’s European achievements which are incredible. For me, after five years at <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>, this is a big step. But this is a great club in an incredible competition, in an incredible league. Looking back over my career, I think I am in the best form <b>[I have ever been]</b> right now. I’m dangerous in the opposition area, I’m good in the air and I hope to be able to show that here. At <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>, I had a great season, I scored a lot of goals, and I played in the Champions League. I’m still growing but I feel strong. At 28, I think I’m in the best moment of my life.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> forward Luuk de Jong believes his club have the ability to cause an upset when they take on <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> on Sunday]</b> It’s been a long time without a win at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> but I think it’s always possible in football. We have to be prepared as a team and be focused and ready for everything that will come. If we have confidence and play well I think we can beat a lot of teams - even Barcelona<br /><br /><a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is always a great game to play and it’s always tough. I played at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> last season in the Champions League and we played a really good game, but they have so much individual quality to win games and they’re always dangerous. We have to be fully prepared for this game, stay focused and play with confidence and personality. It’s always impressive to play at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> and other big stadiums like that but it doesn’t matter where we play, we always have to be ready. As a young kid, though, playing at places like <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> is one of the reasons you start playing football<br /><br /><b>[De Jong bagged 28 goals in 34 league games for <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> last season, but has yet to find the net for his new club]</b> Of course I want to score as soon as possible for <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>. But last year with <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> we won the first 13 games and I didn’t score in the first four games, so … I think everybody knows my qualities and what I do for the team, my work and my playing as a target man. At this point I haven’t had luck with the final ball but it will come. I’ll start scoring goals and getting assists - it’s just more motivation to work harder in every game. I’ve never put a number on the amount of goals I want to score in a season, I just want to be as important as possible for the team with my goals and assists. I work hard in every game to press the opponent, win back balls and help the team dominate. Hopefully I can stay fit all season and be a key player</p>
