  <p><b>[Adib Zainudin praised win over Myanmar ahead of vital qualifers in Bangkok]</b> Yes, with the win tonight it gives us the confidence injection to do well in the AFC. We were lucky because we couldn’t our usual game because of the wet pitch so we couldn’t applied what the coach wanted. So coach Ong asked us to keep it simple and that’s what we did.<br /><br />This formation focuses a solid defence that’s why we used 3 at the back. Since we’ve already played the competitive games in China as well as against Myanmar, we are more comfortable with it now</p>

  <p><b>[Adib Zainudin and his team mates were treated to a hero’s return upon reaching Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday evening]</b> Yes, that’s <b>[luck]</b> the reality of it. Playing on a wet pitch made it hard for Thailand to play well and maybe that’s our luck. But we are still proud of what we have achieved but this doesn’t mean we should be contended just by qualifying<br /><br />We have another assignment which is the SEA Games and we need to be better in order to help the country win the gold medal. We know Thailand are ASEAN giants but what we need to focus on is our game and our motivation because they are a team of good quality</p>
