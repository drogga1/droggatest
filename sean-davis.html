  <p><b>[Red Bulls dominate Atlanta United to show MLS they are the team to beat]</b> Training this week was so intense, really demanding. We were doing intra-squad scrimmages and we were hating each other after. It was just so intense and I think that’s exactly what we needed for a game like this. I just think the team came out and we imposed ourselves from the first whistle.</p>

  <p><b>[On Concacaf Champions League]</b> The biggest takeaway from last year is that we have the confidence to compete with anybody. We have some really important experiences under our belt. You can talk about the Tijuana series, and the Chivas series, where we more than held our own. We are confident about who we are as a team, and that we can compete with the top Mexican teams.</p>

  <p><b>[Almeyda’s growing pains with the Earthquakes continue]</b> Even this San Jose team versus versions in the past, they’re a tougher team to play against now. I think they have some really good pieces in place, and now I think he just needs time with his style of play. It’s very unique and probably something the players haven’t seen before at San Jose. It’s going to take time for them to adjust, but I think they have everything they need. They just need a little bit of time and we know Almeyda has a great track record so there’s no doubt that team is going to continue to improve because we saw glimpses of how good they can be today.</p>

  <p><b>[LAFC vs New York Red Bulls. While Chris Armas’s side has been inconsistent, it has typically saved its best performances for the greatest stages]</b> I think we’ve done well against better teams this year. But we have to continue to improve against all teams. It doesn’t matter who we play, we have to show up with the right mentality. It doesn’t matter if we’re playing teams that are just trying to kick it long, we have to show up with the right mentality and how to combat that and play well</p>
