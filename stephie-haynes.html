<blockquote>
  <p>An exclusive interview with WSOF matchmaker and decision maker, <a href="ali-abdelaziz.html">Ali Abdel-Aziz</a>, who discusses matchmaking, goals, keys to a successful future, and dealing with the ‘UFC Reject’ stigma<br /><br />When a brand new promotion is coming out of the gate, it is never 100% error free. There will be a few wrinkles that need to be ironed out. World Series of Fighting, the Las Vegas based promotion that had such a successful freshman effort that they managed to land a TV deal, is aiming to fine tune their promotion into a well oiled machine by the time their third event comes to pass<br /><br />The young promotion has landed some top notch names, the likes of which any promotion would scramble to obtain. With a slew of talented former UFC stars, as well as some kickboxing stars and new names we’re just getting to know, the future can be a bright one when they get all their ducks properly in a row<br /><br />Heading up the promotion are two key figures, Ray Sefo and <a href="ali-abdelaziz.html">Ali Abdel-Aziz</a>. Most fight fans know who Sefo is, from his well known battles in the K-1 kickboxing promotion. Abdel-Aziz is the man behind the scenes, match making and signing the talent. Some may know him from his management company, Dominance MMA Management, known for handling the careers of several members of the Gracie family and UFC featherweight star, Frank Edgar<br /><br />Ali has stepped away from the management aspect of his own career, so that he may focus his undivided attention on making WSOF a major player in the sport. He cites ethical concerns as well, conflict of interest being the foremost reason, for having his partners in Dominance MMA Management handle the company’s fighter interests</p>
