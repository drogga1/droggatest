  <p>[Safawi Rasid ready to work with U22 and find out how he ended up being a goalkeeper] This is my first day. Before this I’ve been with him before. It’s not a big change for me. I just follow what his instructions and training are.<br /><br />There’s a lot of stars there. I’m still young and it’s a big competition to play. Even though I don’t play as much but I do get the minutes here and there. The training there has helped me to improve myself, especially in terms of my passing and tactical understanding<br /><br />We were already behind then and it was five minutes of extra time and there was no choice. I offered and my team mates also asked me to go in goal. Yes, in training I’ve played around with the position sometimes</p>

  <p>[Safawi Rasid finding joy in new-found role for the U-22] I think the trip to China has many positives. With one win, one draw and one loss - it’s a good result for us because the players there are of good quality and we’ve shown that we can put up a fight to them.<br /><br />That is normal to play away. We’ve all played in those games before and there’s no issue. Playing at home for the SEA Games will also be helpful than a hindrance to us<br /><br />This formation suits us. We haven’t used it before but in China, it all felt comfortable. We created a lot of chances in attack and we defended compactly</p>

  <p>[Safawi Rasid will only get to prove his worth to Ulisses Morais, two months later than everyone else at JDT] It feels like opening a new book. I will have to fight all over again and hopefully my chances will come. TMJ [HRH Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim] is good at picking the right coach and I’m confident that this confident that this new coach can help us in our pursuit of the two remaining trophies for us, having let slip in two other competitions</p>
