  <p>[Safawi Rasid ready to work with U22 and find out how he ended up being a goalkeeper] This is my first day. Before this I’ve been with him before. It’s not a big change for me. I just follow what his instructions and training are.<br /><br />There’s a lot of stars there. I’m still young and it’s a big competition to play. Even though I don’t play as much but I do get the minutes here and there. The training there has helped me to improve myself, especially in terms of my passing and tactical understanding<br /><br />We were already behind then and it was five minutes of extra time and there was no choice. I offered and my team mates also asked me to go in goal. Yes, in training I’ve played around with the position sometimes</p>

  <p>[Safawi Rasid finding joy in new-found role for the U-22] I think the trip to China has many positives. With one win, one draw and one loss - it’s a good result for us because the players there are of good quality and we’ve shown that we can put up a fight to them.<br /><br />That is normal to play away. We’ve all played in those games before and there’s no issue. Playing at home for the SEA Games will also be helpful than a hindrance to us<br /><br />This formation suits us. We haven’t used it before but in China, it all felt comfortable. We created a lot of chances in attack and we defended compactly</p>

  <p>[Safawi Rasid will only get to prove his worth to Ulisses Morais, two months later than everyone else at JDT] It feels like opening a new book. I will have to fight all over again and hopefully my chances will come. TMJ [HRH Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim] is good at picking the right coach and I’m confident that this confident that this new coach can help us in our pursuit of the two remaining trophies for us, having let slip in two other competitions</p>

  <p>[Safawi Rasid was one of those players who won their first ever league title as Johor Darul Ta’zim retained their Super League title for the fourth straight season] I joined JDT because I want to improve as a player. Before I went there, I knew JDT is a great team. You can consider it the right decision because we have managed to retain the Super League and now there’s one more cup to challenge for.<br /><br />I feel that I played a lot as well this year. AFC Cup, Malaysia Cup and also Super League. So in a way, I’m glad and happy that I’ve been given plenty of game time. I’ve improve a lot especially in my passing. I get to learn from players more experienced to me and it has helped me a lot</p>

  <p>[Safawi Rasid not content yet despite amazing goal against Brunei] First of all, I’m thankful for the win and with the goal, I was able to help the team to get three points. Tonight in the first half, we were at our best but in the second half, we gave all we got to get the three points. It’s not that we aim to win by a big margin but we managed to create a lot of chances tonight [Monday] despite missing most of them. I think I can still perform better especially in keeping hold of the ball and my passing.</p>
