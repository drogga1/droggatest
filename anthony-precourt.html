  <p><b>[New <a href="austin-fc.html">Austin FC</a> sporting director <a href="claudio-reyna.html">Claudio Reyna</a> jumps at another chance to build a roster from scratch]</b> Hiring someone with Claudio’s gravitas and experience as a player and executive with NYCFC, it’s a big day for our club, and it’s a big hire for us. Claudio obviously had a tremendous career as a player. He understands the Concacaf region with his national team duty, and then obviously he transitioned into a leadership role, and you know, there’s no better place to learn than City Football Group<br /><br />In terms of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> IQ. he just understands our league and the acquisition mechanisms really, really well. He also has a global perspective, playing in Germany and England and Scotland, and he just has a lot of relationships. His network of contacts across Europe in the United States are second-to-none. He’s got a real keen eye for talent</p>
