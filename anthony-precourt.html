  <p><b>[Columbus Crew owner Anthony Precourt has confirmed reports he is considering moving the MLS franchise to Austin, Texas]</b> Despite our investments and efforts, the current course is not sustainable. his club has ambition to be a standard bearer in MLS, therefore we have no choice but to expand and explore all of our options. This includes a possible move to Austin, which is the largest metropolitan area in North America without a major league sports franchise. Soccer is the world’s game, and with Austin’s growing presence as an international city, combined with its strong multicultural foundation, MLS in Austin could be an ideal fit</p>

  <p><b>[MLS confirms Austin FC as 27th team]</b> This is a very proud moment, and we are so happy to share it with the people of Austin, City leadership, the dedicated soccer fans of the region, and everyone who believed in our mission to bring Major League Soccer to this incredible community.<br /><br />The greatest way we can show our gratitude is in our actions as leaders of Austin FC. Our intent is to build a team that will be a perennial contender for MLS Cup, to build a stadium at McKalla Place that rivals the best sporting venues in North America, and to cultivate a club culture that brings people together and always give back</p>

  <p><b>[New <a href="austin-fc.html">Austin FC</a> sporting director <a href="claudio-reyna.html">Claudio Reyna</a> jumps at another chance to build a roster from scratch]</b> Hiring someone with Claudio’s gravitas and experience as a player and executive with NYCFC, it’s a big day for our club, and it’s a big hire for us. Claudio obviously had a tremendous career as a player. He understands the Concacaf region with his national team duty, and then obviously he transitioned into a leadership role, and you know, there’s no better place to learn than City Football Group<br /><br />In terms of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> IQ. he just understands our league and the acquisition mechanisms really, really well. He also has a global perspective, playing in Germany and England and Scotland, and he just has a lot of relationships. His network of contacts across Europe in the United States are second-to-none. He’s got a real keen eye for talent</p>
