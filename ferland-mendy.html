Real Madrid are in talks with Lyon over the potential signing of left-back Ferland Mendy as Zinedine Zidane begins a summer overhaul of his squad</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Lyon’s Ferland Mendy has become Real Madrid’s latest summer signing, joining the Blancos in a deal worth an initial €48 million]</b> Real Madrid and Olympique Lyonnaise have agreed the transfer of the player Ferland Mendy. The player will be linked to the club for the next six seasons, until June 30, 2025. Mendy will be presented on Wednesday June 19, at 1pm, in the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Ferland Mendy? The €48m-rated ‘Mbappe of left-backs’ signed by Real Madrid]</b> It’s true that everything’s happened very quickly since Le Havre, but I tell myself that it must go quicker! I’ve not had an easy journey, it’s true, but I’ve never given up. Now I’m here. This burning desire to succeed, it’s in my character. I’ve always been like that.</p>

  <p><b>[Becoming a Real Madrid player is starting to sink in for Ferland Mendy, who opened up on his 10-year journey from being told he would never play football again to joining ‘the greatest club in the world’]</b> When I was 15 I had a hip operation and they told me I would never play football again. I was in a wheelchair for a while and spent six or seven months in hospital for rehab. Now I’m at Real Madrid. It’s incredible.<br /><br /><b>[He also revealed compatriot Raphael Varane had offered to support him through his transition away from Ligue 1]</b> I’ve spoken to Varane and he told me it was the greatest club in the world. He said he would help me to integrate well in the dressing room. That’s going to be easier for me as I play with him for France. I’m very happy to be a part of Real Madrid. I know the quality of Marcelo. He’s had a great career and I’m going to learn a lot from him<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether France team-mates Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbappe could be the next stars to arrive in Madrid]</b> Why not? They’re high quality players but we haven’t spoken about Real Madrid. The only person I spoke about Real Madrid with is Varane</p>

Real Madrid defender Ferland Mendy is expected to be out of action for three to four weeks with a thigh problem</p>

  <p><b>[Ferland Mendy has explained that <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine</a> Zidane’s presence at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> was one of the decisive factors in him picking to move to Santiago Bernabeu last summer]</b> It’s <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, quite simply. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, too, that was a plus. There was no need to convince me. We talked about it, but there was no need to do so at length<br /><br />I wouldn’t say that I’ve imposed myself, there’s still a lot of pressure. It’s really different with regards to <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. The level of expectation is very high<br /><br />It’s a match that’s very different. There’s a lot of impact, a lot of desire from both teams. In any case, the Clasico is a game that should be won. Yes, the title is at stake, but after there are still a lot of matches, too</p>
