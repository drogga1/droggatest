  <p><b>[Rumoured Bayern Munich target Kai Havertz has ruled out a move away from Bayer Leverkusen for at least another year]</b> For me, it has long been clear that I will spend the next season in Leverkusen, without any ifs and buts. I feel very well in Leverkusen and I see a period here in which I can develop very well. At some point I will take the next step. If it comes to that, then no one will be angry with me here. You just want to achieve the most possible in your career<br /><br /><b>[Leverkusen managing director Rudi Voller previously told any interested suitors to forget about bidding for the Germany international, who is under contract at BayArena until 2022]</b> It’s logical for clubs to come close, but there was nothing to be agreed and not too much to talk about. For the coming season, I can definitely say that Leverkusen is the right place for me</p>

  <p><b>[Reported Liverpool and Bayern Munich target Kai Havertz has admitted he is uncertain if playing for the Bundesliga champions is the next and right step for him]</b> I really don’t know yet whether Bayern is the next and right step for me. I also don’t know whether foreign countries would not be more suitable for me. I really don’t think too much about it at the moment. I have that self-confidence, yes <b>[I could play for Bayern]</b>. But the same applies to other clubs as well<br /><br /><b>[Havertz conceded that a transfer is in his future at some point, even if his focus remains on his current club]</b> I am honest, at some point the next step must come for me. But I’m not going to worry about when exactly that will happen. What counts now is Bayer Leverkusen. We still have a lot to do. Leverkusen very quickly signaled that they wanted to keep me. That’s why it wasn’t an issue for me. Now I’m starting my 10th year here, maybe we can make it a golden one for the club. What will happen afterwards has not yet been decided. There is no club where I have already signed</p>

  <p><b>[Kai Havertz says Mesut Ozil and Toni Kroos are perhaps the best footballers Germany has ever seen]</b> In my opinion, Mesut Ozil or Toni Kroos have been and are wrongly critcised for unnecessarily delaying the game or slowing the tempo down. Who claims this has very little idea of the game. In my opinion they are perhaps the best footballers Germany has ever had<br /><br /><b>[When asked where he saw himself in two or three years’s time]</b> I hope to be at an absolute top club. There are five, six clubs that are among the best in the world and my goal is to reach such a level. Of course, I hope that I will win one or the other title in the next few years, experience a lot and make the most of my career. That’s what matters to me. The people in 30, 40 years only remember you when you have really achieved something. That is my goal. Next year I am 21 and that I want to take the next step at some point is very clear. No one in Leverkusen will be mad at me either. For every player comes a point at which he wants to evolve. We will see. There is a lot of talk and writing in general, but I do not put much pressure on myself</p>

Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus has been named Footballer of the Year in Germany for the second time in his career. The Association of German Sports Journalists, in conjunction with football magazine Kicker, gave Reus 150 of the 540 votes cast to place him ahead of Bayer Leverkusen prodigy Kai Havertz and Bayern Munich full-back Joshua Kimmich.</p>

  <p><b>[When asked about <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>’s apparent interest]</b> They’re probably the biggest club in Germany and there are many players that were very successful at a young age that went there. Therefore, I get linked with Bayern, but we’ll see what happens. There are players that want to stay close to their family and others say, ‘I want to live in another country’. There’s something clear: if you want to be a star in Germany, you can’t go wrong with Bayern. I think I’ve picked up enough international experience at Leverkusen. I know the rhythm of these international matches and I’m confident that I can go abroad at any moment and play at clubs outside of Germany. For the moment, I want to have a good season. Afterwards, we’ll see.<br /><br /><b>[When it was suggested his style suits Barca]</b> Yes, because <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> have a lot of the ball, but there are lots of teams that do that these days, not only <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, for example, are a team that have a lot of possession, although they’ve been a bit less efficient than <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in recent years. There are many players that inspired me like <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a>, <b>[Zinedine]</b> <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>… they’ve always been my idols.
