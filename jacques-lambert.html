  <p><b>[Jacques Lambert admits Euro 2016 concerns after Paris attacks]</b> From the start, we knew security would be key to the competition’s success. The attacks of January didn’t change much. The risk of attacks against France, and I say France not just Euro 2016, was identified from the start and was among the 12 risks in the application dossier and structured the work between the ministry of the interior, the government and Euro 2016 SAS. What has really changed is the progression of the terrorist risk in comparison to the other risks. It’s not a theoretical risk anymore, it’s a possible risk. There has been an action.</p>

  <p><b>[We have a plan for empty stadiums at Euro 2016]</b> It’s not an option I’m working on as president of the organisation. It is quite legitimate for Uefa services to consider all possibilities. We have crisis scenarios to try to deal with all the cases that may arise, including matches carrying over from one day to another. Remember at Euro 2012, the game between France and Ukraine was almost postponed because of a colossal storm. The empty stadium hypothesis is a working one. I say it is not an option because we are not organising Euro 2016 for that. We want to provide entertainment to people, not to play in front of empty stands. There was never an option taken in this direction by the highest level of Uefa, the president or the executive committee. Those kinds of decisions are highly political decisions, it cannot simply be the result of study at a level administrative by Uefa.</p>
