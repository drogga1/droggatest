<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ascendent Santos Laguna, Uruguay star Brian Lozano taking it step by step]</b> I think the key to have a good individual showing is the team. The team comes into the playoffs in really good form, and that lets an individual stand out a little more at times, but the most important thing is always looking out for the collective group. I also have to say that the coaching staff has helped me out a ton and helped me get better in a lot of aspects. I think you learn from listening and from there you get better. That’s been the key for how I’m feeling today<br /><br /><b>[Lozano said of his Uruguay return]</b> For me, it’s a dream. It’s something I’ve wanted for a long time, but I couldn’t get ahead of myself. If I wanted to get back to the national team, I had to do things well with my club and think when the whole base of the team is doing well, the individual can make a jump forward<br /><br /><b>[Lozano says the Superlider label doesn’t come with any added pressure]</b> We can’t get overconfident or underestimate any opponent. We know that everyone is strong and if we just keep doing what we’ve done all tournament, be concentrated, that can make the difference and we can get <b>[Santos’ seventh title]</b>, but right now we’ve got a really important game in <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a> and after that it’ll be a tough opponent if we’re able to get through</p>
