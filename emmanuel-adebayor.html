  <p><b>[Emmanuel Adebayor says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans treated him unfairly. Twelve months ago the Togo international was pursued by <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> but, despite turning down a move away from the Emirates, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans booed him and accused him of having no loyalty towards the club]</b> They <b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans]</b> didn’t turn on <a href="cesc-fabregas.html">Cesc Fabregas</a> when <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> showed interest in him. When a player plays well clubs come in for him. I scored 30 goals for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> two seasons ago and it was not my fault that Milan, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> wanted to buy me. The fans never understood that and I cannot understand why the fans went after me. I had played my heart out for that club and gave it my best and the way the fans behaved towards me was not nice at all. I was in the same position as Cesc. Every summer <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> tried to sign him, but the fans never turned on him<br /><br /><b>[Adebayor will begin next season as a City player on £150,000-a-week]</b> I know a lot of people will be saying ‘He went for the money’. However I would like to hear of any man, if he is honest, say he would refuse if he was earning £10 and someone offered £30. We are all human beings who love what we do. I have signed a very good contract, but now it is about what I am to achieve as a footballer. Every footballer needs a challenge and I have a big challenge in front of me now<br /><br /><b>[Admitting he challenged <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> about why it was him the club decided was surplus to requirements]</b> I only ever told him <b>[<a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>]</b> I loved the club and wanted to stay, but I think the club needed money. They had to sell someone and they pointed the finger at myself. <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> told me they had accepted City’s offer and I asked him why - at the end of the day I found out that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> needed the money and that I was the target. I never wanted to leave but now it’s all behind me and it is about what I am going to do with City</p>

  <p><b>[Emmanuel Adebayor insists <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans’ abuse justifies his goal celebration]</b> There is only so much abuse a man can take until he reaches breaking point. I could not understand some of the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> players being disrespectful towards me<br /><br />I was being abused by people who six months ago were singing my name. The abuse was for no reason. It wasn’t my fault I left, it was Arsene who wanted to accept the offer for me. They were all clapping Kolo but they were shouting personal abuse at me before the match had even kicked off<br /><br />People talk about us as being football players and the money we earn, but just because we are fortunate it does not mean we need to take abuse. If you were to abuse a man in the street for over an hour he would react and it would be a worse reaction than a goal celebration<br /><br /><b>[Treatment by former teammates]</b> There were players from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> who refused to shake my hand before the match. I don’t want to give you their names - that is not my style - but there’s more than one of them. Emmanuel Adebayor insists any man would react the same<br /><br />My friends, like Eboue, were fine with me. They are decent people. But I could not understand some of the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> players being disrespectful towards me. These are people I have spent a lot of time with and people I thought were my friends<br /><br />I can just about understand the fans’ reaction because they don’t know the full story. However the way some of the players behaved is just crazy. When a man offers you his hand, you shake it. For them to act like that was a disgrace<br /><br /><b>[His tackle on <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a>]</b> I am sorry <a href="robin-van-persie.html">Robin van Persie</a> got hurt but I can’t regret something I did not mean to do. Anybody who knows me knows I would not set out to hurt anybody and I would especially not mean to hurt an old team-mate<br /><br />I really am glad Robin was OK because I know my stud was close to his eye but there was really nothing I could have done - there was no way I could have got out of the way in time<br /><br /><b>[His goal celebration]</b> I scored and wanted to show people it is not a good idea to abuse me. I really didn’t understand it at all. I was running on pure emotion and when you take emotion out of football we are going to have a big problem<br /><br />People say I had time to think about because I ran the length of the pitch but that is not true. I was abused all match and scored a goal I knew would win the game for us. Ten seconds is nothing - your emotion is going to last a lot longer than that<br /><br /><b>[Regrets]</b> I know a stweard got hurt and I really do want to say sorry for that because he didn’t ask for any of this - he was just a man doing his job. Emotions were running high for me and it is obvious they were for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans as well<br /><br />They had just seen me score the goal that meant they had lost the game and that was very hard for them to take. The steward was just doing his job but if things hadn’t been thrown and people had stayed in their seats then that wouldn’t have happened<br /><br />Players should feel like they can celebrate a goal without the fear of being hit by things<br /><br /><b>[Two sides to every story]</b> I’m not sure if the fans understand what happened during the end of my time at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> but I have done nothing wrong. An offer came in for me and, as I understand it, Arsene and the club accepted the offer the same day. It was not my fault I left, it was Arsene who wanted to accept the offer for me<br /><br />I wasn’t making any comments in the Press about wanting to leave or being unhappy, it was the club who wanted to sell me yet I am being abused by the fans who once cheered me. It makes no sense. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans just don’t have the full picture<br /><br />I have said many times I enjoyed my time at the club and I scored a lot of goals. If they were unhappy with me leaving they need to take it up with their manager and their board because I had nothing to do with the sale<br /><br />Arsene has said many things in the Press but I only take notice of those who matter to me. I read his comments but, as the tattoo on my arm says, ‘Only God can judge me’ not Arsene Wenger<br /><br /><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> v <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> - the return leg]</b> People have asked me if they think I might be rested for the return match but I hope there is no chance. I am not the sort of man to shy away from things, I am not scared or intimidated by such things<br /><br />I hope by the time the Emirates match comes round we are still very much fighting for the title at City and we are even leading the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Emmanuel Adebayor admitts <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s players are struggling with booing while they strain to get the message from their new manager, <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>]</b> Instead of booing people, which will make it even worse, I think it is sometimes better to support them and give them what they need to perform on the pitch. Right now, to tell you the truth, I think a lot of players, when they put on the shirt and go out on to the pitch, are finding it hard in the head<br /><br /><b>[Adebayor says the players are feeling the heat]</b> It’s kind of hard when you know the first bad ball you make the fans are going to boo you. When you are playing in front of your own crowd you want them to support you. But now it is like going through a sad moment and your family not welcoming you home. That’s the worst thing ever because you have nowhere to go. At the moment I don’t know whether we should play at home or whether we should play away<br /><br />Obviously I was on the bench against Stoke and, though I could not see everything as clear as night, I could see that nobody wanted the ball. It’s hard for the players. It’s not their fault and it’s not the fans’ fault either because the fans want to see a result, the fans want to see a response and things are not going our way at the moment. We just have to fight as a team and as a club to find a solution. The quicker the better<br /><br /><b>[Adebayor added that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are struggling to adapt to <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a>’s methods]</b> He’s a good manager and we just have to find a way so that we can try to understand what he wants to tell us and how he wants us to play and put that on the pitch. If every player could do what the manager wants then we would win the Champions League. But at the moment we are not getting the message. To me, he is a good manager and a good man - we just have to get what he is telling us<br /><br />We have to get used to him. He is the new manager and it is tough. Tactically, he is working hard, he is trying to make us understand what the opponents will try to do and what we have to do to score goals and win the games. But at the moment there is a blockage somewhere. Hopefully we can overcome that. Football is a funny game. You play one game and score one goal and everybody says: ‘Hey, things have changed for you’<br /><br />Maybe we can go out and win the next game 3-0 or 4-0 and that will be it - the fans will be back enjoying <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> again and we will have it like it was when I first came here on loan. Then, every weekend I was happy to come in and play for the club because I knew I was going to have fun and enjoy it. Now it is not fun anymore. The critics are there and I welcome them - I take them in a good way and hopefully I will do my talking on the pitch. At the moment things are not going our way, but it cannot go any lower than this. Things can only get better<br /><br />Obviously all managers bring their own philosophies, the way they see football, the way they see games and everything. But come on, this the third or fourth manager in two or three years so we just have to stop it now being about the manager<br /><br /><b>[After the international break, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> travel to <a href="hull-city-fc.html">Hull City</a> and, according to Adebayor, it will be a relief to be away from home]</b> To be honest, I think so. At least you know I am going to be having the majority of opposition fans booing me rather than our own fans booing me. And I am not just talking about me, I am speaking on behalf of all the players<br /><br />I think it might be better to play away from home at the moment because at least we know beforehand we are guaranteed to be booed because they want their home club to win. But when you are playing at home and your own fans start booing you after a few minutes then it is harder</p>

If you look at Chelsea, when Hazard gets injured they’ve got Willian; if Willian gets injured they can still play Moses further forward. Arsenal’s problem is that today they are just Ozil and Sanchez. If one of them gets injured, it is a problem.<br /><br />I’m happy for Pochettino and how they are doing. Things didn’t work out between us but he is a great manager and we still have a good relationship despite what people might think. We still keep in touch - he is a good guy and has changed Tottenham. I don’t know whether the fans there hate me or love me but they should remember one thing, which is that there was a time when I scored goals for them and made them happy</p>

And it is why I have not said anything about racism the past few weeks. When I celebrated, the FA fined me, they punished me. Nothing happened to the Arsenal fans. So it <b>[racism]</b> started with me and long before me. I remember getting to the stadium and Arsenal fans were there. All I heard was the the chant: ‘Your mother is a whore and your father washes elephants’. My father worked in currency exchange and my mother is a businesswoman, but this went on and on. So how can I reply? I didn’t have a voice to go against thousands of supporters. Now the same FA are trying to stop racism? I’m sorry, it does not work that way. Today is too late. We are tired. Enough is enough. I see Mario Balotelli and Didier Drogba on Instagram. How many times do we have to post something? We have to react. We have to leave the pitch.<br /><br />The abuse was too much. I was ready to die. I just looked at them and thought: ‘There are things you do not do’. If a sniper shot me, he would not have struck me down. I was in my spiritual zone. Kolo Toure said to me: ‘I was looking at the pictures and you did not flinch once’. I did not feel human anymore</p>

We are losing..<br /><br />Wenger is a beautiful manager. But no matter the situation, we had to play our football. I remember those days going to Stoke. You know it’s a heavy afternoon with Rory Delap’s throw. I’m a big guy but what about the rest of the team? We came out of the dressing room in the corridor and you hear clink, clink…the studs from Stoke… and just think ‘Oh my God’. <b>[Ryan]</b> Shawcross, <b>[Robert]</b> Huth, <b>[Peter]</b> Crouch… Then you see our team of 60kg players<br /><br />We had quality but for some games. I am sorry, it was not enough. United and Chelsea were technical but so strong. Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. Rio insulted everyone on the pitch. He is proper psycho. But Vidic was the tough man, the nastiest, like running into a rock. He could block a striker with a single finger. He walks on you, he says sorry, he kicks you, he says sorry. He shouts at you and makes a little bit of spit come out. This guy was ready to kill. We swallowed defeats. Games where I scored and we lost 2-1, I thought my job was done. Rio would have come to me, ‘if you want to be happy, score three’. These are the things we didn’t have. We were nice. We had a gentlemen team.

  <p><b>[Emmanuel Adebayor left the door open to a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> return by saying anything can happen following his departure from Turkish Super Lig club Kayserispor]</b> These are tough decisions and <b>[it]</b> was tough for me. One of the most important decisions of my life. I tried to give my energy and will to this team since I arrived. I gave my best but sometimes you have some issues in your personal life. You think about your family and have to make decisions about your future. And that decision should be fast. I have decided not to continue my career here. Even though I am leaving physically, my heart will always beat for this team<br /><br />I cannot say that I’m leaving Turkey for good. Anything can happen in life. I have to rest and spend some time with my family. I had three great years here and I think that the Turkish league is among the best leagues in Europe</p>

  <p><b>[Emmanuel Adebayor has quit Turkish side Kayserispor after just four months with the club]</b> Everything was quite difficult for me and this is one of the most important decisions to make in my career. I joined this team with a lot of ambition, to make history, but at some point you have to look at your health, family, everything around you and make a decision. I’ve come to a conclusion where I have to move forward. Obviously, I have to leave this team, but my thoughts will always be with the club<br /><br /><b>[Emmanuel Adebayor now considers his future, but refuses to rule out a return to Turkish football]</b> A footballer can never close a page, let me just go now and clear my head about my life and career. We’ll see if I come back to Turkey or not. I had a beautiful three years in Turkey and I just wish this league to be one of the best leagues in Europe. Going back home to see my family, childhood friends, and a change of atmosphere for a couple of weeks, and I will take it from there. A lot is going on and I just need to go back home to know the next thing that I will do<br /><br />… This has been my last game for Kayserispor. I’ve had some good times in the past three months. But this has been an important decision - one of the most important I’ve made in my life. I’ve tried to show my energy and desire from the day I arrived. I’ve given my all for the team<br /><br />But sometimes I have problems on my mind. I think about my family, and need to take decisions about my future. I don’t have any new club lined up for the time being. I’ll go back to Togo, spend some time with family and old friends, and get some clear ideas. I don’t know what the future may hold</p>

I have to follow their dreams, I have to meet their targets… let’s enjoy ourselves together! It’s going to be a beautiful year and a beautiful time for me in Paraguay<br /><br />This was one of the most emotional days in my life. I understand that maybe some people know my name already, but I never expected the large turnout that greeted me so early on my arrival. We landed at 1am and to see about 5,000 fans singing my name was emotional and unbelievable. They could’ve been sleeping or watching a movie but they came out to welcome me. I’ve played around the world but what I’ve seen, the Olimpia fans are one of the best</p>

  <p><b>[Adebayor will not be donating to his homeland]</b> I always do things according to the wishes of my heart and not according to the words of others. I’m sorry that people compare me to <a href="samuel-eto-o.html">Samuel Eto’o</a> and <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a> by asking me why I don’t have a foundation or why I don’t donate, as if I was the one who brought the coronavirus to Togo <b>[…]</b> I am neither the one nor the other, I am me, Sheyi Emmanuel Adebayor. A word of advice for the guys regarding donations, I will not do that. Everything is clear and very simple. Thank you and good day</p>
