  <p><b>[An angry Edin Dzeko on coach Safet Susic and the Bosnia-Herzegovina fans]</b> I came here with a niggling injury and Susic knew that, and he still didn’t substitute me either at half-time, which was the plan, or after the break when I asked to be replaced. I don’t know why. I wish to thank all fans who support me but the others <b>[who jeered]</b> should be ashamed because I am a born winner and always played my heart out for the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Dzeko wary of ‘dangerous’ Republic of Ireland]</b> The fact Ireland didn’t lose to Germany in qualifying speaks for itself. We all know they are dangerous from set pieces and that they play long balls. I know most of their players from Premier League, but they know us as well.<br /><br />We have to give 200 per cent to progress. It would be great to have good result in the first leg, considering the fact they will be missing some important players</p>

  <p><b>[Edin Dzeko has warned his Bosnia-Herzegovina team-mates to take nothing for granted against Republic of Ireland, after their 1-0 win over Germany]</b> Maybe some of their most important players are not playing in the first game, so it’s a big problem for them, but they have other good players who can jump in, so I don’t think it’s a big advantage for us. They have some important players, some experienced players, who can bring.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if the Bosnians, who finished behind Belgium and Wales in Group B, are favourites to progress]</b> No, I think it’s 50-50. It doesn’t matter that some of our players are playing in the Champions League because Ireland have players with a lot of experience who have already played in big games. I know almost all the Irish players - they all play in England in the best league in the world and they are there because they have their individual qualities, they are good players. Even if some of them are missing, they are a good team which will definitely never give up, I know that</p>

  <p><b>[Edin Dzeko has admitted he gets hurt by claims he does not work hard enough]</b> I don’t run? I don’t give my best? Come on! That is a joke. I can guarantee that no one in the stands or in front of the TV wants us to win games more than I do! Any match, I don’t care who we play against or what we play for, I just want to score a goal or my team to score a goal so that we win the match. Every match I give my very best. Every single match<br /><br />I know people will criticise when you play bad; that is part of this job and I am fine with that. That is not a problem. The problem is the insults. That is what hurts the most. This is the time of social media and everyone has a chance to publicly say what they think. No matter how illogical or stupid it is. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, everyone is entitled to insult you because you did not score or play well. People think that they care more than I do - but that is simply not true.<br /><br />It’s never easy to read headlines like that, to hear fans shouting things like that. You know that you are better than that, that you can play much better, but sometimes it is difficult to turn things around. What people do not see is that you are a human being too and that you have problems like everyone else.<br /><br />I would lie if I tell you that I don’t listen or read what people say. I do. I ignore the insults and irrational things but I like to watch and read what educated football people have to say, people who analyse things, especially in Italy. They know football, they try to do it in depth and as someone involved in the game I do enjoy some articles or programmes<br /><br />Nothing compares to Rome. Nothing. People there are crazy about football, in a positive way. The expectations were big in Germany, bigger in England, but nothing even close to Rome. It’s a special city, with a special bond with a club and people adore it.<br /><br />In Manchester I could go out for a dinner or for a walk; people would stop me and politely ask for a photo from time to time. In Rome it is impossible for me to walk normally in the city. They are passionate, love their club and their players and the attention is enormous. And that kind of attention and passion raises expectations and pressure. But I am not saying this in a negative way.<br /><br />I love how things work there, because passion and love is what football is supposed to be about</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea in for scary Halloween with Dzeko in best form of his career]</b> I am personally proud to reach 100 appearances in a Roma jersey and, after my first year, nobody thought that was possible.<br /><br />Rome is similar to Bosnia. The people don’t just criticise you, they insult you. So, I’m used to it. I did think about leaving because you do when you don’t play… but I decided to stay and I was convinced of that, even after the final game of the season, against Chievo. I didn’t play but I said to myself, ‘I’m not leaving here’. And that was my decision; no one asked me to stay. I saw it as a challenge to win. I went on holiday, I switched off and I started over<br /><br />I scored many goals last season but this year it’s tougher and I didn’t touch the ball many times tonight<br /><br />I don’t feel old. I want to keep playing regularly and at a high level</p>

  <p><b>[Edin Dzeko has admitted he was flattered by Chelsea’s attempts to sign him in January]</b> It is true that negotiations have been conducted and that is all I can say about this topic. There was a lot of speculation, falsehoods and even a few ridiculous stories, and I’m really flattered by Chelsea’s interest, a club that I respect and admire very much. So many stories have been told about my departure from Rome over the past few weeks, but I am still here. After all, I am happy to stay because Rome has become my home and an indelible part of my life. From the very first day I was accepted in Rome in an unreal way and I can never and will not forget it, and I have had some of the happiest moments in my life in this city. For the first time I felt the joy of fatherhood here when my daughter Una was born, and my son Dani was born in Rome. This city is now part of my life and it will always be.<br /><br />The fact is that we haven’t celebrated a win for a long time, which is very frustrating for us, but we haven’t had enough luck in several games. We’re all working hard to get back to winning ways as soon as possible, but it’s going to be difficult. We have quality and I’m convinced that it’s a question of when we will end this bad run and find a winning rhythm. I believe that there are many more beautiful moments ahead of us and we will succeed in achieving all our goals together</p>

I have talked with him about his past when he was playing at Chelsea. Obviously, he was much younger and everyone knows the English league is not the easiest league in the world. But I think Italy did him good. He played three years in Rome and he scored a lot of goals in Serie A, he learned a lot here. We text each other a lot. When the semi-final draw was made, I just wished him luck in breaking the Premier League record but told him he can take a rest against us.</p>

I just don’t understand the referee, he was so sure that he was right, but I’d seen it hit Smalling in the face. When I saw the replay on television, it’s just incredible. The referee kept insisting it was a penalty, I told him it was his face and not the hand. You could see the mark on Smalling’s face where the ball hit him. You can’t give a penalty like that at the 95th minute. It’s unacceptable. We ran no risks at all in the second half and we’ve lost two points here.
