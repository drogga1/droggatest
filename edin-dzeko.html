  <p><b>[An angry Edin Dzeko on coach Safet Susic and the Bosnia-Herzegovina fans]</b> I came here with a niggling injury and Susic knew that, and he still didn’t substitute me either at half-time, which was the plan, or after the break when I asked to be replaced. I don’t know why. I wish to thank all fans who support me but the others <b>[who jeered]</b> should be ashamed because I am a born winner and always played my heart out for the national team</p>

Nobody I spoke to wanted me to move to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> so I decided to stay.

  <p><b>[Edin Dzeko has made no decision on where he will be playing in 2018-19 as yet, although he remains under contract until 2020]</b> Now I will play two games for Bosnia and then we’ll see <b>[where will I play]</b>. I have another two years of contract, so Roma has to be asked about it too<br /><br />While I was playing for Zeljeznicar, <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> was my big wish. After I won the German title with Wolfsburg in 2009, I was very close to Milan, but Wolfsburg would not let me go. But my career went very well and I am currently very happy in Rome</p>

You never know. I had four and a half great years there, and had fun every minute of every game. I love <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and England, so we’ll see.

  <p><b>[Roma have announced Edin Dzeko has signed a new three-year contract]</b> Over the last few weeks I have realised just how much the club wanted me to stay. My conversations with the board, the work we’ve been doing with the coach <b>[Paulo Fonseca]</b>, the relationship with my team-mates and the love of the fans has all made me realise once again what I had already learned during these four years - that Rome is my home. Here there is everything we need to win something and I am delighted to be able to stay here even longer</p>

  <p><b>[Edin Dzeko revealed he was offered Roma’s captaincy by team-mate <a href="alessandro-florenzi.html">Alessandro Florenzi</a> in an effort to convince him to stay amid interest from Inter]</b> They went to great lengths to keep me here. I want to thank them and now I need to give my all on the pitch, as always. It’s really nice to see that other people are happy that I’ve stayed here. My team-mates aren’t just team-mates: we’re friends, brothers <b>[…]</b> They were always on my back: ‘You’re not going anywhere - you’re staying here!’ I have a great relationship with them all. <b>[Lorenzo]</b> <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Pellegrini</a> and <a href="alessandro-florenzi.html">Florenzi</a> were on me every day: ‘You’ll stay here - you’re not going anywhere’. <a href="alessandro-florenzi.html">Florenzi</a> would say: ‘If you sign, I’ll give you the captaincy!’<br /><br />When I did sign, he said: ‘It’s yours!’ But I said: ‘Ale, you’re our captain and we’re all behind you’.</p>

  <p><b>[Dzeko scored nine league goals and 14 across all competitions to lead the way for Roma]</b> I said that Rome was my home after I signed the new deal - but it’s not the first time I’ve said that. I’ve always said it and I really do feel that way. My family feels that way too, especially my wife and also my kids, who were born here in Rome. We were on holiday recently and my daughter Una kept saying: ‘Let’s go home to Rome!’<br /><br />We spoke at the end of last season and they told me they wanted me here and that I was part of the project for the future of Roma. During pre-season over the last two months, they made me feel important. In the end we were able to achieve what we all wanted. I’m here and I’ve signed for another three years because I want to stay here and because I’m happy</p>

I know him as a great player, and he is a very good addition to our attacking team who wants to play football. I am 100 per cent sure he is going to be a big help for us. I was definitely happy to see this transfer happen. After we played for our national teams and he scored two goals against us I told him, ‘My friend, next games you have to score for Roma as well!’. He’s a great pro. I remember him also from <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> times and he will be a big player for us. Hopefully, he can stay a long time here. Hopefully he will <b>[stay]</b>. He will see that we are playing football here and immediately he scored a goal so hopefully, he can have more goals and a lot of assists for us</p>

  <p><b>[Roma: Officials admitted <a href="chris-smalling.html">Chris Smalling</a> penalty was a mistake against Monchengladbach]</b> It’s a serious error that cannot happen at this level. It changes the result, the whole game, the group. Now we have another three games where anything could happen. A victory today would’ve made everything easier. I just don’t understand the referee, he was so sure that he was right, but I’d seen it hit Smalling in the face. When I saw the replay on television, it’s just incredible. The referee kept insisting it was a penalty, I told him it was his face and not the hand. You could see the mark on Smalling’s face where the ball hit him. You can’t give a penalty like that at the 95th minute. It’s unacceptable. We ran no risks at all in the second half and we’ve lost two points here. We can’t do anything about it now, we have to look forward</p>
