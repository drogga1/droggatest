  <p><b>[BVB manager Peter Stoger confirmed that <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> skipped the briefing on Saturday before leaving Dortmund’s training complex early]</b> This is a relatively important meeting, and he just stayed away, so I guess he’s not that important, that he’s not that focused. We’ve taken consequences. He was a little surprised today, he did not quite feel that way himself, but for us it’s a straightforward story. If he does not want to be there, then we’ll turn to someone else who is fully focused on playing. He has hinted that he is focused, but we all know that’s not the case</p>

Whether he’s able to play for Saturday, I doubt that.<br /><br /><b>[Bayern could potentially claim the German title at the weekend]</b> Our plan is not to allow them to celebrate their success against us</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Dortmund boss reveals Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s bad behaviour in bid to force Arsenal move]</b> He left me no other choice. He trained well four days of the week. But to underline his wish for a transfer, he skipped team meetings before games or refused to run during the final training. We did our best to keep him for at least another half a year, but Auba wasn’t ready for that.<br /><br />Honestly, I got along well with him although he kept me pretty busy for four weeks. But Auba personally apologised to me before joining Arsenal. He told me that his behaviour had nothing to do with my person and that he had felt my support</p>
