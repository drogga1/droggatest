  <p><b>[Bundesliga club Koln will not stand in Jonas Hector’s way should he wish to leave for Chelsea]</b> I would not say that any player of any club in the world is not for sale, but we have extended Jonas’ contract. And I think the player is clear - he knows what he wants. If there is any club Jonas is interested in, then we would talk to them. But Jonas didn’t say that he wants to leave the club and go to Chelsea so it doesn’t matter. If someone wants to leave the club then we have to talk about it, but not before.</p>

  <p><b>[Cologne coach Peter Stoger, on the other hand, tried to deflect attention from his sharpshooter Anthony Modeste]</b> For me, he is just another player. Everyone has their job on the field, his is to score goals, and right now he is doing so.</p>

  <p><b>[BVB manager Peter Stoger confirmed that <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> skipped the briefing on Saturday before leaving Dortmund’s training complex early]</b> This is a relatively important meeting, and he just stayed away, so I guess he’s not that important, that he’s not that focused. We’ve taken consequences. He was a little surprised today, he did not quite feel that way himself, but for us it’s a straightforward story. If he does not want to be there, then we’ll turn to someone else who is fully focused on playing. He has hinted that he is focused, but we all know that’s not the case</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Aubameyang’s latest act of defiance is a sign he wants out of BVB]</b> Well generally it doesn’t bother me at all if Aubameyang right now is kicking it around somewhere else. That’s his decision. If he had been good in training, he would have played <b>[on Friday]</b>.<br /><br />But I didn’t have that impression of him in the last training session before the match. I felt like he was busy with many things but not this important match. That’s why he wasn’t with us. If he kicks a ball all week and there are pictures of him, and he does it well, then he’ll be back in the squad against Freiburg</p>

  <p><b>[On Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]</b> We lost an extraordinary forward. And what I already said was that on the last day we got a new player who has goalscoring skills. He has not been getting much playing time lately and that is why he wanted to move and he wants to have more time on the pitch with us. We needed such a player for our squad. That the game went like this is like a dream for him and for everyone involved. It feels very good for him and to everyone so he can feel comfortable here very fast. But I think we all saw that, independent from the goals, he will be an important player for us.</p>

  <p><b>[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s eccentricity is one reason why many have come to love him over the years]</b> In my time here, he <b>[Aubameyang]</b> never came too late. Only one single time he skipped our team meeting and only one single time he practiced badly because he wanted to put a sign <b>[out]</b>, apparently. But, apart from that, he behaved reasonably.</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Stoger is prepared to show the kind of faith in Batshuayi that he was denied at Stamford Bridge under Antonio Conte]</b> He will definitely try to do well in his first home game. Of course, the expectation has increased after his goals against Cologne, so it’s not always that easy.</p>

  <p><b>[Pulisic is a slight concern for the trip to Italy after leaving Monday’s training session early due to a knock]</b> He got a knock on his ankle in Gladbach.

  <p><b>[Ex-Dortmund boss reveals Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s bad behaviour in bid to force Arsenal move]</b> He left me no other choice. He trained well four days of the week. But to underline his wish for a transfer, he skipped team meetings before games or refused to run during the final training. We did our best to keep him for at least another half a year, but Auba wasn’t ready for that.<br /><br />Honestly, I got along well with him although he kept me pretty busy for four weeks. But Auba personally apologised to me before joining Arsenal. He told me that his behaviour had nothing to do with my person and that he had felt my support</p>
