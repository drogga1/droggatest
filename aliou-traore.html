<blockquote>
  <p>[Manchester United midfielder Aliou Traore believes he is now fully integrated at the club and feeling at home] I feel like it’s my second home here now. United helped me a lot – I can now speak English fully and they helped me with my mother and the new house. I feel like an Englishman!<br /><br />I look back on a great season for us, although we didn’t win anything. We played some really good football and can hopefully do well next year. We had some big occasions, like the FA Youth Cup tie against Chelsea, and beating Liverpool twice away from home. They were really good games to watch<br /><br />[The midfielder is relishing the step up and pushing himself at the next level and knows what is expected] It’s been a new experience for me. I’d never played men’s games before so it was great experience stepping into the Under-23s. It’s quite different – much quicker and less space due to the speed of the game. You also need to get to know your team-mates. You have to manage how to play with new colleagues as you don’t know what they like and their strengths. But you learn very quickly from it and can do this in training as well. I’m going to enjoy this summer but work hard and then get back to Manchester, and be fit and ready to go</p>
