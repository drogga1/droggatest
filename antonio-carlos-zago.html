<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Antonio Carlos Zago says he’d pay to play in the Derby della Capitale]</b> I’d pay to play against <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>. For me it would be a dream. In Rome, the derby has a special meaning. If you win, it can change the season. We’ve had three defeats in the derby, now is the time to get back to winning. Like <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a>, I also do not have a great fondness for <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>. You cannot make a prediction<br /><br /><b>[Zago went on to reveal that he was overcome with emotion when he got the post as assistant coach of the club]</b> It was an indescribable emotion. When I came back inside I locked myself in the bathroom and cried. The sports culture in Rome has a special meaning. I think a player who has history with Roma cannot play for <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a>. With <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> and Inter, they happen to exchange players. It’s always a special game. From the first day I arrived in Rome in 1998, I realised how important the derby is. I think they will suffer from the match played on Thursday in Turkey</p>
