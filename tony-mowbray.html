  <p><b>[<a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> boss Tony Mowbray says forcing league restarts ‘doesn’t make sense’]</b> The world is missing football, but I don’t think we should be compromising the health of the staff, of the players, of the officials, of the people who would have to be around stadiums. Even empty stadiums, who is getting the balls back? Little things, everything has to be thought about. I can’t see a quick start to this solution. I’m not sure what it is. How are we going to go up for corners and challenge for headers and make tackles and have all the physicality that football is going to have, if we’re still doing that <b>[social distancing]</b>? It doesn’t make sense</p>

  <p><b>[Conor Chaplin answered Barnsley’s prayers as he came off the bench to score in a 2-0 win over <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> that does wonders for his side’s survival hopes]</b> We were one point off the play-offs, we have lost two games against teams we should be beating in my opinion, life looks pretty difficult and tough going forward as we play a team at the top of the division (Leeds). Let’s wait and see, you never know. We had a genuine chance of believing we could put ourselves in our frame, so these two results have been desperately disappointing<br /><br />We lost the game because we didn’t take our chances in the first half, you have to score goals to win football matches. We dominate the game, should have scored goals, didn’t take the chances and came in at 0-0, which was not a true reflection. We should have been in front. We have to be ruthless we have to take chances. that’s how it was, ultimately we are very disappointed</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> outclassed <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> to take another step towards their long-awaited <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> return as a 3-1 victory at Ewood Park put them four points clear at the top of the Championship]</b> I think we made a game of it in the first half particularly. Obviously we missed a one-on-one and hit the post and they scored at strange times, just as we were getting back in the game <b>[…]</b> They come with an attitude that they believe they’re going to win football matches. They’ve got very good players and they spend a lot of time in your box. I think their right-back was in our box 100 times today, but I don’t think the gap was massive</p>

  <p><b>[Automatic promotion-chasing West Brom had to settle for a point at <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> after substitute Joe Rothwell’s strike earned the hosts a 1-1 draw]</b> Particularly in the first half you could feel their quality - there is a reason they are at the top end of the table with <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>. And yet, sadly, watching their goal at half-time, it looks a metre offside to me, which is a frustration for us all. We had some unbelievable chances in the second half, one-on-ones that should be going in the net. It is Jacob today, just come off the bench, running through one-on-one with the goalkeeper - just slide it past him, round him, under him, whatever it is. So I am frustrated we didn’t get all three points</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="mason-bennett.html">Mason Bennett</a>’s first-half strike kept alive Millwall’s Championship play-off hopes and helped them to a narrow victory over <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a>]</b> That is the disappointment and we can’t do anything about it. We all knew what was at stake as Millwall knew. It was not as if we were playing a dead rubber against somebody that did not matter. There was a lot at stake for them and they did what they did, and played how they played and they got a 1-0 victory. It was hard for us to get through them, round them or over them and we ultimately didn’t manage to score a goal in a game where we had to score a goal</p>
