  <p><b>[A statement from Wigan owner Au Yeung’s UK lawyers said the Next Leader Fund had bought the club with the best intentions]</b> Wigan Athletic is a wonderful football club with rich history and a passionate fan base. We bought Wigan Athletic with the best intentions: to create a team that would get the club back into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and I have invested more than £40m. Unfortunately, the Covid-19 crisis has severely impacted people and businesses around the world - and Championship football clubs, which rely on fans coming through the turnstiles, are no exception. This has fundamentally undermined our ability to fund Wigan Athletic and, after struggling to find a solution, in the end took the difficult decision to put the club into administration to ensure its survival. The administrators are now doing everything they can to find a new owner who will secure the future of Wigan Athletic for the sake of the many thousands of devoted Latics fans, and the local community<br /><br />The League fundamentally disagrees with the comments attributed earlier today to Mr Au Yeung Wai Kay where he stated that ‘the Covid-19 pandemic has undermined the ability to fund the club’. Whilst it is clear that Covid-19 has undoubtedly presented significant financial challenges to the professional game, evidence of the required source and sufficiency of funding to be invested in or otherwise made available to the club, was provided as part of the recent change of control process. This set of circumstances is more illustrative of the wider financial challenges facing EFL clubs, who, without a full and comprehensive reset of football’s finances, including how monies are distributed throughout the game, will continue to struggle to meet the demands of an outdated and unsustainable model.<br /><br /><b>[The EFL also said it is working with administrators to help ensure Wigan exits administration]</b> Given the club’s standing within the EFL and their local community there is, quite rightly, a significant strength of feeling of anger and frustration amongst all those connected to the club. The EFL has engaged with the administrators and their advisors and is continuing to provide its full support in all ongoing matters, particularly how it can work through the requirements of the insolvency policy and assist the club in exiting administration at the earliest opportunity. In the short-term, those discussions will continue with the sale of the club, player transfers and funding required in order to complete the 2019/20 season the immediate priorities. In addition, we will also engage with the appropriate supporter groups, local politicians and other key stakeholders as appropriate to assist in helping achieve a long-term stable future for the club and its local community.</p>
