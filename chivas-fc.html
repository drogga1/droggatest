  <p><b>[You won’t hear Jose Maria Aldrete Gonzalez’s name mentioned in coverage of Sunday’s Liga MX final second leg, and he hopes you won’t notice his work, either. The man responsible for keeping the Estadio Chivas field maintained is proud of the work he and his team have put in during the run to the title]</b> That’s something Matias himself has told us, that everyone around the team, we’re part of the team that plays and we all have our way of supporting and helping the team. It’s simple to see that there are three elements on the field. You’ve got a field, a ball and players. If one of those three things doesn’t work this triangle becomes unbalanced. So, we’re really satisfied to be able to contribute in the right way by doing our jobs.<br /><br />You feel a great satisfaction to have overcome a very big challenge. Five years ago we didn’t know what it meant to have a sporting field. We didn’t know that a field needed many more things than water and cutting it often. We’ve learned a lot along the way. We’ve suffered a lot in the sense that situations where we had to work and make an effort and learn and look to control plague. Now to have a field with these conditions where the team is in the final - they also played in the Copa final, which was the first final of the year<br /><br />We’re really happy that we’ve put together a great team because this is a group effort, and we’ve helped in our small way for the team to have the best conditions to be able to get into the final<br /><br />It’s a very close relationship in the sense that anything can be communicated. They’re very respectful with what the team needs and they also respect what we suggest but the field ultimately is for them to use. If they need the field, we’ll make a recommendation about the timing, activities, and after every game we do a report so they know the field’s condition and what they’re going to face in this aspect.<br /><br />It’s a very open communication and when there’s a situation we chat, we make a recommendation and look to find the way they have what they need to develop their game. We always try to have the least activity possible to keep the field in the best state</p>

  <p><b>[Sunday’s loss turned out to be the final nail in the coffin for Jose Cardozo’s career as Chivas manager]</b> Club Deportivo Guadalajara informs that after an analysis of the showings by the club up to now in the Clausura 2019, the results are not going hand-in-hand with the goals set out at the start of the season and the footballing performance has noticeably dropped, which with the squad available doesn’t correspond to the situation that had been projected for this stage of the national championship. Because of this, it makes known that as of today, Jose Cardozo is no longer the manager of the team<br /><br />We thank Pepe for the effort, commitment and determination he put forward since he took over our squad and we wish success to him and his coaching staff in their future professional projects</p>
