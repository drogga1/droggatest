  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund’s latest signing is probably unknown to many followers of the Bundesliga, but in capturing Raphael Guerreiro from Lorient they have secured an exciting left-sided player]</b> At my parents’ house, there are still pictures of Pauleta and Cristiano Ronaldo on the walls. I loved the intelligence of Pauleta, the way he played the game in his head and not only with his feet.<br /><br />When I went from Caen to Lorient, it was hard to get my head around that I was worth €3m. It’s a lot of money for one guy, especially coming out of Ligue 2. My parents <b>[his father a factory worker and his mother a housewife]</b> were even more surprised than me. But I tried to live up to my fee and prove my worth.<br /><br />At the time I thought: ‘What the hell’s going on?’ It can make you pretentious but it gives you self-confidence, too.<br /><br />My absolute dream? It would be to play a Euro 2016 semi-final for Portugal against France at the Parc des Princes. I’d play left-back, my favourite position, and Ronaldo would score</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund midfielder Raphael Guerreiro made his first appearance in four months on Tuesday, and has shown that he is back to his best with an exceptional goal in training]</b> It was a difficult time. But I’m very happy to have finally made my comeback. I feel good again now. At this point I would like to express my thanks to the club staff, who gave me great support. Of course, I’m not yet at 100 per cent in terms of running, but that will improve bit by bit. I need to build it back up. Nonetheless, I will now try to be there when the coach needs me. I’m very happy to have played again. I felt good and everything went well on the pitch.</p>
