  <p><b>[Bastian Schweinsteiger hit back at <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Franz Beckenbauer</a> who advice him go to easier league such as <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>]</b> I don’t know when <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Beckenbauer</a> moved to America, but I am 30. It is a challenge for me to prove I can do it here, but I am confident I can adjust to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a><br /><br />I had my knee trouble after the World Cup which was very intensive for me and I had a break in October. But I have a lot of experience in big matches and that is an advantage. My style of play is to control a game, so you have to be smart in your brain and fast. I want to make a positive impact and I think I can contribute a lot to the team<br /><br /><b>[Schweinsteiger insists he can add to his trophy haul by winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at United]</b> Absolutely, that is my goal for my time here. I want to win titles and this is what <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is used to and I am the same. I cannot guarantee titles, but I will guarantee that we will do everything to be successful in the season<br /><br />I know the club is looking forward to winning titles again and I am the same. <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> is a big club, but <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are bigger and I can see that. They are the biggest club in the world and I am sure this team has the quality to win titles<br /><br />When I see what we do in training and the quality we have, I am sure we have the chance to win titles. I am convinced about that and I want to add my quality to United’s game<br /><br />I had the chance to come to United in 2010. I thought about what to do because there were opportunities. My goal was always to win the Champions League with my club <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, but now I am happy to be here and so is my brother Tobias.

I have 0.0 per cent doubts about playing. A ruptured ligament needs time but everything is healing perfectly. I know my body well, everything will be fine. In about five days I can start running again and five days later I should be able to train with the ball. I will be fully fit in March, I think.<br /><br /><b>[Former Germany and Bayern Munich team-mate Oliver Kahn has also raised his concerns about whether Schweinsteiger is still good enough to earn a place in Low’s star-studded squad]</b> I have played in 27 competitive fixtures this season, despite my ban and my injury.

With your positive charisma, your open style and last but not least thanks to your inimitable left foot, you have inspired not only me, but also the German, English and Turkish audience alike.

  <p><b>[Chicago Fire midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger is thoroughly enjoying playing regular football again. His brother Tobias said]</b> Bastian loves playing football, he enjoys every minute in training all the time. I know him, he always wants to play. And play 90 minutes every game. And he enjoys training with the guys and helping them to improve and it’s fantastic for him.<br /><br />For sure, MLS’ level is different to the European teams like Bayern Munich and Manchester United that he’s played for. But it’s good for him to help the other players to improve, I think he can help them. And he also has to learn new things in another type of ‘soccer’. It’s good for him.<br /><br />My brother, he likes to play football so much and he’s not that guy who can sit in the stands and earns his money. He wants to play football and he wants to have fun. When you see him now, he likes to play. When you see him play the last matches with Man Utd, you can see he enjoys every minute.<br /><br />He wasn’t disappointed when he left Man Utd because he was enjoying his new adventures. He’s not the sort of guy who thinks negatively about his past, he always thinks positive about his future. He’s feeling very well, he enjoys the town, the people in Chicago, the team, the organisation. They had seven points from their first three games at home. Now they have some tough away teams, but he likes it very much and it’s a really good challenge for him</p>

  <p><b>[Bastian Schweinsteiger says it was never his intention to leave Manchester United]</b> When everything happened in the preseason with the manager <b>[Mourinho]</b>, for me it was a test. I wanted to play for United, I wanted to play at Old Trafford. It was always my goal. I was training individually. I remember Mourinho in November spoke to me and took me in the first team again and said I could train again. But I was looking forward to getting more minutes and to play.<br /><br />I’m always a positive person. Of course I was surprised at how it was at the beginning of the season with the club and the manager. He apologised, as you know, and I think if we had met at a different time it would have been different, but it is how it is. I am now happy to be here in Chicago and I wish Manchester United all the best. I am always happy when they win, especially if they can reach the Champions League spots. But I’m focused now here on Fire. I won’t forget the supporters of United and also the team and the players</p>

  <p><b>[Schweinsteiger still shaking off rust from Manchester United nightmare]</b> Probably it will be the case when I have more matches in my body, when I have more rhythm. You have to know that I was not playing so much at <b>[Manchester]</b> United. To come in the league without a preseason is not so easy, so actually I’m quite surprised how good I feel. But my expectations for myself are quite high so sometimes in my game I want to try to decide it. I want to make the difference, then something in the body is not working 100 percent. Like a little bit of the fitness, or you’re not in the rhythm where you’re used to being. My brain is working, so that’s always good, but the other things will definitely come. I will get to this point in let’s say in five, six more matches.<br /><br />For me, that’s not a big deal. I’m actually physically strong. I can adjust. There are other things as well where you can improve a little bit in MLS, but I have to say the league is good. It’s not like that the league is boring or bad. I think the league is good, and every single match is a tough match, so that’s good for us. We can win. We have to focus on our game style to make it easier for everyone on the pitch as well, and then I’m quite confident for our games<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he thinks Germans are following MLS more]</b> I think so, yes. MLS is also shown on Eurosport in Germany. A lot of players are also messaging me asking, ‘How is it?’ I have a feeling if MLS improves, that more players from Germany will come over. I have some friends, and also teammates, asking how it is and everything. They want to know how it is. And I know in Germany, the players in the teams which I played for, like America, of course, but they are not sure about the level of MLS. I hope the level of the league improves step by step, and then I have a good feeling that a lot of German soccer players will come over<br /><br /><b>[Schweinsteiger is keeping expectations modest with the Fire]</b> For me, it would be great if we could qualify for the playoffs. The Eastern Conference in my eyes is quite tight, everything, the teams are good so it’s not so easy. Before we ask for this kind of spot, we have to do our work and we have to improve - as I said before - our game style, our mentality a little bit more. Then we can win matches, but we have to do the work before we ask for the top spot</p>

  <p><b>[Bastian Schweinsteiger doesn’t believe his former club Bayern Munich need to change much]</b> That’s difficult, but if you ask me which kind of player I would like to see in the Bayern Munich jersey then I would probably say I would like to see Neymar in a Bayern Munich jersey.<br /><br />Actually, I’m also quite a fan of Neymar. Not only about his game style, but also his personality. <b>[The connection]</b> actually came from <b>[former Bayern Munich defender]</b> Dante. He was playing with him in the Selecao, and he wanted to have a shirt of mine so I gave Dante a shirt of mine for Neymar. Every time when we played against each other there was a lot of respect<br /><br />I also remember in 2014 when we won the World Cup in Brazil, and I met him during my vacation - it was a coincidence. Then we spent some hours or some days together, so it was quite fun. He’s good guy. He’s a typical Brazilian. His heart is good. He’s a good person and, for me, one of the best players at the moment<br /><br />It’s not easy for him as well, because the whole Brazil are looking forward to getting a new Ronaldo or Ronaldinho, and I think with Neymar they have a player who can achieve all these goals which they have. I hope that he will one day be player of the year in the world, and I wish him all the best</p>

  <p><b>[Schweinsteiger says Bayern Munich will win the Champions League again very soon]</b> No, Bayern Munich is for me one of the top three clubs at the moment in the world. It’s not easy when you lose in the Champions League, or you when lose the cup. I know what it feels like. But still, Bayern Munich is a huge club and they don’t need a transition in my eyes. They have great players, they have everything there. Sometimes in these matches, when Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich or Juventus Turin are playing against each other, there are small details that make the difference if you win or not.<br /><br />I’m quite sure in the next two or three years they’re going to win the Champions League again<br /><br />Actually, I’m not thinking about <b>[returning to Bayern]</b>. I’m more thinking about things that are important at the moment, which is the Chicago Fire. But I will come back to Munich. The beer gardens are quite nice there<br /><br />I remember when I started my career in Munich you couldn’t say before the season that we want to win the Champions League. And my goal was to help the club - of course with other players as well - to get the club on this level to say before the preseason that want to win the Champions League. When we won the treble with Bayern - we actually also lost the Champions League final twice before</p>

  <p><b>[Bastian Schweinsteiger reveals the differences he has seen playing in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to his time in Europe]</b> We all know that this league is just not like the <b>[English]</b> <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> or the <b>[German]</b> <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. And, of course, it can be frustrating on the pitch at times when things discussed <b>[in the team meeting]</b> are not implemented or when somebody loses a ball or just does not have an eye for the team-mate.

If you compare it to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> or the <b>[Germany]</b> national team, the difference is huge. But I knew what I let myself in for. The league is interesting because it’s evident everyone can beat everyone. And sometimes things happen you just don’t understand.

I came on in the second half and played against Zidane, who scored a good goal five minutes later. They won 1-0.

  <p><b>[Germany legend Bastian Schweinsteiger says he left <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for Chicago Fire in 2017 because he could not imagine playing for another club in Europe]</b> I did not want to go elsewhere in Europe. <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> were the clubs I always wanted to play for.<br /><br /><b>[While he has enjoyed life in the United States, he has also noticed differences with his old life - not least the American media]</b> You do not have as many game weeks as in England and not the same level as Europe. Sometimes you need a bit of patience. <b>[Punctuality]</b> is not taken so seriously.

  <p><b>[Former Red Devil Bastian Schweinsteiger says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should let <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> leave if he wants to move on]</b> If a player wants to leave the club, you shouldn’t stop him. You need players who are 100 per cent into the club and care about the club, that’s the only way you can survive at the top level and have success. Paul is a great player, he is just looking for a team where he can play the same style that he does with the France national team, so if you give him that kind of team around him, he would be happy at United<br /><br /><b>[United briefly enjoyed an upswing in their form following the sacking of <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> in December]</b> I’m glad they have re-started their team and the way they play. It’s about time because United is a huge club with amazing supporters and they have players in the squad who can really be dangerous. They should play a nice way of football and I really hope that <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> lets the team play to their abilities and as far as I can see, he has done a good job. I would really like to see them win <b>[<a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b>. They have fantastic players, you just need to use them</p>

Many, many thanks for the time we spent together, I will always have a place for you in my heart!</p>

He was always asking me, ‘What’s your friend Thomas doing?’. He would have done us good at United back then. But Thomas was a bit younger, he did not want to leave Munich. Maybe that has changed in the meantime. His situation is different to mine back then. I was playing every game, then Van Gaal contacted me, I wanted to try something new. Thomas has often been on the bench lately, a change of scenery could do him good at the end of his career. He still has great quality<br /><br /><b>[Schweinsteiger said of <a href="niko-kovac.html">Niko Kovac</a>]</b> I like <a href="niko-kovac.html">Niko Kovac</a> and I keep my fingers crossed for him.

  <p><b>[Schweinsteiger backs <a href="mario-gotze.html">Gotze</a> for success after <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> departure]</b> It is very, very unfortunate, I think.
