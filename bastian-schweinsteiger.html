  <p><b>[Bastian Schweinsteiger hit back at <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Franz Beckenbauer</a> who advice him go to easier league such as MLS]</b> I don’t know when <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Beckenbauer</a> moved to America, but I am 30. It is a challenge for me to prove I can do it here, but I am confident I can adjust to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a><br /><br />I had my knee trouble after the World Cup which was very intensive for me and I had a break in October. But I have a lot of experience in big matches and that is an advantage. My style of play is to control a game, so you have to be smart in your brain and fast. I want to make a positive impact and I think I can contribute a lot to the team<br /><br /><b>[Schweinsteiger insists he can add to his trophy haul by winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at United]</b> Absolutely, that is my goal for my time here. I want to win titles and this is what <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is used to and I am the same. I cannot guarantee titles, but I will guarantee that we will do everything to be successful in the season<br /><br />I know the club is looking forward to winning titles again and I am the same. <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> is a big club, but <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are bigger and I can see that. They are the biggest club in the world and I am sure this team has the quality to win titles<br /><br />When I see what we do in training and the quality we have, I am sure we have the chance to win titles. I am convinced about that and I want to add my quality to United’s game<br /><br />I had the chance to come to United in 2010. I thought about what to do because there were opportunities. My goal was always to win the Champions League with my club <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, but now I am happy to be here and so is my brother Tobias. My brother is a huge <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> fan. He is a big <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a> and <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> fan, but it was always also my dream to be a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player<br /><br />I saw the 1999 Champions League final at home. My brother had the United jersey on and I had Bayern. I didn’t cry at the end, but my brother was very happy. I always followed <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and we watched a lot of United games, so this is also a good move for my brother</p>

  <p><b>[Bastien Schweinsteiger speaks about his future]</b> MUFC will be my last club in Europe. I respect other clubs, but <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> was the only one which could make me leave <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. I will be ready if the team needs me. This is all I can say about the current situation. I want to thank the fans for the amazing support over the recent weeks</p>

  <p><b>[Bastian Schweinsteiger reveals the differences he has seen playing in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to his time in Europe]</b> We all know that this league is just not like the <b>[English]</b> <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> or the <b>[German]</b> <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. And, of course, it can be frustrating on the pitch at times when things discussed <b>[in the team meeting]</b> are not implemented or when somebody loses a ball or just does not have an eye for the team-mate. I don’t blame anyone for it, that’s my problem - I need to adapt to the league and cope with those situations. If you compare it to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> or the <b>[Germany]</b> national team, the difference is huge. But I knew what I let myself in for. The league is interesting because it’s evident everyone can beat everyone. And sometimes things happen you just don’t understand. This might be referee decisions or the running paths or passes of a team-mate. It’s different than in Europe, but you have to take things as they are</p>

  <p><b>[Germany legend Bastian Schweinsteiger says he left Manchester United for Chicago Fire in 2017 because he could not imagine playing for another club in Europe]</b> I did not want to go elsewhere in Europe. FC Bayern and Manchester United were the clubs I always wanted to play for.<br /><br /><b>[While he has enjoyed life in the United States, he has also noticed differences with his old life - not least the American media]</b> You do not have as many game weeks as in England and not the same level as Europe. Sometimes you need a bit of patience. <b>[Punctuality]</b> is not taken so seriously. If the meeting starts at 6 o’clock and the last player comes in at 6.10 o’clock in the cabin, that is quite normal<br /><br /><b>[Former team-mates Philipp Lahm and Hasan Salihamidzic have already taken up non-playing roles at the Allianz Arena, but Schweinsteiger says he has not decided what his future holds just yet]</b> I usually do it in the autumn when I decide how to go on. That’s the way it will be. I’m still a player. I really appreciate that Bayern say such things about me. The question is always when, how, and where <b>[he will take the next step in his career]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Former Red Devil Bastian Schweinsteiger says Manchester United should let Paul Pogba leave if he wants to move on]</b> If a player wants to leave the club, you shouldn’t stop him. You need players who are 100 per cent into the club and care about the club, that’s the only way you can survive at the top level and have success. Paul is a great player, he is just looking for a team where he can play the same style that he does with the France national team, so if you give him that kind of team around him, he would be happy at United<br /><br /><b>[United briefly enjoyed an upswing in their form following the sacking of Mourinho in December]</b> I’m glad they have re-started their team and the way they play. It’s about time because United is a huge club with amazing supporters and they have players in the squad who can really be dangerous. They should play a nice way of football and I really hope that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lets the team play to their abilities and as far as I can see, he has done a good job. I would really like to see them win <b>[the Premier League]</b>. They have fantastic players, you just need to use them</p>

He was always asking me, ‘What’s your friend Thomas doing?’. He would have done us good at United back then. But Thomas was a bit younger, he did not want to leave Munich. Maybe that has changed in the meantime. His situation is different to mine back then. I was playing every game, then Van Gaal contacted me, I wanted to try something new. Thomas has often been on the bench lately, a change of scenery could do him good at the end of his career. He still has great quality<br /><br /><b>[Schweinsteiger said of Niko Kovac]</b> I like <a href="niko-kovac.html">Niko Kovac</a> and I keep my fingers crossed for him.
