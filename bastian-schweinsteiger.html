  <p><b>[Bastian Schweinsteiger hit back at <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Franz Beckenbauer</a> who advice him go to easier league such as <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>]</b> I don’t know when <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Beckenbauer</a> moved to America, but I am 30. It is a challenge for me to prove I can do it here, but I am confident I can adjust to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a><br /><br />I had my knee trouble after the World Cup which was very intensive for me and I had a break in October. But I have a lot of experience in big matches and that is an advantage. My style of play is to control a game, so you have to be smart in your brain and fast. I want to make a positive impact and I think I can contribute a lot to the team<br /><br /><b>[Schweinsteiger insists he can add to his trophy haul by winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> at United]</b> Absolutely, that is my goal for my time here. I want to win titles and this is what <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is used to and I am the same. I cannot guarantee titles, but I will guarantee that we will do everything to be successful in the season<br /><br />I know the club is looking forward to winning titles again and I am the same. <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> is a big club, but <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are bigger and I can see that. They are the biggest club in the world and I am sure this team has the quality to win titles<br /><br />When I see what we do in training and the quality we have, I am sure we have the chance to win titles. I am convinced about that and I want to add my quality to United’s game<br /><br />I had the chance to come to United in 2010. I thought about what to do because there were opportunities. My goal was always to win the Champions League with my club <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, but now I am happy to be here and so is my brother Tobias. My brother is a huge <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> fan. He is a big <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a> and <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> fan, but it was always also my dream to be a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player<br /><br />I saw the 1999 Champions League final at home. My brother had the United jersey on and I had <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. I didn’t cry at the end, but my brother was very happy. I always followed <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and we watched a lot of United games, so this is also a good move for my brother</p>

  <p><b>[Bastian Schweinsteiger says he has no doubts that he will be fit to play at Euro 2016]</b> If they don’t change plans and switch the Euros to the beginning of March then everything looks fine. I have 0.0 per cent doubts about playing. A ruptured ligament needs time but everything is healing perfectly. I know my body well, everything will be fine. In about five days I can start running again and five days later I should be able to train with the ball. I will be fully fit in March, I think.<br /><br /><b>[Former Germany and Bayern Munich team-mate Oliver Kahn has also raised his concerns about whether Schweinsteiger is still good enough to earn a place in Low’s star-studded squad]</b> I have played in 27 competitive fixtures this season, despite my ban and my injury. There are a lot of things that can be better but this claim is very far-fetched</p>

  <p><b>[Bastian Schweinsteiger reveals the differences he has seen playing in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to his time in Europe]</b> We all know that this league is just not like the <b>[English]</b> <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> or the <b>[German]</b> <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. And, of course, it can be frustrating on the pitch at times when things discussed <b>[in the team meeting]</b> are not implemented or when somebody loses a ball or just does not have an eye for the team-mate. I don’t blame anyone for it, that’s my problem - I need to adapt to the league and cope with those situations. If you compare it to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> or the <b>[Germany]</b> national team, the difference is huge. But I knew what I let myself in for. The league is interesting because it’s evident everyone can beat everyone. And sometimes things happen you just don’t understand. This might be referee decisions or the running paths or passes of a team-mate. It’s different than in Europe, but you have to take things as they are</p>

  <p><b>[Bastian Schweinsteiger claimed that ending the season without a trophy made his time in Chicago feel incomplete]</b> Last season had some high moments, and also some that maybe did not go the way we all hoped. Our team reached an important milestone by returning to the playoffs. However, our year ended without a trophy, and so it felt incomplete. As a sportsman I can not accept this but with the great support of our fans, I am sure we can create another great season. I love this city. I love this sport. And I love winning. And so, it is with great happiness that I announce my return to the Chicago Fire in 2018. I look forward to another year with my teammates, the staff and, of course, our great fans</p>

Zlatan is a very smart player and he has not only one option, he has always three options in his brain. He is very fast in his brain and in his technique and everything, so it’s going to be tough and we have to play as a team against him.</p>

They really play well, I like watching them a lot and hope it’s going to be a good game for us<br /><br />He’s a great player. For me, he understands the game really well and he’s always a threat for the opponent, and we have to keep an eye on him, definitely. But, also of course they have other players there that are also really good and can decide games<br /><br />I remember once we played with Bayern at United and he made a dive in the last minute because I had a yellow card, and I got a yellow-red card. So the first thing I did when I came to United, I thanked him again for that. Off the field we played golf with each other, that was always fun. We had a good time in Manchester</p>

I remember the semi-final we lost 4-0 at home. He was the best, so difficult to stop<br /><br />I remember perfectly the first time, in 2003, at the Bernabeu. I came on in the second half and played against Zidane, who scored a good goal five minutes later. They won 1-0. Playing against Zizou helped me a lot later because I watched how he moved and protected the ball. It was impossible to replicate it though, yet I did learn a lot from those things</p>

Paul is a great player, he is just looking for a team where he can play the same style that he does with the France national team, so if you give him that kind of team around him, he would be happy at United<br /><br /><b>[United briefly enjoyed an upswing in their form following the sacking of <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> in December]</b> I’m glad they have re-started their team and the way they play.
