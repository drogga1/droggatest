  <p><b>[USWNT vs Chile women. Tobin Heath is certainly predicting a more complicated affair]</b> I think they’re a great opponent. I think its incredible what they’ve been able to accomplish in such of short period of time that they’ve been around. South American teams are difficult to break down. They play the game, see the game a little bit different than what we’re used to, so we have to be ready for anything and know that they’re capable of hurting us and understand that we have to bring our A game.</p>

  <p><b>[USA women’s national team winger Tobin Heath has said her side has been waiting their ‘whole lives’ for an opportunity like the one they will get against France]</b> This is a game that we’ve been looking forward to our whole lives. It’s a privilege to be able to play a host country in a host nation, because it’s just that much bigger and these are the type of games that we love.<br /><br /><b>[on Amandine Henry]</b> She’s fantastic, I consider her one of the best players in the world. It was amazing to play alongside her. She’s a natural leader and I think it’s shown a lot during this World Cup. They’re lucky to have her as their captain</p>

  <p><b>[Tobin Heath believes the United States Women’s World Cup win over the Netherlands can be a springboard for their equal pay fight]</b> We’ve been fighting for this for a long time as a team and to be on this platform on the world stage and to hear the stadium chanting for it, it was a really, really powerful moment. I hope that causes change. It’s really cool to be not just winning and fighting for things on the field, but fighting for things off the field and doing so in a way through sport I think is really powerful. I think it’s just the start of something massive and culture-changing. Unless we get to the final and obviously win the final, maybe that chant isn’t being chanted. So I think in a lot of ways, this team has been kind of, I guess you could call it synchro-destiny with this fight for equal pay and I think it’s our responsibility and it’s something that we love to do.<br /><br /><b>[Some worried the non-football related headlines she was grabbing could have a negative impact on this team]</b> We’ve got to celebrate these great, great sports moments and she had a fantastic tournament. She’s an incredible player. Alex Morgan had a fantastic tournament, <a href="rose-lavelle.html">Rose Lavelle</a> had a fantastic tournament. It’s these special moments that only the World Cup brings around so we didn’t need to celebrate our teammates, they did wonderful<br /><br /><b>[Speaking more about Rapinoe’s impact]</b> She’s a fantastic leader for us both on and off the field and I think she’s really led with a lot of grace and by action too. It’s not easy to speak up and then also to follow it up by action but she’s done it so well, especially in this tournament, to stay focused and motivated at the task at hand but also be fighting a parallel fight as well. It’s kind of synonymous with the US women’s national team, you know. We fight to win games and we fight for things off the field too. But to see the momentum that this tournament has kind of pushed forth with all of those is just fantastic<br /><br /><b>[The victory also answered a lot of critics who questioned coach Jill Ellis and also the team]</b> To be able to say <b>[we are]</b> world champions, I think <b>[that]</b> is the only thing that you can say against critics in a lot of ways. This team has been through so much, from 2015 to 2016 to now. It’s incredible and it speaks volumes to this group and to kind of the resilience of this group and the players that have been a big part of the last however many years in order to bring this team and keep this team at the top. It’s not easy, especially in this generation of football where more and more teams are competitive. You saw this in the tournament. For us to still remain where we are I think is a testament to the determination and the hard work that goes in every single day with these players and with the staff</p>
