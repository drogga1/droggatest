  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> Boss <a href="ciro-ferrara.html">Ciro Ferrara</a> Appointed As Italy Under-21 Coach]</b> <a href="ciro-ferrara.html">Ciro Ferrara</a> is the new coach of the national Under-21 side.

  <p><b>[Napoli’s appointment of Carlo Ancelotti is akin to signing Leo Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Getting Ancelotti is like signing Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. He will bring the kind of balance that is needed in a city that at times can get a bit swept up in events. Napoli lost the title because they lacked balance. The Azzurri were never inferior to Juventus, but they dropped points along the way and those who have experience of these phases in a campaign know those are the points that prove decisive in the long run. I’m sure Carlo will be able to handle the pressure and keep everyone motivated in an environment that can lose its way in a flood of enthusiasm. He can adapt to any circumstances and will bring new ideas not just on the pitch, but also in dealing with the fans and media. In that sense, I really think Ancelotti can make a big difference, because we all know at Napoli they get very excited and then very depressed. The important thing is that Carlo came to Napoli to win, not just to do well</p>

  <p><b>[AC Milan continue to be linked with a move to bring Zlatan Ibrahimovic back onto their books]</b> I think AC Milan should definitely sign him. You always have more solutions when you have Ibra in your team<br /><br />Maldini? I like to see him back in the world of football. It was a pity to see him out. He is a winner and he will try to do something positive for the club</p>
