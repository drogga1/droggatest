<blockquote>
  <p>[Former Arsenal star Jimmy Carter thinks that Mesut Ozil looks ‘disinterested’ but he wants Unai Emery to continue his rebuild and include <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> target <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Lucas Torreira</a> in his plans] If he was honest, Ozil would know that his season last season was way below the level he should be. He has to either be moved on or he needs to step up next season and show he is a top player in Europe. You need some creativity in there, Ozil has to be moved on as he looks disinterested. At the moment, he is not showing that [he is interested]. If I was the manager and got offered good money for him, then I would take it straight away.<br /><br />I grew up an Arsenal fan. They have massive rebuilding problems. They need to recruit and recruit well. They have problems at the back, Sokratis and <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Mustafi</a> are not good enough and need to go and Monreal is not a centre-half. He is a decent left back at best. Centre-back needs addressing. Midfield needs strengthening as losing Aaron Ramsey is complete madness to Juventus. <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Torreira</a>, give him another chance; he is decent and tenacious. <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> is very inconsistent. I don’t think he is good enough for Arsenal.<br /><br /><a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a> and <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> are brilliant and without their goals, I don’t know where Arsenal would be. For me though, I defend Unai Emery as he did a decent job last season apart from the defending in the Europa League final. It just shows how far they are behind. There’s a rebuilding programme at Arsenal that needs to happen. The recruitment needs to be spot on or they are in trouble.<br /><br />[Carter hopes <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Lucas Torreira</a> resists his opportunity to play at the <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> next season] I don’t think it was a perfect season for <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Torreira</a>. He started the season very well but he seemed to tire as it went on. He has the World Cup so I think that took its toll later on in the season for him. I think what you get with <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Torreira</a> is that he sticks his foot in, makes it difficult for the opposition and he is going to be tenacious. That’s what you get from him, he isn’t going to create a lot but he scored a great goal in the North London derby. He is not the most creative player. I would give him another year unless he is really unsettled and he wants to move to <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>. If he tells Unai Emery he wants to go back to Italy then Arsenal could let him go but then he would need replacing. You can’t sell everyone</p>
