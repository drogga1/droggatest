  <p><b>[Udinese were extremely close to losing their Italian international Gaetano D’Agostino in the summer just gone]</b> I have no regrets for not having gone to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. I am in Udine, which is my home. So it’s good to still be here. I have a clear conscience<br /><br />I would describe our performance <b>[against Inter]</b>, as very beautiful. We were disappointed not to take any points away from the match, but we can hold our heads high.

  <p><b>[Udinese midfielder Gaetano D’Agostino is looking forward to returning to his hometown this Sunday when the Zebrette travel to Palermo]</b> For me it is an extra stimulus to play in that stadium and in that city. Who knows, maybe when I retire I will be wearing the Rosanero shirt. Right now, I’m an Udinese player, Palermo is my town, but I want to do well in Friuli</p>

  <p><b>[Fiorentina midfielder Gaetano D’Agostino is looking forward to the upcoming clash with Milan at <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> and touched on his fitness as well as the constant comparisons to Andrea Pirlo]</b> I’m ready. Maybe I don’t have 90 minutes in my legs yet, but the coach <b>[<a href="sinisa-mihajlovic.html">Sinisa Mihajlovic</a>]</b> will decide. I must thank him because he is managing the situation very well. <b>[Pirlo]</b> has won everything, we are different. I can assure you he is one of the few players in the world who can really make a difference. Yes, he has something more than I do<br /><br /><b>[He also commented on the Italian national team and took a swipe at <a href="cesare-prandelli.html">Cesare Prandelli</a>’s decision to call up Lazio’s Argentine-born playmaker Cristian Ledesma]</b> I will just say one thing: players born in a country should play for their own country. Anyway, I root for them. Give me time to get back into shape and I will compete fiercely</p>
