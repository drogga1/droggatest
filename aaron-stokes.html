<blockquote>
  <p><a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> has already had a crack … but now it could be the turn of UFC superstar <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> when it comes to facing the formidable <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Floyd Mayweather</a> in the boxing ring<br /><br /><a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>’s dad has surprisingly accepted an informal offer from <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Floyd Mayweather</a> which would see the two fighters clash in the boxing ring<br /><br />But talk of a sensational cross-sport match-up has since gone cold. But Khabib’s father, Abdulmanap, has now given his son the green light to go ahead and fight <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Mayweather</a>, who has been in retirement since fighting <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> in 2017. However, not until the ‘Eagle’ has fought <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a>.<br /><br />Over the summer, Khabib’s manager <a href="ali-abdelaziz.html">Ali Abdelaziz</a> claimed <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Mayweather</a> - who is nicknamed ‘Money’ - needed the fight due to being short of cash<br /><br />It’s unlikely that <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Mayweather</a> will be short of cash, however. The unbeaten boxer is worth between $700m (£544m) and $1bn (£780m) following his stellar and high-profile career. And <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Mayweather</a> reportedly earned $9m (£7m) for his farcical bout with Tenshin Nasukawa on New Year’s Eve</p>

  <p><a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are still keen on <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a>, despite going all out to sign <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> this month. The Red Devils have made no secret of their desire to bring the Portuguese star to Old Trafford before the end of the January window. United’s interest in Fernandes has led to talk of Maddison or <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> joining the club die down. But the Independent report <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s side remain interested in the <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> playmaker. Maddison is a United fan and is said to be a major summer target as the struggling <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> side look for future stars<br /><br />Club legend <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> has already backed his former side to sign Maddison. But <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> are keen to hold on to the England star, and will no doubt make any transfer suitors pay a premium for his services. Maddison has enjoyed a solid season, with the Foxes looking nailed on to secure Champions League football this season. The 23-year-old has scored six league goals this term, chipping in with three assists<br /><br />This month United continue to go full throttle towards a bid for Sporting Lisbon man Fernandes. The two clubs remain way off with their respective valuations, which has led to a stalemate. Sporting continue to hold out for £68m as they plan for life without their star man. United, on the other hand, don’t want to pay more than £51m in a deal which would see £42.5m paid up front<br /><br />The Sun claim there has been no change in either club’s stance since the weekend. United co-chairman Joel Glazer is said to be the man responsible for the structure of the Red Devils’ offer as the American businessman simply doesn’t think Fernandes is worth what Sporting are asking for. Fernandes is said to want a move to the Old Trafford outfit. And the attacking midfielder looked incredibly unhappy as he stormed down the tunnel after Sporting’s cup clash with Braga this week.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> are ready to make a loan offer for Hull attacker Jarrod Bowen which could see them buy the player outright if they achieve promotion to the Premier League<br /><br />Hull continue to price Jarrod Bowen out of a move to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but a switch to Championship side <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> could be on the cards. <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> and <a href="marcelo-bielsa.html">Marcelo Bielsa</a>’s side are all chasing the attacker, who has 18 months remaining on his current deal. Hull don’t want to lose their star man and have slapped a £28m price tag on his head<br /><br />The Championship outfit are also open to a £3m loan deal, with an option to buy the player outright for £25m in the summer. <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> are happy with the temporary part of that offer but are only prepared to pay £15m for Bowen’s services if they get promoted this term<br /><br />The Whites sit second in the league at present but have struggled in recent weeks as the chasing pack close on the automatic promotion spots. <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> will be hoping to beat their <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> rivals to Bowen in the coming days.<br /><br />And Hull boss <a href="grant-mccann.html">Grant McCann</a> hinted an exit could be in the offing</p>
