  <p><b>[The 15-year-old, now at Derby County, has already lived through extremes: from winning a skills title at Manchester United Soccer School aged six, to being without a club for 10 months due to a fall-out between his father, Glen, and Aston Villa]</b> No other lad has been through what I’ve been through over the last eight years.</p>

  <p><b>[On Zak Brunt. Michael Calvin said]</b> We’re dealing with very young lives, with immature bodies and half-formed characters and it’s not something football can take lightly.<br /><br />It makes me think, ‘what is football doing to our kids?’. Is it worth the fractured families I’ve found? Is it worth the blighted lives it can create? Is it worth the almost full commoditisation of childhood? Football has got a huge duty of care, but I don’t think the game has applied that with due attention. Safeguarding has improved exponentially, but there is still massive exploitation. What is the cost of the dream? We’ve got vulnerable children and concerned parents, is football doing the right thing by them? I suppose as questions like these multiply, I hope the book can be a catalyst for that kind of debate<br /><br />Football, like life to an extent, is not Walt Disney. There is good and bad. If there’s a common thread through the book, I hope it’s the humanity of the subject. We can cherish the dream and celebrate achievements, but please - we need to protect the innocent. I really hope that everybody learns to see the child and not the player. That is an important start</p>
