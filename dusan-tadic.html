  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic has signed a new contract with Ajax that includes an agreement to stay on as a coach at the Dutch club after he retires]</b> We have had a great season, but I have been very happy here from the moment I joined this special club. I think everything here is great. I have a good relationship with the fans, the staff, the players and everyone who works for the club. It’s great when a club offers you such a contract. It is a motivation for me to show even more. It also gives me more responsibility and I love that. I want to start as a coach after my career. We will see when that will be, we will do it step by step. At the moment I still feel great, that’s the most important thing.<br /><br />One day I want to start my career as a coach at Ajax. I think there is no better place to start than here. I love the philosophy of Ajax and the way of thinking. That was also the reason for me to play football here. I think about football in the same way that I think about football. I hope that if I become a coach in a few years, my team will play as Ajax does</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax attacker Dusan Tadic believes his side were robbed of victory in their dramatic 4-4 draw with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> due to referee Gianluca Rocchi’s ‘destructive’ performance]</b> We were much better. We should just talk about our game because we had 4-1 and everything was under control and then one man steals everything from us. Big disappointment, because we should just talk about <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and how we play nice football, but we cannot because one guy came and stole everything. We saw a situation where there’s a foul on <a href="daley-blind.html">Daley Blind</a>, then it’s not second yellow for <a href="daley-blind.html">Daley Blind</a>, then it’s not second yellow for Joel Veltman, then it’s not a penalty. I have never in my life seen triple punishment, never. But everything starts with a foul on <a href="daley-blind.html">Daley Blind</a>, he was tackled by <b>[Christian]</b> <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a> I think. It’s a big disappointment. I don’t like to make excuses, I don’t like to talk about other people. We should just be talking about how <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> played much better than <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> but we cannot because somebody destroyed our game</p>
