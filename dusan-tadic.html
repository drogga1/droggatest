  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic thinks that James Ward-Prowse is ready to be a key player for Southampton]</b> He is a big talent, big English talent. He is a very good guy. He has a good mentality and works hard every day. He has the qualities to be a very, very important player for Southampton and be a top player <b>[for England]</b>. He takes good corners and free-kicks. He sees things before others. He can play one-or-two touches and he can be dangerous in a good team. We have a nice academy <b>[to create players like Ward-Prowse]</b> and a good training ground. Southampton have all the advantages to create good players, when you compare it to Serbia, Southampton has the better facilities. They can produce a player who is much more ready.<br /><br />He is a very nice guy. As a football player, he is a very good striker who knows how to score goals. He smells where the goal is. He knows how to play good football and so far to play with him is very, very nice. We have a good connection and with time, it will get better and better. He finished very good chances. He has a very good left foot and knows how to score goals. Everything he shoots is a goal and for us that’s very good<br /><br />We have had our ups and downs this season, this is normal because our team is young. I think in the last three games we have found our system and are playing in our best positions. I think in the last four games we have played very well. We scored eight goals in two Premier League games and against Manchester United we played in the final and we deserved much more. We are happy with how things are going and expect, with time, that things will get better and better. I am happy, you have ups and downs, it depends how the team plays. If your team plays well, then I play well. If not then it is harder for me. I think we are back to our best. I am in my best position in the middle of the 4-2-3-1. It is easier for me to play there and you can see with our statistics and goals that we are much more dangerous. It has been a joy to play in recently</p>

  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic believes that Serbia have the fighting spirit required to qualify for the World Cup]</b> The reaction to me playing on with a broken nose was very nice! That is the positive part of being Serbian - we don’t have so many facilities in Serbia and everything for young players, but what they teach you in Serbia is to be tough. When I was younger, all my coaches taught me to be tough and it doesn’t matter what happens, whether you broke your leg or something else, you know you need to fight for your team. This is a very good thing in football. They teach you to be tough.<br /><br />I am in my best form for my country because of the coach. Slavoljub Muslin has given me a lot of freedom and he has put me in the right position so I can make the difference. I appreciate that and I am ready to give my best in training and out of training for him. I know that I can bring goals and assists, and the coach requires that. He is trying to put me in those dangerous situations for the other team, so I can show my qualities. I think that our chances are very good. We are confident, we are playing well with the right players and Muslin is making everyone sharp. We are happy and hopeful about going to the World Cup and we are doing everything to achieve that<br /><br />Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldinho were my favourite footballers. Zidane was elegant, his movement was perfect, everything he did was perfect. It was a joy to watch him. Ronaldinho, him and Ronaldo were my heroes. They were the first to do some nice tricks and this sticks in your mind. They were on a different level and everyone enjoyed that and I tried to watch them play a lot. They were at the very top level. I always tried to do some of their skills, it was fun.<br /><br />We have the cliche that we are a very powerful national physically but it is true that we don’t have the best structure. It is hard for players to make it, especially compared to England - their youth players have everything they need to make it. If we had this in Serbia then that would be great, but this is normal and you have to fight for yourself. I think it is very hard to break through as an attacking midfielder in Serbia, it is easier to succeed as a defender than as an offensive midfielder because there are a lot of players and they expect you to make defence and, if you don’t make an assist in 50 minutes, it is a crisis or something like that. This is normal. I played with a lot of big talents and good players but you had to fight for yourself to succeed and that’s the only way you can be. I always liked sport and I played football all day. I liked to play basketball and tennis too, I enjoyed a lot of different activities</p>

  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic regards Chelsea’s Nemanja Matic as a key player in Serbia’s World Cup qualification campaign]</b> Nemanja has been at the top of the game for a long time. He is important for them <b>[Chelsea]</b>, also they have a great coach and you can see that they have a great mentality and good qualities. I am very happy for him because he is a good guy and player. He is very important <b>[for us]</b> because he is one of the best at his position and we are happy to have him. The title race is still open but I think Chelsea have the will do it. I think they have enough experience not to throw away eight points, along with Matic’s qualities of course! They have a good coach, Antonio Conte has tried to find the best season for them and after Arsenal they changed to 3-4-3 and that’s the biggest difference and with the players they have … they are one of the best in the league<br /><br /><b>[On Aleksandar Kolorov]</b> I am not surprised <b>[he has moved to centre back]</b> because he has the qualities to play there. He is a smart player and he is quality. Guardiola likes a left footed player to play there and he likes to play from the back and Alexander Kolorov is very good at that. He has a beautiful left foot and he can give good passes between the lines but still defends well, so I am not surprised about that. He can play everything but for us he plays a very important role in the 3-4-3. He plays on the left-hand side and it is a good position for him, too. He has played well there in the past and all good players can play in many positions<br /><br /><b>[On Marko Grujic]</b> I know him very well, he is a good boy with a good mentality. I think he needs time because everything has happened to him <b>[in the past year]</b>. He played just one season with Red Star and then he went to Liverpool and he needs the time to adapt. For sure, Liverpool will bring good qualities into him. We will see what happens in the future but I believe in him. He just needs to work hard every day and his qualities will come out on the pitch. You can see other players with more experience than him that have struggled in the Premier League. He is still a young player and, for him, this situation is normal. The Premier League is the hardest league in the world. If you go to another league it is easier but this league is hard to adapt to. There’s a lot of contact so I think that it is different from everything else</p>

  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic believes Virgil van Dijk will achieve anything he wants in the game as long as he remains calm]</b> He is a very good player. I have known him for a long time. We played for Groningen together and he was coming from the youth system there. I know him from that time, now he has improved a lot. Back then, you could see that he would become a very good player and we have missed him a lot <b>[in the past few months]</b>. I hope he can recover quickly and that he will keep playing how he was playing. I am not surprised <b>[that big teams want Van Dijk]</b>. There are not so many choices <b>[for top defenders]</b>. He is a very good player and I hope he will recover well and keep playing well for Southampton. I think he is a clever boy and that he needs to be calm and work on recovering and then everything will come into place. You need to be professional and then everything that he wishes will happen.<br /><br /><b>[On Graziano Pelle]</b> I miss him a lot. He was an important player on the pitch and we are very close. I just wish him the best because he is a very good guy. Yes, I think I understand him, he had a fantastic offer and he wanted to finish and take that situation. Everyone needs to assess their situation and that’s it. Everyone makes a move for a reason. I think football in China will improve, it is a big project but they are going to need to buy a lot more players to catch up with Europe</p>

  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic hails €100m man Milinkovic-Savic amid Man Utd rumours]</b> He is a good player, he is young. He can learn a lot of things but he has a big talent. He has the capacity to go far. That’s it. He is the future of Serbian football. I say to him to just be calm and work smart and he does. He needs to work for his team and then after he can show his qualities. I think he is a clever guy. He is a good boy and he just needs to keep his head calm <b>[due to ongoing rumours]</b>. There is a big future for him<br /><br />Yes, it is probably going to be like that. Brazil <b>[and]</b> one other. They are one of the favourites for the title. One more team as well as them will probably go through. Normally when we play against Brazil, we will just try to stop them from winning. We will see, it is difficult to beat everybody, not just Brazil. I think we are a good team but the problem is that sometimes we need to be more smart. More intelligent, more experienced. We showed that today … We need to show it in the next game also. Before the Costa Rica game, we said this was the biggest game but now we say the next is biggest. We have to go step by step, it is as simple as that<br /><br />It was a very important achievement. It was a tough time. It was difficult but this was the first time that I was in this kind of situation. I am happy because Southampton is a huge club and shouldn’t go down</p>

  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic has no doubt that he made the right decision in leaving Southampton for Ajax]</b> I’m really happy to be here, because I’m playing with good players and the philosophy of the club is beautiful. That is the most important thing. If you find the click, you can play lovely football and then it doesn’t matter what they say about you. I’m really happy with the <b>[Champions League]</b> draw, we have a big chance to go through to the next round. It will be difficult and I don’t think in terms of percentages, but second place is certainly possible. I’m excited about every game, but not just in that competition. Our focus must be on every game that we play, or else we’ll lose points in the Eredivisie.<br /><br />My family would pick Amsterdam over England every day. It’s a beautiful city. There’s nothing I don’t like about this place. Netherlands is a way better place to live in than England. They only have London, but here it’s different. Everything is clean and there are nice roads, streets and bars here. It’s something special<br /><br />On the field we rotate a lot and it makes it difficult to mark us. Therefore it’s good to have David back on the field. He really understands the game well. He is extremely fast and sharp. He has a real bright future ahead of him. I’m sure he will have a great career. Those who understand football really do see that <b>[Ziyech and I]</b> like to play together and constantly look for each other</p>

  <p><b>[Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt will suit everyone]</b> It is not strange for me to see the young players without fear. It is in the Ajax DNA. They don’t care about pressure. I really like the philosophy. We always dominate and we don’t care if we are home or away. We always play our football, this is our biggest strength. The only problem is that if you don’t try things or take risks, then the coach will say something. Even if you make mistakes, they want you to play and enjoy it. De Ligt is 19, De Jong is 21, but they think like a 30-year-old. Their brains are amazing. Their mentality is complete. You cannot buy this. I have never seen it in my life. They will suit everyone. They have everything in their game<br /><br />It’s not good to have 11 young players and it’s not good to have 11 old players. You need to have a mix. Both can learn from each other. In the past few years, Ajax didn’t have so much success but had a lot of possibilities and young players. They have made a very good project and you see what is happening now. They have invested a lot and got everything back</p>

  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic hailed Erik ten Hag]</b> I have a contract here and I enjoy it. We’re working on the future, so I’m not thinking about that right now. He was very important. He did a great job. He wants to improve us every day, he wants to help us. I think he also told his team with <b>[Alfred Schreuder]</b>, with Richard <b>[Witschge]</b>, with Aaron <b>[Winter]</b>, with Carlo <b>[l’Ami]</b>, with Bjorn <b>[Rekelhof]</b> and also a lot of compliments to our medical staff also, they did great to keep us fit. And also like all coaches they did amazing for us because they want to make us better. What is the biggest thing about Erik I think is his fanaticism and that he wants to improve us every day and he really likes football and this is really great for players because always they want to help you improve<br /><br />It was an amazing season in the Champions League for me and for the team. This is the most important thing because we did everything as a team and then everyone showed themselves in a bigger part and everything and yes, I think Ajax is the highlight of all the Champions League and everyone is talking about Ajax</p>

  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic feels that <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> ‘deserved’ to reach the Champions League final over <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> It had been a while since <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> won the double. This was a fantastic season, we became increasingly hungry. <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> made the Champions League exciting. We deserved to play the final.<br /><br />You know, when I’m disappointed, I like to cry. Surrendering yourself to the emotion. Then you get it all out of your body. When I got home, I turned on some sad Serbian music and sat on the couch. Then I went to bed. I think I seriously didn’t cry for an hour that night. When I saw my children the next morning, that also helped</p>

I think everything here is great. I have a good relationship with the fans, the staff, the players and everyone who works for the club. It’s great when a club offers you such a contract. It is a motivation for me to show even more. It also gives me more responsibility and I love that. I want to start as a coach after my career.

At the moment I still feel great, that’s the most important thing.<br /><br />One day I want to start my career as a coach at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. I think there is no better place to start than here. I love the philosophy of <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and the way of thinking. That was also the reason for me to play football here.
