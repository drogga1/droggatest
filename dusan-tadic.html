  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic hails €100m man Milinkovic-Savic amid Man Utd rumours]</b> He is a good player, he is young. He can learn a lot of things but he has a big talent. He has the capacity to go far. That’s it. He is the future of Serbian football. I say to him to just be calm and work smart and he does. He needs to work for his team and then after he can show his qualities. I think he is a clever guy. He is a good boy and he just needs to keep his head calm <b>[due to ongoing rumours]</b>. There is a big future for him<br /><br />Yes, it is probably going to be like that. Brazil <b>[and]</b> one other. They are one of the favourites for the title. One more team as well as them will probably go through. Normally when we play against Brazil, we will just try to stop them from winning. We will see, it is difficult to beat everybody, not just Brazil. I think we are a good team but the problem is that sometimes we need to be more smart. More intelligent, more experienced. We showed that today … We need to show it in the next game also. Before the Costa Rica game, we said this was the biggest game but now we say the next is biggest. We have to go step by step, it is as simple as that<br /><br />It was a very important achievement. It was a tough time. It was difficult but this was the first time that I was in this kind of situation. I am happy because Southampton is a huge club and shouldn’t go down</p>

  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic has no doubt that he made the right decision in leaving Southampton for Ajax]</b> I’m really happy to be here, because I’m playing with good players and the philosophy of the club is beautiful. That is the most important thing. If you find the click, you can play lovely football and then it doesn’t matter what they say about you. I’m really happy with the <b>[Champions League]</b> draw, we have a big chance to go through to the next round. It will be difficult and I don’t think in terms of percentages, but second place is certainly possible. I’m excited about every game, but not just in that competition. Our focus must be on every game that we play, or else we’ll lose points in the Eredivisie.<br /><br />My family would pick Amsterdam over England every day. It’s a beautiful city. There’s nothing I don’t like about this place. Netherlands is a way better place to live in than England. They only have London, but here it’s different. Everything is clean and there are nice roads, streets and bars here. It’s something special<br /><br />On the field we rotate a lot and it makes it difficult to mark us. Therefore it’s good to have David back on the field. He really understands the game well. He is extremely fast and sharp. He has a real bright future ahead of him. I’m sure he will have a great career. Those who understand football really do see that <b>[Ziyech and I]</b> like to play together and constantly look for each other</p>

  <p><b>[Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt will suit everyone]</b> It is not strange for me to see the young players without fear. It is in the Ajax DNA. They don’t care about pressure. I really like the philosophy. We always dominate and we don’t care if we are home or away. We always play our football, this is our biggest strength. The only problem is that if you don’t try things or take risks, then the coach will say something. Even if you make mistakes, they want you to play and enjoy it. De Ligt is 19, De Jong is 21, but they think like a 30-year-old. Their brains are amazing. Their mentality is complete. You cannot buy this. I have never seen it in my life. They will suit everyone. They have everything in their game<br /><br />It’s not good to have 11 young players and it’s not good to have 11 old players. You need to have a mix. Both can learn from each other. In the past few years, Ajax didn’t have so much success but had a lot of possibilities and young players. They have made a very good project and you see what is happening now. They have invested a lot and got everything back</p>

  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic hailed Erik ten Hag]</b> I have a contract here and I enjoy it. We’re working on the future, so I’m not thinking about that right now. He was very important. He did a great job. He wants to improve us every day, he wants to help us. I think he also told his team with <b>[Alfred Schreuder]</b>, with Richard <b>[Witschge]</b>, with Aaron <b>[Winter]</b>, with Carlo <b>[l’Ami]</b>, with Bjorn <b>[Rekelhof]</b> and also a lot of compliments to our medical staff also, they did great to keep us fit. And also like all coaches they did amazing for us because they want to make us better. What is the biggest thing about Erik I think is his fanaticism and that he wants to improve us every day and he really likes football and this is really great for players because always they want to help you improve<br /><br />It was an amazing season in the Champions League for me and for the team. This is the most important thing because we did everything as a team and then everyone showed themselves in a bigger part and everything and yes, I think Ajax is the highlight of all the Champions League and everyone is talking about Ajax</p>

  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic feels that <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> ‘deserved’ to reach the Champions League final over <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> It had been a while since <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> won the double. This was a fantastic season, we became increasingly hungry. <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> made the Champions League exciting. We deserved to play the final.<br /><br />You know, when I’m disappointed, I like to cry. Surrendering yourself to the emotion. Then you get it all out of your body. When I got home, I turned on some sad Serbian music and sat on the couch. Then I went to bed. I think I seriously didn’t cry for an hour that night. When I saw my children the next morning, that also helped</p>

  <p><b>[Dusan Tadic has signed a new contract with <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> that includes an agreement to stay on as a coach at the Dutch club after he retires]</b> We have had a great season, but I have been very happy here from the moment I joined this special club. I think everything here is great. I have a good relationship with the fans, the staff, the players and everyone who works for the club. It’s great when a club offers you such a contract. It is a motivation for me to show even more. It also gives me more responsibility and I love that. I want to start as a coach after my career. We will see when that will be, we will do it step by step. At the moment I still feel great, that’s the most important thing.<br /><br />One day I want to start my career as a coach at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. I think there is no better place to start than here. I love the philosophy of <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and the way of thinking. That was also the reason for me to play football here. I think about football in the same way that I think about football. I hope that if I become a coach in a few years, my team will play as <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> does</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> attacker Dusan Tadic believes his side were robbed of victory in their dramatic 4-4 draw with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> due to referee Gianluca Rocchi’s ‘destructive’ performance]</b> We were much better. We should just talk about our game because we had 4-1 and everything was under control and then one man steals everything from us. Big disappointment, because we should just talk about <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and how we play nice football, but we cannot because one guy came and stole everything. We saw a situation where there’s a foul on <a href="daley-blind.html">Daley Blind</a>, then it’s not second yellow for <a href="daley-blind.html">Daley Blind</a>, then it’s not second yellow for Joel Veltman, then it’s not a penalty.

But everything starts with a foul on <a href="daley-blind.html">Daley Blind</a>, he was tackled by <b>[Christian]</b> <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a> I think. It’s a big disappointment. I don’t like to make excuses, I don’t like to talk about other people.
