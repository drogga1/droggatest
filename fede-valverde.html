  <p><b>[Valverde says I’ll learn a lot from <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> if he comes to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>? I live quietly. I try to enjoy it when I put on this shirt. If in the future he has to come obviously I’m going to learn a lot from him as a player. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> has supported me even when I didn’t have any minutes. He has given me the confidence and assurance. He’s uniting us a team</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="diego-simeone.html">Diego Simeone</a> has said that Fede Valverde did the right thing in fouling <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Alvaro Morata</a> when the striker was clean through on goal in the Spanish Super Cup final between <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>]</b> My colleagues have supported me. It was sad. If I showed it (MVP award) to everyone it would be uncomfortable. I held it. I was very angry that I left the team with one less. But they supported me, which is something very nice. I want to recognize <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>, who also came over and said some words that I won’t say. But I want to highlight it because nobody does it.</p>

It’s something you train for, you work for, you fight for, to have good results. Things are working out well. I’m getting minutes on the pitch, playing, the team is winning. It’s fantastic. I’m enjoying every minute of my life, an amazing time. As well as winning titles with the team, I am also going to become a father. So many positive things are happening and I’m trying my best to enjoy them</p>
