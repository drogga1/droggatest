  <p><b>[LA Galaxy condemn ‘racist and violent’ posts from <a href="aleksander-katai.html">Katai</a>’s wife]</b> Earlier today, the LA Galaxy were made aware of a series of racist and violent social media posts by Tea <a href="aleksander-katai.html">Katai</a>, the wife of LA Galaxy midfielder <a href="aleksander-katai.html">Aleksandar Katai</a>. The LA Galaxy strongly condemned the social posts and requested their immediate removal. The LA Galaxy stands firmly against racism of any kind, including that which suggests violence or seeks to demean the efforts of those in pursuit of racial equality. The LA Galaxy stand with communities of color, and especially the Black community, in the protests and fight against systemic racism, social inequality, bigotry and violence. The LA Galaxy will hold a meeting with <a href="aleksander-katai.html">Katai</a> on Thursday, June 4 and will determine next steps. Now is the time to reflect on our role in helping fight racism in our community</p>
