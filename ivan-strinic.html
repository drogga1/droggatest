  <p><b>[Ivan Strinic has confirmed that he will be joining AC Milan on a three-year contract this summer]</b> The season is now over, so I can say that I am no longer a Sampdoria player and I have signed a three-year contract with Milan. I think the club will announce it after the World Cup. Being left out by Sampdoria? When you have a contract that’s expiring in two months, a club can do one of two things. They can concentrate on getting the most out of you for the time left, or they can decide not to play you anymore. So I played only three games in the second half of the season, Milan wanted me and said they didn’t care that I would not play much for the rest of the season. The fact they wanted me anyway is a good thing<br /><br />Even as kid, I never supported any foreign club, only Hajduk. But of course I liked some clubs more than others and Milan was definitely one of those. While I was growing up and started playing football, Milan was the best club in Europe and I loved players such as <b>[Clarence]</b> Seedorf, <b>[Paolo]</b> Maldini, <b>[Andrea]</b> Pirlo, Cafu. It is an honour and privilege to be part of such a club’s history. It was not easy for Milan this season to change almost their entire squad, it takes time and hopefully we’ll do better next season. Although this one was not so bad either as we qualified for the Europa League</p>

  <p><b>[New AC Milan signing Ivan Strinic will step away from professional football for an indeterminate period after a heart problem was detected]</b> AC Milan inform that during routine medical tests, carried out on all professional athletes in Italy, it was found that Ivan Strinic suffers from the beginnings of hypertrophy in the cardiac muscle which will need further tests following a rest period. The player must therefore suspend temporarily all competitive sporting activity until the follow-up exams have been completed.</p>
