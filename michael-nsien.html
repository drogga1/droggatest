<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Tulsa Roughnecks coach Michael Nsien, who as the only black coach in the USL Championship was highest-ranking black coach in pro soccer prior to Fraser’s hiring, told Goal before the season]</b> I think as coaches we always put a lot of pressure on ourselves, and the job comes with a lot of pressure. But I’m also sensitive to what that means to other people like me. I feel the pressure that I need to do well for my own career to keep going but also for other guys to get more opportunities. Some friends have been pretty direct about that, saying, ‘Hey, we need you to do well. People need to see a guy like you achieving and players relating to you because that’ll open up doors for other people’.<br /><br />One of the most difficult parts for me to say is that there’s no mentors. That’s one difficult part about being a minority coach. There are a couple of guys in England where I’ve followed some of their work, but there hasn’t been anyone to lean on in terms of: How did they get where they’re at? What are some of the challenges they faced as minorities? I wouldn’t use the term racism right away, but I’d say relationships. People tend to look out for friends or people in their network, and improving the network of minorities is an important thing</p>
