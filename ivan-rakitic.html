<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ivan Rakitic on how he got together with his wife]</b> It’s a love story worthy of Hollywood. I went back to the club hotel after dinner with the sporting director. I knew the following day I had a medical, a meeting with the president and the contract <b>[signing]</b>, so I was nervous and didn’t want to sleep. So I went to the hotel bar with my brother for a coffee. The woman who is now my wife was serving. There were still four days left in the transfer window. Another team wanted to lay on a private plane for me to go and sign for them, but I told my brother, ‘No, I’ve given my word to the <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> president. I’m going to sign the contract tomorrow - and I’m going to marry that waitress. I lived in that hotel for almost three months, and I would go to the bar every day and order a coffee and an Orange Fanta, because that is all I knew how to ask for in Spanish! When another waitress tried to serve me I’d have to say, ‘No, not you, the other one!’ Raquel would always say she had to work so she couldn’t come out with me. But one day a friend tipped me off that she was in the bar on her day off, so I jumped straight in the car and drove to the bar. I walked up to her, pulled up a chair and said, ‘Here I am, and now you have no choice about coming out with me because you’re not working’. She came out for dinner with me the next day and we have been together ever since. George Clooney couldn’t have done it better!</p>

I think we have that debt and I’m sure if we asked the fans they would love for there to be football<br /><br />Without a doubt and I say this from the awareness that the risk will be very small, but also because of the solidarity with those who have been playing for us from the first minute and that they will continue like this for many days<br /><br />Lately I have heard many people talk about the problems there would be if we do not play, economic problems, European competitions, calendar, promotions, relegations, but I have not heard anyone talk about people, those people for whom their team is part of their life and they have suddenly had it taken away. Socially we must take a step, to be able to entertain people with what they like, so that we all stop thinking about viruses and disease, so that we can return to joking around with our neighbour from the opposite team</p>

  <p><b>[Rakitic laughs off <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> exit talk despite approaching final 12 months of contract]</b> I’ve got used to it a bit. I’ve been here six years now - so I’ve had six years of this sort of thing. I have to try to understand it, to remember that football is not just a sport. There is a bit more to it. We know that, we have to try to understand it - you have a laugh about it sometimes. The main thing is that I feel good and I am getting good feedback from the manager and the club. I’ve still got a contract, when I sign a contract I always intend to fulfil it, and if that cannot happen for any reason, then we’ll sit down together and talk about it, but for the moment, I am very happy here and I am thinking about other stuff.<br /><br />Today’s the first day I’ve been out in 60 days. I’ve only been 30-40 metres from the house until now. We’ve been allowed for, I think, about a week, to go out walking with children for one hour per day, and that was it. So today was the first time I’ve been properly out of the house. And it was a funny feeling, a bit uncomfortable, driving with gloves on, with a mask on, pretty weird, the situation is a new one for us, and you do have, well maybe not fear, but you certainly have respect for the situation. In football you have to be ready for anything but as I’ve said I don’t want to look too far ahead. I want to enjoy the moment and get ready to play whenever we are able to, or allowed to. We are still in the Champions League - we have the second leg of the last-16 tie against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. In <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> we are two points ahead of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, and we have fair few games still to play. We want to try to enjoy that, hopefully enjoy that, and after that we’ll see</p>

  <p><b>[Rakitic wants <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> future talks amid <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> swap deal rumours]</b> I have become used to my name coming out, it is not new. It would be nice to be in touch. I had it with <a href="eric-abidal.html">Abidal</a>, but it was more to talk about going back to work. I don’t have any negative thoughts. You can always talk to me. I am happy to go back to training and to wear the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> shirt again<br /><br />It is not only in recent times, I have been in the same situation for two or three years. Nothing changes for me. I really want to prepare for the return. A few games remain and for that I want to be at the highest level. The rest will be seen. When I sign a contract it is with the idea of fulfilling it.<br /><br />I want to have the best in my team and Lautaro is at the best level, we have noticed that every time we play against Inter. If he arrives I’m delighted, but I have nothing to do with this</p>

  <p><b>[Ivan Rakitic says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, Suarez and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> gave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> a strong sense of superiority]</b> It was very enjoyable. You could see the opposition’s concern, because they had to fully focus and didn’t know where to concentrate most. We attacked at every possible chance, we were dangerous and deep and had everything. It was a joy to play with them. We were very strong and got stronger with time. We reached the final at our peak and I remember how we felt. We said that we didn’t want the season to end because we wanted to keep playing. There was a strong sense of superiority that kept us wanting to play. <b>[The key was]</b> how the players mixed together and how hungry the new players were. All of that was coupled with a great coach who knew the finer details and how to handle everything. It was an impressive season and I still remember it all today: what happened before the final, the game, the goal, the post-match - it was unforgettable. That final will always be engraved in my mind<br /><br /><b>[While the 2019-20 season will have an unusual feel once it restarts due to the impact of the coronavirus crisis]</b> It will be different for everyone. There’s a clear before and after with the virus. We have come through a hard time, everyone worked at home and now the games will be behind closed doors, so everything will be different.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> could win the Champions League for the first time since that 2015 success]</b> We want to improve a lot of things because we know that we need to. There’s a fantastic atmosphere in the dressing room and we have clear objectives. Hopefully we’ll end August with both trophies <b>[<a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and the Champions League]</b>, we are working for that and I think it is possible. We want it. We will have to be prepared and see how the competition is formatted, but we have an opportunity that we want to take advantage of.</p>

  <p><b>[Rakitic says he will stay at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> next season but admits it is ‘not nice’ to be out the team]</b> I spoke to the club ten or 15 days ago and the conclusion is that I have nothing to talk about because I have a contract until the summer of 2021 with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and it is the entity I want to be in and play with. Furthermore, my wife and my daughters are good in the city. There is no reason to think about other things. I am training well and I am sure that Rakitic will be in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> longer.<br /><br />It is not nice when you do not play, especially when you do not understand why and they do not explain the reasons. But I respect the coach’s decisions. I am in a team sport, not individual. The most important thing to me is the present moment, and that means we are starting the championship next weekend. We must be ready for that too. With the years I have, I think I have proven that football is most important to me. I simply want to be happy and enjoy. That means winning a lot more trophies with Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[Ivan Rakitic is seeking clarity over his future at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> amid ongoing rumours linking him with a summer move]</b> I’m not angry with anyone, I still have a great relationship with everyone at the club and I’m incredibly grateful for the time so far at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. It’s just that after the long time I’ve been here, people talk to me openly about everything. I want clarity in which direction it is going. I now feel that we want to take a common path. I have no problem with the fact that there have been many headlines around my name in recent years. I am always open to discussions with those responsible and prefer it to being told about it through third parties. I am still very happy at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. My wife also feels very comfortable in Barcelona<br /><br />I don’t want to look too far ahead. The people at the club know that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> is the perfect club for me. I always sign a contract with the intension of fulfilling it. I still want that and I want to feel needed at the club. <b>[Staying at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> is the plan.

If something bothers you, you have to talk, but the idea is that I want to stay here longer<br /><br />My head and heart are clear at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. Now I want to enjoy the moment after the hard time with the coronavirus pandemic. Everyone who knows me knows how crazy I am about football</p>
