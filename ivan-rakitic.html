  <p><b>[Ivan Rakitic on how he got together with his wife]</b> It’s a love story worthy of Hollywood. I went back to the club hotel after dinner with the sporting director. I knew the following day I had a medical, a meeting with the president and the contract <b>[signing]</b>, so I was nervous and didn’t want to sleep. So I went to the hotel bar with my brother for a coffee. The woman who is now my wife was serving. There were still four days left in the transfer window. Another team wanted to lay on a private plane for me to go and sign for them, but I told my brother, ‘No, I’ve given my word to the <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> president. I’m going to sign the contract tomorrow - and I’m going to marry that waitress. I lived in that hotel for almost three months, and I would go to the bar every day and order a coffee and an Orange Fanta, because that is all I knew how to ask for in Spanish! When another waitress tried to serve me I’d have to say, ‘No, not you, the other one!’ Raquel would always say she had to work so she couldn’t come out with me. But one day a friend tipped me off that she was in the bar on her day off, so I jumped straight in the car and drove to the bar. I walked up to her, pulled up a chair and said, ‘Here I am, and now you have no choice about coming out with me because you’re not working’. She came out for dinner with me the next day and we have been together ever since. George Clooney couldn’t have done it better!</p>

  <p><b>[Rakitic wishes €222 million man Neymar was still at Barcelona]</b> I’m not going to lie to you, I would prefer that Ney was here with us. Apart from being a great player, he is a friend and I am very fond of him. After he left, we have to continue. Barca is not one, two or five players. It is the biggest club in the world and we have to keep working. It would seem better to be able to count on him, but if he is not here, we join forces to be even better..<br /><br />If one day I’m a coach, I will not want to explain everything. I am not a player who always goes to ask the coach or the club how things are going. And you don’t always have to understand things. I did not understand it and I said it openly, but it is like that and what I had left was to work very hard and at the end of the season I was in the team again. It was a situation that someone else could explain better than me. I have not changed anything. I am the same and I do the same work</p>

  <p><b>[When asked which Mexico player could be the most similar to Messi]</b> This doesn’t exist, not in Mexico, not in Croatia. You have to say that. He’s not the best in the world for nothing - for me, the best in history. With all respect to everyone else, If we only talk about one player, not a whole team, there’s no player in the world that even compares to Leo. Leo is unique. We all know that. We know tomorrow we’re going to face a very strong group that will put a lot of pressure on us, they’re very aggressive. They have a good atmosphere in their group, they want to give everything for the shirt, and our goal is to be better than them. … They’re a very strong national team, but having said that, with all respect, it’s very difficult to match Leo<br /><br /><b>[Argentina’s 2-0 victory against Italy without Messi]</b> They have a ton of talent. They could even take a second team to the World Cup and be able to compete. We’re preparing well. We know it’s not only Argentina, but we have a very complicated group and <b>[will]</b> try to have the perfect World Cup. First, we have to go through Nigeria. After <b>[that]</b>, enjoy the game against Argentina. And after that, <b>[face]</b> our old friends from Iceland to get out of the group. Of course, we’ve talked and I’d definitely like us to go through together, but we have to fight a bit and hopefully we can go through together</p>

If I had to choose, I’d prefer him to stay in Paris. I find it hard to believe that he’d go.

We get along great on the pitch and off of it because Sergio is an extraordinary character. I always want to have the best players next to me, so I’m happy when Sergio is by my side. When you know he is on the field with you or behind you, you automatically lower the handbrake and feel more secure. It is difficult for him to know because he knows that he is smart, tricky and reads the game really well. He is a quiet team leader<br /><br /> have a gluten intolerance. It’s been two years since I discovered it and after that I had to completely change my diet. It wasn’t easy, at first it was embarrassing, and now it is slowly becoming a habit.

  <p><b>[Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic has urged Ousmane Dembele’s critics to lay off him and give him time]</b> It is not easy to come to the largest club in the world and the daily pressure that comes with it and having to endure that. You have to give him time. He has unbelievable qualities and I am sure that he will take the next step. You have to turn a blind eye to such a player <b>[and allow him some mistakes sometimes]</b>. It is worth doing that for such players because they have a huge career ahead of them<br /><br /><b>[Rakitic also discussed Barca’s goals for the 2018-19 season]</b> We are really looking forward to the Champions League. But we also know that we need the league title in Spain. The club has only won the Champions League after winning the league in the same season. Accordingly, we are reluctant to play a great season in the league <b>[and forget about the Champions League as a result]</b>. We have to join forces to do that<br /><br />Of course, it is different <b>[without Iniesta]</b>. Andres is unique, he has shaped our game for many years. Even as Xavi left, everyone wondered how to proceed without him. But then it went well. Just like now, without others. Of course, it would be nicer if both of them were still here and leading us. The most important thing is that they have left a homogeneous, ready team. We all learned so much from them. Andres was, for me, one of the most important colleagues that I met. He is also a good friend for me outside the pitch. So, it is a pity that he left. But we understand his move to Japan. I think we can do well without him.

I’m part of the biggest team in the world and that makes me very proud. I love football. A lot. It still feels amazing to be able to play football every day and if you love something then you tend to be better at it. I would never describe football as a job because it doesn’t feel like a job. But I also know that there’s a responsibility to play here, that people are looking at you every minute and that they want to know what you are doing. Every player is different but I try to treat everyone the same. On a day-to-day basis, I come across other footballers and club staff and I try to treat all the same, from the security guard to Lionel Messi<br /><br /><b>[Rakitic once recalled his seven-month pursuit of his now-wife Raquel Mauri.

I probably asked her out 20 or 30 times. It was the hardest thing I’ve done in my life. It was harder than winning the Champions League, and it took nearly as long</p>

I’ve been here six years now - so I’ve had six years of this sort of thing. I have to try to understand it, to remember that football is not just a sport. There is a bit more to it. We know that, we have to try to understand it - you have a laugh about it sometimes. The main thing is that I feel good and I am getting good feedback from the manager and the club.

And it was a funny feeling, a bit uncomfortable, driving with gloves on, with a mask on, pretty weird, the situation is a new one for us, and you do have, well maybe not fear, but you certainly have respect for the situation.
