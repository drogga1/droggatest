Juventus are confident of securing a deal to sign Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot.</p>

  <p><b>[Adrien Rabiot has not rejected an offer to extend his contract with Paris Saint-Germain, his mother and agent Veronique insists]</b> I want to make a formal denial. read absolutely everything. That Adrien had an appointment with Leonardo that he did not honour. Or that I received an offer to extend his contract from Leonardo that I refused to raise the auction. This is absolutely wrong. There is not the slightest discussion between Leonardo and I. I had him on the phone once since he came back and we greeted each other with respect. He’s a smart person. There was no offer and there will not be any.<br /><br /><b>[Veronique refused to confirm that a move to Turin is on the cards and will not reveal where he is going until a deal is made official]</b> You know, in football, we’re very superstitious, and it’sbetter to say as little as you can until nothing is done</p>

Juventus have reached an agreement with French midfielder Adrien Rabiot on a multi-year contract. Available on free transfer after refusing to sign a new deal with Paris Saint-Germain.</p>

<p>: 2019 06 30
Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot is to undergo a medical with Juventus on Monday ahead of signing a five-year deal with the Turin club</p>

<p>: 2019 07 01
Juventus have completed the signing of Adrien Rabiot, the Serie A side have announced</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Adrien Rabiot admits the opportunity to play alongside ‘great champion’ Cristiano Ronaldo and sage advice from Gianluigi Buffon influenced his decision to sign for Juventus]</b> I had the chance to grow up playing with top players, which helped me a lot. Ronaldo is a great champion. The chance to play with him definitely had a bearing on my decision. But I know the whole dressing room is packed with world-class players and a positive spirit.<br /><br /><b>[Buffon, now a free agent, has been linked with a return to the Serie A champions and played a crucial role in guiding Rabiot towards Allianz Stadium]</b> Gigi spoke to me a lot about Juventus and his opinion matters a lot. He knows the club very well and told me many interesting things. He told me that if I wanted to take a step forward in my career I had to choose Juve, so I did. I have a lot of respect for him and I listened to him. Juve is a very prestigious club with great experience in Europe. They often reach the last stages. As I see it, I’m at a club which is clearly at a higher level of PSG, which is what inspired me a lot to make this choice</p>

  <p><b>[Adrien Rabiot wants to make history by emulating Zidane, Trezeguet &amp; Platini at Juventus after joining the Serie A champions on a free transfer]</b> Juventus has a great history of many great French players and I hope to leave my mark too. Juventus is a great and very prestigious club with a great history. From what I have seen, they are a step <b>[closer]</b> from being at the top in respect to PSG.<br /><br />Everything was finalised a little while ago, we found an agreement in a bit of a rush. Juventus contacted me in the past and the right moment arrived to come here. After seven years in Paris, I am ready to play in Serie A and I will do so with the same determination that I have always had. I haven’t had the opportunity to talk to <b>[head coach Maurizio]</b> Sarri yet, but everyone from Juve has left a great impression on me<br /><br />My preferred position on the field is in the left-midfield spot, but I can also play in a two-man midfield. I am at the disposal of the coach. There is a lot of competition here, even with Blaise Matuidi, but it doesn’t change anything regarding my relationship with him. It’s normal</p>

  <p><b>[New signing Adrian Rabiot admitted he has room for improvement after his debut in Juventus colours, but is optimistic about settling into the team]</b> It was the first game, so there is still a lot of work to do. Physically I need to grow, but I felt good playing my first game. We are understanding each other very well within the team and with the coach</p>

  <p><b>[Adrien Rabiot said Cristiano Ronaldo is helping him improve at the Serie A champions as he hailed the Juventus superstar’s influence]</b> I played a lot this summer, because I needed to adapt to the team. I’m managing to create an excellent affinity with Cristiano Ronaldo, because he also plays on the left. Training with him allows me to improve myself a lot and his presence is very good for the group. Turin is different from Paris. It’s smaller, but it’s a beautiful city. I am finding myself at ease and I managed to adapt well, which is very important for what I can then give on the field. Personally, I can’t wait to start this adventure. I feel fit, we have worked a lot this summer, but we are ready for this appointment. With Parma it will be difficult, because we are the team to beat, and everyone will always give their best against us, but we are confident<br /><br />The coach, Maurizio Sarri, made an excellent impression on me. He has a precise game philosophy and knows exactly how we must play, both in the offensive and defensive phases. We have already absorbed his concepts and we are working well with his staff</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd linked Adrien Rabiot has no plans to leave <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in January transfer window]</b> Yes, I will stay with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> for sure. There is no problem. I feel the confidence of the club and of coach <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>. 2019 was not easy for me, I came to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> after a long time without playing. I’m looking to adapt to a new league, a new environment and a new coach. I hope 2020 will be better for me and be able to help <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> by exploiting my full potential<br /><br />I’m ready to adapt and play where the team will need me. When I arrived, I hadn’t been playing for a long time, now I am finding the rhythm. I feel better and better and we want to keep working like this. I love our philosophy, having possession of the ball and quickly attacking the opposing team. This allows us to quickly recover the ball. Over time, we will improve further</p>
