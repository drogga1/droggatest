He knows the club very well and told me many interesting things. He told me that if I wanted to take a step forward in my career I had to choose <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, so I did. I have a lot of respect for him and I listened to him. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> is a very prestigious club with great experience in Europe. They often reach the last stages. As I see it, I’m at a club which is clearly at a higher level of <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, which is what inspired me a lot to make this choice</p>

I’m managing to create an excellent affinity with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, because he also plays on the left. Training with him allows me to improve myself a lot and his presence is very good for the group. <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> is different from Paris. It’s smaller, but it’s a beautiful city. I am finding myself at ease and I managed to adapt well, which is very important for what I can then give on the field. Personally, I can’t wait to start this adventure. I feel fit, we have worked a lot this summer, but we are ready for this appointment. With <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> it will be difficult, because we are the team to beat, and everyone will always give their best against us, but we are confident<br /><br />The coach, <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a>, made an excellent impression on me. He has a precise game philosophy and knows exactly how we must play, both in the offensive and defensive phases. We have already absorbed his concepts and we are working well with his staff</p>

I hope 2020 will be better for me and be able to help <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> by exploiting my full potential<br /><br />I’m ready to adapt and play where the team will need me. When I arrived, I hadn’t been playing for a long time, now I am finding the rhythm. I feel better and better and we want to keep working like this. I love our philosophy, having possession of the ball and quickly attacking the opposing team. This allows us to quickly recover the ball. Over time, we will improve further</p>
