  <p><b>[Kevin Gameiro tells he turned down the chance to join <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, instead opting for a move to <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League runners up <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>]</b> I knew that if I went to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a>, I would have found myself as the fourth attacker. My game time would have reduced I think. In fact there was more chance of me staying at <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> than going to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. My agents made me aware of more attractive offers on a financial level but I wanted to stay in Spain. I feel very good here and my family does too</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Gameiro speaks about his team-mate <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a>’s potential]</b> I can’t say that because I played with <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>, <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> … great players at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. But Antoine is a great player and I think he can go even higher and I hope for him that he’ll do it. For me, it’s a pleasure to play with him. We have fun on the pitch, and you can see it every weekend</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> complete €16m signing of Gameiro from <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>]</b> Perhaps. I have a little time left to get there <b>[in terms of fitness]</b>. I have a week to be here and prepare for the game. It was not easy, but as the president has said, it has long been clear in my head <b>[that he wanted to join <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>]</b>. Now I’m here and I’m very happy<br /><br />A long time ago I wanted to come here, but because of club problems it couldn’t be. Then there was no option and I went somewhere else. The coach <b>[<a href="marcelino.html">Marcelino Garcia Toral</a>]</b> told me that he wanted to work with me for a long time. When the coach tells you that, it gives you a lot of confidence to come. I will work hard to try to do many great things here</p>

  <p><b>[Valencia vs Arsenal]</b> We’re going to have chances, sure. Arsenal play football and leave spaces. We are going to have chances. And two goals will be enough. We cannot hesitate and need to start this game strongly. It is never easy to play in a stadium with a hot atmosphere. For us it is much simpler. The support of the people gives you special encouragement. We have to look only at ourselves and if we play our game, we will win</p>
