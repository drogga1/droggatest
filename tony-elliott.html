  <p><b>[How British football coaches are being hit hard by coronavirus crisis]</b> It is tough for everybody. It isn’t about football, sport or goalkeeping; it is about life. We literally are just looking to survive. This is how extreme it can get. There’s a lockdown now. I have some prominent roles in the game working with <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> for the deaf and the blind squads at the national level as well as at Bristol City Women FC but I am on a contract for my services so neither have an obligation to pay me. The bottom line is that my two main revenue streams - and any other revenue streams I may have turned to - have all gone. It leaves me in a very precarious position. At this current time, I have no income streams<br /><br />I was training these teams and then literally 10 days ago I get contacted by the club saying ‘we aren’t getting together, you have to stay at home. There’s nothing going on at the training ground so we are closed down’. That’s okay for full-time staff because they are on contracts. The club are obliged to pay them. I am on a contract for services; I get paid when I work so there’s no way of paying me. I can’t work from home because my work is on the grass. You could do bits of analysis but that’s not a full day’s work. That’s a few hours a day so they aren’t going to pay you for that. They are going to prioritise full-time staff and I get that. That’s the risk you take when you are self-employed and do lots of different things. That’s what has happened with me<br /><br />The FA have now cancelled all my squad training camp commitments until at least the beginning of August. It isn’t just hanging on until the end of April. I am just hoping we play football before the winter comes. The full-time staff or ones in top professional clubs will get looked after but I think some of those will go to the wall. There’s hundreds of thousands of staff members in all areas who are more or less full-time workers at clubs but are on zero-hours contracts or part-time contracts or service contracts and they won’t get a penny. Where it leaves those people I don’t know. What do you do now when you are finding other jobs? My CV is basically just experience as a footballer and a coach. I am not a bricklayer, nurse or doctor. I have no other qualifications outside of football and I think most are like me<br /><br />I could work in supermarkets. I have done that before but there’s a process to work in those roles. There will be people no longer working in retail in shops who will get those chances ahead of a football coach. Everything else is closed so where are you going to work? The government are trying to force legislation through. If you are not working, you can go on Universal Credit. But we are still waiting on that. We have all got mortgages, rent or other things to pay for and we need help because our revenue streams have stopped completely on their say so. I support that decision because I don’t want to be passing on this potentially lethal virus. I am glad it is enforced but we need help and support to look after the self-employed. We are not just a handful of people. This is five million people self-employed and thousands in football</p>
