  <p><b>[Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s arrival presents a big challenge for Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid]</b> Of course it plays a big part how he comes in, but I’ve only heard good things. I think it’s going to work out and be more positive than anything. We’re looking forward to it.</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastian Lletget for the Galaxy’s opening goal little more than a minute after the LAFC sequences of passes first began]</b> It definitely felt like a low point, but it motivated us. When we got that first one everything changed.</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastian Lletget returns to scene of career-altering injury with USMNT]</b> It’s one of the best moments, and one of the worst in a way. But I’m moving forward from these things and I think I wouldn’t have been so eager to come back if it was something that was going to hurt. It’s a special place, but for sure it has some bad memories.<br /><br /><b>[Lletget said of Berhalter’s preferred playing system]</b> I feel really good in that system. I can play a couple of positions, but definitely in the midfield is where I belong so I’m really excited. I think <b>[a number 10 role]</b> is the way forward, especially in this system. I think that’s where Gregg likes me and hopefully it works out (on Saturday) too<br /><br />Emotionally you have to block that stuff and put up a wall. You don’t need to think about that too much because it can mess with your energy. I just want to enjoy being back on the field with the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastian Lletget and Paul Arriola shine to help USMNT pass tougher test from Costa Rica]</b> I’m not even going to lie, I was <b>[crying]</b>. People don’t realize what it is for an athlete when you get injured like that. And then just in this particular stadium I got the goosebumps even training yesterday morning with the team. I had to overcome an injury that put me out for a long time, and getting back to where I am is definitely overwhelming, very emotional, but moving forward I just can’t wait to keep going.</p>

  <p><b>[Canada didn’t even have to worry about bending and not breaking. They barely even bent]</b> If there’s ever one thing that we work on, it’s patience and to dominate the ball. I think, in that sense, we’re prepared for it. If they do move to a formation that parks it more in the back, I think we are ready to disorganize them. It’s one of the challenges of this game. It’s not just a friendly. We’re tight for points and we need them<br /><br />We’re definitely missing people like Christian and stuff, and obviously he’s been a key player for this team as everyone knows. We have to have variety. We have to be creative. It’s not like we don’t have the players to do it. We don’t need to sell ourselves short. We just need to believe in ourselves and do what Gregg asked us to do. The chances will come and I think it will be a much different game this time</p>

  <p><b>[Asked about Ibrahimovic’s departure before a national team training session last week, midfielder Sebastian Lletget couldn’t hide his indifference]</b> Oh man, that guy. I wish him the best, dude. It was a good run.</p>

  <p><b>[Playing with <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> was super frustrating, says ex <a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> teammate Lletget]</b> There’s definitely a better feel around the place for sure. As far as chemistry, that’s only going to build with time<br /><br />You couldn’t be free. It was super frustrating. You feel like you want to literally take your boots off and just walk off the field. It’s tough to play against him and tougher to play with him<br /><br /><b>[Although nothing came of the set piece, it went viral on social media because Ibrahimovic pushed the midfielder out of the wall, much to Lletget’s shock]</b> What’s funny about that guy, that to me is complete insanity to do that to one of your teammates - complete insanity. I was telling him in that play: ‘This <b>[opponent]</b> is alone, should I go?’ I’m kind of whispering to him and he said: ‘No, stay’. Then literally as he’s about to kick it, he just shoves me and you can see in the video that I just play it off super cool. Then obviously I wake up the next day and it goes viral. it’s one of those moments I think he shows his true colors</p>
