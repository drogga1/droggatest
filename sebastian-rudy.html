  <p><b>[Sebastian Rudy talks about his admiration for <a href="xabi-alonso.html">Xabi Alonso</a>]</b> I always watched <a href="xabi-alonso.html">Xabi Alonso</a> in recent years. I would have liked to have played with him and would have learned a lot from him. I could have gotten a lot from Alonso: his vision, clarity, his calmness. And his shot on goal. He always packed a punch</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich midfielder Sebastian Rudy has welcomed Bayern Munich’s interest in Leon Goretzka]</b> It’s normal that Bayern have good players and want to add more. Reinforcement of the squad is always good. We have to think as a team because it’s about team success.<br /><br />I want to attack the second half of the season and improve myself - and my game. Everyone here wants to play. There’s great competition in my position but I’m hungry to come out on top. The World Cup is a big goal of mine. For that, I will have to be at my best. But I’m optimistic that it will come together this year and I’ll earn my ticket</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastian Rudy is determined to prove his worth to Schalke]</b> I did not show what I can do. That’s why I’m disappointed with my personal performances. From now on, I will take things a little differently and try to show what makes me strong. I want to prove to my critics wrong, I can do it better - this thought motivates me immensely.<br /><br />I underestimated the differences between the clubs. It took me a long time to get used to the Schalke game, which made my time at the start very difficult. That will certainly not happen to me again. I also have high expectations of myself and try to get the most out of every game and every training session. I would not say that my expectations were too high. Fans and clubs rightly expect a lot from me and can expect a lot in the future as well. I know what I can bring to the team and I will show it next season<br /><br />It’s not nice to be constantly criticised. Of course, legitimate and constructive criticism is part of the job and is also important, but I do not understand why only negative reports are made about individual players. That does not go by without a trace and it hurts. People have to realise what they’re causing. Football professionals are not machines, but people with feelings. Sometimes you get the impression that you just get blown away</p>
