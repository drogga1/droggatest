<blockquote>
  <p>[Was Mourinho right to publicly humiliate Luke Shaw?] If you listen to what former players said about Sir Alex Ferguson, I think Gary Neville said he would call you into his office and tell you that he wasn’t going to play you in a match and you’d leave feeling good about it. That was the most remarkable thing, he could make you feel good when he dropped you. That is what a true psychologist does, he manages to make you even more motivated to play or motivated to never be dropped again.<br /><br />The problem with calling somebody out in the public arena is you’d better know the psychology of the person you’re dealing with very well before you take to embarrassing them in public. Obviously Mourinho knows his job so I’m not going to do the same thing to him as he’s doing to a player in the sense of calling him out, but maybe he knows the players he’s talking about so well and feels he needs to make a big statement to get them to focus and concentrate more. If you are doing it repeatedly and constantly without knowing the animal you’re dealing with, I think it’s dangerous territory<br /><br />Absolutely, and everybody psychologically goes through peaks and troughs so what you said one day to that player might not work six months later. We all go through bouts where we are more confident, less confident, resilient, less resilient, and so you can’t just go ‘OK, that’s a player who I can always call out in the press’ because they may not be in that place.<br /><br />Some people need an arm round the shoulder, some people need a kick up the arse, but circumstance could need you to change your practice. The whole thing about being a good psychologist is understanding where that person is at the time. There’s a saying in psychology that the meaning of your communication is the response you get, and that’s very important.<br /><br />It goes for pretty much any profession, so if a manager calls me in to work with a certain player or a team I cannot go back to a manager and say ‘The player that you gave me was really stupid. I said all the right things, and they didn’t understand.’ I’m the only one in that situation who can be stupid because I didn’t communicate my message in the right way. The responsibility is always on the person giving the message, not the one receiving the message<br /><br />Mental resilience is the real measure of greatness. Everyone is going to receive criticism at some point, it’s how you deal with it. Mental resilience is the difference between a good player and a great player. If you have one bad game and you suddenly believe that you are only going to play badly, that means you have a lack of resilience.<br /><br />What makes a great player in any sport is that ability to focus at the appropriate time. Everything around you is a distraction, the agent trying to fix a deal, the press that has ultimately killed careers. How many players can you mention, even just at United, who had that promise as a young player but ultimately got distracted?<br /><br />If you are not giving players a solid belief system, they are not going to shine. At United, Fergie used to talk about the difference between being a United player and not being a United player was that ability to focus and have that mental resilience. The American car manufacturer Henry Ford said ‘Whether you think you can or you think you can’t, you are right</p>
