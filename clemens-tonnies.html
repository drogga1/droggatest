  <p><b>[Clemens Tonnies racist’s remark]</b> <b>[…]</b> Then the Africans would stop cutting down trees and producing babies when it is dark<br /><br /><b>[The comments caused an immediate outcry and Tonnies quickly issued an apology]</b> I am for an open and diverse society. I am sorry for the comment on the large number of children in Africa. As chairman of the supervisory board of <a href="fc-schalke-04.html">FC Schalke 04</a>, I am 1,000% behind our club values. This includes the fight against racism, discrimination and exclusion. On the basis of that I expressly wish to excuse myself. It was wrong, rash and thoughtless and in no way in line with our values. I am very sorry</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin-Prince Boateng has said he is upset that Schalke chairman Clemens Tonnies did not receive a more severe punishment for recent racist comments]</b> That should not happen to a person in his position. When it is said that it was just a slip-up – I just don’t know how that can be a slip-up? His three-month break, who does that help? No one. They had to set a better example there. The opportunity was there to show everyone that something like that is not acceptable. Not in Germany, not in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and not in our club</p>
