  <p><b>[Even Rashford’s dive can’t help injury-cursed Man Utd break back into the top four]</b> It’s a dive and, therefore, a yellow card for Rashford.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Premier League referee Graham Poll has branded Dele Alli a player who cannot resist the opportunity to cheat]</b> Dele Alli has a major flaw in his game - he can’t stop cheating. There was a chance to score, there was no reason for the England player to dive, but he couldn’t resist it. The FA need to look at their disciplinary regulations. At the moment, they will only act and suspend a player if a dive is successful; i.e. the referee has been conned and a penalty, for example, has been wrongly given. One thing is for sure, if Alli is fouled in the last minute of a game that Spurs are trailing 1-0, his previous actions could make a referee doubt the validity of his fall.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku is facing the threat of a three-match ban which would rule him out of meetings with City and Arsenal]</b> Romelu Lukaku must face a three-match ban once the FA view replays of the incident between the Belgian and Brighton’s Gaetan Bong just before the only goal of the game.<br /><br />Lukaku was impeded as the corner came in but his reaction was extreme, kicking out first with his right foot and then making full contact with his left foot somewhere quite painful.<br /><br />It was a violent act which would have resulted in a red card had referee Neil Swarbrick seen it. The Brighton full back did remarkably well to not react, nor complain to the officials. He deserves praise for that.<br /><br />United manager Jose Mourinho will be understandably irritated if Lukaku is banned retrospectively, but he should take comfort in the three points because the only goal of the game - Ashley Young’s deflected effort - came just after the whistle should have blown for Lukaku’s assault.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Graham Poll has said that when you are refereeing, you do not believe in Fergie time]</b> You dispel it as popular myth of teams that are jealous of Manchester United’s success<br /><br />I think it would be too easy to just say it’s rubbish. When you analyse and think psychologically what happens, the pressure that’s on you at Old Trafford or the Emirates or Stamford Bridge, the pressure that is implied upon you must have an effect, even if subconsciously</p>
