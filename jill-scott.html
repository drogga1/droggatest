  <p><b>[Jill Scott was coy about her England future after the Lionesses crashed out of the Women’s World Cup in the semi-finals]</b> It’s a good question to be fair. I feel okay at the minute to be honest, but would it be realistic to say another four years? I’d be 36 so yes, it could be my last, but I’ve said before I don’t really like to think too far ahead. My aim was just to get through this one and then decide after that what the plan is. I feel good at the minute and I still feel I can compete at this level.<br /><br /><b>[Scott is hoping to stick around for those two tournaments at least]</b> Obviously we got the qualification for the Olympics which wasn’t an easy task when you look at the teams that got knocked out and we won’t have that opportunity so again that’s another thing we can feel proud of. But at the moment everything just seems to hurt. A home Euros would be fantastic. Hopefully we’ve gained a few supporters on the way of this journey and hopefully they’ll stick with us and follow us in an Olympics and home Euros<br /><br />We knew it was going to be a difficult game, they’re not number one in the world for nothing but I think we can take great pride in the fact that we competed. Obviously this team now has been to three semi-finals consecutively in major tournaments and I don’t think many teams can say they’ve done that. I think once the emotion’s gone out of it - it hurts at the moment, a lot - hopefully we can leave this tournament and feel like we’ve done a good job</p>

  <p><b>[Jill Scott on <a href="phil-neville.html">Phil Neville</a>]</b> You can’t expect a manager to come in and win a World Cup. That was the aim, but it’s not easy at the elite level and we just fell short. England haven’t won a tournament since 1966 and haven’t been the best team in the world for decades. Phil <b>[Neville]</b> had a big impact - ok, we had played in semi-finals before but for me, he is one of the best managers I’ve played for. He was great for me.</p>
