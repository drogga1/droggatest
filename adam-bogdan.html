  <p><b>[Adam Bogdan has lifted the lid on training ground stars at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, with the Hungarian claiming that Lazar Markovic was a genius]</b> There were a lot. <b>[Daniel]</b> Sturridge, his finishing is amazing. From one step, he could find any corner. <b>[Philippe]</b> <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> was amazing as well. I don’t know what words I should say as I’ll say amazing for other players as well. Lazar Markovic was a genius in five-a-side games. It’s really, really hard to pick one. You play against <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> who will run for two hours, he will graft and score goals in training. <b>[Jordan]</b> Henderson is very similar. It’s impossible to pick one out. I’m glad and grateful to have been able to play with these players<br /><br /><b>[Another of those to have impressed Bogdan was Roberto Firmino]</b> I’m in love with the game of <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>. He’s such a key player for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. You could tell (he was special). He got injured when I made my debut with his back so it took him a few weeks to come back. For him, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> came in and knew him from Germany and that was a really key factor. He was aware of his abilities, what he could get out of him and it fitted perfectly with the system that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> wanted to play. You can see it in training. The touch, the passes, the turns, you can’t take the ball away from him, the attitude - everything. It takes a bit of time for the games to adjust to the system the manager wants you to play but in training, yeah, you could see it</p>
