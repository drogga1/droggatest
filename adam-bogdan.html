  <p><b>[Liverpool goalkeeper Adam Bogdan has been ruled out for nine months due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury]</b> I have just received the result of my MRI scan, which showed that I tore my ACL in my right knee. It will be a lengthy recovery. I am sure I will return stronger</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Bogdan admits the competitive nature of the 2016-17 Premier League title race makes it almost impossible to predict where Liverpool will finish]</b> I’m sure it will be very exciting. This is the best Premier League in the recent years. There are six teams that can win the title. There is some advantage for Chelsea right now, but the others still have a chance. It is really hard to call which team will win, but Chelsea is the favourite now.<br /><br />I think Liverpool are in good form and they have a good playing style. They can win any of the matches. They have a chance to win the Premier League, but they still can be third or fourth. It is too early to say anything about the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Adam Bogdan has lifted the lid on training ground stars at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, with the Hungarian claiming that Lazar Markovic was a genius]</b> There were a lot. <b>[Daniel]</b> Sturridge, his finishing is amazing. From one step, he could find any corner. <b>[Philippe]</b> <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> was amazing as well. I don’t know what words I should say as I’ll say amazing for other players as well. Lazar Markovic was a genius in five-a-side games. It’s really, really hard to pick one. You play against <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> who will run for two hours, he will graft and score goals in training. <b>[Jordan]</b> Henderson is very similar. It’s impossible to pick one out. I’m glad and grateful to have been able to play with these players<br /><br /><b>[Another of those to have impressed Bogdan was <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>]</b> I’m in love with the game of <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>. He’s such a key player for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. You could tell (he was special). He got injured when I made my debut with his back so it took him a few weeks to come back. For him, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> came in and knew him from Germany and that was a really key factor. He was aware of his abilities, what he could get out of him and it fitted perfectly with the system that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> wanted to play. You can see it in training. The touch, the passes, the turns, you can’t take the ball away from him, the attitude - everything. It takes a bit of time for the games to adjust to the system the manager wants you to play but in training, yeah, you could see it</p>
