  <p><b>[Ada Hegerberg speaks about growing up with her sister and fellow team-mate Andrine, while living together away from home in Potsdam]</b> You just want to be sisters when the day ends. I think we got to know each other quite well through that period. When we moved apart, we grew a lot as people. It just tightened our relationship. That’s why it’s so cool to see each other more often when we’re here with Norway</p>

  <p><b>[Why Ballon d’Or winner Ada Hegerberg isn’t playing at the Women’s World Cup]</b> I think NFF <b>[Norwegian FA]</b> has a long way to go, and right now it’s not the place for me. It’s as simple as that. Football is the biggest sport in Norway for girls and has been for years but at the same time girls don’t have the same opportunities as the boys. Norway has a great history of women’s football but it’s harder now. We’ve stopped talking about development and other countries have overtaken us<br /><br /><b>[The 23-year-old’s frustrations are understandable given her environment in <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>, where equality between the female and male teams has allowed the former to become the best club in the world]</b> We need more people in the game with the vision of <b>[Lyon president]</b> <a href="jean-michel-aulas.html">Jean-Michel Aulas</a>, who knows that investing in the women’s game is a win-win for the club and the city and the players.

  <p><b>[Hegerberg has suggested that women’s football does not get the respect it deserves in her homeland, pointing to unequal pay and a lack of investment as evidence]</b> It was tough at so many camps. I have been broken mentally. It has been a deeply depressing feeling. I had nightmares after being with the national team, you shouldn’t have things like that. If you want to get anywhere in life you have to make choices. Immediately the thought came into my mind: ‘I think I’ll have to stop playing for the national team’. Then everything just ran off and I started to sleep well again</p>

  <p><b>[Coronavirus will not affect $1bn investment in women’s game]</b> Everything is so uncertain at the moment and we worry about our sport, especially as a women’s player. I understand that the men’s football is the top subject obviously, but you cannot forget the place of women’s football in this. Hopefully everything will get back in place and women’s football continues its development and we won’t lose position. It is a difficult situation for all of us</p>

  <p><b>[The striker said of the injury sustained before <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> were due to play Stade de Reims on January 26th]</b> It gave this click sound. In a situation you’ve found yourself in 10 times, 10,000 times before. I felt my body shaking. It was a signal. But then I was back on my feet and I didn’t have any pain<br /><br /><b>[When the Norwegian was told she had ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament]</b> It’s a very, very strange feeling. I consider myself to be a very privileged woman and with a wider perspective it’s not the end of the world, but when you’re a footballer and an athlete at a high level it kind of feels like you’re at rock bottom<br /><br /><b>[She is surprisingly upbeat]</b> I’m doing fine. I’m not complaining. The circumstances are so strange at the moment, I’m just trying to keep home, and I’m lucky to have everything in place from my rehab<br /><br />I’m in a period where you have a lot of feelings in certain moments. Sometimes you need to lower expectations and be a bit more gentle to yourself through those difficult periods in order to conquer them<br /><br /><b>[she is determined to help make sure that women’s football is a key part of discussions when it comes to the sport’s coronavirus recovery]</b> Football is going to suffer from this, the bigger men’s clubs are going to suffer, everyone’s going to suffer and obviously women’s football is going to suffer. I understand that men’s football is up for discussion first. We also benefit a lot economically from men’s clubs and we need their help, as well, to build a better product and take it to a place which we can benefit from ourselves one day.<br /><br />But it’s just very important to keep women’s football in the discussions at all times. There has been great development in the last years, it’s had a good rhythm, and it’s very important that we don’t take two steps back again after a crisis like this because we’re not the first priority. We just have to keep the voice strong and not lose our position. It’s such a strange situation to be in so it’s very hard to say where it will go but we need to push for the same evolution that we’ve seen in recent years<br /><br />Football is going to suffer from this, the bigger men’s clubs are going to suffer, everyone’s going to suffer and obviously women’s football is going to suffer.

To see how far I can push it as a player at the highest level; that’s something that motivates me.<br /><br /><b>[As does watching a culture shift in Norway as young girls and boys there look to her in the way she looked at the ever-modest Ole Gunnar Solskjær when growing up]</b> There was a lack of women role models when I was growing up - that’s something that has changed a lot today. That’s very important. I can see the impact all the success that I’ve had with <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> has not only had on young girls but also young boys in Norway. I feel that’s a big game-changer.<br /><br /><b>[Hegerberg has won everything there is to win at Lyon]</b> I believe in staying loyal to your club. I’ve had the most amazing years at <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> and I have another year of my contract. It’s impossible to say what the future will bring but right now I’m in my own rehab bubble trying to get back on track stronger for <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> - I have scary plans for that comeback</p>

  <p><b>[Ada Hegerberg on Coronavirus]</b> With the current situation, we’re all a little impeded in our lives - we’ve put aside some of our freedoms for the good of society as whole. This gives us time to think differently. With everything I’ve been through with my family, friends and everyone around me, I consider myself to be very privileged in life. Mental health is extremely important in this scenario. With the injury, but also with COVID, I took a step back from football. I took the time to reflect on what I’ve been through in the last few years, but also on what I want to do in the future</p>
