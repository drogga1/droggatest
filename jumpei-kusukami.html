<blockquote>
  <p>[Western Sydney’s Jumpei Kusukami relishing A-League challenge] Personally, I think I haven’t shown a complete performance yet. This team [Western Sydney] has priority in defence and I have to use more energy on defence in my current position. It was very difficult at the beginning because I had the problem of fitness in addition to tactical problem. I had to understand how we play here. Now, I have improved my fitness and able to run more distance than before. It enabled me to produce more offensively, which I have been showing in Japan.<br /><br />My team-mates are supporting me, and I love the way supporters motivate us here. Wanderers supporters make great atmosphere especially at the home games, and that is the reason why I feel happy every time I play. Currently, I am very fulfilled and enjoying football, so I want to play more games and record my name in the club’s history<br /><br />[On fans] They are quiet. Last time, I guess it was a place like a zoo, I was taking a photo with a koala when I heard a staff member discussing whether I was Jumpei or not … supporters here appear shy and don’t talk to me much<br /><br />[Jumpei conceded he was still taken aback by the physicality of Australian football] Players here make hard contact even at the training ground<br /><br />I’m looking forward to playing against [Urawa] and also I would like Japanese fans to watch me play because there are very limited chance for Japanese fans to check my play when I play in Australia</p>
