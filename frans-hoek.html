  <p><b>[David de Gea immediately put the disappointment of missing out on a move to Real Madrid in 2015 behind him]</b> I had an open discussion with David, who was always honest and realistic, and the conclusion was that it was better to leave him out until the moment his situation was clear because the situation was influencing David at that moment. David has always been open in the communication about that possible move. We discussed that openly and the fact it had failed to happen. I felt he knew exactly what was going on and switched immediately again to his current situation.</p>

  <p><b>[David de Gea could play for Barcelona or Manchester City]</b> I worked with him for two years at Manchester United and I must say he’s at a really high level. It’s not easy to play three games a week as is demanded in England and maintain a high level. Particularly when anyone can beat anyone there. But he does it. That’s why it’s unusual to see him make mistakes at international level. De Gea could play for Barcelona or City because playing with his feet is among his many qualities.<br /><br /><b>[On Ter Stegen]</b> For me, he is one of the best because at Barca it is very important to play well with the feet, but he is also fantastic at shot-stopping, in the one against one situation. He is a very modern goalkeeper, of this time and that has a lot of value</p>
