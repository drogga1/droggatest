  <p><b>[Spanish coach Santi Denia underlines importance of Brazil game]</b> It’s the most difficult group of the tournament and it’s very important to win the first match. Brazil are favourites for the World Cup. Winning the first match will lift our spirits. We had two weeks of preparations. One in Spain, One here in India<br /><br /><b>[The events back in Catalonia where an independence referendum has caused political controversy]</b> We have come here to win the World Cup. We are here to play football and we are a united country.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the presence of Barcelona and Real Madrid players in the same dressing room]</b> Yeah! it’s our job to ensure that the players from different teams are united. They are doing their best. They have played a lot of matches together and the group is united<br /><br />Conditions cannot be an excuse for the match tomorrow. We are working really hard</p>

The fight to sign <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> wonderkid Ferran Torres]</b> He could play for any team in the world but, for me, he could be very useful in English football. We always used him with the national team as a pure right winger, on his natural side, where he could take on people on the outside. Wingers are often used in England, more than in Italy, for example, although he has evolved more with <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> playing inside, or even on his opposite wing. He is developing his game in a spectacular way</p>
