  <p><b>[The goals may come for Tigres, but right now the club’s scoring issues look very real]</b> It’s a situation that worries all of us: players, coaches, everybody. We’re going to keep looking and trying to find attacking plays to be able to finish. Thinking it’s a crisis would be bad on my part. I have to analyze what happened on the field. We had a very average first half. In the second half, the red card was well called. It’s very complicated to play with a man less.</p>

The two goals are situations that can happen to anyone. The errors were costly, we committed them, but the character of soccer, the desire, the commitment, I think the result we have now is more than fair. More than fair because my team did everything possible to be able to win. We tied, but I think that getting the tie leaves us in a very good state of mind.</p>

I think it would’ve been a better game <b>[with better weather]</b>.<br /><br />A tie with the feeling of a tie. It’s a shame we couldn’t reflect the superiority we had in the game on the scoreboard. Naturally there times it happens, other times not as much. Today is one of those days where you’re satisfied with the players did, with what they tried, with what they looked for but not satisfied that the chances we had we weren’t able to finish. But I don’t have any regret or anything. I think the only thing we were missing is the goal. We scored one, but I think in the several chances we had, it would be excellent if we could’ve scored one more. I’m confident that hopefully the next game we’ll be more deadly</p>

Honestly, I sincerely think I’d be a traitor, stabbing them after all these years at this club that has supported me so much. With the next three years I’ll have 11 years as the manager of a club. Do you remember this ever happening in Mexican football? So, this loyalty between us, this commitment, is really important.<br /><br />If Tigres tells me goodbye and the federation thinks I can be a useful element, maybe we’d sit down to chat, but that’s the only reason if I didn’t have a contract or a job with Tigres<br /><br />I’m coming to do my job 100 percent.

We already know them really well. I have no doubt that this team will do really well. I love that it’s a tough opponent. They’ve got the chance to face the best and with this experience they’ll be much better in the future. Don’t think about the result, but rather how these guys grow. If we don’t give them the chance, we’re stunting their growth. They’re the future of the national team, and you have to give them chances. If you’re talking about them all week, all day, they deserve to play these games. I’m open to running the risk of being criticized, but I have a lot of confidence in these guys</p>

That’s where i see them. Why? Because they’re young players with talent with hunger to do things really well and to want big things. I see them with the age they are and the talent they have, and I’m going to insist they’re continuing with preparation, with formation in their clubs. When they come to the national team, this also can happen with the national team. They’re young players.

We need a lot of work.<br /><br />Nobody wants their players to make mistakes. Tuesday, I expect the team, the players, each one individually play to their level and that after that as a collective they can integrate. It’s not that easy. With a national team you only have one or two day to come together, it really depends on the individual players, on their tactical understanding and I hope Tuesday we can improve on both aspects, the individual and the collective</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico’s lack of depth will be on display in second game vs. Argentina]</b> What do we want, the benefit of Mexican football as a whole or do I want the benefit for my club? Are we really supporters or not? This situation isn’t an agreeable one, and if we can’t get it solved we’re going to keep doing the same thing. ‘I’m loaning you the player, but I’m not loaning him. I support you, but I don’t support you.</p>

  <p><b>[Tuca Ferretti’s interim spell with Mexico comes to an end]</b> I was looking to do my job, take care of what I’m in charge of. Naturally, with this game it’s come to an end. The results obtained weren’t at all to my liking, but I think we’ve got to do an analysis of other situations so the next manager in my situation can take advantage of these six games that were played. There are a number of important players who played at the last World Cup. We have to see who really will be able to get to 2022, and naturally there’s a group of young players who must keep progressing to really be what we hope they can be for the next World Cup.<br /><br /><b>[I provided]</b> time for the federation to be able to find the next manager of our national team. I think it would’ve been premature to have selected someone right away and I think my prescence gave them the time needed to be able to pick this person who will be the person to take the Mexico national team to the next World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[On Concacaf Champions League]</b> Saprissa always will be and is one of the big clubs in Costa Rica, apart from the stage it’s in. It’s a team that’s representative of this country. We know the importance that has and we’re going to take this game with every bit of respect. I don’t know who has said that we’re the favorites. We’re 11 v. 11. That’s how we always think. I don’t know why you’re putting labels on it. We’re not taking it like that.</p>

  <p><b>[Tigres right to be confident, even without Gignac, in CCL quarterfinals]</b> Tomorrow, I’m focused on what we’re going to face. I don’t know if I’m going to live until Saturday, so it’s day by day. Wednesday I’ll think about the next match.<br /><br />You guys put the favorite tag on, we don’t put it on ourselves. We always say we’re 11 v. 11. If we face Barcelona in the Club World Cup, naturally you’d put Barcelona as the favorite, but we’d say we’re 11 v. 11. It’s the same with what we’re going to face tomorrow. For us, we’re 11 v. 11 and we shouldn’t be confident of anything</p>

  <p><b>[Tigres punish Dynamo’s lack of perfection]</b> I think it’s a great team. Today, we got an advantage, but we shouldn’t think it’s definitive. We should be humble, respectful to play well in the second leg. We have respect for the Dynamo and playing there, we’re going to play as though it’s 0-0 and look to score the goals that give us the result.</p>

  <p><b>[After his team topped the Dynamo 2-0 last week behind a pair of late goals]</b> It’s a good opportunity, having two good players at every position. When you have two good players in every position, one always is going to feel bad, but they know perfectly well that they’re my friends, they’re my ‘sons’ off the field. I look to put together the XI that will be best for the team. Understandably, some of them aren’t happy. The one who plays is very happy, the one on the bench, you know what he feels. But they know perfectly well that the only chance they have to show is on the training ground and in the matches. I’m going to be fair with the team, and whoever I think is best I’m going to put in. There are times both are good in the same week, but I have to pick one. FIFA doesn’t give me the chance to play with 12 or 14!</p>

  <p><b>[Tigres coping with pressure ahead of Concacaf Champions League final against Monterrey]</b> Here it’s an important thing to have all the players ready to be able to choose the 11 that in your head is the best for the team.

  <p><b>[Tuca Ferretti’s side come into this tie undefeated in their last 10 Champions League home matches]</b> Here the word ‘obligation’ isn’t the right one. I think ‘ambition’ is the word. We have the ambition to achieve something and get us out of this unfortunate situation, and they also do with not having been able to achieve anything in their new stadium. Which of the two? Wednesday we’ll see who achieves the final objective</p>
