  <p>[Toronto FC deserves to celebrate CONCACAF Champions League triumph over Tigres] The elimination leaves us sad, but I’m at peace because the team did everything, everything it had to do to go to the next round. But, it didn’t happen for us today. The team played really well, did things very well, but the winner isn’t always the one who plays better. I think today we were much better. The truth is, we saw a very good performance. If I’m not mistaken, I think they had two, three chances. But this is a game where you take advantage of the opportunities, and they took advantage of them. Us, of the many that we had, we couldn’t finish something more..</p>

  <p>[Ferretti didn’t take questions after the match, offering up a statement and then departing to begin the offseason] A team that played with heart eliminated us. We never had that. A team that gave everything, that ran, eliminated us and we never did that even when they had 10 and we had 11. We never showed superiority when we were a man up. That’s the cause of our elimination. I could sum it up by saying Los Guerreros eliminated some bourgeois Tigres.</p>

  <p>[Tigres coach Tuca Ferretti not interested in Mexico national team job] Since Friday they’ve asked me that question 50,000 times. 50,000 times. It’s something I can’t imagine, honestly. I’ve got a three-year contract with Tigres. Three years with Tigres. I just started my three-year contract on July 1. I’m thinking about seeing it out.<br /><br />I’m going to rest. You’re not going to see me again, you’re not going to see me anywhere. I don’t even want you all to invite me for commentaries or interviews or anything. ‘m not going to be saying anything or ‘sawing off’ parts of others to see if I get a job somewhere<br /><br />It’s not for me. I was with them at a World Cup, and it’s not the time to fill my ego up as the coach of the national team</p>

Now my commitment is to Tigres. I’ve got three years left on my contract. I’ve always looked to be good on my word, but yes you do feel thankful, you could say, but once more, thank you.</p>

This experience today they had, hopefully they have many more. For them to keep having this opportunity [with the national team], they have to do things well with their clubs and when they come here they have to keep that level up.</p>

  <p>[Ferretti reveals previous job offer from USA Soccer] I don’t want to. I don’t know how to speak English, and I don’t want to learn. A long time ago, Sunil Gulati offered me a 10-year contract, but not to be the coach of the national team. It was to organize the youth teams in the United States to develop players for all the teams in MLS. That was a long time ago. Sunil, I’ve known him since I was a player. Now we’re old.<br /><br />I think like Mexico, they have very talented managers. Bruce Arena and other managers, everything they done with the U.S. they’ve done good things. I think both countries have great coaches and have plenty to pick from<br /><br />I believe there is a clause. I don’t know the amount, honestly. I understand that there is one. Aside from that, the thing is that in the first place I want to fulfill my contract, so I’m not going to go and explain that. Once again, everyone can tell me, ‘Oh, you can get here and…’ I already was there. I participated. I filled my ego. If it happens, it would be for other reasons</p>

We’ve played them and they’ve got past us and we’re considered one of Mexico’s best teams. Although it is only speculating, I think they’d do well [in Liga MX]. I don’t think they’d be outside the playoffs, I actually think they would be considered among the teams that are regularly in the playoffs and has a shot at the title</p>

  <p>[Tuca Ferretti defends decision not to call up Mexico regulars] I’ve taken the decision not to call them. It’s my right. I take the responsibility for the lift, but I don’t want to say that they can’t be on it in the future. Every Mexican player can be chosen, and right now although someone might not be in the squad doesn’t say that they’ll never be in it. Right now, I’ve thought that we must observe other players. It’s very clear, you have to see those elements for the 2022 and 2026 World Cups.<br /><br />[Currently, Atlanta United manager Tata Martino and Iran manager Carlos Queiroz are the two coaches who have been most frequently linked with the job] I don’t know if it’s those two guys or if there are more. Honestly, I don’t think I should give my opinion about those two managers. There are people in charge of looking for a manager for the national team. They’re taking their time, the time they need. There’s no hurry, and naturally when they make the decision they’ll make the best one after analyzing all the aspects they want from a manager of the Mexican national team<br /><br />To bring together this group of players and not give them the chance to play wouldn’t be appropriate. I’m thinking of giving minutes to everyone. I have two matches, and I’m able to think about one group for the first game, and another for the second although I still haven’t defined [those groups]</p>

  <p>[Tuca Ferretti said these games have shown how Guzman and the rest of his generation are solving problems on the pitch] A characteristic the young players have is the commitment, the desire to be able to overcome adversities.

  <p>[Mexico face Chile looking to exorcise ghosts of 7-0 Copa America defeat] This is a preparation match, a new stage, there are new players. There’s a not-so-friendly atmosphere around that game because of the way in which they lost. But you shouldn’t play with fear, thinking about what happened. You have to be calm, think about things well. The training sessions are giving me confidence that they can do things well. In that game back then, there were really specific errors all game. You have to be well-organized and play without the ghost of the past result. If we come in thinking about that, the players will feel pressured, paralyzed. I want them to show their quality, give the benefit to the team and look to do things the right way to get a good result<br /><br />[He said of the 2016 match] That topic isn’t spoken about at all. They’re different times. It was another Mexico and another Chile. This rivalry and willingness to always have a good game always will be there, and Mexico comes in after playing a good match against Costa Rica</p>

  <p>[No more moleros? Mexico’s Argentina trip hints at changing strategy for FMF] The simple act of leaving a comfort zone, of not playing in the United States every match, speaks to the intention of the directors to get better in the sporting aspect - which from my point of view has been forgotten about a little. I’m not against the commercial, but now they’re thinking about a better balance between the two areas. If the sporting side arrives to its highest possible point, the other will come on its own.<br /><br />[Ferretti said of the players who opt to stay in Liga MX] Mexican football gives a really important comfort zone because a lot of times they don’t want to risk what they have in Mexico for a little less and a future earning a little more</p>

  <p>[Mexico’s new manager will inherit defensive deficiencies displayed vs Argentina] Today, our ceiling was very far. I expected better soccer from the players. I think we had a lot of mistakes that, how can I tell you, players on this level shouldn’t have. I think that was one of the reasons why they started to dominate the play and the position on the field. Maybe far is drastic, but we do have to work a lot. A lot. We need a lot of work.<br /><br />Nobody wants their players to make mistakes. Tuesday, I expect the team, the players, each one individually play to their level and that after that as a collective they can integrate. It’s not that easy. With a national team you only have one or two day to come together, it really depends on the individual players, on their tactical understanding and I hope Tuesday we can improve on both aspects, the individual and the collective</p>

Are we really supporters or not? This situation isn’t an agreeable one, and if we can’t get it solved we’re going to keep doing the same thing. ‘I’m loaning you the player, but I’m not loaning him.

  <p>[Tuca Ferretti’s interim spell with Mexico comes to an end] I was looking to do my job, take care of what I’m in charge of. Naturally, with this game it’s come to an end. The results obtained weren’t at all to my liking, but I think we’ve got to do an analysis of other situations so the next manager in my situation can take advantage of these six games that were played. There are a number of important players who played at the last World Cup. We have to see who really will be able to get to 2022, and naturally there’s a group of young players who must keep progressing to really be what we hope they can be for the next World Cup.<br /><br />[I provided] time for the federation to be able to find the next manager of our national team. I think it would’ve been premature to have selected someone right away and I think my prescence gave them the time needed to be able to pick this person who will be the person to take the Mexico national team to the next World Cup</p>

  <p>[After his team topped the Dynamo 2-0 last week behind a pair of late goals] It’s a good opportunity, having two good players at every position. When you have two good players in every position, one always is going to feel bad, but they know perfectly well that they’re my friends, they’re my ‘sons’ off the field. I look to put together the XI that will be best for the team. Understandably, some of them aren’t happy. The one who plays is very happy, the one on the bench, you know what he feels. But they know perfectly well that the only chance they have to show is on the training ground and in the matches. I’m going to be fair with the team, and whoever I think is best I’m going to put in. There are times both are good in the same week, but I have to pick one. FIFA doesn’t give me the chance to play with 12 or 14!</p>
