  <p><b>[Sacked Watford manager <a href="javi-gracia.html">Javi Gracia</a> said he was surprised by the sudden nature of his dismissal at Vicarage Road on Saturday. <a href="javi-gracia.html">Gracia</a> was sacked by the Hornets’ owner Gino Pozzo with the team bottom of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> having failed to win any of their first four games of the season]</b> After the unexpected announcement about the termination of my contract after only four matches, I want to express my surprise after completing the best season in Watford’s history. I respect this decision and I’d like to reassure that the excellent relationship I have with Gino Pozzo and Filippo Giraldi, and this is not going to change despite my abrupt exit of the club. I am grateful to this club for allowing me to manage this great club in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, it has been an incredible experience with very special moments like <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup final I had the privilege to enjoy. I want to thank every single person who works for this club and has made my everyday very easy. My gratefulness and love for this club will be eternal. And finally, I want to thank the fans for supporting me the way they did from Day One, until my last. I will always wish the fans and these players the best</p>

All three will now self-isolate for seven days - in line with the protocols set out in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> guidelines - before being tested again at a later date. Strict adherence to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> guidelines has ensured the training ground remains virus-free and a safe environment for the players to continue to work.

  <p><b>[Watford investigate after claims <a href="andre-gray.html">Andre Gray</a> breached lockdown rules with gathering]</b> Watford Football Club is aware of social media posts which suggest two players contravened government lockdown protocols. The club will fully investigate the matter and speak to the players concerned. No further comment will be made.<br /><br />We need to draw on it but it has gone now. It is in the past, it is three points on a day where we weren’t expected to pick any points up. Our focus now has to be on the present. The nature of being in relegation battles is being able to focus on the job in hand and we have to take care of our own performances. That is the benchmark you are aiming for. Not always achievable and teams are coming to terms with playing in a different environment. We have just got to make sure that our game is close to our best. If we do we have always got a chance of winning games, it doesn’t matter who you play against. How I measure our performance is against us, not really against our opponents. If we get our performance somewhere near our best we will always have a chance. We are looking to get as many points as we can. For me it is very much a case of preparing ourselves and having a single-minded approach</p>
