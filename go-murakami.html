  <p><b>[On Arsene Wenger]</b> It was in 1995 and it was my first job as an interpreter. I heard he came from Monaco and I didn’t know about him but everyone said he was a good manager from France. I was told ‘Go, you’re in charge of Mr Wenger’. I spent one-and-a-half years at Grampus Eight and I was always with him, he was a hard worker. At the beginning we had a seven or eight game losing streak, it was difficult at first. He <b>[Wenger]</b> knew everything about nutrition and the mental side, how to control the players. He tried to adapt to the Japanese style, we were just at the beginning in terms of football. He took it back to the basics, how to control, trap the ball and pass. Everybody said it was like going back to school but he thought we needed these things - the basics are important. With nutrition he controlled everything. If vegetables or orange juice had more acid - they were out. Before the day of the game we would have pasta or chicken without any oil. After we kept winning everybody got used to his ideas and understood how it benefited the team. I think Japanese players are disciplined. They follow all the instructions and show respect through saying ‘arigato gozaimas’ <b>[thank you very much]</b>. He likes the culture and the people.<br /><br />For me he is like a philosopher. He speaks with proverbs. For example, he would say ‘Go, football is very simple but playing simple is very difficult’ - I love this kind of thinking. I have lots of memories with my time with Arsene. He’s always watching videos and analysing the next game. Boro Primorac <b>[now Arsenal first team coach]</b> was here too, he’s a kind of funny guy. Wenger is more strict. I went to Arsene’s house one day and he was watching a video, Boro was sitting down next to us eating some snacks. I said ‘boss, can I go home’, he said yes ‘OK, go home’. The next day I asked Boro how long Arsene was watching football for and he told me he stayed up until three in the morning. He’s always like this. Boro stayed with him in the same apartment and he was always joking. My memory of Arsene is that he’s always watching and thinking about football. Football wise he’s a specialist and he likes it<br /><br />He said ‘Go, it’s a good suit. But you haven’t changed’. That photo was four years ago at Arsenal’s Asia Tour. Pixie was the head coach and Wenger was here, there was a press conference and I was translating. It was a great moment<br /><br />Carlos Queiroz came in later on and I also interpreted for him but the results were not so good. I left <b>[Grampus Eight]</b> in 2003 and spent four years abroad as a coach in Palau - a small country in the pacific. In 2008 Pixie <b>[Stojkovic]</b> became head coach and Grampus asked me to come back to Japan to be interpreter as I knew him as a player. We were in a good way after that and first we won the championship in 2010, after that in 2011 we only needed one point to become champion but finished as runners-up. From my point of view the basics are important. My vision is the same as Arsene’s, I follow his instructions. He spent 20 years at Arsenal. To stay more than 20 years in one club is amazing and I think his personality and character is loved by staff and directors. Once he’s familiar with somebody he always takes care of that person, that’s why I still keep contact with him</p>
