  <p><b>[Subra praises JDT as worthy Super League champions]</b> Our target is to stay in the league. Next two games we have to give all we have to win. It’s a big task but it’s not critical. We have to win our game and not worry about what others do.<br /><br />Playing at Larkin isn’t easy. We gave our best. JDT have changed a lot, even the system. Their up three and middle three are really strong. The results today reflect the game and congratulations to them. You can see the qualities. They have all the best players in the country, including the foreigners</p>

  <p><b>[S. Subramaniam chimes in with his opinion on what the 5-import ruling could do to Malaysian football]</b> It’s not good for Malaysian football in the sense that it will hinder the development of young players stepping into the first team. So we won’t get new players and same players will play all the time. How the kids will be good enough if they don’t get match time. How many teams will give 20-year-olds game time? One more is that we have problem is the matches, we don’t have enough matches. We only have 12 teams in the Super League and we only play 22 league games. Malaysia Cup maybe 10 games and FA Cup six games maximum.<br /><br />Thailand has a big pool of good players with more teams in the league. They have 18 teams so including cup games, they will have 45 - 50 games. So players will have enough games. For next five years, if say we go with this five foreigners plan, ok that’s good from a commercial standpoint but how many new players will step into the league? From a commercialization point, it makes sense doing this.<br /><br />There’s pros and cons but in terms of development of young players, it won’t be good. But the quality and competitiveness of the league will definitely improve. It’s an impact for the national team. Over the past few years, it has always been the same set of players. It’s not the fault of the national team coach but our fault<br /><br />If an agreement can be reached - if we take their players, they take some of ours, like an exchange program. At least our players get exposure, which is better than players sitting on the bench and not playing. If a player don’t play at the age of 20, it will hinder his development. Maybe Under-21 one player will start. Then from both leagues, we’ll at least get to see 24 young players playing every week. It might be a solution.<br /><br />If we can get the league to 16 teams, the players will get more game and teams will be looking to have bigger squads. So teams could be looking to give more chance to young boys. We need to have some quota system or ruling because that is also a motivation to the players in President Cup. If I see only established players playing week in week out, how is that going to motivate me? I won’t be able to see my pathway to the top<br /><br />President Cup is not going to give you the same intensity as the Super League. If you see elsewhere, in Europe perhaps, the level of the second division is there but our President Cup is far from the Super League. So when these boys come from the President Cup to the Super League, they will struggle. The coaches won’t gamble on them. I feel for these young boys.<br /><br />Look at Selangor this year. P. Maniam has put in a lot of young boys throughout the season. But if they get another option next year, do you think these boys will get the same amount of chances? I’m not sure, even I won’t do that if I’m the coach. Last year we saw Safawi Rasid. It’s very limited. Even now we only get one or two. Imagine what it is with the extra foreigner</p>
