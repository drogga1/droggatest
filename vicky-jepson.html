  <p><b>[For Vicky Jepson, there is one word which stands out above all others when it comes to the new Women’s Super League season: momentum]</b> What happened with the World Cup was fantastic. And it was so important, too. To see the impact, to see how many people were tuning in to watch, how many people were talking about the sport and how many people were ready to give their support to their team, whether it was England, the USA, whoever, that is inspiring. To get, what was it, over 11 million people watching England play on TV, that’s massive for the sport and it has to be capitalised upon. It’s great to see those players emerge and start to become household names. For me, growing up it was <a href="mia-hamm.html">Mia Hamm</a>, she was the poster I had on my wall. Now, it might be a <a href="lucy-bronze.html">Lucy Bronze</a> or a <a href="steph-houghton.html">Steph Houghton</a>, and that’s great for the sport<br /><br /><b>[For the first time, fans can purchase full season-tickets]</b> Yes, but we can’t just say those kind of things. We can’t just use the World Cup and live off that. It’s up to everyone within the game to do everything we can to get people through the gates. It’s up to us to make sure the product is as good as we can be, and that people remain engaged with the sport. We’ve had a few initiatives which we think will help in that regard, but our aim is to showcase the best of our sport and ensure that fans want to come and watch us on a regular basis<br /><br /><b>[Support from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as a football club will help]</b> The summer was fantastic. It was great to be a part of it and to show that we may be two teams but we are one club. The support and reception from the fans in the States was incredible, and shows just how far ahead the USA is in terms of women’s sport. From our point of view, it was great to experience that support and to take ourselves away from our usual environment, spend some time together, train well and play some good games - even if one of them was played in a ridiculous thunderstorm!<br /><br />We’re happy with what we’ve been able to do, even if as a manager you’d always like a couple more! For us, the key thing will be keeping players fit. That cost us big time last season, when we lost players like Niamh Charles and Jess Clarke at key times, and we just didn’t have the numbers to cope with that. Now I look at our forward options, in particular, and I’m excited by what we can do. We were eighth last season, but I look at this year and think we can look at the top six as a realistic target. There are a lot of good teams in the league, especially with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> coming up, but we have quality ourselves</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool boss Vicky Jepson defended her team after a 2-0 defeat to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, describing winger <a href="lauren.html">Lauren</a> James as a player that no centre-back in the league can deal with]</b> Listen, I’ve worked with <a href="lauren.html">Lauren</a> James at international set-up. She’s an incredible kid - you can’t show her right and you can’t show her left, because she can play off both feet. I don’t think you can tell me one centre half in the league who can deal with <a href="lauren.html">Lauren</a> James because she’s an incredible player. However, I felt the amount of times she got in the box - she only got scored one goal, so I think that’s credit to our back four in dealing with her. It’s tough because first 45 minutes, we really did frustrate them. We were really disciplined in our shape. I thought you couldn’t pick faults with our defensive shape, and actually the pace that we caused them down the sides caused them to make a sub in the second half, with Lotta Okvist coming off to put Amy Turner in, which was a good change for <a href="casey-stoney.html">Casey Stoney</a> <b>[Man United manager]</b> to make, because they were struggling to deal with Rinsola Babajide. She got in loads of times<br /><br />We had three or four opportunities first half when we could have taken the game. Those opportunities are absolutely vital if we want to start getting points in this league. Overall, we conceded a penalty last minute, but we were chucking everything at it. We went to three at the back, chasing the game, so you’re going to be exposed a little bit on the transition. But I thought all in all there are many positives. Yes, we lost, yes I’m absolutely gutted because I hate losing, especially to United. But it was marginal. The last three league games have been marginal defeats<br /><br /><b>[Liverpool will now have chance to regroup as the international break looms]</b> I think this international window has come at the right time for us to reset and refocus. We’ve got a good friendly lined up next week that will help us work on what we’ve looked at and what we’ve been working on over the past couple of weeks. If we were miles away and we were getting battered every week, then I’d probably be looking old and grey. But I’m looking smiley because I know that and I belief believe in my squad that we’re going to get points soon, and the second we click and we get it right going forwards, we’re going to cause teams a lot of problems</p>

  <p><b>[The Reds, whose narrow 1-0 defeat to reigning champions <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> last week extended their winless start to the new season]</b> You saw Bristol lose 7-1 here in midweek. Look at the quality in our squad and the way we’ve held them out. I’ve got no worry whatsoever and neither have the players. It’s too early to talk about the table. We’ve got a tough run now, but we’ll be okay this season because we’ve got too much quality. We’re in a good place. It’s taken time - we were guilty of falling behind and the club’s responded to that. It may be a bit reactive, but Rome wasn’t built in a day</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool Women sign Taylor Hinds from rivals Everton]</b> Taylor is a great signing for our club, she’s an England youth international with a number of years of WSL experience. Taylor will certainly add many qualities to our back line, being able to play off both feet and her pace on the flanks going forward will certainly contribute to building and creating attacks. I’m excited to work with Taylor and push her to develop further, she’s already trained really well this week as a Red and has fitted in well with the squad. I’m sure all Red fans will join me welcoming Taylor to the LFC family</p>
