  <p><b>[Major League Soccer has welcomed FC Cincinnati to its ever-expanding family]</b> Major League Soccer is proud to introduce Cincinnati as our 26th team. The rise of Cincinnati as a passionate soccer market in recent years, coinciding with the city’s growing economy and reputation as a top destination for young professionals makes it an ideal city for our growing league. We congratulate Carl Lindner and his partners, and also the soccer fans of Cincinnati, who have passionately supported FC Cincinnati in the USL.</p>

  <p><b>[FC Cincinnati coach <a href="ron-jans.html">Ron Jans</a> claims he was quoting lyrics a hip-hop song]</b> FC Cincinnati was founded and operates with three core values: (1) being inclusive and family-friendly, (2) having a strong and visible presence in the community, and (3) winning on the field.<br /><br />When club leadership was made aware of the allegation, we were very surprised as building a caring and committed culture has been a focus of Ron’s leadership. We want to fully understand the nature of the incident and allow for an environment for our players to speak freely to any locker room issues. Therefore, while both the Club and <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a> work together, Ron will step away from the team during the investigation.<br /><br />While the investigation is undertaken, the Club is also committed to ensuring every member of the club has a deeper appreciation and awareness for differences in cultures and backgrounds, and will institute training for every member of the organization. The Club will not have further comment on this matter until the conclusion of the joint investigation with MLS</p>
