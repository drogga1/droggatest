  <p><b>[Asamoah Gyan on criticism of his move to China’s Shanghai SIPG]</b> I don’t understand the criticism, I work hard for what I earn. It is not as if I am doing anything illegal or robbing people of their money. At the end of my career, people will not criticise me anymore. They will move on to the next person. And at the end of my career the most important thing will be how well I did for myself, my family and those closest to me. This time is my era so I have to make sure I make the most of it</p>

  <p><b>[Asamoah Gyan talks about being Africa’s leading goalscorer in World Cup history and his admiration for legend <a href="roger-milla.html">Roger Milla</a>]</b> thanks @FIFAWorldCup its always a pleasure to represent my Country Ghana, and breaking the legendary <a href="roger-milla.html">Roger Milla</a>’s 20 years record was one of the best moments in my career having admired his goals scoring prowess and dance as kid … i am humbled</p>

  <p><b>[Asamoah Gyan talks about his missed penalty kick in the quarter-finals against Uruguay at the 2010 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup South Africa]</b> Sometimes things happen in the game and you face a lot of the ups and downs but it is something you cannot change. I am always trying to be a better man and sometimes when I’m alone in my room, I just think about all these things. I wish it could be rewound but it has happened. It’s going to live with me for the rest of my life. Something can happen like it again and I can redeem myself or maybe my son or nephew is going to do it in the future and you might never know. But if it doesn’t happen like that then I’m going to live with it for the rest of my life</p>

  <p><b>[Ghana captain Asamoah Gyan has disagreed with recommendations made by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry for the Black Stars’ 2014 World Cup campaign in Brazil]</b> The Commission of Inquiry wasn’t fair to me at all. I have done my best for Ghana by creating jobs in the country. In Ghana, I have employed more than 300 people and I pay them every month, I also pay taxes. So I’m doing my best in improving Ghana’s economy. I haven’t been to a leadership school but I have been doing a lot in the economy. When I moved from England to UAE, people said I moved because of money, when I moved to China they said the same thing. I will say the money I got is what I’m investing in the country. I have created jobs in the nation. For me the commission’s report was not fair to me.</p>

  <p><b>[Afcon 2019: Ghana ace Asamoah Gyan wants more playing time]</b> Every player wants to play but at the end of the day, the coach takes the decision. I just have to be mentally and physically ready for the game and anytime I’m given the opportunity, I can also prove my worth. I’m ready now<br /><br /><b>[The former Sunderland man also spoke about his introduction in Saturday’s draw with Cameroon]</b> Honestly, it’s all about timing. I’m happy that I played but I think I should have been on a bit earlier. During camping I didn’t have enough time. I’m just coming back to my normal shape. I’m happy I had some game time against Cameroon. Hopefully, l get more time against Guinea-Bissau. I don’t know what’s going to happen but let’s be hopeful</p>

I urge all celebrities, all those who are fortunate, let’s give back to the community because this is the time that people need up. People need our support<br /><br />Let’s do this to help the government because the government cannot do this alone. We can’t depend on the government, these are our lives. We have to protect one another; we have to stick together<br /><br />Let’s take precaution, stay at home, use your hand sanitizers, let’s do everything possible to protect ourselves</p>

  <p><b>[Asamoah Gyan tells about the experience of missing his penalty kick against Uruguay in the 2010 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup South Africa™ quarter-finals]</b> Till today, any time alone, it still haunts me. Sometimes I feel like the world should go back again so I can redeem myself, but I know this is something that will haunt me for the rest of my life. I accept that because there is nothing I can do about it. I went there to save my country, but I ended up being the villain, which I accept because I know how people feel. It was a disaster. It was crazy. I was also calm because I couldn’t sleep the whole night because I was crying the whole night until morning, so I was somehow calm because I couldn’t cry anymore. All I was telling myself was to get another chance because I knew I could redeem myself even if not football, something else. But even if I don’t, my kids will do it one day</p>
