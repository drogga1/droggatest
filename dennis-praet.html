<p>: 2019 08 08
Leicester City have confirmed the signing of attacking midfielder Dennis Praet from Sampdoria for a reported £18 million</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Leicester midfielder Dennis Praet has revealed that he turned down the opportunity to move to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> when he was a teenager]</b> I had three or four really good options. We went to visit <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, Lille, <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and Anderlecht. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> would have been a really nice step and I could earn a lot more money there than in Anderlecht, but at that moment my education was not finished and that was really important for me - there was no insurance that I would become a good football player<br /><br />It was a really close call because it was deadline day. I arrived at the training ground but there were some small issues with the contract and I think it was only one hour before the deadline that everything was figured out, so I signed just in time. But I arrived here with the thought that if I sign, I could go back to get my stuff I needed. But the gaffer really wanted me to stay for the first game. I had no boots, so I did two training sessions and the first game with somebody else’s. I don’t even know whose they were<br /><br /><b>[Praet’s research for the move was equally unusual - as it was conducted on the <a href="sampdoria-fc.html">Sampdoria</a> team coach]</b> We were driving to a friendly game and I watched the second half of <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> v Atalanta. Was really surprised by the way <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> were playing - with a really high press, really nice football, a lot of chances. At that moment I was sold</p>
