  <p><b>[Clint Dempsey speaking in Seattle about the first time he played as himself in the EA SPORTS™ <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> video games]</b> I remember playing games and you have to create your own player and your own image. And the first time being on the game and playing yourself was crazy. But at the same time it is depressing because you see what your stats are and you then try to work harder, to make sure you are performing better on the field - so when you play yourself in the game you will be doing better.</p>

  <p><b>[Seattle Sounders forward Clint Dempsey is closing in on full fitness]</b> It was a heart issue. It’s something that’s difficult to kind of explain. But at the same time I’m not feeling those things anymore and I’m happy to be back playing.<br /><br />I was able to consistently progress and work on my fitness and make sure everything was moving in the right direction. It started off slow and had to work my way up and still working up now but feeling like I’m finally getting close<br /><br />It would be great to get back in with the U.S. team. But to do that I have to do well here and that’s the main focus - <b>[it’s]</b> here with Seattle and making an impact on the field here</p>

  <p><b>[On Nicolas Lodeiro]</b> He’s a great player who really helps the team keep possession and creates opportunities for the team and for himself in the attacking third. He also works really hard defensively. He’s really fun to play with and I look forward to connecting with him more this season.<br /><br /><b>[On Cristian Roldan and Jordan Morris]</b> They’re huge for us. They were a big part of what we were able to do on the field. The played a big part in terms of helping the team make the playoffs and make that playoff run that got an MLS Cup. I’m glad to see them improving and they’ll be even stronger for us this season. It just adds more depth and adds more weapons to your team. The future looks bright for both of these guys<br /><br />When Roman Torres got back there, it just gave us a more dominating presence there in terms of his physicality and what he brings alongside Chad as a center back pairing<br /><br /> feel like we still have a core group of guys who were a part of the run that got the team to win the MLS Cup final. We’re just looking to build on that and add some pieces. It’s always unfortunate to lose guys like Nelson Valdez, Andreas Ivanschitz, Tyrone Mears and Erik Friberg, who all played a big part in helping the team win MLS Cup. But unfortunately you can’t always keep everybody<br /><br />You know you’ve got a target on your back after the team won MLS Cup. It’s just about using it as motivation and knowing you’re going to get your opponents’ best</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic shines in playmaker role as USA routs Honduras]</b> Man, he’s a great player. He can beat people one-on-one on the dribble. He creates mismatches because of that. Someone else has to kind of push to him, and if you’re able to make good runs he’ll find you. It’s great to have players like that, that can win that one-v-one battle and break teams open.</p>

  <p><b>[Clint Dempsey continues to fight winning battle against father time]</b> Well, it’d be awesome. It’d be a dream come true. Any time you play in a World Cup it’s a dream come true. It’s one thing to say and another thing to do it. You’ve got to stay relevant, you’ve got to stay producing and you can’t just say it and that’s going to happen. I have to be on the field and do it. I’m just taking each game as it comes and hopefully I can play a part in helping the team. Yeah, that’d be great if I can be around for that.<br /><br />Just going through the situation, it’s tough. Trying to get back on the field I had to take a step back and I had to get going again and, yeah, there’s moments you don’t know if things are going to get right and you’ve got to pray about it. Yeah, there’s moments where you’re sitting at home and praying that things will work out. I’m just blessed that I can keep going, its what I love to do and hopefully there’s more time left</p>

  <p><b>[USA District Court in Texas has dismissed a class-action lawsuit filed by a trio of youth clubs against the MLS Players Union and U.S. national team stars Michael Bradley, DeAndre Yedlin and Clint Dempsey. Bob Foose said]</b> We have said consistently that training compensation and solidarity payments are bad for players, and would treat players differently than employees in any other industry, including sports. For example, it’s absurd to think that a business school could demand a fee from a company that hired one of its students. Yet, that’s the kind of payments the youth clubs seek.<br /><br />No player should have the market for his services adversely affected by these payments. This is not to say that players and the Players Union don’t believe in and support youth development. We do, but it should not be funded through a tax on randomly selected professional players’ contracts</p>

  <p><b>[Clint Dempsey poised to rewrite U.S. record book]</b> <b>[It surprised me]</b> a little bit. You never really know what’s going to happen obviously. You try to go out and get goals. My goals-per-game ratio with the national team has always been pretty good, but to get four in two was a little bit of a surprise I would say. There’s a lot of quality on the team. They put you in good positions to get chances. I think that’s why you get better looks in front of goal and I think that’s why you get more goals.<br /><br />You never really know of the situation. You’ve got to make sure that you feel all right to come back. They told me that what I have wasn’t life-threatening, and that I would be back. I just believed them, kept working, followed the protocol and was able to get back out there<br /><br /><b>[Dempsey and Altidore have rekindled a strike partnership]</b> I would say we’re both hungry to score and create for each other. Whether it’s goals or assists. He’s a strong guy who can hold up the ball really well in the attacking third and bring others into play so it’s good to play with him.<br /><br />I owe a lot to him. He called me into the first national team camp. He called me into the World Cup. Started me in a game in the World Cup. Gave me the opportunity to accomplish my dream as a kid, score in a World Cup. So I owe a lot to him. Doing well on that stage kind of opened up the door for me in Europe and gave me the opportunity to accomplish that dream as well</p>

  <p><b>[Clint Dempsey delivers that something special USMNT needed to reach Gold Cup final]</b> It’s bigger than me man. It was something that was already written it seems like. I couldn’t have pictured a better scenario, coming off the bench and getting a goal and assist, and helping the team get to the final. That’s a dream come true.<br /><br />It means a lot, especially after a few heart procedures, being able to be back on the pitch and play at this level and be competitive. That feels great<br /><br /><b>[Arena’s decision to leave Dempsey out of the starting lineup a questionable one]</b> That’s what Bruce said. He thought it was going to be a tight game, where he could bring me on late and I could open up. It was always going to be a little bit difficult trying to go 90 three days after going 90 at 34. I was happy with the decision, and glad I could come on and make an impact</p>

  <p><b>[The USMNT isn’t shedding any tears over Mexico’s surprising Gold Cup exit]</b> It’s not different. I think we would have been expected to win <b>[regardless of]</b> whoever we were playing. We’re on home soil, we have a strong team. There is always that pressure to succeed. It’s going to be a difficult game, no matter who we were going to play. We’ll prepare and go out there put our best group forward to try to bring the cup home.<br /><br /><b>[when asked about the key to beating Blake]</b> You just have to get chances. Put the chances you get on goal, put them on frame and make him work. Put him under pressure. The more chances you create obviously the better chances you have to score. We just have to make sure we are good in the attack and creating chances, trying to be clinical in front of goal. He’s athletic. Tall ‘keeper, long arms. He can make some big saves. He’s good coming out on crosses and being brave in there. But at the end of the day, we got Tim Howard, who we face all the time in training. Going up against him prepares us for anybody</p>

We have good possession in the attacking third, we’ll have good chances so I’m looking forward to the challenge.<br /><br /><b>[Dempsey said of the 2016 final]</b> It was tough not being able to be on the field and battle with the guys. As the game went on, I started getting more nervous what was going to happen and then it went to a penalty shootout and before that <b>[Stefan Frei]</b> with the great save. Our team battled very hard and they were able to see the game out in penalties.
