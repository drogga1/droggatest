  <p><b>[Clint Dempsey speaking in Seattle about the first time he played as himself in the EA SPORTS™ <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> video games]</b> I remember playing games and you have to create your own player and your own image. And the first time being on the game and playing yourself was crazy. But at the same time it is depressing because you see what your stats are and you then try to work harder, to make sure you are performing better on the field - so when you play yourself in the game you will be doing better.</p>

  <p><b>[Clint Dempsey at Seattle’s THE NINETY for the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Interactive World Cup 2016 Host Country Qualifier]</b> He’s cool. I remember back when you’d have to create your own player and your own image. The first time I was included in the game and played as myself was crazy … it was a bit depressing to see my stats though, so I tried try to work harder, to make sure I performed better on the field, so that when I play as myself in the game that I’d be doing better!</p>

  <p><b>[Seattle Sounders forward Clint Dempsey is closing in on full fitness]</b> It was a heart issue. It’s something that’s difficult to kind of explain. But at the same time I’m not feeling those things anymore and I’m happy to be back playing.<br /><br />I was able to consistently progress and work on my fitness and make sure everything was moving in the right direction. It started off slow and had to work my way up and still working up now but feeling like I’m finally getting close<br /><br />It would be great to get back in with the U.S. team. But to do that I have to do well here and that’s the main focus - <b>[it’s]</b> here with Seattle and making an impact on the field here</p>

  <p><b>[On Nicolas Lodeiro]</b> He’s a great player who really helps the team keep possession and creates opportunities for the team and for himself in the attacking third. He also works really hard defensively. He’s really fun to play with and I look forward to connecting with him more this season.<br /><br /><b>[On Cristian Roldan and Jordan Morris]</b> They’re huge for us. They were a big part of what we were able to do on the field. The played a big part in terms of helping the team make the playoffs and make that playoff run that got an MLS Cup. I’m glad to see them improving and they’ll be even stronger for us this season. It just adds more depth and adds more weapons to your team. The future looks bright for both of these guys<br /><br />When Roman Torres got back there, it just gave us a more dominating presence there in terms of his physicality and what he brings alongside Chad as a center back pairing<br /><br /> feel like we still have a core group of guys who were a part of the run that got the team to win the MLS Cup final. We’re just looking to build on that and add some pieces. It’s always unfortunate to lose guys like Nelson Valdez, Andreas Ivanschitz, Tyrone Mears and Erik Friberg, who all played a big part in helping the team win MLS Cup. But unfortunately you can’t always keep everybody<br /><br />You know you’ve got a target on your back after the team won MLS Cup. It’s just about using it as motivation and knowing you’re going to get your opponents’ best</p>

  <p><b>[Houston Dynamo 2-1 Seattle Sounders]</b> I felt good. I’m still trying to get to my top level. I’m not there yet but I think if you watch preseason, it’s been a steady progression. I look to be better hopefully next game..</p>

  <p><b>[American soccer legend Clint Dempsey announces retirement]</b> After a lot of thought, my family and I have decided that this is the right time for me to step away from the game. I’d like to thank all of the teammates, coaches and support staff that I’ve worked with throughout my career. It has always been my dream to make it as a pro. I’m grateful to have been on this ride. I would like to thank all of the fans who have supported me throughout my career with the New England Revolution, Fulham, Tottenham, Seattle Sounders and the U.S. men’s national team. Y’all have always made me feel at home, and it is something that I will always remember.</p>
