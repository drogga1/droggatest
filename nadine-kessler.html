  <p><b>[Women’s World Player of the Year Nadine Kessler on her pick for this 2015 winner at the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Ballon d’Or Gala]</b> It’s a simple fact that if you’re captain of the world champions, perform fantastically at the tournament and score amazing goals, then for me (Carli) Lloyd is favourite for the title and would be a deserving winner</p>

  <p><b>[UEFA and Disney launch women’s football project]</b> Playmakers can attract girls who might not have had any contact with football at all, or might be generally not very active. Our ultimate goal is, first of all, to get them active and to learn different kinds of movement before the football comes in. But we would be very, very happy if the girls are that inspired and that in love with the game that they wish to continue their route</p>

  <p><b>[Nadine Kessler says she is excited about the addition of Old Trafford to next year’s tournament]</b> This <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Women’s EURO 2021 will be ground-breaking from start to finish. To kick-off at the ‘Theatre of Dreams’ in Manchester, and to have the final at the iconic Wembley Stadium shows just how far the game has come. This is what women’s football deserves. To play in such stadia is what you strive for - as a player, coach, referee and a fan. I am so happy for everyone who will have the opportunity to experience this. Our goal is to deliver a memorable tournament and inspire the next generation of football-loving girls and boys. Knowing <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> and England’s long-term commitment to the women’s game, we have no doubt that we will achieve this together and set a new European benchmark</p>
