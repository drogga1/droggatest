  <p><b>[Hernan Cristante said the team won’t make major changes after the disappointment]</b> When things are going well, you have to keep working and when things go poorly I think you have to stay on the path you’re on. I think today the team was beaten by the other side’s determination. I’m the one who’s at fault with that. I think I made a mistake with the selection of the starting XI.</p>

  <p><b>[Toluca a strange leader]</b> They’re difficult teams who give you very little space. You have to create options however you can. At no time was it an easy game.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Toluca the biggest story nobody in Mexico is talking about]</b> I think yes, Toluca has become one of the favorites, but that doesn’t guarantee you anything at all. Anything we might say can change in a game. Today we’re a consistent team and powerful concerning the game. We’re a difficult team for anybody. We’re candidates like the other seven teams who are going to get into the Liguilla</p>

  <p><b>[Santos Laguna, Toluca share history, chip on shoulder heading into Liga MX final]</b> The uncertainty increases, the adrenaline because if this is going to become a Clasico, they’re two teams that want to beat each other. They’re not to teams who <b>[might say]</b>, ‘Well, we’re going to control they game,’ They lack a bit of respect for the other team. No. It’s two teams who respect each other a whole lot and despite what you might want to think about respecting the opponent, the teams who have respect give more on the field than what they have. I’m talking about heart and I’m talking about intensity</p>

  <p><b>[Santos Laguna pulls out another home win, but one-goal advantage might not be enough to win Liga MX]</b> Play very well. It’s going to be a very difficult match like this one. It’s going to be game where they’re going to look to use their strength, which is their speed in attack. It’s a team where they double things up very quickly, so we have to be cautious. Obviously the team has to take a few risks to go for the result we’re looking for.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Hernan Cristante said he had spoken out of frustration rather than considering his message]</b> I had a reaction to a bad comment. I can’t disrespect absolutely anyone, and when the match ended I felt more outside the team than in it. That’s what I told <b>[Toluca sporting director]</b> Jaime <b>[Leon]</b> and Francisco <b>[Suinaga, Toluca’s vice president]</b> and it was a moment where I got heated<br /><br />I’m just the manager and it’s not my place to disrespect anyone at the club. I made a mistake. Someone made a comment that wasn’t appropriate or not at the appropriate time and I had an unnecessary reaction<br /><br /><b>[Cristante was speaking after his team’s elimination from the Copa MX despite Amaury Escoto’s late equalizer that somewhat saved face for Toluca in a 2-2 draw with second-division FC Juarez]</b> A lot of managers have rescued their jobs with the Copa. We all put importance on it, but for us it’s gone, it got away. It hurts, and it’s a hard blow. It’s a failure, and that’s how we’re taking it</p>
