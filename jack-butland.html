  <p><b>[Jack Butland has warned Joe Hart that he is out to take his place as England’s No 1 goalkeeper]</b> Obviously I wanted to represent my country this year, but these things happen and I need to stay focused. Of course, I want to play for England as often as I can and at major tournaments. I’m doing everything I can to try and achieve that and that comes ultimately from playing well for Stoke first. That’s my motivation every weekend, ultimately I want to put pressure on Joe <b>[Hart]</b>, it’s a long process but I believe if play like I have been this season I’ll be England’s next No.1.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be a tournament I get to feature in. I get the best out of Joe and he gets the best out of me, but ultimately I want his place in the England team<br /><br /><b>[Butland also lifted the lid on his relationship with Hart]</b> It’s friendly rivalry that we have. We are not best mates, we keep our distance to a certain extent, but it’s a good relationship I have with him. Every now and again outside of England camps we talk. We don’t live too far away from one another and my girlfriend and his wife get on well - we occasionally bump into them. I text him every now and again to wish him well for Champions League games. When we go away with England it’s a really good environment, we push each other and that’s a brilliant situation to be in</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland admits reports suggesting that he is a summer transfer target for Arsenal are positive]</b> I must have done all right this past year, I can’t remember! That’s football. It’s not anywhere near the transfer window yet, but that’s the way papers work. I just take it as a positive that I’m still thought about in the football world after so long out. But my focus is on Stoke, always has been, and playing well. I’m just worried about getting playing again, getting the gloves and boots back on. My only focus is playing again for Stoke, getting some game time before the end of the season and hopefully start getting back into the England side as well.</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Butland has hailed Manchester United as the biggest club in the world amid talk of a possible move to Old Trafford]</b> y ambitions are to be the Stoke number one and England number one, but there are other things I want to achieve in my career as well. I want to play in the Champions League and I want to win trophies. There’s no reason why we can’t win trophies at Stoke, we’ll try and win some cups and do as well as we can, but I obviously have ambitions. If it’s the right move at the right time, you never know. You always have to think about these things.<br /><br />A club like Manchester United, or whoever it may be … United are, for me, the biggest club in the world and you have to take those things in consideration. But if it’s right, if it’s not, I’ll make those decisions at the time. I’m back in a Stoke kit at the minute and I’m focussed on doing as well as I can in pre-season and the season ahead, and what will be, will be. It’s all just speculation and rumours at the moment, and I don’t get into that too deeply.</p>

  <p><b>[Jack Butland has been re-assured about his place in the national team]</b> You can argue that the standard is different <b>[in the Championship]</b>, but it’s still a very demanding league and I still have to be at the top of my game. I still have to be fit, strong, train well and play well. If I can do that, I’d like to think I can stay in the squad. The manager’s reassured me of that. We’ve had a lot of conversations. If I’m in the Championship beyond this season, then obviously things start to get a bit trickier, but certainly for this year he’s reassured me that if I can keep my standards high, I can be a part of the team.<br /><br />It’s not particularly difficult if you’re comfortable doing it. We’ve done it all week in training. So for me, I enjoy it, I like the challenge, I like the experience of being able to do it, so it’s nice to have that opportunity to do it with England</p>
