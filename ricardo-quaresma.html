I hope they manage to sell more books. But selling more books doesn’t make them know more about football than the rest</p>

  <p><b>[Ricardo Quaresma has hailed Cristiano Ronaldo as the only person in football he admires after Portugal’s Euro 2016 victory]</b> Even with the injury <b>[Ronaldo]</b> never stopped, he always supported the team and that’s why I say, not just as a friend, that he is the only person I admire in football. I admire the strength he has.<br /><br />We have a great captain, it is an honour to play alongside him and have him in the national team and all Portuguese people should be proud to have Cristiano. <b>[His critics]</b> speak of him and do not know him as a person. He is a great person, a great captain and he deserves everything he has achieved in football. He always has confidence and is positive and that’s what he gave us</p>
