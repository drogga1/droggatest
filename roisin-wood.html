  <p><b>[Anti-discrimination organisation Kick it Out says educating rather than punishing fans should be top priority after a start to the Premier League season marred by illicit chants]</b> Education sits central to everything we do. We have no interest in banning fans unless it’s proportionate to what they’ve done. What we’re interested in saying to some fans is that it’s not what the player wants and not what the club wants. Some fans have actually come through to us and said ‘we do find that offensive, we don’t want to hear that’. That’s what’s important, to educate fans. We’re not there to punish you. You’re supporting your player, your club, I get that, so talk to us about some of the things you could do to help.<br /><br /><b>[Despite the chanting in the Premier League, Wood believes British football remains at the forefront of the fight against discrimination across the continent]</b> I think we’re still leading the way. We’ve come a long way in the last 25 years. Is there loads to do? Absolutely there is. But I still see some of the things coming through to us from Europe and I’m talking to people who have travelled abroad with some of the teams and they say you’re not going to hear here what you’re hearing there.<br /><br />We’ve still got loads to do but I think we’re not very good at communicating what we do sometimes. We need to get better at that. The messages of diversity and inclusion, I just don’t think we tell the world that all the time</p>

  <p><b>[Kick It Out reveals racism, sexism and discrimination increase in UK football]</b> Kick It Out’s reporting statistics for the 2016-17 season clearly indicate discrimination is still prevalent within the beautiful game. As we head towards the 25th anniversary of the organisation in August 2018, it is a timely reminder that there is still significant work to be done to ensure all participants can feel safe and included in the sport.<br /><br />Whilst the statistics show a large proportion of reporting taking place within the professional game, Kick It Out is aware of the vast scale of under-reporting within the grassroots game. This is one of a number of challenges the football authorities must tackle going forward.<br /><br />Kick It Out actively encourages all those involved across the game to report any discrimination they witness or suffer.</p>

  <p><b>[Education the only way to stamp out Italy’s anti-Semitism problem]</b> I don’t understand why anyone would think any racism is banter. We take anti-Semitism seriously. Last year we saw an increase in the reports around anti-Semitism. It is illegal.<br /><br />I’m not surprised as having lived and worked in Italy for seven years these stickers are widely distributed across Rome on both Lazio and Roma sides. Italian people by nature are not violent, they’re not nasty people. They’re very welcoming. But on topics like this they are very ignorant. They don’t get it. For me the key difference between Italy and England in terms of anti-Semitism and racism is simple. It’s ignorance. Where it’s bandied about as banter it’s ignorance and nothing else.<br /><br />In England, the average person in terms of their knowledge of the Second World War, its implications, is slightly higher. In Italy, they might see something as a joke and not actually know the true implications of it. For me, that’s the key. In England, we’re a bit further ahead in terms of what’s accepted and we understand the reasons why<br /><br />If it’s in society it’s in football. Football has to be really strong in taking that chance to highlight this - even more than normal society. We need to educate people to know this is racist and what will happen to them if they are found guilty of it.</p>
