  <p><b>[Former Central Coast Mariners captain John Hutchinson has joined Seattle Sounders as an assistant coach for their reserve team]</b> We are very pleased to bring John into our technical staff. In addition to his robust professional career as player, his coaching philosophy and leadership qualities fit very well in our organization. I look forward to seeing how he develops our young players and helps them grow on and off the field.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Central Coast Mariners captain and assistant coach John Hutchinson is now with the reserve team of MLS outfit Seattle Sounders]</b> I think Australia’s missed the boat a long time ago in implementing that. You know, you see a lot of players now leaving Australia, young players have to leave because there are just not enough jobs for them professionally, and they end up going overseas early and then they end up losing their way. It’s the same with the coaching, isn’t it? The coaches obviously want to progress and keep learning but there are not enough jobs in Australia for players or coaches. sSo in America they’ve got their stuff sorted. They’ve got this system underneath the MLS that runs really well. It’s professional, it’s full-time.<br /><br />As soon as they offered me the job, I literally answered 10 minutes later and accepted the job. Seattle’s GM called me and said ‘we haven’t even spoken about money etcetera’ and I’m like ‘I don’t really care. I just want to work with full-time footballers again.’ So we got that sorted straight away</p>

  <p><b>[John Hutchinson has revealed that Central Coast Mariners coach Paul Okon never spoke to him during his departure from the club where he spent 12 years]</b> It was obviously tough. Once Tony got sacked and you know you’re in limbo land because a new coach is going to come in and not want you, and all that kind of stuff. Once Okon got the job and I hadn’t spoken to him at all at that stage, you know you’re not going to keep your job anyway. I had myself prepared once Tony left I was going to lose my job. Okon didn’t speak to me at all the whole time. So in terms of that, that was really disappointing. To be at a club for 12 years and the head coach can’t even have a chat to you - that was really disappointing<br /><br /><b>[Hutchinson still hopes to return to Gosford and coach the Mariners one day]</b> I don’t really have much to do with them at the moment, which is sad<br /><br /><b>[After leaving Central Coast in August, Hutchinson travelled around the world on a professional development tour]</b> Just to have a look about, see what other teams do and just see some different coaching styles and all that. So my first stop was actually Seattle and I came here because I’d made contact with Dave Tenney, who is the ‘S and C’ <b>[strength and conditioning]</b> guru here, and I came over for a week here. Went to Qatar as well, went to Hong Kong and then I emailed the <b>[Sounders’]</b> GM when they made the <b>[2016 MLS Cup final]</b> to wish them all the best and from there, they told me a coaching job was available. I applied for it, went through the interview process and got the job<br /><br /><b>[The Gippsland-born coach is relishing his time in the Pacific Northwest, with S2 sitting fifth in the USL’s Western Conference after 10 games]</b> It’s an incredible football club, a wonderful club. It’s run so well. It’s highly professional; the training facilities are really good. I think Australia needs <b>[a professional second division]</b> desperately … so we can keep players in Australia, and they can stay there and become better footballers and the coaches don’t have to go hunting around the world looking for jobs. I’m enjoying my time, though, here. I wouldn’t want it any other way</p>
