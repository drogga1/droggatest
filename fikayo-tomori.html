I have nothing but good words to say about Derby, the club, the fans and my team-mates. I am really proud. We are disappointed and we are hurting, but we had such a fantastic season. Even though we lost, we still had a lot of good moments to look back on and cherish. I am not really thinking about Chelsea at the moment but we will see when the new season comes</p>

We said at half-time that we wanted to up it again but we didn’t do that. We conceded a goal really early on in the second half and it becomes very difficult when you do that. It’s disappointing but we just have to learn from it. This is <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, we’re a big club and there’s a lot of expectations but we’re here to try to meet those expectations<br /><br /><b>[Some voiced their frustrations on social media at a perceived naivety from <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> in bringing on 18-year-old Gilmour as his side fought to close out the game - and eventually failed to do so]</b> There are high standards and when we fall below those standards then of course there will be questions. It’s not always going to be perfect but in games like today, when we’re in such a strong position and then we throw it away, it’s disappointing. I’m here to try and push everyone else in the squad in my position so it was nice to get my full debut. I’m very proud but it would have been even better for us to get the win. We (Tomori, <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> and Mason Mount) have gone through the whole process and we’ve seen a lot of people come and go so to get to this stage is good but obviously now we want more. We want to really cement our places in the team and do big things for this club</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori has said it has been a ‘mad turnaround’ to go from playing on loan at <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> to a first call-up to the England squad]</b> Yeah, I wasn’t really expecting it. I came in this season trying to improve myself and give myself the best chance to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Playing for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is what I’ve been doing since I was seven years old, so it’s nice it’s happened this way. Having the manager say that about you is nice and that’s what you want. I know he has that faith in me and he’s showed me that faith last year and this year. I’ve just tried to work hard and I knew coming back for pre-season I would have to take myself up a couple of levels and I was going to have to learn from other people. So, that’s what I’ve been doing and it’s nice he’s saying that, but I want to carry on and keep improving<br /><br /><b>[Tomori could have instead opted to play for Canada, where he was born, or Nigeria, where his parents hail from, and he acknowledged he had to think hard about choosing England]</b> England is such a big nation, as well as Nigeria and Canada, so I think I was going to be happy with whoever called me up - but it’s nice it is England. It wasn’t England all the way. I had certain people and certain things that I had to consider. I spoke to my family and people that I care about it and that’s the decision I came to. So, when England came calling, it was difficult to say no.<br /><br />It was just more of a thing I was waiting for a call-up because the last international break I didn’t get a call-up from anyone. This international break, I was waiting for a call-up and England called me up. It’s been a good week. Nice to get the England call-up, but winning in Lille and today, it’s been a good week. The manager (Lampard) told me in the changing room after the Lille game (about his England call-up) so I knew a day before and I had to keep it a secret.<br /><br />I told my family and then it got announced on Thursday. Not at all <b>[did I see it coming]</b>. The manager told me and I was like ‘oh’. It was a nice feeling. I’d say so <b>[that it came quicker than I expected]</b>. Last season, I wasn’t expecting to be there but I never really put a limit on saying I couldn’t do it. It was just more a case of I’ve got to give my best for my club and wherever I was going to be playing week in, week out and try to get in the squad wherever I was. It is obviously good I am here and now, to be in the England squad, it’s a mad turnaround for myself<br /><br /><b>[He is thriving under <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> and his coaching staff]</b> It makes it a lot easier because the manager outlines what he wants from us and we try not to change it up too much. It’s still the same principles of we want to press, we want to work hard for each other. Regardless of the shape, those are the fundamentals and the basics of what we want to be doing. It makes it easier if we switch from a three to a four. Sometimes you have to adapt to the opposition but most of the time we want to play our own game</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori has recalled accidentally breaking <a href="diego-costa.html">Diego Costa</a>’s nose in a training session]</b> I was actually still in school and I didn’t know I had done it in training. It was an accident, we both went up for a header and I had to flick the ball backwards and he tried to score. He headed the back of my head and he broke his nose. I didn’t know I had done it until the next day when it was all over the papers. I was getting a lot of messages with people thinking I had meant to do it! It was mostly light-hearted, a lot of banter. I got back to school and people were asking about it. I was in year 10 or 11 and my mates had all seen it. It was all right. He didn’t kick me in training after that<br /><br /><b>[Tomori admits that he did not foresee <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> leaving to join Arsenal]</b> Yeah, I wasn’t really expecting <b>[Luiz to leave]</b>.

  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori believes spending last season out on loan with Derby set him up for a big season at Stamford Bridge]</b> I think that every single player that goes on loan from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, the end goal is to make it into the team and I’ve been fortunate enough to get a taste of that this season. Most importantly when I was on loan at Derby was to try and develop myself as much as possible, try and learn the game a bit more and if the time did come to come back to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, that I’d be fully prepared and more prepared than if I went somewhere else for example</p>

We have got a lot of talented players, so you just have to be patient and when you get your chance you have just got to take it like he did on Saturday. I am really happy for him - that patience and hard work he showed in training has paid off. You have got to be on top of your game, not only in the games but in training as well. It is good Christian has come in because everyone has to be on their toes. No one knows their position is safe and that drives the team on and brings the best out of each individual<br /><br /><b>[Tomori thinks strong competition for places at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will help raise the overall level of the team]</b> Callum was rested on Saturday and Christian comes in and scores a hat-trick. That is going to raise Callum’s game and then Christian is going to want to keep raising his game to stay in the team. We have a young team, an exciting team, and we all try to help each other out as the games go on and in training.

  <p><b>[Tomori opens up on journey from Hull loan to a Blues match-winner]</b> Everything has kind of happened really fast this last year. I haven’t really had time to take it in. In the little time I’ve had to think about it, I’m proud of what I’ve done, but it’s only the beginning. I want to achieve more; I want to win some trophies and play more games for England.<br /><br />I was playing full-back <b>[at Hull]</b> and, yeah, I wouldn’t say I didn’t foresee it because I wasn’t looking that far ahead. I was just thinking about Hull and trying to do as well as I could for myself. I think at a club like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, there’s competition for places everywhere.<br /><br />You have to be on top of your game and then the manager has to make decisions. He chose to leave me out for some games. I have to respect his decision and try and work hard on the training pitch so when my chance comes, I can hopefully take it.<br /><br />Hopefully I’ve given him something to think about and next week I can be in the team. I am not only learning about myself but the way the game is played and how to communicate in a good way. Every single game I am learning and I am trying to relay that to everyone else.<br /><br />I think with winning games and playing games it builds confidence. I feel a lot more confident than I was in the beginning of the season so I feel like I have a bigger role to play in the team. That’s whether I am in the team or not I feel like that’s in what I need to bring to the training sessions and the changing room even though I am just starting out. Us young players are encouraged to talk in the changing room and use our voices. This season as it has gone on I have tried to do that a lot more. We young players have a lot of personalities even though we are young and we just want to show what we can do<br /><br /><b>[Tomori admitted that if his side are as sloppy against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> as they were against Hull that they will lose in the upcoming game at the King Power Stadium on Saturday]</b> We know that they are a good team and they are having a good season. We know they have a lot of threats and today, if we play like we did, we can get punished. If we have chances, we have to take them. We have to defend better. I think if we have the chance to kill the game next week, then we should. It is easier said than done but throughout this week we are going to work out how we can stop them and bring our game out as well. In the first half, we probably should have had the game won. We knew, especially in the second half, they were going to come at us. They did make it difficult for us and we scored our goal at a good time. They then scored their goal and that made it more difficult for us</p>

I’m just staying positive, and in the grand scheme of things the most important thing is that the team wins<br /><br />We expect a tough game. Earlier on in the season they managed to beat us. They have a new manager now; they have had a lot of good results. But they are coming to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> and we want to make it difficult for them. They have good players but if we approach the game in the right way I’m sure we can get the three points. We’re on a high after the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> result. For us to play the way we did and beat them gives us a lot of confidence. We want to take that into the <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> game. It’s another home game, in front of our fans who I am sure will be buzzing, and it’s a chance to get three points and cement our place in the top four a bit more</p>

  <p><b>[When asked about the fastest player at Chelsea]</b> Personally, I’d say I’m up there with (Antonio) <a href="antonio-rudiger.html">Rudiger</a> because if you see the stats from matchdays, it’s me and him who are at the top.

  <p><b>[Tomori says he has had to adapt his game since stepping up to the top flight from the Championship]</b> It has been different for me this season, just because it is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and it is a step up. You have to be more focused and prepared, always alert. In the Championship you have a lot of different strikers - some love it in the air or like to go in behind. But then I’m playing against <b>[Roberto]</b> <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> and he’s dropping deep into midfield. Things happen a lot faster and mistakes are punished more harshly. <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> was probably the most difficult <b>[to play against]</b> - along with Salah. Every time they got the ball, I was thinking, ‘This is a challenge but this is where I want to be - this is a chance to prove that I can play at this level.’<br /><br />Coming into <b>[this season]</b> I was trying to be relaxed about it all - but you’ve got your friends and family saying you’re playing for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, you’re playing in the Champions League and stuff. Sometimes that gets in your head, and you just think this is actually happening, it’s a dream. I try to stay focused and we’ve got the manager who’s played at World Cups and Champions League finals, he keeps us all calm and especially with the young players who are new to this stuff, there’s a lot of arm around our shoulders. The season’s been great and hopefully we can finish it off<br /><br />Tammy <b>[Abraham]</b> and Mason <b>[Mount]</b> were scoring goals, I managed to get into the team, Reece <b>[James]</b> came back and started doing well after his injury. But being able to bounce off each other makes it a much more comfortable environment for us and we can relax and play our game. Then the experienced players like Antonio <b>[Rudiger]</b> and <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpi</a> (Cesar Azpilicueta), the ones who have been there and done it, sharing a changing room with <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> who has won everything, it makes it easier to adapt and get to learn from these players</p>

  <p><b>[Salah &amp; Mane teaching Tomori how tough life in ‘men’s team environment’ can be at Chelsea]</b> It is tough because you come up against different strikers and different systems that teams use. Some teams might play two strikers up top, some may play one and then you have teams like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - we all know how <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> likes to drop in, with <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> running in behind so you need to have that concentration all the time. It’s about always being aware of what’s going on around you, communicating with team-mates around you to help them and make your job easier. Everybody knows that if you make a mistake in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, you’re likely to get punished so being able to stay focused and making sure you do everything at 100 per cent is another part that you have to grasp quickly<br /><br />You’re suddenly thrust into this men’s team environment and playing against seasoned professionals who have played the game for 15 or 20 years in some cases. It’s a big transition because you have to train well, try to get yourself into the team and then you’re fighting every week for three points that could get you promoted, into the play-offs or save you from relegation</p>

  <p><b>[Tomori welcomes <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> competition after battling to prove he belongs at the top]</b> It was just about me feeling like I belonged and that I could play at this level. I had spent two-and-a-half years in the Championship and with Derby last season I managed to win Player of the Year and get to Wembley for the play-off final so I knew I’d had a good season. I wanted to challenge myself at the next level, which was <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I wanted to do it for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, the club that I’ve been at since I was eight; a club that’s won the Champions League, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, FA Cups, everything. They won the Europa League the previous season so being able to come into that team and show myself, show the manager and the fans and my team-mates, show everyone that I could play at that level, was really important. I managed to do that in those early games and showcase what I could do and I’ve managed to carry that through. Now, it’s just about trying to maintain that level, not drop below it and keep on improving it.<br /><br />Having competition helps the team to improve because everyone wants to play. You know if you want to get in the team then you have to better than the person who’s got the shirt at that time so you have to take it from them. Individually, it spurs you on but then it also makes the team better because everyone is going to be firing on all cylinders trying to get into the team. When you do get your spot, you have to play well to keep your place so I think the fact that there is that friendly competition means everybody knows you have to be on your game. If you train well, you can get in the team and if you play well then you’ll stay in the team. Having that breeds this friendly, competitive nature and spirit that we have and it can only be a positive thing</p>
