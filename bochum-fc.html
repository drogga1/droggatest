  <p><b>[Arsenal have hit out at the ‘unacceptable racial abuse’ that Jordi Osei-Tutu suffered during his debut for German side VfL Bochum]</b> Jordi Osei-Tutu was unfortunately the victim of a racist incident during a pre-season friendly between FC St. Gallen and VfL Bochum 1848. VfL Bochum 1848, Jordi Osei-Tutu and his parent club, Arsenal, are in close coordination to deal with this incident. Both clubs, VfL and Arsenal, stand by Jordi Osei-Tutu and assure him of their full support. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination. Racism has no place in our game</p>

  <p><b>[Bochum will now continue dialogue with St. Gallen over the incident in a bid to ensure further action is taken]</b> St. Gallen would like to make it clear the club condemns every form of racism or discrimination. Any such behaviour will be punished. Our players treat each other with respect regardless of origins, skin colour or religion. The player who was involved in the incident has assured the club’s hierarchy that he stuck to the club’s philosophy in yesterday’s game against Bochum</p>
