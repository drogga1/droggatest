  <p><b>[Guardiola says he takes responsibility for failing to convince his team to play on the front foot against Monaco]</b> We have to take responsibility because he never told us to play deep, so of course we have to take responsibility for that. Since he took over at the club, his philosophy is to go forward, to press the team we’re playing, to win the ball high up the field and then pass the ball to a player who can be creative and make something happen. We just didn’t do it. He didn’t tell us <b>[to do what we did]</b>. We dropped, we didn’t press and he doesn’t like that.</p>

  <p><b>[Gael Clichy has warned Arsenal supporters to be careful what you wish for as calls mount for Arsene Wenger to be moved on]</b> I can understand because football is free for everybody to have opinions so you cannot stop that. And you cannot only think about the past because it is also about the present. But I don’t think many managers could have done what he has in the last 10 years - you know the story better than me. You always want something new when you are used to something and what you get is probably most of the time not better than what you have so you have to be careful what you wish for.<br /><br />I’m not going to get into any detail but I do believe he’s the right man. He has been the right man for so many years and I am listening to what people are saying. If the club is spending more money and they have the players they need, then perhaps Wenger is the perfect man. If you take him off and you bring someone else with the same structure, would he be better? Would he do better? I’m not sure. It’s not for me to say if it’s in the right hands or not but I do believe what he has done in the past is amazing<br /><br />It is always difficult when teams are in this kind of form. Most of the time you can hear what people are saying. They are looking for revenge: they want to show the fans, they want to show the manager … I think we did well. The atmosphere is what it is. Of course, I was here before. I really hope everything can be sorted but it is not only because of the atmosphere we felt we could have done better, it is because of the way it is when you play for a big club like City. You have to try to win and go for all the big points - home or away. We are more focused on how we had to play to get the points than thinking they are not in the best moment</p>

  <p><b>[Gael Clichy believes his team-mate Leroy Sane should win the PFA Young Player of the Year award because he has impressed while adapting to English football]</b> At the beginning, I could tell he is a player with so much ability, so much talent, but you need to get yourself used to a new country. You need to find a balance between being a young talented boy who will play a few minutes there, if he scores, he scores. If he doesn’t, onto the next one.<br /><br />I think the switch has been happening since the time he scored Arsenal. From that moment, he realised he had something to do for the team. Since he has been playing with Gabriel or Sergio at the front, Sterling on the right, it’s really when the season started to go a little bit easier for us.<br /><br />When you play against players like this you have to be aware of the talent they have. The consistency has also been good for him, he hasn’t suffered any injuries <b>[in recent months]</b>, he came here every morning fresh to training, you can tell he is enjoying his football and that’s what you want for a player.<br /><br />I think it’s fair he’s been nominated for the young player of the season and I really do hope he wins it because it’s really hard coming to a new country at his age and adapt so quickly, the way he did. I hope people will do the right thing for him but I hope even if he doesn’t get it this season, he will get so many in the future because he’s got so much potential.</p>

  <p><b>[Gael Clichy talks about his time playing for <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> I was lucky for the last 12 months to work with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> and often you think of someone being a genius of football; but if someone is close, he is the one. I am not saying he’s the best, as other managers have had success with different methods, but he certainly shows you a different way of feeling and seeing football. It was a major shock</p>

  <p><b>[Gael Clichy says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> can still concede goals for fun]</b> Even today’s team they have that quality to score four goals in 10 minutes. Don’t ask me why <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have always been able to do this but they can also even today concede goals for fun<br /><br />This was typical <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. We could go anywhere and play anyone off the park then all of a sudden we could crumble in just a few minutes. We were young, we had plenty of talent but people were talking about what we were missing and maybe that was a bit of experience. We were an amazing team but we lacked character, if you want. Even with a lead of three goals, we could feel the fans pushing and after the second goal I could feel that it was going to be difficult <b>[to win]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Clichy felt pushed out of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> when making move to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> in 2011]</b> I remember clearly at that time the club was trying to promote more British players. There was a group of four or five players, they were putting them out there, they wanted to build the team around them and I was getting to a point where, not the injuries, but where you feel that the club is saying they <b>[don’t]</b> want to keep you. I don’t think they wanted me to leave but I didn’t feel at the time that they wanted me to stay. I believe nowadays in football when you want a player to stay, you tell them you want them to stay and you make sure he stays. I didn’t feel that at the time. I’m not the only one, if you look around at the other players who left at the time that I left they would probably tell you the same and I think overall the decision was good for everybody. It wasn’t linked to my injury, it wasn’t linked to anything but I could feel that the club was pushing towards something else.If you speak with my close friends, my family, there was a moment where I was dying to finish my career at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because I was loving every single moment of it. But at the same time seeing how it was going, seeing that for those last few years where we hadn’t won anything, it was down to me as the player and I thought that maybe it was time to break the circle. They were trying to promote new players so I said to myself, ‘You know what? Let’s go and see something</p>
