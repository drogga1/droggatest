  <p><b>[Gael Clichy talks about his time playing for <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> I was lucky for the last 12 months to work with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> and often you think of someone being a genius of football; but if someone is close, he is the one. I am not saying he’s the best, as other managers have had success with different methods, but he certainly shows you a different way of feeling and seeing football. It was a major shock</p>

  <p><b>[Gael Clichy says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> can still concede goals for fun]</b> Even today’s team they have that quality to score four goals in 10 minutes. Don’t ask me why <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have always been able to do this but they can also even today concede goals for fun<br /><br />This was typical <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. We could go anywhere and play anyone off the park then all of a sudden we could crumble in just a few minutes. We were young, we had plenty of talent but people were talking about what we were missing and maybe that was a bit of experience. We were an amazing team but we lacked character, if you want. Even with a lead of three goals, we could feel the fans pushing and after the second goal I could feel that it was going to be difficult <b>[to win]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Clichy felt pushed out of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> when making move to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> in 2011]</b> I remember clearly at that time the club was trying to promote more British players. There was a group of four or five players, they were putting them out there, they wanted to build the team around them and I was getting to a point where, not the injuries, but where you feel that the club is saying they <b>[don’t]</b> want to keep you. I don’t think they wanted me to leave but I didn’t feel at the time that they wanted me to stay. I believe nowadays in football when you want a player to stay, you tell them you want them to stay and you make sure he stays. I didn’t feel that at the time. I’m not the only one, if you look around at the other players who left at the time that I left they would probably tell you the same and I think overall the decision was good for everybody. It wasn’t linked to my injury, it wasn’t linked to anything but I could feel that the club was pushing towards something else.If you speak with my close friends, my family, there was a moment where I was dying to finish my career at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because I was loving every single moment of it. But at the same time seeing how it was going, seeing that for those last few years where we hadn’t won anything, it was down to me as the player and I thought that maybe it was time to break the circle. They were trying to promote new players so I said to myself, ‘You know what? Let’s go and see something</p>
