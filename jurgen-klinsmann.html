  <dd>Hicks admits the club had made an approach to former Germany manager <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Juergen Klinsmann</a>, with a view to <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Klinsmann</a> replacing <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> as manager.

  <p><b>[Klinsmann on USMNT coach staff]</b> A coach staff it’s extremely important, like a team, that the puzzle is the right one, that the chemistry is the right one. That one supplements the other one.<br /><br /><b>[on Martin Vasquez]</b> Martin has been part of this game here in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, in Mexico, in Central America a really long time. He knows the market really well. He knows many, many coaches down in Mexico and is well connected.<br /><br />He’s a perfectionist when it comes down to planning training sessions and to execute them. That’s why I give him a lot of freedom to get that satisfaction to run certain things<br /><br /><b>[on <a href="andreas-herzog.html">Andreas Herzog</a>]</b> Andy’s one of the uprising coaches coming through the European ranks. He has already coached the under-21 team from Austria very successfully. He was in line for the head coach there<br /><br />Obviously with Andy basically running a bit our European office … gives it a new dimension. We have people present in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, in Italy that do work for us that has never been done before. Therefore we can monitor our players overseas, we can monitor them closely here in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and also closely down in Mexico, which is very important<br /><br /><b>[Klinsmann foresees his current assistants moving back into head management roles soon enough]</b> Both are ready to be head coaches anyway. What I need from coaches like that is that they’re not just saying yes to me, that they say often no to me. That they deliberate with me on certain issues, because every one of us reads the game differently, reads a player differently. So it’s important that we exchange those opinions, and at the end of the day I have to make the calls, and I will make those calls</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klinsmann, USA coach and a <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup™-winner as a player, gives his insight on the difference between European and North American mindset ahead of the Copa America Centenario]</b> How can we explain to people in U.S. that soccer is a player-driven game and the decisions are made by the player? Because once the game is rolling, you have barely any influence on it. You have you three subs, a little talk at half-time and you can scream as loud as you want on the sideline, but they can barely hear you. The athletes, the players write the story. That has always been the message to them because soccer is so different to baseball, <b>[American]</b> football and basketball. I can have a timeout in basketball, and I can have a different play. I can tell them all the time when there is a commercial break, ‘OK, next strategy.’ Soccer is an inner-driven sport and this is one of the biggest challenges for the American soccer fan and also the athletes.</p>

It’s been an amazing experience. It’s been a huge, huge honour to lead the national team over that amount of time. We’ve had some amazing experiences together. It’s come to an end, and obviously you’ve got to respect that. I want to say a very, very special ‘thank you’ to all of the players. The response from them yesterday since the news came out has been overwhelming. All the text messages and calls I received from the players of support, it’s been very emotional for me. I really, really appreciate it. I wish them the best of luck. I was a thousand per cent convinced we were going to qualify for Russia 2018 after those two losses. It’s now down to a new coach getting the job done, but I’m still convinced he and the team will get the job done and will have a tremendous 2017 and hopefully a tremendous World Cup in Russia</p>

That was a huge disappointment. The qualification really was never in doubt, but then the lads had a blackout versus Trinidad &amp; Tobago. They only needed a point, were too sure of that and underestimated that final match.<br /><br />Despite that low point, the football <b>[in the U.S.]</b> is still on the rise. Sure, there are a lot of things to catch up on: in the youth academies, in the universities, in joining up the pieces. But MLS is stable after 20 years. It has role-model character. It has a backbone, mostly thanks to <b>[league co-founder]</b> Phil Anschutz. He kept things together when they could have fallen apart. By now, MLS has caught up in the infrastructure. What happened in U.S. soccer in the past 20 years, that is a bit like a fairy tale. It still needs patience, but the league’s getting stronger with every year</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klinsmann conceded that it will be very difficult for Germany to win the World Cup again in 2018]</b> Germany is always among the favourites for winning the World Cup. We have a very good team, full of quality players, but it will be very difficult to repeat the World Cup win from Brazil in 2014<br /><br />Every generation brings out its own leaders and special players. I had the pleasure in 2006 to coach a team lead by experienced players such as Michael Ballack, Jens Lehmann, Oliver Kahn and Miroslav Klose. Today the German team is lead for example by Manuel Neuer, Toni Kroos, Thomas Muller and Mesut Ozil. Every generation has its own challenges and dynamic. The chemistry within a team is the most important piece of the puzzle<br /><br /><b>[Is team lacks a reliable target man?]</b> I disagree. We still have very strong No.9s like Timo Werner, Mario Gomez or Sandro Wagner for example. Timo has enormous talent and potential, which he showed already in the Confederations Cup last year<br /><br /><b>[On Joachim Low]</b> Joachim is a fantastic coach and person. His leadership is very positive and balanced and the players respond 100 per cent to his ideas. Hopefully he will continue for a long time with the German team</p>

Everyone couldn’t believe it that the team lost in Trinidad &amp; Tobago. It was a huge disappointment for everyone involved in soccer in the United States, including myself<br /><br />I had a great time with USA Soccer over five and a half years. Getting out of the group of death in Brazil in 2014, competing against Portugal, Ghana, and Germany, then getting into the semi-finals in 2016 at the Copa America was very exciting<br /><br />Since leaving U.S. Soccer I had the opportunity to watch my son Jonathan perform in the U-20 World Cup last year in South Korea and now I’m following his path at Hertha Berlin.

  <p><b>[Klinsmann claims Concacaf Nations League is holding USMNT and Mexico back]</b> I think the biggest challenge for the United States, or even Mexico or Costa Rica, for the key countries in this region, is you don’t really have the highest competition outside. That means when you play just within your own system, you don’t have the big matches against European countries or South American countries in order to grow your program, in order to grow your players.

This was an extremely exciting time for me and offered many interesting challenges. The club and the city have grown even stronger in my heart.<br /><br />At the end of November we met the wishes of the club’s leadership and pieced together a highly competent team and offered assistance in a difficult time. We made progress in a relatively short space of time thanks to the support of many people during a run of difficult games - we now have a six-point gap to the relegation places.<br /><br />I am firmly convinced that <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> will achieve their goal and preserve their status.

If they are not guaranteed, I can’t make the most of my potential as a trainer and live up to my responsibilities.<br /><br />That is why, after much thought, I came to the conclusion that I should leave my position as head coach of <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a> and go back to my original long-term role as a supervisory board member. The supporters, the players and employees of the club have grown in my heart during this time and that is why I will continue to do my all for <a href="hertha-berlin.html">Hertha</a>.

  <p><b>[Klinsmann followed his initial statement up with a Facebook Live video, where he expanded on what he meant by his comments, with fans puzzled by the coach claiming not to have the club’s backing after receiving €75m of new players]</b> In Germany, we’re used to having a manager on the substitutes bench at the side of the pitch and that he participates, that he’s there for the players, and keeps the door open for them. I wasn’t used to that anymore.<br /><br />I know the English model for a manager - they’re called managers in England, not coaches - has only one job and that’s being the boss of the club.<br /><br />They’re different in Germany, where everyone gets to have their say, everyone plays a role, the whole management structure. In the end only one can decide, and I feel it has to be the coach. And we disagreed there. Unfortunately we disagreed on many things<br /><br />A lot of you said it ended in chaos. That’s absolutely not true, absolutely not true. This team is stabilised. We came in and the team was practically in a relegation place, level on points, and now there’s six points difference. The team is stabilised and playing in whole different way to the way we found it.<br /><br />The goal for the year is survival, next year the goal is towards Europe. The goals are very important.

  <p><b>[How the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> became USMNT players’ league of choice]</b> I think it’s a league that has traditionally always given a chance to young players coming through the ranks. It’s always based on performance, so when an American player comes over and performs, then he gets a chance to play. There’s not much politics involved. The coaches are usually very straightforward.
