  <p><b>[Former <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> goalkeeper Paul Robinson believes the club should sell <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> now rather than risk losing him on a free transfer]</b> The chairman has obviously put a price tag on his head <b>[and]</b> they have to get value for money. If he’s not going to sign a contract then they have to cash in<br /><br />I’d be surprised if they do keep hold of him due to the fact that he still hasn’t signed his contract that he has been offered. He’s made noises that he is ready for a new challenge. He’s been at the club now for six years now and the fact that he hasn’t signed a new contract going into his final year I think it does have an effect on the team. I think it does have an effect on the players around him and I think genuinely if he did want to stay and his heart was there he would have signed it by now<br /><br />The problem you have got is that the player clearly wants a new challenge, and if the window closes and he’s still at your club, you have then got to motivate that player until his new challenge arrives either at the end of the season, or in January, or whenever that may be. As a manager, you’ve then got a player who didn’t want to be around, so you’ve got to motivate that player and get him back on board and buy into what you are doing for the next 12 months</p>

There is always a link to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> with <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>. I can’t see now why <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> would want to change <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I think he would get more success at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> than he would in the current <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> side. If there’s an opportunity for foreign players to go to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, who want to play in this country, of course it’s going to be an attraction. It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world, historically, yes they’re in a position of transition at the moment and things do need to change. Will that change? We’ll see. I think this season they’re a long way off where they should be and where they need to be</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Robinson believes <a href="jordan-pickford.html">Jordan Pickford</a> is still <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>’s number one keeper, despite acknowledging his drop-off in performance]</b> Yes, he is <b>[England’s No.1]</b>, definitely. I don’t think he’s playing the best that he’s ever played, clearly I don’t think he’s at the top of his game because he’s set himself such a high bar. I think he made an error in the Merseyside derby in November, and I think that impacted him a little bit. It was the first time he’d made a high-profile error, where people have actually started scrutinising him and are now watching him<br /><br />A goalkeeper is all about confidence. When you make a mistake, or you have criticism levelled at you, you’ve got to be very strong. Little things, like someone saying something when you go behind the goal to pick up the ball, it makes you question yourself. I genuinely think he’s England’s No.1 goalkeeper at the moment. Is he the best in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>? There are probably a few goalkeepers in better form than him at the moment. But is he England’s No.1 for the next internationals? Absolutely, yes he is. He’s earned that right</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Robinson says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> is the perfect manager to get the best out of Gareth Bale]</b> I’d love to see it happen. I think if anyone can get the best out of <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>, it’s <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>. Losing <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>, losing that little bit of creativity, that edge he’s brought to the side in the last however many seasons that he’s been there, I think a signing like <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> would really ignite the place again. It would really give the fans a huge boost<br /><br />I think the whole <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> episode has been handled quite badly from start to finish, to be honest. To get to this point with <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> still hanging around, not performing, playing a bit-part, not having a lot of money for him - it’s probably one thing they have dropped the ball on. I don’t think <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> can criticise the timing because it’s always been coming</p>

But the deal has to be right. In the past, <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> has made sure the deals are right and he has got excellent value for players.

He came as a wide player after a very good academy upbringing. He was a talented player but he was not the finished article. I think he has got better and he now prefers to play down the middle. He has grown in stature and increased his physique. His speed used to be his real asset but now he has got end product as well. I can certainly see him fitting into one of the top four’s squads. If <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is fit, he plays, but he has not played a full season in years. He (King) is guaranteed games even if he is not a starter</p>

Managers are going to have to be very aware and conscious as to how they man-manage their players fitness, injuries and squad rotation.
