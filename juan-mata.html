  <p><b>[Juan Mata, in his weekly blog for Kicca.com]</b> I consider him <b>[Cruyff]</b> the ideological father of the football; the one I try to play like and the one I look to learn from as a spectator whenever I watch a game. The intelligent use of the ball and the spaces, the importance of talent over the physical condition and the understanding of football as a team sport are concepts that I definitely endorse</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> midfielder Juan Mata on business side of football]</b> I don’t enjoy the business side of football. I love the game. I love training and competing. I’d take a pay cut if there was less business involvement in the sport. Football is very well remunerated at this level. It’s like we live in a bubble. Compared to the rest of society, we earn a ridiculous amount. It’s unfathomable. With respect to the world of football, I earn a normal wage. But compared to 99.9 per cent of Spain and the rest of the world, I earn a silly amount</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Mata tells about his eating habits]</b> When I first arrived in England, I didn’t have very high expectations about English food because everyone told me that it’s not so good, or whatever. English people and English food is very English, they feel very proud of their food and routines. On Sundays, I like to try Sunday roast and I really like pie - beef pie. The one thing I didn’t like that is very famous is the fish and chips. It’s very famous but it’s a bit oily. I like to go to English countryside pubs, where they have homemade food and I really enjoy it - so I cannot complain about English food. And that’s not a fake answer, it’s a real one!</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Mata speaks about Common Goal, an initiative he’s leading to encourage the football community to donate 1 per cent of their earnings to charity]</b> One of the first lessons I learned in football is that it takes a team to accomplish your dreams. We live by this mantra on the pitch, yet we don’t see it enough in the social space. Common Goal is creating a collaborative way for football to give back to society. It’s the most effective and sustainable way that football can deliver long-term social impact on a global scale. Football has the power to do this, but we need to act together</p>

We know there are three or four big clubs in Europe and United is one of them. Despite it not being the best moment in our history, even though we have won trophies, that feeling of waking up every day and feeling like a Red Devil is unbelievable so I wanted to keep feeling that. I wanted to stay, I wanted to keep giving my best to bring United where it belongs. I’ve been here more than five years and I realise how amazing the supporters are even in the tough moments. So I cannot imagine if we win a big trophy how it would be, how the town will change red. I imagine myself in that situation so that is another reason why I wanted to stay. I’ve lived difficult moments but I am really looking forward to living great moments with this club. Despite all that I wanted to stay. I wanted to commit to the club and keep enjoying wearing this shirt and keep trying my best</p>

Sometimes when you are their age you can lose your head a little bit and think you are a better player, or bigger players, than you actually are. But they are very calm and very humble, the four of them. They are trying their best. I really like them as personalities and as players. That is why they are here. <b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> knows that in a squad you need balance, you need a mix of young players and more experienced players<br /><br />It is true that time flies and it feels like yesterday when I was 22, 23, but I have been playing football now for a long time - 12, 13 years as a professional. I enjoy that part of the game, speaking to young players now and trying to tell them how I understand football, how I think professional football players should be, but obviously my focus is still on giving my best on the pitch. I want to play as much as I can, I want to score and to assist. That is my main focus.

That’s one of the things about social media. It’s fantastic to connect people if you use it for the right things. But it also gives a chance for so many people to let go of their frustrations towards other people and with no problems because there are so many fake accounts. There’s no identity.

  <p><b>[Juan Mata has admitted that playing for a club with the history of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> still feels surreal]</b> When I was a kid in Spain I only ever wanted to be a professional football player. My dad was but he didn’t play in the first division and my only aim was to do that, to make my family proud. And then that came and many things after that and now I am at a club where <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> and Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Eric Cantona used to play and sometimes it feels surreal<br /><br />We know that fans of this club have been used to winning and when you are in a period of change - Sir Alex leaving and different managers - and trying to win this Premier League title again which we haven’t won for six years then of course there is pressure from the fans, from the media and everywhere. But there is only one way you can deal with it and that is to face it and manage and cope with the pressure and I think you do that on a daily basis. If you do your routine right, if you train right, if you demand from each other then it will pay off and you will be able to handle it better. Also you need to realise who you are playing for.<br /><br />You journalists speak more about United than other clubs, right? That’s something I realised from the first moment. If you see pundits on TV - a lot of ex-Man Utd players. If you see the newspapers there is always something on <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>. Even if it is a small story it is bigger because it’s <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. The level of repercussion is crazy which makes you think even more on how united we have to be with the fans, club, players because you have that sense that everyone who does not support United is happy when United loses.

  <p><b>[Juan Mata believes that, if they want to, football players should use their platform to speak out on societal issues]</b> It’s a reality that there is a lot of money in football. And for me, the problem is not that. That’s not a problem at all because football generates a lot of things for the world, and a lot of passion and a lot of money. So it’s normal that something that big generates a lot of money. If we can use a part of that money to actually invest in football, but in a different kind of football, which is a social football, then I think it makes a lot of sense<br /><br />I think there are still people that think, ‘Why is this football player speaking about all these things?’. Why not? That’s my point of view. Why not? I’m very happy to be a football player. I’m happy to have played many games and win some important trophies. I feel very privileged and lucky about that and hopefully I can win many more. But I think we are here to do, in a way, something else. When you’re in a profession like this, you have that responsibility in terms of so many people following you, so many people watching the game. Helping other people is probably more meaningful than scoring a goal in the final. If you can do something different, a different kind of goal, then much better</p>

  <p><b>[When asked for a message to the club’s fans]</b> My message is always being grateful for what they give us. I understand their frustration when we don’t get the results they deserve, so I feel sorry for that. But what I can do, individually, and what we can do, as a team, is give our best. Fans recognise that. Over results, what they value is that a player gives everything and tries as much as he can, and that’s what I do and what my team-mates do. If we want to get our objectives, we need to stick together - managers, players and fans - because there’s many people on the outside enjoying it when <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> don’t win.

You can say it doesn’t mean as much to me as it does to a fan, but it can for sure. <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a> clearly gave you a different view on this, but the rivalry that means a lot to the fans of my club also means a lot to me.<br /><br />For example, I have a passion for my first club Real Oviedo. So, I cannot be happy if they play well and the result has gone against them. Also, I cannot look at their rivals and say I am happy if they are playing good football and achieving more. It is the same now that I am at United. You can see that City and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are good teams and they play nice football, but I cannot be happy that United are behind them at the moment. Of course not. I understand what it means to the fans to be behind City and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and I cannot be happy about this. I prefer to focus on us rather than thinking about our rivals<br /><br />When I go to a club, it is important for me to get passionately involved. This is why I always try to learn about the history of a club I play for, to understand their rivalries. I always like to go out in the city, to visit historic places and to learn about the fans and what matters to them. This is something I do for myself. First of all, I love football and there are many things I didn’t know about <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s history, or United’s big rivalries and big games. So, I will always encourage every player in the world to try for one season to learn more about their club and not just be a passenger passing by in history.<br /><br />Sometimes players come to a club and maybe don’t have a desire to understand what it means to play for them, but I like to understand more, especially when you are playing for a big and historic club like United. What always amazes me when we go away with United for pre-season tours is the size of everything. You know before you get there that it is going to be big, but when you see it first hand it is even bigger. You see it when we go to Ireland or Australia, like we did before this season, the amount of supporters and the passion for the club is just incredible. Every time you see this, it reminds you that you are playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. Also, that brings responsibility and we have to handle that. There are many people watching our games and not just in Manchester and England, so it means that success is even bigger than it is for some clubs and also disappointment is felt by a lot of people</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Mata is determined to remain at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for years to come]</b> It feels like it has gone very quickly, it feels like time flies. I didn’t know it was going to be my 250th game, but I feel proud. When you play your first game you feel like you are in a new beginning, a very exciting moment in your life playing for this club. I don’t want to stop here, I want to keep going and going, and keep adding games in a United shirt.<br /><br />I have to start with the day I arrived and the way I arrived in helicopter. It was unforgettable. <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> was welcoming me to the club, De Gea was also waiting there. After that, my debut, we played against Cardiff with Ole as Cardiff manager so that’s always forever in my memory<br /><br />My first goal was against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, at the Stretford End. It was a messy goal, not very beautiful, but I think it was eight or nine games without scoring for the club so it was very important for me. The goal in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup final against <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>, we were losing and it was almost the end of the game, so when I scored I was also happy in that I helped the team to win. The game at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, I always come back to it, why not? The Europa League final as well, I enjoy thinking about them, and hopefully many more to come</p>

  <p><b>[Mata admits he still isn’t used to playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> The feeling of being a player at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is really special and almost unique in football. At times it seems surreal that in the morning I put on that shirt to train, that I play in the stadium where players like <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a>, <a href="george-best.html">George Best</a>, <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> and <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> have played. People I watched from a long way away as a kid and especially that generation of <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a>, <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a>, <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> and now I’m playing in their team and I’m so proud of that</p>
