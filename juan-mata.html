  <p><b>[Juan Mata insists he is the perfect age to succeed with the Spanish national team]</b> Many of you are asking me these days about the Spanish national team. As I always say, I have been very lucky to play and to win a World Cup and a European Championsip; to participate in the most important competitions, but I’m still <b>[as]</b> excited as the first day. I am convinced that I’m a perfect age in my football career and I look forward to keep contributing and achieving more success with my national team. That’s what I work for every day, training and playing to the maximum, trying to do the best I can. After that, obviously, the manager is the one who picks the players for every game.</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Mata has defended Diego Costa’s form for Spain after the striker was left out of the national squad and replaced by Alvaro Morata for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers]</b> Being the striker in a team like ours, with so many midfielders, is not easy. You have have to adapt and above all be patient, because there is a lot of time without touching the ball. But when you do get it you have to finish well. It is a very complicated role and players like <b>[David]</b> Villa or <b>[Fernando]</b> Torres did it very well, but it is difficult to come in and adapt. It is very difficult to face him. I would rather have him as a team-mate than a rival. His movement and goals will always create problems. Also because he fights with the centre-backs and causes friction that somehow knocks the opponents’ concentration.<br /><br /><b>[On aggression has always been part of Costa’s game]</b> That is his game and always has been - it is not new. Now it seems to be talked about more because he is in the Premier League and he is something different from what was there, but he has always played well</p>

I was proud to have taken part that day<br /><br />We know we’ve qualified but we want to put in a good performance. I’m sure it’ll be a difficult game. This team has something if we play at a high level. We’re ready to give our best. We’ve seen a lot of Ukraine’s games. They’re a very complete team and it’ll be difficult to win tomorrow</p>

I love training and competing. I’d take a pay cut if there was less business involvement in the sport. Football is very well remunerated at this level. It’s like we live in a bubble. Compared to the rest of society, we earn a ridiculous amount. It’s unfathomable. With respect to the world of football, I earn a normal wage. But compared to 99.9 per cent of Spain and the rest of the world, I earn a silly amount</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Mata claims Manchester United were beaten by the clock in their eagerly-anticipated Premier League showdown with Liverpool]</b> Liverpool scored first, from the penalty spot, and we couldn’t take our chances to equalise before the break. In the last few minutes we pushed really hard for the victory, which is something that United has done for many years in the past. Zlatan was able to tie the score, and we felt that, if the game had lasted a big longer, we would’ve won. It was a pity, because our goal was the three points, obviously. Perhaps we didn’t see the best football but it was a thrilling game full of rivalry. All we have to think about now is starting over and trying to win the next game. The team showed pride until the end, and Old Trafford fought with us, as always</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Mata admits he endured a frustrating afternoon at Stoke City]</b> The game left me with a bitter taste. Firstly, we didn’t win. We created chances to get the three points and it makes us mad to see that the ball just doesn’t go in. It’s especially frustrating when you are so unlucky as to score an own goal, when you’re trying precisely to avoid that. I don’t remember when was the last time that I scored an own goal; in fact I believe this is the first one. I know it goes with the territory but when it happens to you it hurts. Anyway, this is football and, as always, we have to stay determined and motivated, and carry on.<br /><br /><b>[Rooney who now has 250 goals for the Red Devils]</b> I want to congratulate Wayne once again. He’s become the top goalscorer in the history of the club and I’m so happy for him. I’m sure that he will keep scoring many more goals and improving his amazing stats</p>

English people and English food is very English, they feel very proud of their food and routines. On Sundays, I like to try Sunday roast and I really like pie - beef pie. The one thing I didn’t like that is very famous is the fish and chips. It’s very famous but it’s a bit oily. I like to go to English countryside pubs, where they have homemade food and I really enjoy it - so I cannot complain about English food. And that’s not a fake answer, it’s a real one!</p>

We live by this mantra on the pitch, yet we don’t see it enough in the social space. Common Goal is creating a collaborative way for football to give back to society. It’s the most effective and sustainable way that football can deliver long-term social impact on a global scale. Football has the power to do this, but we need to act together</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Mata is planning a move into management]</b> I would like to play until I’m 40 if my body allows me to. I will carry on with Common Goal. And management tempts me but it is an unforgiving role. A coach depends on whether I take a corner well or finish a chance in front of goal and really, what influence does he have over this when it happens? I understand that people take decisions under pressure but the process is not valued, only results. I also want to work with youngsters, warn them of the perils and remind them of their responsibilities because it is sometimes easy to fall off the right track needed to get to the top level. Psychology also attracts me and in football, the mental aspect is very important, because if the mind is not settled, the feet do not work either.</p>

What hurt me is that they spread rumours and lies about what did not happen.<br /><br />I’ve been in England for a few years and I’ve been lucky to win many titles but the only one I have not raised has been the Premier League, so I hope to do so at some point because it would be fantastic<br /><br /><b>[When quizzed on whether he expects De Gea to still be at United next season]</b> I’m not a fortune teller.

It’s been a long season but we need to make sure we can compete until the end, that we keep that second position and we fight for being in another FA Cup final and try to win it<br /><br /><b>[On a Wembley showdown against Tottenham]</b> It’s the FA Cup, we all know how important it is. And then to get second in the league which is not the ideal position, but it’s the position we want to finish now<br /><br />We are frustrated ourselves with the performance and what we have to do is think about the next game and keep going, because we have very important weeks ahead. It’s one of those days that we didn’t play good enough and we tried to create some chances in the first half and in the beginning of the second, but we didn’t play quickly enough. We made life quite difficult for ourselves so we are all frustrated, and we understand the frustration of the fans</p>

If one year it’s not possible, a lot of people will say that we have failed - but that’s not true. We wanted to win the title, but the season wasn’t bad. It’s still possible to win the FA Cup and, if we do that, then I don’t ­consider it a negative campaign. So, for us now, the FA Cup Final is the match of the year. It’s a ­special trophy and we are ­dreaming of winning it.<br /><br />United are a club which have to fight for titles and our objective next season will be the Premier League for certain. I know that it hurts the ­supporters that City won the title this time, even if our victory at the Etihad gave us a little satisfaction. So we want to finish the ­season well for them now. People say City will dominate the league for years, but I don’t see that. This Premier League is tough, and I don’t see them winning the title three or four times in a row</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata has acknowledged he is happy to play as a supporting striker to Alexis Sanchez during the club’s pre-season tour]</b> I used to play as a striker when I was a kid, and I like to be in the box. It’s a different shape. It’s a system that is very difficult to play against. I think the manager is trying to fit all the first-team squad players into the XI. In the last two games I was playing with Alexis up front. It’s been a few years since I’ve played there but I think once you’ve played in there you pick up the components and you still have them. Now I just try to play that position. I’ve felt okay, so it’s fine.<br /><br /><b>[On Real Madrid]</b> They are a great team with a great squad. They now have a new manager <b>[Julen Lopetegui]</b> who we know very well but the players are pretty much the same. They are one of the biggest clubs in the world. We will be able to play with some of our young players, which will be a good experience for them. I think it’s a perfect end to this US tour<br /><br />Obviously, results could have been different but <b>[they]</b> are not so important now.

I’m very happy for the team, for us, but especially for the fans. They don’t deserve everything that is going on, so they deserve to see a team like today.<br /><br />It was special. We were losing 2-0, they created even more chances to score more goals and confidence levels were low. We needed to change something and when you have nothing to lose you just throw it and you push even more. We couldn’t afford another defeat, especially for the fans. I think they saw today that we tried everything and we came back and from the mental point of view it was a very important three points<br /><br />We felt that if we scored it was not impossible, especially at Old Trafford. If you score once you can score a few goals in some minutes; I’ve seen Manchester United doing that a lot of times over the years and today we did it. Even though it felt very difficult we did it. We created more chances to score more goals and that’s a very positive sign. I will say that today the victory is a pride victory.

So, for English people, I think it’s just easier, shorter and better to call him Dave.<br /><br />I know many players and people from the backroom staff there. Cesar Azpilicueta is a very good friend from the time I was playing there. David Luiz is still there, Willian’s still there. Eden Hazard, who is a good friend, and Gary Cahill… so there are still some players there I know. It’s always a special game for me against Chelsea and it will be tough - they are doing good. They have a new manager and they play with more or less the same players but in a certain style<br /><br />It’s going to be difficult. Stamford Bridge is a difficult stadium, but we have to try to keep going with the amazing 20, 25 or even 45 minutes that we did against Newcastle. I think the second half was very, very good and we must try to build from there, try to play our game, try to win and then think about the next fixtures</p>

Maybe in the future, there is a substitute where you go, take the free-kick and go back to the bench. You never know. I have confidence in my free-kicks at the moment. I train a lot. After training I get the ball and try. The goalkeepers help me out too.<br /><br />What a nice last five minutes. It is a very good night for us to get three points against Juventus in Italy. It is amazing! They have fantastic players and are a top team. We come back to Manchester with three points and that is football! The first half was not bad. It was quite even. They had chances but in the second half it was a fantastic goal from Cristiano Ronaldo. They had a few clear chances after that to win the game but they didn’t and we came back.

  <p><b>[Man Utd star Juan Mata reveals what is special about Arsenal boss Unai Emery]</b> The managers I’ve known all had their own specific way of working. Apart from the set pieces, I think what’s special about Unai is the way he communicates. In his talks, he used to write, three, four or five things on the board: those were the points he was going to bring up. Sometimes it was five phrases or metaphors he was going to explain. I’ve never seen that with my other managers.<br /><br />They usually revolved around phrases about positivity, camaraderie, the values he wanted to create in his team. To do that, he did something no one else did, that is, he communicated by means of the points he had written down. His talks could go on and on because he didn’t notice the time and carried on talking, but what he said was always intense, and he would ask you questions. That turned it into a kind of seminar that brought in the whole group.<br /><br />One particular memory stands out for me. He was talking about the criticism we’d received after we’d lost a match. This was pretty harsh, and so he talked about our relationship with the press and how we should react to the criticisms: ‘I don’t read what they write about us when things are going badly. I don’t let myself be influenced by what they might say, and only read the press when things are going well’.<br /><br />He liked positive thinking and the fact that it gives you more energy. He was also the first manager who talked to us about the incredibly complicated relationship there can be with criticism: the pressure, the repercussions and how to manage them. If you’re a professional footballer, you’re open to negative comments with every game, but he showed us that we were above all that, that the journalists could say what they liked, we had to concentrate on our job, which was to make progress. <b>[…]</b> I think that the emotional factor, particularly in football, is a very important phenomenon.<br /><br />I think that being confident gives you more freedom, it liberates you, helps you have the courage to do things on the football pitch. You have to feel free enough to do what your body is telling you to do. Sometimes though, the pressure of winning and the fear of defeat limit your performance. I used to talk about that with Unai and Carcedo because I needed to. Their positive attitude, even at the most difficult moments, meant that the players felt more relaxed on the pitch. And that’s what I found personally</p>

It’s not ideal to go behind because then you’re chasing the game and running more than you should.

But overall we qualified and that was the most important thing and we knew that, but obviously we would have loved to have been first in the group.<br /><br />It’s a very busy month and we have very important games coming, especially on Sunday. But I don’t think it’s an excuse because as a football player, you focus on the game that you are playing and try to give your best in every single game. Today we were already qualified but it was still a Champions League game against a good team. Obviously, they wanted to show that they can beat a club like Manchester United and they are not in a very good position in the league either. But they pushed, and they wanted to show they are a very competitive side. I know it’s difficult, but we have to keep going and especially with what we have coming on Sunday, we need to be ready for that</p>

It was a convincing win against Cardiff and it will raise morale going into the end of 2018 and the rapidly approaching new year. It is time for be optimistic, to look ahead and keep working hard to climb up the table. We are really motivated to do so while entertaining our fans, who deserve so much</p>

I just love Anthony. The better he plays, the more we win. I always say the same, but it’s true: give the ball to Anthony and we will win!<br /><br />You always believe you can do it when you play for a club like Manchester United. It seems like nothing is impossible. It’s seemed very far <b>[away]</b>, fourth position, third position, but we are there now. We did a really difficult job but we know that we’re not there yet because the Premier League has not ended. We want to keep up this good performance, this good run, everyone playing, everyone contributing to the game. I think we are very strong as a group and we are showing it. Hopefully we can keep going until the end<br /><br />There is fantastic chemistry between all of us, the players and the manager. Since he came the only thing he’s tried is to make us confident, that we can beat anyone, that we can play very good and get the results and we’re doing so. So we are very happy obviously because when you when ten games you are very happy and high on confidence. Now we face another challenge, which is a Champions League match with PSG. It will be very difficult but hopefully we can keep going. Everyone is contributing to the team, everyone is leaving their egos aside and just wanting to give their best for the team whenever we play and I think against PSG we will do the same. Whoever plays will try their best. We are feeling strong as a group we are thinking about ‘us’ and not about only ‘me’ and I think that’s very good to achieve our goals until the end</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Mata has praised Manchester United team-mate Paul Pogba]</b> Yes, he assisted the cross for the first goal, scored the second one. Even in the second half, 80, 85 minutes he was still defending, going forwards. He’s very, very complete. He’s got physique, he’s got quality, he’s got a pass, he can go box to box. He’s one of the best. Today he showed why<br /><br />I think it was the perfect reaction to our defeat to Paris Saint-Germain. It’s never easy to come to Stamford Bridge, to win against Chelsea, to not concede any goals, to play some good football. I think it was a very good evening for us and gives us a lot of confidence for the next games<br /><br />Obviously we had a difficult result against PSG, but we still believe we can come back. In the Premier League, our main target is to get top four, after a very good run of results. One or two months ago it was pretty impossible to get where we are now, so we want to keep that position. And in the FA Cup, we’re close to Wembley. So hopefully we can go to Wembley again with all our fans, because it’s a very nice feeling</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Mata admits to making the injury he picked up against Liverpool worse by chasing Mohamed Salah]</b> Everything possible seemed to happen to us. If there is a game that no United players want to miss, it is when we play Liverpool, but you have to accept that injuries are a part of the sport. Luckily, I can’t remember having faced a similar situation in a game and that is after more than 12 years as a professional, it is the first time that a muscular injury has forced me off during a match.<br /><br />In reality, I have to be grateful, as it is an uncommon record for a football player, but this one came during a derby. It was a shame, and on top of that it wasn’t the only injury - Ander and Jesse both had to go off for the same reason. It was incredible that all of this happened in just the first half. It wasn’t the dream start we’d imagined for such a big game, but the team competed well despite the injuries and we even had the better goalscoring chances. In terms of my own injury problem, I could feel something for a few minutes and I hope that I didn’t make it worse when racing to stop Salah on the counter-attack (I had to do it!). I’m hoping it isn’t anything serious. I will do everything that I can to get back as soon as possible</p>

As I told you a week ago, I’m not used to being injured. The week has crawled by without being able to train with my teammates. I’ve been around them each day, of course, as I am going through my recovery at the training ground, but it’s not the same. It is hard to not be able to contribute, and even more so during a week with two games. To everyone’s delight, the team have been doing well out on the pitch, showing that we are all able to compete<br /><br />This week, we have two more games … which will probably go by slowly for me again, although I will be supporting the team and carrying on with my recovery process. I’m feeling good about it, every day I’m a bit better and I am working to be back as soon as possible. PSG and Arsenal are both top opponents to be facing this week. The game in Paris is particularly tough due to the first leg, but we are United and we never surrender. We have to believe that it is possible. Later, we will visit the Emirates again in a vital game as we fight for a Champions League place</p>

  <p><b>[Mata hoping to hand Man Utd fitness boost after being forced to watch ‘magical’ nights from afar]</b> It is has been another different week, without being able to play, but there are reasons to be optimistic. On Friday I was able to put in some work out on a pitch again and my recovery is progressing as hoped. Hopefully I can rejoin the team soon. Thank you for your messages. I’m going to keep doing everything I can to be back fit as soon as possible<br /><br />I watched the game at the Emirates at home. A defeat that wasn’t desired but has to be played down. I believe that we deserved more against Arsenal. In the second half, in particular, we started to look for the equaliser, but once they scored their penalty the task ahead was a lot tougher. It has to be remembered that we were playing against a great team at their own ground, but I really think that we deserved better than a 2-0 loss. It resulted in our first defeat with Ole in domestic competition <b>[Premier League and FA Cup]</b>, where we had amassed 15 matches unbeaten. Despite this disappointment, we continue moving forward with the motivation to get back to winning ways, and we do so with confidence. To finish talking about last week, obviously we have to discuss Paris. It is something difficult to explain with just words. A historic night. To come back from 2-0 down is tough, but to do so against an opponent like PSG is even more difficult. This magical night represented the greatness of Manchester United and it will be, without doubt, remembered forever in the history of our club.

And for me, the problem is not that. That’s not a problem at all because football generates a lot of things for the world, and a lot of passion and a lot of money. So it’s normal that something that big generates a lot of money. If we can use a part of that money to actually invest in football, but in a different kind of football, which is a social football, then I think it makes a lot of sense<br /><br />I think there are still people that think, ‘Why is this football player speaking about all these things?’. Why not? That’s my point of view. Why not? I’m very happy to be a football player. I’m happy to have played many games and win some important trophies. I feel very privileged and lucky about that and hopefully I can win many more. But I think we are here to do, in a way, something else. When you’re in a profession like this, you have that responsibility in terms of so many people following you, so many people watching the game. Helping other people is probably more meaningful than scoring a goal in the final. If you can do something different, a different kind of goal, then much better</p>

You can say it doesn’t mean as much to me as it does to a fan, but it can for sure. <a href="michael-owen.html">Michael Owen</a> clearly gave you a different view on this, but the rivalry that means a lot to the fans of my club also means a lot to me.<br /><br />For example, I have a passion for my first club Real Oviedo. So, I cannot be happy if they play well and the result has gone against them. Also, I cannot look at their rivals and say I am happy if they are playing good football and achieving more. It is the same now that I am at United. You can see that City and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are good teams and they play nice football, but I cannot be happy that United are behind them at the moment. Of course not. I understand what it means to the fans to be behind City and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and I cannot be happy about this. I prefer to focus on us rather than thinking about our rivals<br /><br />When I go to a club, it is important for me to get passionately involved.

What always amazes me when we go away with United for pre-season tours is the size of everything. You know before you get there that it is going to be big, but when you see it first hand it is even bigger. You see it when we go to Ireland or Australia, like we did before this season, the amount of supporters and the passion for the club is just incredible. Every time you see this, it reminds you that you are playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. Also, that brings responsibility and we have to handle that. There are many people watching our games and not just in Manchester and England, so it means that success is even bigger than it is for some clubs and also disappointment is felt by a lot of people</p>

So we stay with him, and I think that’s a good sign of things going okay.<br /><br />The respect is mutual, and we never had any personal problem. The situation was a football situation. He played in a certain way that maybe didn’t suit perfectly my qualities as a player, and that’s it. Sometimes it happens in football. But my mentality <b>[when <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> joined United]</b> was: ‘Okay, I’m going to try’. My family was a bit scared. The fans were telling me, ‘What are you going to do?’ But I had it clear in my mind that I’m going to stay and prove that I can play much more than people think, and I did. And it’s one of the things that I feel very proud of in my career: having made that decision, testing myself and keeping going and playing, at the end, the Carabao Cup final, the Europa League final, and feeling an important player in the squad. That’s how I felt before, and how I felt with him.</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Mata has named <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> as the biggest talent he has seen come through <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s academy]</b> Obviously the first one who comes to my mind is Marcus, <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>. Everyone knows that he is a special player and I have to admit that in the first training that he did with us in the first team, it was <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> that was our manager, and after the training, we did a little game and he was playing on the right side, and, after everything finished, <a href="ander-herrera.html">Ander Herrera</a> came to me and said: ‘Do you see this player? How good he is? He will be a player for us’. He realised straight away. After one training session, Ander knew that this guy was something special. Of course, after that, he was very determined since the first moment he played with us, scoring very quickly, many goals and, of course, for his country also. I think he is probably the most special player that has come through in my time here, through the academy<br /><br />I just chant his song, which is ‘Bruno, Bruno’ every morning when I see him, so I think he’s happy with my morning welcome. He is a great guy; we have become very close and he’s obviously a great player. He’s done great.<br /><br />It’s a difficult question. Some days, yes; some days, no. Some days, yes because I love football - you can train to play in a certain way, you can train to develop players and make them reach their highest level. I like many parts of the game and what happens on the pitch, but on the other side, your life is constantly questioned and the demands are so high because it all depends on whether the ball goes into the goal and you can win, or not</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player Juan Mata has urged footballers across the world to do more to try and help with the fight against the coronavirus]</b> It’s been heartening to see many positive responses from players and other football leaders to the current crisis, but it can be also hard to know what to do to help effectively those who need it most. We are suffering a stark reminder of how interdependent we all are. To overcome coronavirus, and the other challenges facing humanity, we need to coordinate individual efforts and work together as a team. I’m urging not only my Common Goal teammates, but also all other players and football leaders from around the world to unite and help tackle this crisis, and at the same time use this as a catalyst to play a key role in tackling the other challenges humanity faces. Together we can beat this.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> midfielder Juan Mata says ex-Chelsea star <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> was the best player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> The best <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> player, I mean, I used to love to play with, and against, <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>. For me, for many years, he was the best in the league. He could win games by himself. I used to train with him and I know how good he can be. He has been very unlucky in his time with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> with some injuries, but I’m sure he’ll show his real level when he’s fit to do that and he’s not injured. Other than him, we’ve had many players. You can speak about the history of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and you can maybe put some of my ex-team-mates like <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> - he has to be up there. <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> has to be up there, and <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a>. My ex-team-mates from Chelsea: <b>[Frank]</b> <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>, <b>[John]</b> Terry, <b>[Didier]</b> <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>. It’s very difficult to pick one<br /><br />My best friend at United is David. <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> and that’s also an obvious one. We were friends before we were playing together in the club. Ander <b>[Herrera]</b> was a very big friend, and still is, but now from afar. But, to be honest with the people that we have been playing with for more years, like <a href="phil-jones.html">Phil Jones</a>, <a href="chris-smalling.html">Chris Smalling</a>, now that he is on loan but <b>[he’s a]</b> very, very nice guy. I do miss <b>[Herrera]</b> on the pitch but also in the dressing room and outside. We were living in the same area. We were seeing each other after training for lunch, dinner, to watch football together, so of course I miss him. He’s a very good friend. I’m still in touch with him very often. He’s very happy in Paris. When you understand football in the same way, I think it’s enjoyable to play with someone like him or with someone like Bruno <b>[Fernandes]</b> now. You always miss them when you don’t play with people like this</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Mata says <a href="michael-carrick.html">Michael Carrick</a> would have been more appreciated in Spain]</b> The first one that comes to mind is <a href="michael-carrick.html">Michael Carrick</a>, because I had a chance to play with him for a long time. I know how important he is for a team. From my point of view, he didn’t have the media talking about him, or even the fans speaking about his importance, but it was just a joy to play alongside him. As an attacking football player, when you have Michael in behind, you know he’s going to find you. Wherever you move, he’s going to find you. I joke with him, calling him the quarterback of a football team because you make the movement and the ball is going to fall into your run. It’s not going into your feet but into your run, exactly what you want, to control it and keep going. Sometimes, people don’t appreciate that enough and also defensively. People could have said he was not the most aggressive one but he was very intelligent. He didn’t need to be so aggressive. He’d read before where the ball was going to go and made the recovery. For me, he was a fantastic midfielder and, for some times of his career, he was underrated or underappreciated - in the national team and for the club.<br /><br /><b>[The United playmaker went on to express his belief that <a href="michael-carrick.html">Carrick</a>’s talents would have been valued more highly in Spain]</b> Because of the way he plays, this type of player is very appreciated in Spain. He probably would have been bigger than he actually was here</p>

  <p><b>[Juan Mata is determined to remain at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for years to come]</b> It feels like it has gone very quickly, it feels like time flies. I didn’t know it was going to be my 250th game, but I feel proud. When you play your first game you feel like you are in a new beginning, a very exciting moment in your life playing for this club. I don’t want to stop here, I want to keep going and going, and keep adding games in a United shirt.<br /><br />I have to start with the day I arrived and the way I arrived in helicopter. It was unforgettable. <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> was welcoming me to the club, De Gea was also waiting there. After that, my debut, we played against Cardiff with Ole as Cardiff manager so that’s always forever in my memory<br /><br />My first goal was against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, at the Stretford End. It was a messy goal, not very beautiful, but I think it was eight or nine games without scoring for the club so it was very important for me. The goal in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup final against <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>, we were losing and it was almost the end of the game, so when I scored I was also happy in that I helped the team to win. The game at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, I always come back to it, why not? The Europa League final as well, I enjoy thinking about them, and hopefully many more to come</p>
