They hit our crossbar, but on the whole I feel that we dominated. Conceding yet another goal in stoppage time is difficult to take as we had put a lot of effort into the game. We weren’t able to rest certain players and we lost Mensah. It wasn’t a very positive evening</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham are closing in on a deal to sign Southampton centre-back Jose Fonte]</b> Jose has different possibilities. He has the solution and the opportunity to see this, and we will see what the situation is in a few days. He was in training this morning with the players and he works normally with good spirit, and like a professional. This situation with Jose is difficult for the squad. It’s difficult for him also. It’s not just about this market; it’s been since the beginning of the season.<br /><br />It’s been a difficult situation for Jose because he’s always in discussions with the club, about contracts, or no contracts. I took a decision at the beginning of this window to keep Jose out the team, to study different possibilities, and to protect the team from all this speculation about Jose. With this many games it’s important to keep focused about our game, not just on the situation of Jose. It’s difficult, but the squad can take the responsibilities</p>

He is an interesting player for the future.<br /><br /><b>[after Gabbiadini became the 16th player to score three goals in his first two Premier League appearances, and the first since Zlatan Ibrahimovic in August]</b> It’s a good start, a very good start, of course</p>

For me N’Golo is the same quality of Romeu with us. It’s an important to player and without him for Chelsea it’s difficult and the same with Romeu, it’s difficult for us without him.<br /><br />If we see the quality of his games since the beginning of the season, for me, he <b>[Romeu]</b> is not far off Kante because he’s very consistent and every game he gives good performances, with consistency and quality. <b>[Romeu]</b> is strong on the recovery of the ball and has a lot of qualities to start on the ball. He’s very good player for me and the same level <b>[as Kante]</b>. We will see for the future, we are confident in him and, for me, he can look to a selection with Spain, for example</p>

He has all the qualities to play for all the great teams in Europe. He can make the difference, so for me he is a top player in Europe.<br /><br /><b>[He added on the difficulties faced in trying to contain Hazard]</b> It’s not possible to mark him because he cannot play just in the same position. He is free in the system - he can play on the left, the right, as a striker, or just near a striker where he comes back to take the ball. The team is built around Eden because he is a valuable player and their most important player</p>

The good ambition for him is to continue this hard work, to show his consistency game after game, until the end of the season.

He is making progress. It’s a good thing of course, (if) he continues all season with us<br /><br /><b>[Mahrez has not yet made any moves to agitate for a transfer]</b> It’s not a question in our mind. All the noise is just speculation. Of course we are in the transfer window and it’s normal for all the best players <b>[to be linked with transfers]</b>, but I’m not afraid about this because there’s a fantastic spirit and good attitude in this squad. I have confidence in Riyad. We spoke a lot with him, <b>[about]</b> different things, and often about football, because he likes football a lot.

We needed to manage better and we need also perhaps some others’ respect. We had some solicitation from another club. To make solicitation just one or two days before the end of the transfer window, I don’t know if it’s normal. I cannot suffer this situation because other teams make this thing against us. It was important to stay united within the club, the fans, the players, among themselves. We succeeded to keep a good united within the team.</p>

They have nine wins at this moment which is incredible. They are confident in their play. They are more direct and clinical at the moment, with a clinical player like <b>[Alexandre]</b> Lacazette for example. They can have good confidence for the future, but for the title I don’t know. It is just the beginning of the season and the Premier League has a lot of possibilities.<br /><br /><b>[On Unai Emery]</b> He has done a fantastic job. It is not easy to take the team after Arsene Wenger. Starting this season with a new manager and perhaps a lot of pressure, their beginning of the season has been fantastic and I have a lot of respect for this manager and the quality of his work. Perhaps Arsene wanted a little more possession in his game and perhaps it is more direct with Emery. Two different but good philosophies and styles of game</p>

He’s decisive with his passing and his goals. He drags the team behind him. He was huge in the first games played with the new coach - in the physical dimension, in his ability to break lines, to carry the ball forward, to weigh into the penalty area, to score<br /><br />You can’t man mark him. He’s powerful, can sniff out the right pass in the box, drives forward quickly. You can’t really stop him. It’s a near-impossible physical duel. It’s a challenge to try and read what he’s about to do. He has great vision’. With one or two touches, he can give amazing assists, especially over the defence. He sees everything quickly and is technically on point. Some players are so productive that you play around them. That’s what’s happening at Manchester United</p>

  <p><b>[Claude Puel says <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a> would do very well at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a> can be a player like <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>. He can go into the midfield a little and ask to get the ball in space. For me, he could do very, very well in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. Suarez’s problem is that he has lost some physical condition. He was more powerful and started more. Not now. He knows how to get away, go deep and ask for the ball, because he is a scorer. But you need something more. With <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> played 80 per cent of the game in the opposition half of the field. Now they accept playing a low block. When you are so deep, you need a striker to hold the ball when you get it to allow the team to advance. Suarez loses the ball continuously.<br /><br /><b>[He added on his first experiences of a <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> native]</b> I went to see him play with the <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> reserve team. He never ran, he never asked for the ball, he did not move into space, he did not defend. Nothing, nothing, nothing. He did nothing in 90 minutes. But he scored a goal and he was happy. For him, that amounted to a good game. He had a great character. It was difficult to make him understand that he needed to work, run, ask for the ball in space. First, I made him play as a forward because we had many strikers. Then I put him up top so that when he won the ball, he needed time holding it until the others arrived. He has everything that a scorer needs. He is small, but that is not a problem for him. He has progressed a lot without the ball. Run, work for the team. He has become a complete player</p>

  <p><b>[Saint-Etienne manager Claude Puel is reeling from his club’s decision to sell star defender <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a> to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> over the summer, despite getting him back on loan]</b> Rather than buying a ready-made player, I would rather buy one to develop and help him grow. It’s hard to accept the fact we sold our best player, a young kid, to help fill the coffers. When you have to sell your gems to sort out the budget and then do short-term deals to fill in the gaps, you’re just being reactionary. It’s done now, and I’ve got nothing to say because it allows us to perform. Saint-Etienne have held their position in the past few years. Finishing fourth <b>[last season]</b> was a great result. Work was done in the short term. Is this a viable model? I don’t think it can make the club a success</p>

  <p><b>[Claude Puel has branded <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> striker <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a> a child who needs attention]</b> I did not have a problem with Jamie. Jamie is a good man but sometimes he is like a child: he needs support, he needs attention. It was difficult for me because I was not English, it was difficult to share and explain all my feelings with him. When I arrived at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, he scored a lot of goals. He came back from the World Cup injured, he returned without training sessions. It was difficult for me to use him all the time. I have a lot of time for him<br /><br /><b>[Players like <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a>, <a href="ricardo-pereira.html">Ricardo Pereira</a> and <a href="caglar-soyuncu.html">Caglar Soyuncu</a> owe their presence in East Midlands to Puel, who is happy to see them thrive]</b> It is not a surprise for me to see <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> in this position this year. It is the same team, except for <a href="ayoze-perez.html">Ayoze Perez</a>. It is the same strategy. It is a pleasure to see. Brendan has done a fantastic job. If you look at this team and remember the one that won the title, the whole style has changed. It was my work at the beginning to put in place a team with the possibility to make this progress</p>

  <p><b>[Saint-Etienne fireworks display in <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> clash injures stewards]</b> I hope we will not be penalised, and that the team will not be penalised. The game does not need to fireworks, I’ve seen them before, but not in a football match, or at the end of a match</p>

  <p><b>[former Nice manager Claude Puel says ‘Peaceful’ <a href="hatem-ben-arfa.html">Ben Arfa</a> not like his public image]</b> We talked for a long time. I met a calm person, who loved football. He followed other games, he had ideas about the game. I found him to be a peaceful person, contrary to the image people are given about him: unmanageable, hostile. I didn’t see somebody who was messed up, that’s the most important thing. That was a great team in every position, but he was the best</p>

  <p><b>[Saint-Etienne boss Claude Puel says <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a> is ready to become a star at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> He is ready. He is a fantastic player. He is a young player but with a lot of maturity in his play. Also, in his life. He is a player with a good feeling and spirit. It will be hard for us without him but I think it is a fantastic opportunity for Arsenal<br /><br />I think they need a good centre-back and have done for some time, and I think William is the right player. I think he can play all the time in the first team at Arsenal</p>

  <p><b>[Saint-Etienne coach Claude Puel is hopeful <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a> can remain with the club for the Coupe de France final before he has to link up with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> William is at the end of his contract at the end of the month. He takes great pleasure in training with his team. We will see what can be done to keep him a little longer with us<br /><br />We ended last season with players who were coming to the end of the contract, with players who were suspended during the season and who could not serve their suspensions. I think it’s unfortunate that we did not take into consideration an exceptional case with a four-month gap. They will be deprived of the finals and we will be deprived of them. We also have players at the end of the contract, we will take stock. Loic Perrin is with us and may have this possibility of extending. We made an offer to Yohan Cabaye, we await the answer<br /><br /><b>[While Puel admitted he is interested in Aouchiche, he refused to say if his team are lining up an offer for him]</b> I like to talk about concrete things, Aouchiche has a profile that interests me, and that’s basically all I can say. Many clubs are ready to welcome him, everything will depend on him</p>
