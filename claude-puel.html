  <p><b>[Lyon Coach Claude Puel after <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> were rocked on Wednesday night after they, defending champions, were knocked out of the Coupe de France by Lille]</b> Of course we are disappointed because I feel that we played well, especially in the second half, controlled the match and had the better chances. They hit our crossbar, but on the whole I feel that we dominated. Conceding yet another goal in stoppage time is difficult to take as we had put a lot of effort into the game. We weren’t able to rest certain players and we lost Mensah. It wasn’t a very positive evening</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City appoint Claude Puel as manager]</b> It’s a great privilege to become the new manager of <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> - a club whose values and ambitions are closely aligned to my own. The opportunity to help the club build on its remarkable recent achievements is a truly exciting one and I’m looking forward to working with the owners, players, staff and supporters to deliver further lasting success</p>

  <p><b>[Claude Puel talks about playing the club’s first match since owner <a href="vichai-srivaddhanaprabha.html">Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha</a> was killed in a helicopter crash]</b> Playing football has not been at the front of our minds this week. But for this weekend, and all the matches thereafter, we play to honour a man who did so much for our club. The result is not important, but our desire, our actions to give our best on the pitch to honour our chairman, is the most important thing. I’m confident after I saw my players at training that they can give their best</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City sack <a href="claude-puel.html">Puel</a> after torrid run of results]</b> <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> Football Club has parted company with <a href="claude-puel.html">Claude Puel</a>, who leaves his position as First Team Manager with immediate effect. The club would like to thank Claude for his efforts in leading the team during his 16 months in the role and wish him well in his future career. Assistant Manager Jacky Bonnevay also departs with the club’s best wishes. First Team Coaches Mike Stowell and Adam Sadler, supported by the club’s established backroom staff, will assume responsibility for the senior squad while the club begins the process of appointing a new manager. The Board will make no further comment until this process is complete</p>

  <p><b>[Claude Puel says Alexandre Lacazette would do very well at Barcelona]</b> Lacazette can be a player like Luis Suarez. He can go into the midfield a little and ask to get the ball in space. For me, he could do very, very well in Barcelona. Suarez’s problem is that he has lost some physical condition. He was more powerful and started more. Not now. He knows how to get away, go deep and ask for the ball, because he is a scorer. But you need something more. With Guardiola, Barca played 80 per cent of the game in the opposition half of the field. Now they accept playing a low block. When you are so deep, you need a striker to hold the ball when you get it to allow the team to advance. Suarez loses the ball continuously.<br /><br /><b>[He added on his first experiences of a Lyon native]</b> I went to see him play with the Lyon reserve team. He never ran, he never asked for the ball, he did not move into space, he did not defend. Nothing, nothing, nothing. He did nothing in 90 minutes. But he scored a goal and he was happy. For him, that amounted to a good game. He had a great character. It was difficult to make him understand that he needed to work, run, ask for the ball in space. First, I made him play as a forward because we had many strikers. Then I put him up top so that when he won the ball, he needed time holding it until the others arrived. He has everything that a scorer needs. He is small, but that is not a problem for him. He has progressed a lot without the ball. Run, work for the team. He has become a complete player</p>

  <p><b>[Saint-Etienne manager Claude Puel is reeling from his club’s decision to sell star defender <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a> to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> over the summer, despite getting him back on loan]</b> Rather than buying a ready-made player, I would rather buy one to develop and help him grow. It’s hard to accept the fact we sold our best player, a young kid, to help fill the coffers. When you have to sell your gems to sort out the budget and then do short-term deals to fill in the gaps, you’re just being reactionary. It’s done now, and I’ve got nothing to say because it allows us to perform. Saint-Etienne have held their position in the past few years. Finishing fourth <b>[last season]</b> was a great result. Work was done in the short term. Is this a viable model? I don’t think it can make the club a success</p>

  <p><b>[Claude Puel has branded <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> striker <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a> a child who needs attention]</b> I did not have a problem with Jamie. Jamie is a good man but sometimes he is like a child: he needs support, he needs attention. It was difficult for me because I was not English, it was difficult to share and explain all my feelings with him. When I arrived at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, he scored a lot of goals. He came back from the World Cup injured, he returned without training sessions. It was difficult for me to use him all the time. I have a lot of time for him<br /><br /><b>[Players like <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a>, <a href="ricardo-pereira.html">Ricardo Pereira</a> and <a href="caglar-soyuncu.html">Caglar Soyuncu</a> owe their presence in East Midlands to Puel, who is happy to see them thrive]</b> It is not a surprise for me to see <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> in this position this year. It is the same team, except for <a href="ayoze-perez.html">Ayoze Perez</a>. It is the same strategy. It is a pleasure to see. Brendan has done a fantastic job. If you look at this team and remember the one that won the title, the whole style has changed. It was my work at the beginning to put in place a team with the possibility to make this progress</p>

  <p><b>[former Nice manager Claude Puel says ‘Peaceful’ <a href="hatem-ben-arfa.html">Ben Arfa</a> not like his public image]</b> We talked for a long time. I met a calm person, who loved football. He followed other games, he had ideas about the game. I found him to be a peaceful person, contrary to the image people are given about him: unmanageable, hostile. I didn’t see somebody who was messed up, that’s the most important thing. That was a great team in every position, but he was the best</p>

  <p><b>[Saint-Etienne boss Claude Puel says <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a> is ready to become a star at Arsenal]</b> He is ready. He is a fantastic player. He is a young player but with a lot of maturity in his play. Also, in his life. He is a player with a good feeling and spirit. It will be hard for us without him but I think it is a fantastic opportunity for Arsenal<br /><br />I think they need a good centre-back and have done for some time, and I think William is the right player. I think he can play all the time in the first team at Arsenal</p>

  <p><b>[Saint-Etienne coach Claude Puel is hopeful <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a> can remain with the club for the Coupe de France final before he has to link up with Arsenal]</b> William is at the end of his contract at the end of the month. He takes great pleasure in training with his team. We will see what can be done to keep him a little longer with us<br /><br />We ended last season with players who were coming to the end of the contract, with players who were suspended during the season and who could not serve their suspensions. I think it’s unfortunate that we did not take into consideration an exceptional case with a four-month gap. They will be deprived of the finals and we will be deprived of them. We also have players at the end of the contract, we will take stock. Loic Perrin is with us and may have this possibility of extending. We made an offer to Yohan Cabaye, we await the answer<br /><br /><b>[While Puel admitted he is interested in Aouchiche, he refused to say if his team are lining up an offer for him]</b> I like to talk about concrete things, Aouchiche has a profile that interests me, and that’s basically all I can say. Many clubs are ready to welcome him, everything will depend on him</p>
