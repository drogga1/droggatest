  <p><b>[Man Utd flop Alexis Sanchez’s golden Copa ticket to escape Old Trafford hell]</b> In the Copa America he has the chance to show all that he is capable of. The presence of Arturo Vidal, Gary Medel and Alexis is crucial. They are players who already know the demands and intensity of a championship of this nature. They have already tasted success in the competition and they know how to transmit calm and maturity to their team-mates.</p>

  <p><b>[Chile coach Reinaldo Rueda believes Alexis Sanchez is on the ‘right track’ after the attacker scored in a 4-0 win over Japan on Monday]</b> He’s on the right track. We wanted to reserve him for the next games, but he’s recovered well.<br /><br /><b>[Chile started their title defence in style as Eduardo Vargas netted a brace to go with goals from Erick Pulgar and Alexis Sanchez]</b> Chile have very experienced players, they know each other very well, with a base of many years. The current champions usually make a bad debut, but we worked hard not to suffer with that</p>

  <p><b>[Reinaldo Rueda confirms Alexis Sanchez suffered an ankle injury during Chile’s win over Ecuador at the Copa America]</b> He was evaluated in the break and the doctor determined that he could continue. It was very important what he offered. Fortunately, it was not the same ankle that was injured with Manchester United. Now, we have to evaluate post-match and hopefully he can be in the next game with us.<br /><br /><b>[Chile can seal top spot in the group by avoiding defeat against Uruguay in Rio de Janeiro on Monday]</b> It was a very difficult game. We had the fortune to open the scoring quickly. Maybe we lacked more intelligence to continue … it was a very tactical game</p>

He arrived at a difficult, inopportune moment, perhaps in the most unbalanced United in recent years</p>

  <p><b>[Chile boss Reinaldo Rueda says <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> could be sidelined for up to three months if his ankle injury requires surgery]</b> He could end up under the knife. Inter, his club, will decide. We could lose him for two or three months. It’s a shame because he had started playing again with Inter and scored two goals, while also playing in the Champions League. He was happy and super motivated. Now we have to wait for these decisive hours. We will see what happens</p>

  <p><b>[Chile boss Reinaldo Rueda says Sanchez has had ‘traumatic, very tortuous’ year at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> &amp; Inter]</b> It has been a traumatic, very tortuous year for him. Ever since his departure from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and his first year at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. He came to the Copa America in Brazil and then had that bad luck with the injury in the friendly against Colombia in Alicante. That loan to Inter was almost thwarted and when he recovered the pandemic came. I expect all this to pass quickly because he’s a great professional, has a great attitude in training and will maintain a high standing for any club that gives him a chance. He’s got a lot of football yet to show at the top level.<br /><br /><b>[Asked why Sanchez was unable to cement his place at Barcelona]</b> There are many factors combine so that extraordinary players do not succeed in one place. After being the main man and playing important roles in other places, reaching <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and only having a more secondary role takes its toll. It has happened to many players there. Few have managed to adapt quickly to their new role, perhaps <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> or <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Arturo Vidal</a> managed.

The fans have welcomed him very well and I hope that wherever he goes he will be the protagonist he has always been, and when he comes to the ‘Roja’ he will arrive in perfect condition<br /><br /><a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> has its DNA, a philosophy deeply embedded in the squad.
