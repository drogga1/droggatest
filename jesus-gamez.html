<blockquote>
  <p>[Former Newcastle United right-back Jesus Gamez has hit out at Rafael Benitez] Yes, it got complicated at the beginning with an injury, then I broke my collarbone. I struggled to get back. At family level, the experience was very good. At sporting level, the fans and the team-mates were sensational, but the coach did not understand the situations that happened and also the deal was not the ideal one. He [Benitez] is a person that I do not like talking about because he didn’t contribute anything to me in these two years and I have nothing to say about him.<br /><br />When someone is so selfish and wants to understand everything, they do not know how to read situations and understand that things are not always the same. You cannot distrust everyone. I showed him my professionalism. Time proved me right. I had an injury, I was not fooling anyone at all. The physios and the medical staff at Newcastle knew how to understand the situation. You cannot talk or argue with him because he always wants to be right</p>
