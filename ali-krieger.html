  <p><b>[After two years out of the mix for the United States, 34-year-old defender Ali Krieger was called in for a pair of friendlies and could be a late USA inclusion at France 2019]</b> I knew that the door was somewhat cracked over the years, just waiting for a second chance. I knew that as long as I could get a toe in the door then I’d really take my opportunity and run with it. I just needed that one phone call and that opportunity to be back, so this is it</p>

  <p><b>[The United States assumed the role of the villain from the start of this tournament. Anyone still on the fence about their feelings for this team was quickly swayed one side or the other when Ali Krieger]</b> We have the best team in the world, and the second-best team in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Krieger took direct aim at Trump this week, voicing her support of Megan Rapinoe and confirming she would not travel to Washington DC]</b> I refuse to respect a man that warrants no respect. I feel that staying silent at times can side with the oppressor and I didn’t want her to feel like she was having to process this all alone, because a lot of us do have those similar feelings. I wanted to make sure that as one of her close friends, she didn’t feel that and I feel like we’re able to focus - as women it’s funny, imagine that, we can multitask - on two things at once. I refuse to just sit back and watch an abuser, a bully talk like that to my friend and I support her as a friend and I wanted to make sure that I said something that meant something to me and was important to me and that’s why I did what I did</p>
