  <p><b>[Delhi Dynamos coach Miguel Angel Portugal was also extremely happy with the condition of his squad after a two-month pre-season]</b> It’s our first match and for us, it is important to start well. We had a two-month long preseason in Spain, Qatar and India. This first match is a test for what’s the performance of my team. Now the team is in position to play. Kalu <b>[Uche]</b> is good. Guyon <b>[Louis Ursmarus Fernandez]</b> is good. Everyone is fine.<br /><br />In Spain, we made the first contact to know personalities and characters. And also for players to know what is our philosophy. In Qatar, we improved our contact and philosophy. In India, we played in natural conditions for our competitions. In two months we improved very much and now this match is a test to know what is the output from us now<br /><br />I saw the matches of other teams this weekend; I think the competition is very balanced. All teams are on a similar level. FC Goa and Bengaluru FC won but it was a difficult win for both. It’s a good competition; I think anyone from the ten teams can win. Bengaluru FC, FC Goa and FC Pune City had a high budget but maybe other teams have many players <b>[who]</b> can win <b>[the title]</b>.<br /><br />FC Pune City is a good team. Marcelinho and Marcus Tebar- I spoke to him for signing for my team but FC Pune City paid more money. But, Pune make a good team apart from these two players too. Alfaro is a good striker. I respect their team very much. It’s very difficult to win in Pune but we’ll try and win. For me winning is very important but in the first match, it’s also important what’s the performance of my team</p>
