  <p><b>[Former Roma defender Aldair advises the club to consider signing Olympique Marseille striker Djibril Cissé]</b> Until now the club have done well on the transfer market, Riise is undoubtedly a reinforcement. as well as Loria and the young players coming back from loan spells. But I think that, while in defence they are fine, up front they still lack a winger and a powerful striker. Considering the resources available, I think it would be a good deal to buy Djibril Cissé. Although he’s been through tough times recently, the French-Ivorian player would be perfect for Roma also because he won’t cost too much</p>

There is still a lot of work to do to fix the defensive line, but I reckon that Roma have the drive to claim maximum points</p>

There are rumours circulating that he could join Roma, and I can safely say that he will do well there because he is a great player with excellent qualities. I would advise him to go to the Lupi</p>
