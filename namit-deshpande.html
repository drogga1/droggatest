  <p><b>[Namit Deshpande: The India U17 World Cup team’s defender all the way from Maryland in USA]</b> The truth is, when I was in India, I’d never played a single sport. My mom was a national-level tennis player. So, the natural instinct for her was to put me in tennis. I used to go play tennis but used to persist my grandpa on heading back home so I used to skip many of my tennis classes.<br /><br />When I flew to the US, there was the language barrier - people weren’t so accepting of a kid who doesn’t speak the same language and is of a different colour. So football was the way into the environment over there. I made my first friends in the community through football. My cousin used to play football so that’s how I joined too. I just watched them and realized there are so many friends, I might as well join them<br /><br />When I noticed many of my team-mates being called up, I felt like I have a chance but I knew that I can never play for the United States because I’m not citizen of US. So I knew India would be the best option, knowing it was hosting the World Cup. I thought it would be a good place for me to start my national career<br /><br />I just checked the website, sitting one night and it was the time when a couple of my teammates were called up for the national camp a day before, so I was a bit disappointed. I felt I’m as good as them and I didn’t get the call-up and felt sad. I believed it was my chance now to play for India, knowing they were the host nation. I felt like I should send out the e-mail even though my parents were confident that nothing would come of it. So, at this point, I felt I might as well send something hoping that something good might come out<br /><br />However, there was no e-mail address as such. I just found AIFF’s media e-mail on the website and sent my videos there. Luckily, it was Friday that week when I’d sent and on Monday, Abhishek sir <b>[Abhishek Yadav]</b> responded. So, that’s how it started<br /><br />The former coach wanted me right away but academically I couldn’t meet that requirement as it meant that I would be leaving school and dropping at high school, which is big in the United States<br /><br />It definitely was a rollercoaster, it was another chance. The new coach Norton sir was very understanding and I got my second chance which is a dream come true after now being named in the final 21 member squad<br /><br />I felt everyone is very understanding. I didn’t have any problem with any Indian player in specific. The language barrier was not a big issue because they could understand me and I could understand them, too. When I played on the field, I could speak enough Hindi for them to understand me and they would also speak in English for me to understand them. So, the communication was never an issue. There’s no problem in working together. It’s a tight-knit group now<br /><br />I have come up against most of the players <b>[in the US squad]</b>. I have played against Chris Goslin, I have actually played with the back-up goalkeeper Dos Santos CJ - when he was in Philadelphia Union because I used to train with them. I have played against Christopher Gloster earlier; he plays for New York Red Bulls. I’ve played against Christopher Durkin also, so I have played against most players, once or twice. I know how they play, they are all big names in the DA league and stars in the U-17s<br /><br />I feel we <b>[India]</b> can definitely compete with the US team. They are a good team, there’s no doubt about it but our team is strong enough, playing in front of the home crowd we have a good chance of putting up a good result against them. I played against these players before so I am not too scared. Being on our home turf with so many fans supporting us, I don’t think it should be a problem at alls<br /><br />My family - my mom, dad and little brother, will be coming here to India. My entire family is very excited. Unfortunately, my aunt, who is also a big supporter, can’t make it as it’s her anniversary so she’s in the United States<br /><br />But my grandparents and my aunt are going to be watching the games from there. My friends, ever since I was in the DA, they were after me that I should definitely play for India since I don’t for the US. I used to be sceptical, thinking it wouldn’t ever happen, but now it has. Everyone is really excited to watch this now. In fact, even my American friends are rooting for India<br /><br />As of now, I’m just focusing on the U-17 World Cup</p>
