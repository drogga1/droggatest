  <p><b>[Midfielder ​Stiliyan Petrov ​enjoyed his first day of pre-season with <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, four years after he was diagnosed with acute leukaemia]</b> it was amazing. The boys look sharp already …with a smile. I’m like a little kid smiling constantly. Love it</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic legend Stiliyan Petrov is looking to see the Kieran Tierney transfer saga resolved as soon as possible, with interest from Arsenal proving to be an unwelcome distraction]</b> There comes a point in the careers of footballers that they weigh things up and make important decisions. Kieran Tierney may be in that position in this transfer window. If he goes, then the club will get excellent money for him. If he stays, then they are holding on to a quality footballer. But these are the kind of matters that you want resolved as soon as possible. It’s important to know where you stand and what needs to be done<br /><br /><b>[Petrov, who left the Hoops for Aston Villa in 2006]</b> The manager will be assessing all options available to him, and the club will be working hard behind the scenes to provide him with targets to consider. It is a long, and often complicated, process. You need to identify the right person, and then if he is attached to a club, negotiate a transfer fee, and then the player and agent’s fees. That’s why you need to be patient. I understand that the supporters want to see new players being brought in and money being spent. That is only natural. But there has to be a proper sense of responsibility and professionalism. Going out and bringing someone in if you are not 100% sure is not the right way to go about things. Eventually, that way of thinking and operating will come back to you in a negative way</p>
