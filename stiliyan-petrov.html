  <p><b>[Midfielder ​Stiliyan Petrov ​enjoyed his first day of pre-season with <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, four years after he was diagnosed with acute leukaemia]</b> it was amazing. The boys look sharp already …with a smile. I’m like a little kid smiling constantly. Love it</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Tierney is being tipped to leave Celtic in the near future]</b> You don’t go under the radar if you are consistently one of the top performers. I don’t know if it will be this summer or next but I do think at some point Celtic’s resolve will be tested. And if a huge offer comes in the reality is you have to take it. It will take big money to get him. I don’t know how much but it will be no problem for a Man Utd or whatever. The boy just has to keep doing what he is doing. Getting into the Champions League can be so important for his development. He has the potential to go on and be world class. He could go to a Man Utd or any other top-level club because he’s been brought up having to play under pressure.<br /><br />Like all good players he has not just survived in that environment but has flourished and those who have the temperament to deal with that are the guys who make it to the top. He has shown he can cope at European level. In the Champions League he has been excellent. But it is also about the way he behaves on the pitch. He has shown he is a leader. He has captained his country and he has captained Celtic. That is special for being only 21. He will get better all the time. As an ex-Celtic player and a Celtic fan I want him to be here for as long as possible. But that is not how football works.</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic and Neil Lennon must come to the right decision quickly]</b> Everyone is talking about whether Lenny will get the job but he has to analyse it and see if it’s a good job for him. It’s not just from the club’s side but for Lenny as well. Managers have different ways of working. Lenny is completely different from Brendan Rodgers and he’s inherited a squad built by Brendan Rodgers. Brendan built it very well and got in his own players who could fit his style. Neil Lennon is completely different and if he is to continue then they have to sit and analyse where the club is going. What do they do about Rangers closing the gap? What do they have to do to make an impact in European football again? What do they have to add to the squad?<br /><br />I think they have to make a quick decision. That will show they have a clear plan and that they know what they are going to do. Because if you look at it Lenny will be losing a few important players from the team. He will need to rebuild and move the club forward and there’s not a lot of time to prepare ahead of Europe. A quick and clear decision would give reassurance to the fans and to whoever gets the job that they will get the support and time to rebuild</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> legend Stiliyan Petrov is looking to see the <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> transfer saga resolved as soon as possible, with interest from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> proving to be an unwelcome distraction]</b> There comes a point in the careers of footballers that they weigh things up and make important decisions. <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> may be in that position in this transfer window. If he goes, then the club will get excellent money for him. If he stays, then they are holding on to a quality footballer. But these are the kind of matters that you want resolved as soon as possible. It’s important to know where you stand and what needs to be done<br /><br /><b>[Petrov, who left <a href="celtic-fc.html">the Hoops</a> for <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> in 2006]</b> The manager will be assessing all options available to him, and the club will be working hard behind the scenes to provide him with targets to consider. It is a long, and often complicated, process. You need to identify the right person, and then if he is attached to a club, negotiate a transfer fee, and then the player and agent’s fees. That’s why you need to be patient. I understand that the supporters want to see new players being brought in and money being spent. That is only natural. But there has to be a proper sense of responsibility and professionalism. Going out and bringing someone in if you are not 100% sure is not the right way to go about things. Eventually, that way of thinking and operating will come back to you in a negative way</p>
