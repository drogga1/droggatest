  <p><b>[The Common Goal project set-up by Manchester United’s Juan Mata has gained another high-profile supporter - UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin]</b> I firmly believe that football has the power to change the world and I was inspired by Juan Mata to join the Common Goal project. It’s great to see a player leading this movement because footballers have benefited greatly from football and this way they can give something back. I call upon everyone in the international football community - players, coaches, clubs and leagues - to show they care about social initiatives and donate to causes that they believe in.<br /><br />Football aligned behind a shared vision for good can be incredibly impactful. If everyone gets behind Common Goal, in one way or another, we could change the lives of tens of millions of people across the globe, thanks to a common passion for the game</p>
