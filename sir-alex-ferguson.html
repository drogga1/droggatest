It’s a two-horse race in Scotland and either one of them is going to win something every year, so it’s difficult to leave.<br /><br />They’re big clubs, they’ve got great supports and, in terms of worldwide support, very few clubs in England can reach that.<br /><br />In terms of ability and quality, though, obviously the top teams in England are ahead of Celtic and Rangers. Still, why would <b>[<a href="gordon-strachan.html">Strachan</a>]</b> want to leave?<br /><br /><b>[Asked about Tuesday’s clash, Sir Alex insisted that his side wouldn’t underestimate Celtic]</b> You can say it’s a local derby. It’s Scotland-England, but Scottish and English have the same mentality and both teams will have a go. That’s in the nature and it’s in Celtic’s history. They are not going to sit back, so it will be an open game. We won’t get carried away simply because our home record is good and Celtic’s away record is bad<br /><br /><b>[Playing down suggestions that <a href="shunsuke-nakamura.html">Shunsuke Nakamura</a> would again be the undoing of his Red Devils]</b> We recognise <a href="shunsuke-nakamura.html">Nakamura</a> is an exceptional talent at set-pieces, but I would be very surprised if we lost a goal again like that having discussed it so many times</p>

It didn’t always work but a lot of times it did.

  <p><b>[From <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> to unemployed: Former teen star Freddy Adu and his sad downward spiral]</b> I think we would be interested, he’s only young but we have known of him for a long time. We tried to get him here some years ago but he signed for DC United and that did not stop us keeping tabs on him<br /><br /><b>[Adu did his best to impress but work permit issues meant he couldn’t play a competitive match]</b> Freddy is a talented boy. He’ll go back to the US and we’ll keep a check on him. When he is 18, we will have to assess what we can do next. What we did was to bring him here to give him an idea of what United was like so he could see the place and see how comfortable he was with it. He is a very confident and good young boy but there is nothing we can do about him</p>

  <p><b>[Sir Alex Ferguson fears the extinction of ‘great’ English clubs if <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s giants join <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s global Super League]</b> I struggle to see why an English team would need to leave. Without question, it is money orientated, but surely this would not be attractive to our clubs in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, which at the moment is the best domestic league in world football and is well supported financially by Sky, BT and now Amazon. Furthermore, the attraction of playing in the Champions League is huge for players, coaches and fans alike, as it remains the ultimate test in club football. A lot of clubs with great history could be lost if their partners in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> upped sticks. I strongly believe this is a realistic appraisal of the value of domestic football</p>

Of course he rose to have a go at me and the players stopped him. ‘Sit down,’ I said. ‘You’ve let your team down. You can argue as much as you like</p>

Well Done<br /><br />On behalf of all the players, our thoughts are with all those that have been affected by this terrible virus. It has been heart-warming to see the nation come together to show their appreciation to the NHS and other critical workers.

  <p><b>[In the end, the dispute over ‘Rock of Gibraltar’ was settled out of court and a line was drawn under the matter. Both Ferguson and Magnier agreed that neither would ever publicly discuss the finer details of the legal case]</b> Rock of Gibraltar was a wonderful horse; he became the first in the northern hemisphere to win seven consecutive Group 1 races, beating Mill Reef’s record. He ran in my colours under an agreement I had with the Coolmore racing operation in Ireland. My understanding was that I had a half-share in the ownership of the horse; theirs was that I would be entitled to half the prize money. But it was resolved. The matter was closed when we reached a settlement agreeing that there had been a misunderstanding on both sides. Obviously, there was a potential clash between my racing interests and the ownership of the club, and when a man stood up at the AGM and insisted that I resign, there was awkwardness for me. I have to say that at no point was I side-tracked from my duties as manager of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I have an excellent family lawyer in Les Dalgarno and he managed the process on my behalf. It didn’t affect my love of racing and I am on good terms now with John Magnier, the leading figure at Coolmore</p>
