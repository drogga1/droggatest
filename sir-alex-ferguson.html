The same question could be asked about why are the German teams, why are Bayern Munich not winning the Champions League? Why are the Italians not winning it? Why are the French not winning it? And why are the English not winning it? I think the moment, the cycle is with the Spanish teams. They’re the best, and that’s why they’re winning it. But that will change, that can change. Cristiano Ronaldo will get older, Lionel Messi will get older. Can they replace these players? I think the cycle will change.<br /><br />I had great energy, and I sacrificed a lot - my kids would grow up with my wife, and the role she played was really important. I didn’t need any motivation. You don’t need motivation at Manchester United. The history of that club is enough. So I enjoyed a fantastic spell. Today I think a lot of players don’t make their mind up that they want to stay in the game until it’s too late. In other words, they don’t have a rounded preparation like I did. They maybe take their badges at 32, 33 and then they expect to managers two or three years later. It’s a result industry. It’s a serious result industry. You have to win games and if you don’t have the proper preparation like I did, and a lot of coaches did, you’re going to suffer. And of course the other side, as opposed to when I started, was that you have different owners. They have owners from all over the world, with different ambitions - there’s a lack of patience in that respect. But you really need to be prepared to stay in the game.

It used to be in <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> on the Friday night and we had to go and play <b>[in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> on the Monday, which meant we only had two days’ preparation. So, in the games against <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> and <a href="zenit-st-petersburg.html">Zenit</a> I played a lot of the younger players. I’m sorry I did that and I’ll tell you why - because <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> treated it like the World Cup final. They’re dancing about the touchline and I was raging, saying I should have put the full lot out for the way they were celebrating. But the long-term view was always win your league. There’s a lot of tribalism in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and I think if you ask the supporters whether they would rather win the league or the Super Cup, I know what the answer is. So we viewed it a little differently and, in hindsight, I wish I’d have gone for it. At the end of the day, history is history and we could have won the Super Cup three times - if we’d played properly in Rome against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> <b>[the 2009 Champions League final defeat]</b>, maybe another one.

And bearing in mind he had some injury problems which would have put him him alongside Ryan and Sir Bobby I am sure of that. That apart, what a career… and the goals he scored - unbelievable. He was the absolute perfect player and no matter how many great players we have had in the past at Manchester United, Paul sits in the great pantheon of those players, there is no question about that.

Both Ferguson and Magnier agreed that neither would ever publicly discuss the finer details of the legal case]</b> Rock of Gibraltar was a wonderful horse; he became the first in the northern hemisphere to win seven consecutive Group 1 races, beating Mill Reef’s record. He ran in my colours under an agreement I had with the Coolmore racing operation in Ireland. My understanding was that I had a half-share in the ownership of the horse; theirs was that I would be entitled to half the prize money. But it was resolved. The matter was closed when we reached a settlement agreeing that there had been a misunderstanding on both sides. Obviously, there was a potential clash between my racing interests and the ownership of the club, and when a man stood up at the AGM and insisted that I resign, there was awkwardness for me. I have to say that at no point was I side-tracked from my duties as manager of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I have an excellent family lawyer in Les Dalgarno and he managed the process on my behalf. It didn’t affect my love of racing and I am on good terms now with John Magnier, the leading figure at Coolmore</p>
