  <p><b>[Super League side PKNS FC have set a top five target and a trophy for PKNS FC to reach this coming season]</b> After squad registration was completed, we quickly made plans to build our squad so that we can compete with other teams in the league. Elavarasan has recruited 14 new players to the squad, such as <b>[former Malaysia international]</b> Khyril Muhymeen, <b>[goalkeeper]</b> Zamir Selamat, Affize Faisal Mamat and many more. We also managed to replace the vacancy left by Gabriel Guerra with Lucas Espíndola, Patrick Wleh has also returned <b>[from loan spell at Selangor]</b> and will help other two import players in the squad, which are Matias Jadue and Gonzalo Soto. With the combination of current players such as Shahrul Azhar Toure, P. Gunalan, Nizam Abu Bakar and plenty more, we are optimistic that we can at least finish top five in the Super League. I also want to challenge the team to capture at least one trophy for themselves, and as well as for the state of Selangor<br /><br />For 2017, we have allocated sufficient budget for us to face all the challenges in the league. It may not be as big as other teams’, and this budget would be for all nine teams under the PKNS FC set up, including our academy. Our spending is actually not as big as you think. Of course we increased our budget from last year because we are in the Super League this year. I am confident we can reach our target with this budget. Big budget does not guarantee success if there is no strength and teamwork among the players, coaches and the staff<br /><br />We have a platform for players to express their opinions, especially on their welfare. The most important thing is for them to receive their monthly payment on time. These are professional footballers. They play football to earn a living and they also have a family so that is why we always put that as the main priority</p>

  <p><b>[Super League side PKNS FC are reportedly looking to build their own ground, and are currently considering three locations]</b> Playing in late afternoon is very different than at night because most of the players are used to playing at night. The new stadium will have a capacity of 6,000 to 7,000 spectators initially with an option to increase its seating capacity in the future.</p>
