  <p><b>[Tiemoue Bakayoko insists he is happy at Monaco, but hopes to sign for a big club in the near future]</b> I am very happy in Monaco. This club has brought me a lot. I want to focus on this season. We’ll see after. I hope that I will sign in a large club.<br /><br />I was born and I lived all my youth in Paris. If the opportunity arises, I would not refuse to sign to the PSG. But I’m only 22 and I feel very good in Monaco.</p>

When he arrived at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> I wasn’t a very, very good player, but I had a lot of discussions with him, he gave me a lot of advice, and he allowed me to play my style of football more simply.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>, one of the club’s most celebrated players of all time, has also proved inspirational, albeit from a distance]</b> <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> has had a stellar career and he managed to do so many great things, first at <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> and then here at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.

I’ve played a match with him for the French national team so we know each other very well and I hope we can do beautiful things together this year. I am very happy to be here. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is a great club with a great history, and they are the champions of England. My wish was to be at the best English club there is today.

  <p><b>[Tiemoue Bakayoko’s debut was anything but easy]</b> The Premier League is so different from Ligue 1. I got to see it from the first minutes. So I needed to be ready. In general, I’m a little bit mixed about my game. I had some good moments, but some bad moments too. I need to get the rhythm. It was my first match since the injury so, it will come, but I’m happy overall.</p>

  <p><b>[Tiemoue Bakayoko says he would rather help Chelsea to Champions League glory this season than defend their Premier League title]</b> I would choose the Champions League because it is an exceptionally difficult competition. It’s not easy to win, so you should always grasp the chance to win it. For the Premier League, you always have the opportunity to win when you play for a club like Chelsea. So, if I have to choose between the two, it would be the Champions League.<br /><br />The Champions League has a different feeling to it, compared to other competitions. It is the number one competition in the world. It’s always been my dream to play in the Champions League and win it.<br /><br />I am really determined to start the competition with Chelsea. Since I was young, I have had a good career and I gained a lot of experience last season. Chelsea is a great club, they always want to win trophies. So, it is certainly very important for me give my best for the club. The Champions League puts the pressure on us, especially when playing for a very big club like Chelsea. Chelsea want to win so we want that atmosphere and that pressure</p>

  <p><b>[Tiemoue Bakayoko will consider dying his hair blue when he scores his first goal for Chelsea in the Premier League]</b> As soon as I score a goal I will change the colour of my hair. Possibly to blue. I like changing the colour of my hair from time to time. I don’t go completely over the top, but sometimes I find it brings me good luck. Since the Man City game I put some white in my hair.<br /><br />I’ve always dreamed about playing for certain clubs. Chelsea is one of those. Last season I looked out for them, watching and seeing how best I could play with them. I really thought they were the team in which I could express myself. The chance to work with Antonio Conte was one of the biggest reasons for coming. He’s a coach who has always believed in me and followed my progress from his days at Juve. So it’s natural that I would get the chance to play under him</p>

He’s never said that he might leave and he’s always extremely focused on winning, on doing well in the season. As a player, I would be disappointed <b>[if he leaves]</b>. We all like working with the coach and having this relationship in the long-term. I’ve been working with him for a year and I’ve progressed a lot under him but it’s really up to the club management, up to him and his entourage but he hasn’t said anything.</p>

Don’t forget he’s very young and it’s not easy to play against the older players and to be so quick on the pitch.<br /><br />I think we played very well throughout and I’m very happy for Olivier Giroud and N’Golo Kante<br /><br /><b>[On Maurizio Sarri]</b> He’s a very good coach. He wants to play football, he never wants to play long balls. He just wants to attack the goal, score a lot of goals and play an offensive game.</p>

He has helped me adjust a lot, above all with the language. I hope to speak Italian soon.<br /><br />The 4-4-2 is the formation I prefer, but even in a 4-3-3 I found myself playing well in the last game. My position has changed, but I believe that I have done well. I have been able to help the team more. I am upset about the result against Juventus, but this is football. I am happy with how I played<br /><br /><b>[Bakayoko hopes that working with Gennaro Gattuso can help him to rediscover his form]</b> Antonio Conte and Gennaro Gattuso are somewhat similar, they give a lot and ask even more from the players, during training and in games.
