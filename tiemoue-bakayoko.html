  <p><b>[Tiemoue Bakayoko says <a href="claude-makelele.html">Claude Makelele</a> had a big influence on his career]</b> <a href="claude-makelele.html">Makelele</a> helped me greatly. When he arrived at Monaco I wasn’t a very, very good player, but I had a lot of discussions with him, he gave me a lot of advice, and he allowed me to play my style of football more simply.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a>, one of the club’s most celebrated players of all time, has also proved inspirational, albeit from a distance]</b> <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> has had a stellar career and he managed to do so many great things, first at Marseille and then here at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He is definitely an example I wish to follow, be it the footballer or the person himself. He showed the whole world what he was and I saw that and admired it.<br /><br /><b>[The France international also spoke of his early impressions of Chelsea]</b> <a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kante</a> has proved it all. He was the best player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> last season in the middle of the pitch and that is not easy. To play alongside him would be something very good for me and it can help me progress. I’ve played a match with him for the French national team so we know each other very well and I hope we can do beautiful things together this year. I am very happy to be here. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is a great club with a great history, and they are the champions of England. My wish was to be at the best English club there is today. I have the ambition to play as many matches as possible, to progress as much as I can with a great coach like <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a>, and then I have the objective of taking part in the World Cup at the end of the season. <b>[<a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>]</b> spoke a lot about tactics, and training, and he took the time to talk to me about my game and explain I must be serious-minded and work hard.</p>

We already know, there is the Champions League and we are looking for stability, Tiemoue has decided to stay there.</p>

It is the only thing I know<br /><br /><b>[He went on to admit that he never saw eye to eye with <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gattuso</a>]</b> I had difficult moments <b>[at Milan]</b>, especially at the start.

New Chelsea manager <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> is facing a dilemma over the number of non-homegrown players in his squad as the new season closes in at Stamford Bridge. UEFA rules state clubs in the Champions League may register no more than 17 foreign players in their squads for the competition, with a further eight spots available for homegrown players. One player who the Blues had hoped to move on was midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko, who spent last season on loan at <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>.</p>

<a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> are exploring a loan deal for Chelsea midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko, but are relying on the Blues agreeing to pay a significant proportion of his £120,000-a-week wages</p>

  <p><b>[Tiemoue Bakayoko defends decision to quit <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for Monaco &amp; denies it’s a step back]</b> There was a good opportunity to come back here in a very good project. Lots of people will perhaps say that I am taking a step back by coming to Monaco but I see it differently. My two experiences abroad allowed me to play a lot, contrary to what a lot of people have said. My season in Milan brought me a lot in terms of new avenues of football and professionalism. I have taken a lot of positive things away from it. The club is what is important today. I do not think about my personal ambitions. I want to try to perform well on the pitch to help the club reach its objectives. Les Bleus, I think about it, but it will come as and when. I come back with a new standing, I really want to bring to this group what I have learned and to try to transmit more confidence here</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko has hinted that his playing days at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> are over]</b> We just went to listen to them. We can understand their disappointment. We really had the heart to win the three points tonight. We can understand their impatience. It was important to talk to them, listen to what they have to say. At the end, we applauded them because they continue to motivate us, be there for us. We must really try to pay them back as quickly as possible. <a href="leonardo-jardim.html">Leonardo Jardim</a> is the same coach that I have known for five years. He is still very motivated, he really wants to take us as high as possible. He is close to us, he tries to give us confidence. I really want everyone to support him, that we try to be with him and to listen to him. He has proved that he is a truly great manager. I want him to be here for several more seasons</p>
