Luckily he broke the ice, because you just stand there. It was the World Cup, people were calling me ‘David Black-ham’, going crazy for me. I was kind of like a star. We go into the room: ‘Hello … hello … hello’ He shook my hand, pulled me towards him and said: ‘My daughter wants to marry you’. I said: ‘Sorry, I already have a girlfriend’. He said: ‘No, no but I have others, more beautiful’. Everyone was laughing. The pity is we couldn’t take pictures because the flash hurt his eyes, so I only have one</p>

There are 2,500 people walking through Chemnitz doing the Hitler salute.

  <p><b>[Who is Luka Jovic?]</b> There are critics who only see Luka Jovic play once a week. I have seen him play every day and can, therefore, say that he can become a world-class striker. He has everything to become that. You see that in training. He has football in his genes, he’s a street footballer, and he has a nose for goal. He scores with his head, right or left foot. He is technically good and can shoot well with both feet. He just has everything a striker needs.</p>

  <p><b>[Boateng had to overcome ‘crazy’ ways to join Messi &amp; Arthur phenoms at Barcelona]</b> It’s normal, when I was young I was crazy. At 18 years old in my neighbourhood I was the boss because I had money. Then I had a child and you see that if you do not mature you cannot reach teams like Milan or Barca. They do not choose you. You can play very hard but if the head does not work you cannot play on those teams. That’s why I changed my attitude and my character.<br /><br />Now I weigh 83 kilos. That was down to the party. At Tottenham I did not play and I was always with the fans in the stands. In London I was 20 years old. And you go partying, you’re with friends and you eat badly. Now I have my cook and I am aware that eating well and being healthy lengthens the race. When you’re young you think that every month the money is going to be there. If you do not play you do not care because you have money and friends tell you that you are a phenomenon<br /><br /><b>[On Lionel Messi]</b> He is incredible. I tell you honestly, playing against him is very hard, but seeing him now on the field is magical. I see him like Ronaldinho. He can win matches by himself. I could play in a team where the other 10 defended and he could do it all<br /><br /><b>[Brazil international midfielder Arthur Melo]</b> For me, Arthur is a phenomenon. He never loses a ball, he plays very clean, he does not miss a pass, he’s incredible. Ousmane Dembele is known around the world because he can change matches. He is very quick and has technique, something that is rare. That’s why he’s so strong and decisive</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin-Prince Boateng is now a La Liga title winner with Barcelona]</b> Mentality is crucial. I started too late to really think about <b>[my career]</b>. Of course I regret that. As an 18-year-old, I would have needed an agent or a family to push me in the right direction. I would have liked that. But I had to fix everything myself. I know very well that I have also failed with my motivation, which has not always been 100 per cent there. If I would have had the absolute will, I would have been a starting XI player at Barcelona or would have played 10 years for Real Madrid or Manchester United<br /><br />BVB missed only one goal at the time for Champions League qualification. Had Dortmund qualified for Europe at the time, they would have bought me. Klopp called me personally and told me that it did not work out. I was very sad about that and the normally always tough Prince cried. At the time, I guessed that something big could happen in Dortmund, so I wanted to stay. But it wasn’t meant to happen<br /><br /><b>[Boateng added on Klopp]</b> He knows exactly what he has to say to make you go on the pitch and die for him. He has this over all others. This has been seen in Dortmund and you can see it now in Liverpool. It even gives the players who do not play the feeling that they are important. With him as a coach there is a special feeling<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on what would have happened had the German tactician wanted to take him to Liverpool]</b> For Klopp I would even have gone to China!</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona forward Kevin-Prince Boateng has revealed he thought he was bound for Espanyol when his agent first suggest a move to the Catalan city]</b> <b>[The transfer to Barcelona]</b> went also very fast for me. I just have the best agent in the world. He called me one day and said, ‘You have to play well against Inter, someone is watching.’ But he didn’t tell me who is watching. Even Roberto De Zerbi, my coach at Sassuolo, came to me before the match and said I had to play well because the game was very important. So I had pressure from all sides. But under pressure I play best. I was the best man on the pitch and after the game my agent came to me and said, ‘We’re going to Barcelona!’ I thought he meant Espanyol. But he immediately said, ‘No, the right ones.’ That was incredible. I could not believe it until the sporting director called me<br /><br />It was clear from the start that I would be a substitute. I would come in, for example when Luis Suarez is tired. Recently, I was not in the squad a few times because everyone was fit. I understand that. Of course <b>[I’m not satisfied with this situation]</b>. If I was satisfied, I would stop playing football. In the beginning the situation annoyed me because I think that I’m fully fit. But I can not complain. Barcelona is the best club in the world, my team-mates are Ousmane Dembele, Philippe Coutinho, Luis Suarez or King Lionel Messi. Should I suggest to put these guys in the stands instead of me? The club has invested a lot of money in these players. I can only give everything and offer myself<br /><br /><b>[To win the triple]</b> is the goal, so it’s also communicated every day in the club. The only thing that counts here is to play the game, to win and to bring all three trophies at the end. It is very realistic. We can win the final of the Copa del Rey against Valencia. The Champions League is a very special one, as everyone switches one gear up. Many big clubs are already eliminated, so we have a chance to win the title. If I won the Champions League, I’m definitely gone. Then I will play somewhere else for two or three more years. Once, I said for fun that I would stop <b>[playing football]</b> when Marius Wolf became a national player. So: Jogi, take your time!</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin-Prince Boateng has admitted his admiration for incredible Barcelona strike partner Lionel Messi]</b> When you play against <b>[Messi]</b>, you see that he is strong. When you play with him every day, you can see how incredible he is. If he feels like it, he scores two or three goals. If we fall behind with 1-0, he gets angry, scores three goals and then we go home with an easy win. Of course <b>[Messi is a leader]</b>. If you have a player in the team who can decide every game, he is a leader. Lionel does not talk much in the locker room, but when it comes down to it, he talks. He is so strong that you have to follow him<br /><br />Yes, my friends told me that <b>[I am a role model for them because I got out of Wedding]</b>. Even those with whom I still have contact say today: ‘You have shown that you can make it from the streets to the top’. For that they are still grateful to me today. Many of my buddies now have children and tell them, ‘I used to play in the park with Boateng. So give it your all, then you get out of here too’. The best moment for me was when I brought Ronaldinho to the <b>[little river]</b> Panke in <b>[Berlin]</b> Wedding. I was incredibly proud to have brought this legend to my neighborhood.
