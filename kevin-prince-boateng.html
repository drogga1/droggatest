  <p><b>[Kevin-Prince Boateng has claimed he received messages of gratitude from several Germany internationals after his foul ruled <a href="michael-ballack.html">Michael Ballack</a> out of the 2010 World Cup]</b> The irony of it all.

Nobody was happy that he sustained an injury, least of all me, but many believed being without <a href="michael-ballack.html">Ballack</a> was the better option<br /><br /><b>[Boateng’s father, Prince, has previously said his son had personal issues with <a href="michael-ballack.html">Ballack</a> dating back to an on-field argument during a game between Hertha and <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, and the pair have never held clear-the-air talks]</b> You maybe sit down with someone who is a friend or with a person who is important to you. <a href="michael-ballack.html">Ballack</a> is not important to me; I am not important to Ballack</p>

Luckily he broke the ice, because you just stand there. It was the World Cup, people were calling me ‘David Black-ham’, going crazy for me. I was kind of like a star. We go into the room: ‘Hello … hello … hello’ He shook my hand, pulled me towards him and said: ‘My daughter wants to marry you’. I said: ‘Sorry, I already have a girlfriend’. He said: ‘No, no but I have others, more beautiful’. Everyone was laughing. The pity is we couldn’t take pictures because the flash hurt his eyes, so I only have one</p>

He has this over all others. This has been seen in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and you can see it now in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.

He is still like a child for me. You have to take him as he is and it may be that he’s late <b>[to training]</b>. There are players who do that in defiance, but that’s different with him, he’s just like a little boy. One who earns a lot of money. One who is extremely public. You have to point him in the right direction. For me, he’s still a little boy who was thrown into this giant pool, suddenly cost €150m overnight, and still doesn’t know how it all works because he just wants to play football</p>

There are players who drive Mercedes at 19 years old, get their monthly salary and are satisfied. You have so much talent and do nothing for it, no extra training, nothing. Just play PlayStation and Instagram. It’s okay, but they’re the last to come to training and the first to leave. I used to do that too, but nowadays you can’t afford that in football</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin-Prince Boateng has revealed that he was close to sealing a deal with Orlando City]</b> I don’t know. I was close to signing <b>[with]</b> Orlando, like five years ago. I was really close. They sent me the offer, whatever, I was good with the coach. But they gave me like ten hours to decide and I said, ‘OK, I have to decide as a father, as a husband and as a player’. Ten hours wasn’t enough, so I had to turn down the offer. <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a> even called me when he played there, he said, ‘Listen, come here. It’s a great city. Great place. The football is getting much better.’ I was really close to coming to the States, to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. And I always said to everybody who asked me, I love <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and who knows, I would love to play there because even to say I played in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> as well because it’s getting bigger. I watch a lot of games. It’s getting more intense, it’s getting bigger. The people are going more to the stadium. It’s very, very interesting. Very interesting. And there’s a big market. There’s big market. I have an idea with <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. I don’t want to just go there like a lot of players did - they go there and play there two years. I want to go there and change something. Like I spoke to Puma, my sponsor, and I said, ‘Listen, if I ever have the chance to go to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, be ready, because we’re going to do something’. We’re going to build football fields on the streets for free to play. Everywhere, there are basketball places and baseball fields and that’s why they keep it up there because it is free and you can go play. There are no football cages. We need to open some of those in the biggest cities and get people to love this game</p>
