  <p><b>[New Zealand international Shane Smeltz leaves Wellington Phoenix for Indonesian club, Pusamania Borneo FC]</b> The opportunity has happened quickly as can happen in football. I was totally focused on the Phoenix and had we made the play-offs I would have stayed till we finished playing. At my age I can’t afford to slow down and with the All Whites’ World Cup qualifiers and the Confederations Cup on the horizon I need to keep the good level of fitness I have built up at the Phoenix. I have spoken to <b>[New Zealand coach]</b> Anthony Hudson and he is happy with what I am doing.</p>

  <p><b>[Shane Smeltz explained that he moved to a new club is because he wants to keep playing in order to get a chance to play for New Zealand]</b> Opportunities come fast in football. Before this my focus was with Phoenix and if we managed to get to the play-offs, I would’ve stayed with them. With my age right now, I can’t lose my fitness and drop my performance level. New Zealand is still competing in the World Cup qualification and Confederation Cup so I have to play at the top level at all times</p>
