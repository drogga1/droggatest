<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Perak’s Hafizul Hakim was the toast of the country after his late penalty heroics helped Malaysia to a 1-1 draw against Hong Kong]</b> This <b>[Tuesday]</b> evening when we had a team meeting around 5pm. I was ready but this is my first competitive match, of course I was a little bit nervous but I think it went well for me. I picked a spot and I stuck with my decision. Thankfully it was the right one and maybe it is my lucky day today.<br /><br />I don’t want to criticise the referee but there were a few calls today <b>[Tuesday]</b> that were dubious. Overall the referee was decent but some of the decisions he made did made us feel like weren’t treated fairly. However, one point is a positive point. We are playing at home and it was important that we didn’t lose. We are not far from Hong Kong and we can still fight to get to UAE <b>[United Arab Emirates]</b></p>
