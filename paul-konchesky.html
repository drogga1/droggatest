  <p><b>[Fulham wonderkid Ryan Sessegnon would be better off staying at his current club despite interest from some of the Premier League’s biggest names]</b> Obviously as an older player now I always like to see the younger players stay at the club they’re getting a chance with and make a name for themselves. He’s certainly doing that right now. Another big year with Fulham and you just don’t know what’s around the corner but if Fulham go up to the Premier League then why would he have to leave? He is obviously a very talented young boy but the confidence these players have these days you just wouldn’t think he was 16.<br /><br />If Leicester had finished 17th last season and one point above relegation would they have been shouting for his head? I don’t think so and Ranieri would still be in the Premier League. The owners are ambitious guys and you can see that. After winning the league and then slipping down they couldn’t take a chance because this is where the money is. They’re businessmen and if that’s what was needed to stay in the Premier League then that’s how it is. It does look like the players didn’t want Ranieri there because they’re unbeaten in four now but I know those players and they don’t have that in them. They’re good guys and I think it came from the top</p>

The team are shit, if anyone’s made a mistake it’s the cockney cunt, never should have left Fulham.</p>
