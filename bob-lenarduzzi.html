  <p><b>[Who is Alphonso Davies? The MLS teen sensation invited for a trial by Man Utd]</b> First and foremost, he’s a nice young man. And that’s not always something you can say about talented athletes. He obviously has a lot of ability, but equally important, he’s a humble kid.<br /><br />He has ability, and now he just has to ensure that he continues to do the things he has been doing and not assume that he’s made it, because he hasn’t yet. There have been players who have shown a lot of promise and have faded<br /><br />We can’t smother him, but you can stay on top of things. With the topic of agents, we can’t do a lot in that regard. We can’t tell him who he should or shouldn’t be going with. He has his advisor, who is a friend of the family, and his youth coach, who has worked closely with us</p>

  <p><b>[The Vancouver Whitecaps have fired head coach Carl Robinson]</b> We have a lot of respect and appreciation for Carl and his team, and are thankful for the contributions they have made to this club. A lot of thought and consideration has gone into this decision, which was made with the best interests of the club moving forward. With five games left, we remain focused on our opportunity to make the playoffs. As we look to 2019 and beyond, we are committed to being a championship contender and a global search for a coach to lead this vision will start today.</p>
