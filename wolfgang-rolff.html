  <p><b>[Former Werder Bremen assistant manager Wolfgang Rolff says <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> always had what it takes &amp; De Bruyne a great talent]</b> <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> was a great talent, but he certainly had physical weaknesses at the age of 18. He worked really hard and was able to learn a lot in the shadow of Diego. Thanks to his talent, his speed and his passing game, he grew a lot and had a great career. He always had what was needed; he put it into practice well later on at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>.<br /><br />Kevin came to us from <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> at the time. It is common in Germany that you have to do more running than in England or Belgium. He said, ‘It’s great to train with the ball, but you do so much training without!’. Although we always trained a lot with the ball at Werder. But he accepted that well and what he has done with himself now is of course fantastic. He has always been a great talent with uncanny abilities - quick, two-footed, dangerous<br /><br /><b>[De Bruyne was already being earmarked as a potential star of the future, and surprised some by choosing to go to Werder with <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> also reported to be interested]</b> I think the negotiations with <a href="klaus-allofs.html">Klaus Allofs</a> and Thomas Schaaf showed him the players who have made a big jump in their careers at Werder, such as Johan Micoud or Diego. So he was on board and he saw that he could take the next step with us</p>
