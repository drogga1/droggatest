<blockquote>
  <p>[Canada looking to restore passion, respectability to program as Gold Cup run continues. They’d just lost a tight 3-1 battle to Mexico days prior] We end this path with respect, especially in Concacaf, changing the face of football in our country forever. My journey with the national team started at 18-19 years old when I got called into my first camp. The sense of professionalism maybe, the pressure to win [wasn’t there]. Now we have players playing at their clubs, top-level football, young signings who are exciting around the world.<br /><br />We want to really take this seriously and put our country on the map for men’s football. I know what it’s like to play in Europe, and they look at a Canadian player as less than a footballer. My job is to help our country and leave this jersey in a better place when I’m done with the national team, knowing I was a part of changing the culture here. One of the first conversations I had with John was about what the culture was like before, and I couldn’t tell him because we didn’t have a real mentality or anything that you would want to know about Canadian football. Right now, we know what we have here in this country and this is a great time and a great place to start showcasing what we can bring to international football.</p>
