  <p><b>[Luton saw their hopes of survival improve with a shock 1-0 victory at 10-man <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> thanks to a second-half header from striker James Collins]</b> We’ve only got ourselves to blame. It was a poor result and a poor performance. We didn’t see that coming.When you start like that, it’s difficult to shake it off. It will cost us because points are so important at this stage of the season. We don’t want to be relying on other teams<br /><br />We have to get to a points tally and keep things in our hands. We go to <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> now, which is mammoth</p>

  <p><b>[Millwall and <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a>’s hopes of reaching the Championship play-offs took a hit as they played out a 1-1 draw at The Den on Tuesday evening]</b> We have to keep going and keep believing. Yes we need to get better with game management and get better with looking after the ball late in games, but we will always strive to be better because there is always something to improve on. We won’t give up. <b>[Brewster]</b> practises them every day and his returns are good. I have seen him do it on many occasions and you do fancy them. It was a brilliant goal</p>

  <p><b>[Swansea City and Luton Town charged by FA for fracas. After the game, which Luton won 1-0, <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> head coach Steve Cooper says]</b> It’s a clear red. I’ve got no arguments. I thought the referee caused the melee, but I don’t want my comment on the referee to hide the fact that Jordon has done something that is a clear red</p>

  <p><b>[Swansea strengthened their play-off claims with a 3-1 win that saw <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> boss <a href="pep-clotet.html">Pep Clotet</a> leave the club]</b> Getting the three points was really important at this stage of the season. It was a difficult start and they really rocked us with that but it was a brilliant reaction from the boys. I thought we played excellently in the first half in terms of our positioning and possession and looked a real threat, moving them about<br /><br />It was just about waiting for that moment to create chances and that’s what we did. I was happy with the performance and the result and we have to get ready for the weekend now</p>

  <p><b>[Pablo Hernandez moved <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> to within four points of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> as his late strike against his former club <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> gave United a 1-0 victory at the Liberty Stadium]</b> I thought we were comfortable in the game and I’m really disappointed to lose like that. I think both teams were cautious in terms of attacking and defending and I would have just liked to have had a bit more of the ball in the second half. We would have liked to have picked up a point, but it wasn’t as if anything was going to be decided today. It’s probably going to go to the last game as most things are in the league. The dressing room is down of course and it’s still raw, but the fire in the belly is still there to achieve and we’ll be going to the end</p>

  <p><b>[Sammy Ameobi scored twice to leave Nottingham Forest with one foot in the Championship play-offs and <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a>’s hopes looking rather slimmer following a 2-2 draw at the City Ground]</b> To come here - one of the toughest away games of the season in the Championship - and lead twice but not win, is frustrating. I thought we started the game really well and we were good for the 1-0. If anything I thought we could go and get another to take the initiative. We got ourselves back in front for a second time by getting into areas where we could hurt them. They looked nervous at the back at times. I know there were arguments about whether it was a penalty or not but it was given and we were ahead again. We worked on not letting them score goals from outside the box in the build-up, so for them to score twice like that was a big frustration</p>
