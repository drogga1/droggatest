  <p><b>[2017 U17 World Cup friendlies - Rhian Brewster’s brace seals win for Young Lions]</b> We showed great character. We won the game 3 2 which I think was well deserved. We dominated possession and created the most chances. It would be great to get some feedback on what playing in India is like. We love playing in Mumbai, we love being here. It’s been an excellent experience so far.</p>

  <p><b>[England Under-17 coach Steve Cooper has hailed India coach Stephen Constantine for his help in setting up in the training camp in Mumbai]</b> We have reached out to some people who have worked in India. The India national team manager, Stephen Constantine, has been a real help and I’ve been fascinated at some of the stories that he’s had to tell.<br /><br /><b>[On Steve Coppell]</b> Steve Coppell has managed out there and I’ve had a great conversation with him too and we have some other staff members who have worked out here in terms of sports science. Ashley Westwood is the technical director at Kolkata, where Teddy Sheringham is the manager, and they’ve all helped to give us a really good insight into what it looks like in India and hopefully that information can be valuable in terms of our preparation<br /><br />Preparation is always key, you’re coming together as individuals and trying to become a team as quickly as you can. Particularly in World Cups, acclimatization and getting used to the culture and the surroundings is going to be important. Let’s not forget, they’re only 17 and they only experienced their first major tournament at the U17 Finals in Croatia earlier this year, where they did brilliantly. So this is going to be a new experience all-round for them and preparation for it is key<br /><br />It’s a good life experience for them to go to India and I think it’s really important for the boys to experience what football looks like in other parts of the world. We want to interact with the local people in Kolkata so they recognize that we’re going to be part of their community whilst we’re there.<br /><br />I was so impressed with the interest from the Indian people, there’s a real buzz around the country about hosting the World Cup and a lot of interest. I have no doubt that it will be an amazing World Cup and the support will be at the same level. There’s a real interest in the Premier League and English football, so if we’re bringing part of that to India, it’s important that we give a bit back as well</p>

  <p><b>[England U17’s Steve Cooper focused on Mexico duel]</b> It is obviously a good scoreline 4-0, a decent match. It was a great occasion for the youngsters. Credit to the boys. That is how we expect English teams to play. A lot of positives from the game.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed about their future games involving Sancho]</b> We are only thinking about the group stage matches at the moment. We have to play Mexico and Iraq next. We need to recover quickly and prepare for our upcoming matches in the group stage<br /><br />We have 21 players. All the players in the squad are capable of starting. As I always say it’s a team game and every player is important. We have to make sure that all the players get proper chances to play in the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Luton saw their hopes of survival improve with a shock 1-0 victory at 10-man <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> thanks to a second-half header from striker James Collins]</b> We’ve only got ourselves to blame. It was a poor result and a poor performance. We didn’t see that coming.When you start like that, it’s difficult to shake it off. It will cost us because points are so important at this stage of the season. We don’t want to be relying on other teams<br /><br />We have to get to a points tally and keep things in our hands. We go to <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> now, which is mammoth</p>

Yes we need to get better with game management and get better with looking after the ball late in games, but we will always strive to be better because there is always something to improve on. We won’t give up. <b>[Brewster]</b> practises them every day and his returns are good. I have seen him do it on many occasions and you do fancy them. It was a brilliant goal</p>

I thought the referee caused the melee, but I don’t want my comment on the referee to hide the fact that Jordon has done something that is a clear red</p>

It was a difficult start and they really rocked us with that but it was a brilliant reaction from the boys. I thought we played excellently in the first half in terms of our positioning and possession and looked a real threat, moving them about<br /><br />It was just about waiting for that moment to create chances and that’s what we did. I was happy with the performance and the result and we have to get ready for the weekend now</p>

I think both teams were cautious in terms of attacking and defending and I would have just liked to have had a bit more of the ball in the second half. We would have liked to have picked up a point, but it wasn’t as if anything was going to be decided today. It’s probably going to go to the last game as most things are in the league. The dressing room is down of course and it’s still raw, but the fire in the belly is still there to achieve and we’ll be going to the end</p>

  <p><b>[Sammy Ameobi scored twice to leave <a href="nottingham-forest.html">Nottingham Forest</a> with one foot in the Championship play-offs and <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a>’s hopes looking rather slimmer following a 2-2 draw at the City Ground]</b> To come here - one of the toughest away games of the season in the Championship - and lead twice but not win, is frustrating. I thought we started the game really well and we were good for the 1-0. If anything I thought we could go and get another to take the initiative. We got ourselves back in front for a second time by getting into areas where we could hurt them. They looked nervous at the back at times. I know there were arguments about whether it was a penalty or not but it was given and we were ahead again. We worked on not letting them score goals from outside the box in the build-up, so for them to score twice like that was a big frustration</p>
