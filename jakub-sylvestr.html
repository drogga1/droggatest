  <p>[On Mateo Kovacic] Of course I remember i. It was this rabona kick, Kovacic scored with a header. It was a great win and from then on he was with us for the whole time. I partly remember it because you don’t get many rabona assists. To get in the Dinamo squad at 16, you knew he must have been really good. Everybody at the club knew he was something special already and then after his debut the whole country knew it as well. He was really small compared to the other players, but his ball skills were amazing. His dribbling was crazy and you could see he could control the ball very well. He just needed to wait for some years to get this body weight, to get a bit older and then he developed really fast on the pitch</p>

  <p>[Napoli star Marek Hamsik should be regarded as Slovakia’s greatest ever ahead of former Liverpool centre-back Martin Skrtel] I know Marek very well. We grew up in the same city and our fathers played together. We went to the same football academy in my town. I have known him since I was eight or nine years old. He was always a big talent in Slovakia. He was two years older, I would leave the pitch and his team would enter in a lot of games and tournaments at our club. At that time he was regarded as a huge talent already. As he got older, he continued to progress and develop. I think he has always been a big player at all his clubs and he proved that he is the best in Slovakia and one of the best in the world. He worked really hard, taking these small steps in his career. Then he went to bigger and bigger clubs. A lot of people in Slovakia say, ‘oh he is not that good’ and we don’t really appreciate his success in Slovakia. Sometimes I think people are a little bit jealous.<br /><br />I can tell you that he is also one of the best players that I have ever played with. For sure, in the world too. He is good with his weaker left foot and it is basically just as good as his right foot. He is really talented and he is possibly the best in Slovakian history. He had been competing with Martin Skrtel for the best player in Slovakia award every season, espescially when Martin was at Liverpool. But for me, Marek is the best. Skrtel was really tough, a destroyer in defence and a great player, but for me Marek has everything. Shooting, passing, crossing and great vision. He is amazing to watch. For me, he is the top one.”<br /><br />Hamsik has enjoyed a fine career at Napoli, but many feel he could have represented an even bigger club. Sylvestr, however, is adamant the Serie A side are a huge team already. I think he at in one of the best teams in Italy, it is unfortunate that he never won Serie A,” he added. I think it is great that he has spent 10 years there. He beat Maradona’s record and he is loved in Naples. I think he could have done it somewhere else and it isn’t exactly like Napoli is Livorno, their fans are incredible.</p>
