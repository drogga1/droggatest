  <p><b>[father Abedi <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> says Olympique <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a>’s <a href="andre-ayew.html">Andre Ayew</a> will be greater than me]</b> Of course, a father who doesn’t want his son to be greater than him, I think he has lost it. A great father will always want his son to be greater than him and that is what I wish for him. He can win the Uefa Champions League and even the World Cup, if that is possible<br /><br /><b>[the three-time African Footballer of the Year said his son’s passion for the game is driven by the hunger and desire to win every match]</b> He does not want to lose and he doesn’t want to be ridiculed by an opposing team. With all the talent he also has the courage and determination to fight and then make sure he fights and brings success to his team and to himself. So I think these are the ingredients that make him unique to his team among a lot, these are the few things that make him unique. You are yet to see a lot about Jordan. He is very skilful, very strong and very opportunistic on in front of goal. He is something else. I keep on saying, we should wait and see. We cross our fingers that there are no injuries or something bad happens, that boy is going to be something else</p>

They have a young career which is another 10 to 15 years to go, let’s just pray they are well and they continue to play great football. I’m grateful to God they are making millions and millions of fans happy, they are touching their hearts and I’m delighted they are using the talents God has given them in the right direction</h4>

Kotoko is a great team and it is hard to beat them. Tactical awareness made us win. We didn’t anticipate winning but the better team won</h4>

  <p><b>[Ghana’s Abedi <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> says <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>’s <a href="kevin-prince-boateng.html">Kevin-Prince Boateng</a> is my favourite <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> player]</b> He went there as a player that nobody considered that can top the Italian league and he has been able to prove himself and has proved to the club that he is one of the great players that the club can maintain and can look forward to. I’m happy that he is a Ghanaian and has been able to achieve all that<br /><br />We need him. We don’t have to be arrogant. You must have some managerial skill to be able to manage certain difficult players in the team because when you have a group you always have difficult people in the group and it’s up to you the manager to bring them together and bring success to your country<br /><br />So it all comes to managerial skills because you can be good on the ground as fantastic tactician, but you must have managerial skill to bring egos together and turn it into a winning side. If people can really convince him to comeback it will help us in a great deal.</p>
