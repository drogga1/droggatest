Nelson Semedo may hold the key to Barcelona’s summer pursuit of both Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann and Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar. However, another option for Barca exists if they want to get Griezmann over the line without paying the entire release clause. That option is including Semedo in a swap deal with Atletico</p>

<p>: 2019 07 01b
When Antoine Griezmann’s named was called out by the stadium announcer ahead of Atletico Madrid’s must-win Liga visit to Barcelona in April, the Camp Nou crowd responded with boos. Once the action got under way, the forward’s every touch was whistled. Then, when he went to take a corner early in the second half, the north stand really made their feelings towards him known, unanimously bellowing: ‘Griezmann, you bast*rd, get out of Camp Nou!’. All we were missing was a pig’s head. Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu was hit hardest by Griezmann’s U-turn; the World Cup winner was meant to be his stellar summer signing. Instead, he was left embarrassed, weakened, by the whole affair. Bartomeu is the sole driving force behind the deal, which has been greeted with bemusement by some fans, and outrage by others</p>

But then there is the club where you are, where you are an important player and where they build a project around you</p>

  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid have hit back at Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu with a scathing statement registering the club’s ‘disgust’ at how the Catalans and Antoine Griezmann have conducted themselves]</b> On May 14 Antoine Griezmann told Miguel Angel Gil, Diego Simeone and Andrea Berta of his decision to leave the club at the end of the season. In the days following that meeting Atletico were made aware that Barcelona and the player had reached a deal back in March, just after the second leg of our Champions League game against Juventus, and that they had been negotiating the terms of the deal since mid-February.<br /><br />With regards to President Bartomeu’s declarations today, we want to make clear that it is true a meeting took place yesterday between Miguel Angel Gil and Barcelona CEO Oscar Grau, at Barcelona’s request; and that in said meeting Mr Grau made known his intention to, once the release clause in Antoine Griezmann’s contract has been modified from €200 to €120 million, ask for a delay in the payment of the above amount in the clause, valid from July 1.<br /><br />Obviously Atletico Madrid’s answer was negative, understanding that both Barcelona and the player have disrespected Atletico Madrid and all their fans. As a consequence, today Atletico Madid have ordered the player, his sister in her capacity as his agent and his lawyer, that Antoine Griezmann must present himself on Sunday at the club to begin pre-season with the rest of his team-mates, in compliance with his contractual obligations. By way of this statement Atletico Madrid wish to express their deepest disgust at the behaviour of both parties, especially Barcelona, for having induced a player to break his contract with Atletico Madrid at a point in the season where the club was fighting not just for the Champions League against Juventus, but also La Liga itself against none other than Barcelona, something that we consider contravenes the established negotiation periods with players and distorts the basic rules that ensure the integrity of all sporting competition, as well as causing enormous damage to our club and our millions of fans</p>

Atletico Madrid revealed that Barca and Griezmann connived in March to agree to personal terms having been in contact since the month previous. They announced their rejection of Barca’s offer and demanded Griezmann show up to their pre-season programme set for Sunday evening. The World Cup winner was instead pictured on board a yacht off Ibiza, sipping a bottle of beer with – seemingly – not a care in the world. A representative cited ‘emotional stress’ and a legally-mandated 30-day holiday period as the reasons behind his stayaway. Coincidentally, Neymar pulled the same ruse just 24 hours later with PSG not happy about their star turn failing to report for duty</p>

  <p><b>[Atletico Madrid have released an official statement outlining their intention to open legal proceedings regarding Antoine Griezmann’s move to Barcelona]</b> Antoine Griezmann, represented by his lawyer, appeared at the headquarters of Liga de Futbol Profesional (LFP) to terminate the contract that bound the player to Atletico Madrid, with Barcelona having deposited the amount of €120 million on behalf of the player. Atletico Madrid believes that the amount deposited to meet the termination clause is insufficient, since it is obvious that the agreement between the player and Barcelona was reached before the aforementioned clause was reduced from 200 to 120 million euros.<br /><br />It was also prior to the date on which the clause was modified that the player announced that he would be leaving the club (May 14). Atletico Madrid believes that the termination of the contract occurred before the end of last season due to events, acts and demonstrations carried out by the player and that is why we have already started the procedures we consider appropriate for the legitimate defence of our rights and interests</p>

Atletico Madrid have demanded La Liga prevent Antoine Griezmann from playing for Barcelona next season. Griezmann confirmed he would be leaving Atleti at the end of last season, despite having only signed a five-year contract at Wanda Metropolitano in June 2018 after turning down a move to Barca.</p>

  <p><b>[Antoine Griezmann is proud of winning Lionel Messi’s praise]</b> His words made me feel very happy. He’s the best. When he talks, the whole world listens. He knows this. That he would say that about me made me feel very proud. I insist that I’m desperate to finally play alongside him. I want to meet him, get to know him, watch him in training, play alongside him, provide assists. I’ve thought about it when I’m in bed, at training, and watching videos. You make the ‘film’ in your head and I know it’ll go well. It’ll be really nice<br /><br /><b>[Griezmann appears likely to form a fearsome front three with Messi and striker Luis Suarez when Ernesto Valverde brings his entire squad together back on home soil]</b> On paper, it sounds really good. Later, you have to show it out on the pitch, but I trust us, I trust the team. There’s also Ousmane Dembele, Malcom, Philippe Coutinho too. There are a lot of top-quality attackers who I’m sure will help the team do great things<br /><br /><b>[That could still include Neymar if the Paris Saint-Germain forward gets his wish for a move back to Barca]</b> Let’s see what happens. There are a lot of details to a transfer. Neymar is world-class, a top player, so he could fit in at Barca</p>

I’ve been playing in La Liga since I was 18 and I haven’t won it. It’s really tough. It looks easy because Barca win year after year but it’s really difficult</p>

  <p><b>[Recently, one of the most high-profile cases of tapping up has involved Barcelona once again in their successful pursuit of Antoine Griezmann]</b> Through this statement, Atletico Madrid wishes to express its strongest disapproval of the behaviour of both, especially FC Barcelona, for prompting the player to break his contractual relationship with Atletico Madrid at a time of the season when the club was involved in the Champions League tie against Juventus, as well as the league title race against Barcelona<br /><br />This is something that we believe violates the protected periods of negotiation with players and alters the basic rules of integrity in any sporting competition, as well as causing enormous damage to our club and its millions of fans</p>

There is still margin to improve but it is the line to follow. When important people are missing, the team takes a step forward and it has been like that.

There are sometimes homophobic songs. In our time, this is unacceptable. This attitude, we all end up paying for it</p>

Taking into account the economic capacity of the club and the amount of the economic operation, this committee is aware that the payment of €300, beyond its merely symbolic nature (the fine is imposed because the issued club has been considered the author of a disciplinary infraction), will not contribute to the sanctioned club in particular and, probably, other clubs that may be in the same situation in the future, adapt their behaviour to what is required by regulation. However, this is not a sufficient reason for this committee to opt for the imposition of a sanction - the closing of the stadium by a party - which, as stated, seems to be intended for infractions of another nature</p>
