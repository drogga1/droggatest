They <b>[Uruguay]</b> will probably defend differently against him. It is a quarter-final and he is just 19 years old. He was quiet in the locker room and the tunnel. His maturity impresses me. He is always listening, it’s great for us. When he wants to score even more, to hurt teams, he’ll be a top player. He will rise up the game. It’s up to us to give him the right balls<br /><br />I was surprised that Argentina played without strikers, with <b>[Gonzalo]</b> Higuain and <b>[Sergio]</b> Aguero on the bench, but it was <b>[Jorge]</b> Sampaoli who made his choices.

Cristiano was the guy out wide, doing a lot of dribbling and occasionally scoring. He was not looking for goals, though. When Kylian does what Cristiano did in Madrid, thinking only about scoring, then he will do the same. He will be scoring 50 goals per season.<br /><br />In front of goal in training, Kylian is not all that. I tease him often - I ask him how he manages to score so many goals. When we do finishing drills, he never wins. As soon as he changes that, though, he will be a force to be reckoned with<br /><br />Kylian has to want to go and score - the goal that he scored against Liverpool <b>[in the Champions League]</b> came from the middle.

But my teammates and club people did everything, they came to talk to me, increased my salary. They did everything to show that it was my house and that I shouldn’t leave.

  <p><b>[Griezmann plans to make history alongside <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> It’s a pride thing, I’m very happy to be at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. My father is very happy to see his son playing at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I want to write the history of this club. I have to work to do it, I have to work to be important for this club<br /><br />I hope to improve both in goals and assists. I’m adapting, trying to learn as much about the tactics as possible. I feel very good, physically and mentally. I really want to work. I really want to improve<br /><br />Leo is the strongest player in the world and it’s nice to share the pitch with him. I try to understand his movements and move well when he has the ball to have a better connection<br /><br />The fans, <a href="diego-simeone.html">Cholo Simeone</a>, team-mates, it was a beautiful experience, at the moment the best of my career. Now I’m at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, the best club in the world. It’s a new challenge, game and a new style, that’s why I’m settling in little by little.

  <p><b>[Griezmann: I’m still learning to play with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b> We knew how hard <a href="getafe-fc.html">Getafe</a> would be to play against. They put a lot of pressure on and pressed high. They are third for a reason but we kept cool, tried to play the ball well from the back. It was tough but we suffered and won. I’ve been here six months, we still have to learn. I have to learn <b>[Messi’s]</b> movements and he has to learn mine. We’re enjoying the work we put in together and it’s getting better and better all the time. I’m very happy and really enjoying myself here. I missed a chance which I shouldn’t have done, it came to my weaker foot but luckily it didn’t matter</p>

That’s my ideal itinerary. It’s not bad, is it? If the plan goes like that, I’d sign for that now. I don’t know at which age I want to play in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, it’ll all depend on the trophies I’ll have won beforehand. When I’m nearer 32 or 33, I want to be there.

  <p><b>[Griezmann losing the fight to prove he’s not just another <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> transfer flop]</b> I don’t take into consideration the player’s price tag. Last week we chose one specific team, and today we decided on another one. These are decisions I make and they are technical decisions. They’re not made rashly, and they are done with the best of intentions for the team</p>
