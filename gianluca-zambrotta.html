  <p><b>[Gianluca Zambrotta on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> vs Ronaldo]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> are both extraordinary players. They are able to score 60 to 70 goals per season each. But <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is the players who is better at turning a game at any time. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> does as well, but <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has more of the charisma of Maradona</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluca Zambrotta explains the decision behind coming to India and choosing Delhi Dynamos]</b> I really like to get to know other places. Two years in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> as a player, I enjoyed the experience of playing abroad a lot. I’m a person who really likes to experience other cultures and other mentalities, especially on a footballing level. Doing this helps you grow as a person<br /><br />In my opinion, India is a football nation that wants to grow a lot. It wants to become big in the next few years. So, which country could have been better for me to come to in order to grow together? I believe that this is the best team in India. It’s the team of the capital, which India represents. It was the obvious choice<br /><br /><b>[Delhi Dynamos made it to the last four in the 2015 edition, and the Italian said that his goal this year is to win the title]</b> My goal is the same as the president, the staff and players is to try to do as much as possible to win the league this year and then, next year, we’ll see. I’m someone who lives very much in the present. I don’t think too much about the future. The main objective is to win and to make history with this club<br /><br />We want to win but success also means helping the players grow and, with my technical skills and those of my staff, I should be able to teach them a good brand of football that should lead to success<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether his Delhi side will bank on their defensive solidity like most Italian teams, Zambrotta said that his team will run and fight as 11 players on the field]</b> It’s been said many times that Italy has great defensive organisation. Also some great Spanish sides too, though, like <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>’s Real and <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>’s Atletico are well organised. But defensive organisation doesn’t mean that a team only defends. All the teams must run and fight as 11 players on the field</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluca Zambrotta back <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> appointment at Juventus]</b> I like <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> as a coach. There’s an important project around him now. I don’t know if it’s for a long or short period. But, of course, he needs time to organise everything at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> because it is a new job and it is a new opportunity<br /><br /><b>[Zambrotta, who played for Inter’s city rivals, <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>, believes the excitement is growing at San Siro following <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>’s appointment]</b> We can see the reaction of the fans, the season tickets sold out in just one week. This is a result of the new coach, so there’s huge optimism in the fans</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluca Zambrotta says <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> fans are dreaming of signing <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> from Paris Saint-Germain]</b> <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> fans, and Italian fans in general, dream of seeing <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. It would be yet another great marketing move for Italian football, after <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. With <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> would be in the top five big clubs in the world. The <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> brand would grow massively in the world.<br /><br />It won’t be easy, but I see also a possible return of <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is difficult, although there were many famous comebacks in football recent history, the last being that of <b>[Gianluigi]</b> <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a> to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> after a short spell at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, I recall also <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a> and Shevchenko returned to AC Milan<br /><br /><a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> always have big names on their shopping list. If they want to be competitive in Europe and finally win the Champions League after so many years, they have to spend big money and keep on securing the best players. Like they did with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> last summer.<br /><br />They’ve already invested a lot of money in promising young players, like De Ligt. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> would probably give <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> the edge on the European stage. Times have changed compared to 15 years ago. Football has changed a lot.<br /><br /><a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are making long-term investments on young players born in 1999 and 1998, for example Merih Demiral, who has a bright future ahead, and De Ligt, who is only 19 year old and already proved his value at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>.<br /><br /><a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> needed to invest in defenders, because they have relied on <b>[Giorgio]</b> <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Chiellini</a> who is not getting any younger, despite being still reliable, <b>[Leonardo]</b> <a href="leonardo-bonucci.html">Bonucci</a> is not young either, <b>[Andrea]</b> <a href="andrea-barzagli.html">Barzagli</a> has just retired, so <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> needed to sign a great defender</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> wing back Gianluca Zambrotta discussed Inter’s January transfer window moves and the title race against the Bianconeri]</b> <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>’s arrival brought an important piece of what <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> was asking for, a physically strong central striker that makes the ball go forward, that assists his team-mates, that moves 30 metres on the pitch alone and then gets to the shot and scores. He is a really important player for <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Zambrotta then touched on Inter’s squad and what they need to do to be competitive with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, who are currently first in the league table]</b><br /><br />Clearly if Inter are to be competitive again to hurt <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, there has to be a squad made up of great players. <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> would certainly be a strong purchase, perhaps in the summer market. But Inter haven’t had a repair market, but a market with important purchase</p>
