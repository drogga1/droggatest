<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Everton academy doctor John Thomas praised the quick thinking and initiative shown by Republic of Ireland doctor <a href="alan-byrne.html">Alan Byrne</a>, having promptly treated youngster Shane Duffy who had suffered a life threatening injury in a training game]</b> The Irish doctor had a decision to make when Shane went down injured. He could have brought him over to the side of the pitch for closer inspection or he could have taken him straight to the hospital. Nine out of 10 times you take the player to the sideline and have a closer look. He actually ‘crashed’ when they were in casualty. Had Dr <a href="alan-byrne.html">Byrne</a> not decided to take him there, it would have been different. It will be three months before he can do any sort of physical activity. But the surgeon who carried out the operation, Professor Gerry McEntee - who also needs to be applauded - expects that Shane will be able to make a full physical recovery.</p>
