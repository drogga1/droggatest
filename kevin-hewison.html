  <p><b>[Yingluck impeachment is an execution of Thai democracy]</b> No-one should be surprised that Thailand’s former prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, has been impeached by the military-appointed National Legislative Assembly. This was one more act in a political tragedy in which elected politicians have been repeatedly defeated by the military and judiciary.<br /><br />Despite rumours of a behind-the-scenes ‘deal’ being done, when the assembly voted it was almost unanimous in impeaching Yingluck and banning her from politics for five years last week. These events were scripted, directed and produced by the military junta. Perhaps the only surprise was that Yingluck defended herself, her government and electoral democracy.<br /><br />The impeachment was a show trial. An unelected assembly, packed with generals and Yingluck Shinawatra’s political opponents, threw out an elected politician who had already been sacked by the Constitutional Court before the May 2014 coup. That putsch - itself illegal - ejected the elected government, scrapped the 2007 constitution and set its own rules to retroactively impeach Yingluck from a position she no longer held.<br /><br />The allegations against Yingluck were vague. They asserted dereliction of duty in overseeing a rice subsidy scheme, causing 500 billion baht in damages to the economy, mismanagement and corruption. Little convincing evidence was presented<br /><br />The rice subsidy scheme was part of her Pheu Thai Party’s election platform when it won a landslide election victory in 2011. Thai governments have long intervened in the rice trade. The scheme Pheu Thai promoted was a variant of a policy begun more than 30 years ago. The policy was changed substantially in 2001 by Thaksin, Yingluck’s brother, after he was elected. Yingluck’s scheme was meant to move state funds to farmers to reduce poverty and stimulate consumption. Yingluck’s scheme was expensive but also politically popular. But none of this matters much in a political landscape of division that sometimes resulted in violence. The failures of the scheme were simply an excuse for another political execution<br /><br />Not unlike her brother’s situation when he was ousted by a coup in 2006, it was Yingluck Shinawatra’s electoral popularity that brought her downfall. Thailand’s political elite is suspicious of elected politicians and fears that ‘populist’ policies threaten its social, economic and political control.<br /><br />Having regained total control in May 2014 and ruling with an iron fist, the obvious question is why the military feels it must punish Yingluck. There are several reasons: <br /><br />First, the junta is confident that it has broken the opposition associated with the Pheu Thai Party and the red shirt movement.<br /><br />Second, the junta is reasserting its anti-Thaksin credentials with the royalist street movement that paved the way for the coup and which has representatives in the assembly and other appointed bodies<br /><br />Third, and related, it wants no opposition as it crafts a new constitution that will alter the political rules to prevent any popular political party winning any national poll.<br /><br />Finally, the military wants to continue to steer political developments. There’s a good chance that the coup leader, General <a href="prayuth-chan-ocha.html">Prayuth Chan-ocha</a>, will stay on as prime minister after elections.<br /><br />The punishment is not over for Yingluck. The attorney-general’s office has brought charges against her that could mean ten years in jail. Other courts are processing charges against several senior members of her party, including two former prime ministers. Such actions are meant to silence critics and neuter the Pheu Thai Party. Extensive purges in all government agencies have removed officials deemed sympathetic to Pheu Thai, replacing them with political allies, many from the military.</p>

  <p><b>[Thailand initially said the boys would go through a six-month psychological monitoring period, but the government has thrust them back into the spotlight just two months after their ordeal.

The junta has repeatedly delayed plans to hold an election, and the new king is not nearly as popular as his late father. It makes him look good, <b>[and]</b> it makes the junta look good. This is an opportunity to reinforce a good news story for the junta internationally, which then makes them appear more legitimate within Thailand<br /><br />The junta is campaigning pretty hard on the election trail when no other party is allowed to campaign at the moment, so this is another way to campaign<br /><br />The image that appeared in the Thai media was one of these kids - some of whom are still not Thai citizens - before a huge picture of the king, and the first thing that they’re doing is thanking the king for his efforts. This is an opportunity for the palace PR machine to get to work and try and build an international profile for him</p>

  <p>Two tasks defined the military junta’s political agenda upon seizing power in 2014. One was to undermine former prime minister <a href="thaksin-shinawatra.html">Thaksin Shinawatra</a>’s political appeal and crush his electoral machine. A second was to eradicate the anti-monarchism that developed following the 2006 military coup. The junta now seems to be claiming victory on both tasks<br /><br />In the past, the junta has repeatedly postponed promised elections, fearing that the pro-Thaksin Pheu Thai Party would do well despite the junta’s election laws and rules that are expressly designed to disadvantage Pheu Thai. This year, the junta seemingly came to the conclusion that it had done enough to derail the pro-Thaksin electoral juggernaut and began preparations for an election on 24 February 2019<br /><br />The belief that a ‘victory’ over Pheu Thai is finally possible speaks to the junta’s satisfaction with its efforts to repress red shirts. It also reflects a perception that former Thaksin finance minister <a href="somkid-jatusripitak.html">Somkid Jatusripitak</a> has successfully developed a pro-junta political party that has convinced former Thaksin politicians to defect to the junta.<br /><br />Made a member of the junta after the coup, <a href="somkid-jatusripitak.html">Somkid</a> became Deputy Prime Minister in 2015 and revamped the junta’s failing economic programs by convincing its leadership to adopt Thaksin-esque populist economic policies. With a cabal of former senior pro-Thaksin politicians, <a href="somkid-jatusripitak.html">Somkid</a> also created the new Palang Pracharat Party that, if electorally successful, will propose that Prayuth continue as prime minister in the next government<br /><br />Even if polls suggest otherwise, these developments appear to have given the regime confidence that its parties can triumph over pro-Thaksin parties. Still, the junta is taking no chances, and throughout 2018 it implemented rules and policies to benefit its supporters and hobble Pheu Thai. Commentators are now discounting Pheu Thai’s electoral challenge to the junta<br /><br />The junta can also claim victory in its war on anti-monarchism. Following the 2014 coup there was a huge spike in lese majeste prosecutions involving perceived insults to the monarchy. The decline in prosecutions in 2017 and their elimination in 2018 suggests the junta feels that it has successfully controlled anti-monarchism. It may also reflect <a href="king-rama-x.html">King Vajiralongkorn</a>’s preference that such cases do not tarnish his reign, at least until his coronation is held<br /><br />At the time of <a href="king-rama-x.html">Vajiralongkorn</a>’s accession in 2016, several commentators felt that the monarchy was in crisis and that its public profile would decline. <a href="king-rama-x.html">Vajiralongkorn</a> was thought unpopular, erratic and self-serving. But his profile was boosted this year by significant palace and junta efforts to promote an image of the king as a benign monarch. This has involved several public events such as traditionalist revivals, a river spectacular and a bike ride. The latter was led by the king, with participants donning free shirts designed by <a href="king-rama-x.html">Vajiralongkorn</a> himself<br /><br />Related to this campaign, the junta and palace sanctioned the creation of an official royal support group, known as Volunteer Spirit, which reportedly has some four million members. The group claims to have been involved in the rescue of the young soccer players trapped in a cave that made international headlines, and the delivery of relief supplies following the collapse of a dam and subsequent flooding in Laos.<br /><br />For some, the volunteer group evokes memories of royalist gangs involved in the 1976 massacre at Thammasat University. There is also concern over plans for a quadrupling of the size of the police force that ‘protects’ the monarch, with some seeing this expansion as a return to the monarchy-military relationship associated with multiple coups and political repression over the last several decades<br /><br />For his part, the king tried and succeeded to gain more personal control over palace affairs this year. Most significantly, <a href="king-rama-x.html">Vajiralongkorn</a> demanded more changes to the legal status of the crown’s US$35-50 billion holdings, making it his personal property and allocating him remarkable powers to determine which assets belong to the crown. He also replaced the long-serving head of the Crown Property Bureau with a trusted military aide and made changes to the Privy Council.<br /><br />Within Bangkok, the palace consolidated its property in the so-called royal precinct by closing popular sites to the public, substantially expanding the precinct and removing historical markers connected to the 1932 revolution that overthrew the absolute monarchy. All of this has considerably enhanced <a href="king-rama-x.html">Vajiralongkorn</a>’s power and influence<br /><br />Looking ahead, 2019 may see both an election and a coronation. The junta’s hope is that an election will result in a government that ends military dictatorship but maintains the military’s domination and marks the end of the Thaksin era. If that happens, the junta will likely consider the coronation as a royal endorsement of the military’s political efforts since the 2014 coup</p>
