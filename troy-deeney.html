  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>’s Troy Deeney has called on Twitter to support every player who is the subject of racial abuse on the social media platform, rather than just football’s biggest stars]</b> It takes that to shed the light on it but that’s the frustration. Why does it have to be the big guys? It could be anyone, unless you play for the big clubs, unless you’re high profile that’s when they take it seriously. I didn’t see the statement, but when I hear things like ‘trying’, interesting they’re ‘trying’. It’s not difficult to do and to identify what is and what isn’t. Let’s see, I’m not optimistic but let’s see. The big boys are involved now like your Man Uniteds and things like that so that then makes them a bit more proactive, so let’s see. Any help is a good help, but I’m at that point now where it’s been going on for so long that why would now be any different? I <b>[turned Twitter notifications off]</b> at one point but I turned it back on, I’m not letting them win<br /><br /><b>[Deeney added that at one point racist abuse became so prevalent that he had to stop himself using social media]</b> I just had to do it because I would have said something stupid. It’s more of a personal barrier to stop myself and also I think there’s a huge responsibility too. I’ve got kids that follow me, I’ve got my own kids, my little brothers on social media. So how can I not do something and go ‘this is acceptable’ - if they do it to somebody else then I’m part of the problem as well. It’s just frustrating. I know no one is brave enough to say it to my face, so you’ve got to take it for what it is. I’m from the era before the internet, so I know what’s real and what’s not so you’ve just got to learn to roll with the punches</p>

  <p><b>[Troy Deeney says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> is the best number nine in the Premier League]</b> I think he’s probably the best No.9 in the league, personally. If you’re a manager you want someone who can close down the whole back four on his own, link play, come short - he scores goals and he gets assists. For me, he’s the best around at the moment. You have to look at the two boys he’s got either side of him <b>[Mane &amp; <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>]</b>, 20-plus goals each last season? He didn’t have a bad season at any point but when you have those two overshadowing all the time you kind of take away his importance. But I think when he’s not in the team you definitely see it. Massively</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> captain Troy Deeney says his side took inspiration from Tyson Fury ahead of their shock 3-0 defeat of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> We took heed off Tyson Fury. We thought we’re going to go on the front foot and have it out with them. We were good and they were a little bit off. Let’s not act like they were at their best. We took our chances and I don’t know what more to say. I don’t want to be disrespectful to them.<br /><br />It’s three points. We don’t get an extra point for beating <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or <b>[see it as]</b> we’re out of the bottom three, that’s it, we’re done. There’s 10 games left and we’ve got to graft away. It is what it is. I won’t look at this game in two months’ time if we’re relegated and go, ‘Oh remember that game against Liverpool’. I’ll be p*ssed off<br /><br />Everyone was putting too much pressure on this. That’s testament to the manager, man-managing and not getting caught up in the hype over ‘We have to win this game’. So we had our least demanding week in months. I don’t think that’s going to be something the gaffer does going forward, but we go again</p>

He’s so sick. He scored against us, everybody said he was unbelievable. He could play the same game against <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> and not score and he’s ‘lazy’. That’s how fickle fans are. He could play really bad, have real bad touches, score two, you win 2-0, <b>[and people say]</b> Martial’s unbelievable today. They’re not looking at the footballing context. If you’re looking at it from a purely football context - why’s he going to chase a right-back down? He’s not going to do that. I’m not going to lie, it’s how I made a living!<br /><br />I still think they need to figure out Martial - is he playing on the left or as a striker?</p>

  <p><b>[Deeney: Simple questions not answered over <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> player safety on coronavirus return]</b> I think the concern is very much that Phases Two <b>[when players start contact training]</b> and Three have not been clearly laid out. There has been a lot of what I would class as simple questions that have not been answered. For example, you can talk about the BAME situation. Government guidelines are saying it is four times more likely for people of colour to get the illness and twice as likely to have lasting illnesses, but there is no extra screening and no additional checks being done on any players because it costs too much money. Simple things like that are where people are asking questions and it’s not being answered. When people can’t answer the questions, you start to panic and start to worry. I saw <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> say his dad has asthma and he lives with him so he has concerns. It’s not just players at the bottom who are trying to stay in the league. There are concerns right across the board. I have had a lot of texts from players who are worried about coming out and speaking.<br /><br />We see a lot about care workers and key workers not getting tested and people dying in nursing homes and things of that nature, yet we are expected to have just short of 3,500 tests per month as football players, and PPE for all the staff. How long will it be until that’s the players’ fault? ‘Look at these prima donna footballers that are getting all this preferential treatment when there’s people dying on the street’. That was posed by one of my colleagues. As of five, six weeks ago the NHS was in dire straits and it was put on footballers to make donations, which was already going to happen. But when politicians are calling us out, there is an underlying message that no matter what we do we are painted to be the bad guys</p>

  <p><b>[Several players have voiced their concerns over going back to play with the situation as it is currently in the UK]</b> I’m not even talking about football at the moment - I’m talking about my family’s health. If I feel that I’m not looking after my family, then I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to put my family at risk. What are they going to do, take money off me? I’ve been broke before so it doesn’t bother me. They’re talking about not playing in front of fans until 2021. So if it’s not safe enough for fans to be inside a stadium why should it be safe for players to be in there?</p>

My son is five months and he’s had breathing difficulties. I don’t want to come home to put him in more danger. You’ve got to drive in in your own kit, you can’t have showers, then you’ve got to drive back home in the same dirty kit you’ve got. While we are getting tested and while we are going to be in a very safe environment, it only takes one person to get infected within the group. I don’t want to be bringing that home</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> striker Troy Deeney has said he feels sorry for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because even if they win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> this term, it will be spoiled by the coronavirus pandemic]</b> I believe that when it comes to the integrity of this season anyway, it’s already gone. I feel sorry for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because no matter how it plays out, they deserve to win the league. They deserve to get the trophy. But no matter how it plays out, even if we play all the games, it’s still going to be the year spoiled by the pandemic. It’s not going to be that year that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> won the league being the best team and, you know, it’s 30 years they haven’t won for. So I do feel sorry for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and their players and Jordan <b>[Henderson]</b>, but in terms of integrity, there’s no way you could say that this is a viable competition. It’s like running a marathon, 20 odd miles, stopping for two months and then sprinting the last bit and going: ‘Ah, that was a good time that.’<br /><br />Personally, I just think this is showing me that the players have so much power if they actually all came together. That’s what this is showing me. I’ve had a lot of messages of support from people that I wouldn’t normally – well, that I didn’t even know had my number for a start. But certainly from players from bigger clubs and that shows me that I must be doing something right because I’m just a little old Troy from <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> and everyone seems to listen to what I say</p>

  <p><b>[Troy Deeney has spoken about the abuse he and his family have suffered after he expressed concerns about the safety of the return of the Premier League]</b> I saw some comments in regards to my son, people saying: ‘I hope your son gets corona. That’s the hard part for me. If you respond to that, people then go: ‘Ah, we’ve got him’ and they keep doing it. In a time where it’s all about mental health and everyone says ‘speak up, speak out, please speak’, <a href="danny-rose.html">Danny Rose</a> spoke out and I spoke out and we just get absolutely hammered and battered for it. So, people see that and go ‘woah’ and it’s not just us that gets it, the missus gets direct messages and you’ll be walking down the street and people will be like: ‘Oh, I’m at work, you go back to work’.<br /><br />He’s been doing very, very good research and there is a lot of goodwill on his part to tell me, ultimately, that I’m going to be looked after as best as they can and, ultimately, there is going to be some form of risk for all of us going back to work. Lockdown and the social distancing measures coming down mean people will still always have risk</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> striker Troy Deeney says there is probably one gay or bisexual player in each team]</b> I would go on record saying that there is probably one gay or bi person in every football team. They’re there, they are 100 per cent there. I think people that are gay or from that community definitely are very worried about having to shoulder the responsibility of being the first. I think once the first comes out, there would be loads. If they came out and said it, I genuinely believe you would get, in the first week, at least 100 people that went ‘me too’. Just because they don’t want to be the face of it. I think there is now a bigger platform than ever to be a gay athlete of any nature. I also wonder why people finish football, rugby, whatever the sport it might be, and then go ‘I am gay’. I feel like it must be a real heavy load to carry throughout all your whole sporting career</p>

  <p><b>[Troy Deeney says it is crucial to keep up the momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement]</b> It’s at the forefront of everyone’s mind. The hardest part is to keep the conversation going. We have to make sure that this isn’t a couple of weeks of news and then we move on to the next thing<br /><br />People say it was me and Wes <b>[Morgan]</b>, and naturally we are going to take a bit more credit as we are black and naturally have an emotional attachment, but Kevin De Bruyne was massive in the chat, <a href="seamus-coleman.html">Seamus Coleman</a> was massive in the chat, <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> was massive in the chat. People were having our back and saying: ‘No, we want to do this. We want to help. We want to step up.’<br /><br />They’ve been very good, very open, very receptive to challenge. Also, they’ve told me to shut up when I don’t know what I’m talking about, which is good as well. So, it’s not a case of just, whatever a person of colour says, they go: ‘Yeah, we want to do it’. If they can’t do it or it doesn’t make any sense, they said: ‘We can’t do that’ or: ‘We can talk about this idea’. I think that’s the conversation that everybody needs to have</p>
