  <p><b>[Hearing fans say ‘Zlatan Ibrahimovic is s<strong>t’ has helped Watford forward Troy Deeney to turn a deaf ear to critics prone to snap judgements]&lt;/b&gt; To be perfectly honest, most fans see a different game to players. I am not being rude when I say that. Most fans will sit there and say he should be doing this or that, but they can’t do it and that is why they are fans. If I go to a pub and sit down with a fan and he says ‘Ibrahimovic is s</strong>t’ I will say ‘What are you on about? Look at the ball played into him’. When they see it from a player’s perspective they realise, but they are just looking at it as fans and it is all emotion based. You can’t take it too seriously..<br /><br /><b>[Deeney has also taken to avoiding social media in an effort to skip being dragged into debates which do not concern him]</b> I’m from the generation before that. I remember a life before social media. I remember phone boxes, that’s what I grew up on. None of my friends are big posters - we’re old school. We text, phone and meet up and have a beer or have a curry. I started posting the other day when I was watching them playing their five-a-side. It’s just normal. I’m 29 and still a kid in the real world. I just got a lot of expectations and pressure on me, but it is what it is. I’ve got the best job in the world, I work two or three hours a day and get paid handsomely for it.</b></p>

  <p><b>[Watford’s Troy Deeney was disappointed to see Danny Welbeck picked ahead of him for England]</b> I respected his decision. I can’t say I was overjoyed not to be in it, I’m one of those that believe you have to earn it, I don’t think four games is anywhere near enough to say I should be in the England team. I think his response was interesting, that he’s good enough for Watford but not for us, that message comes across that anyone who plays for a lesser team that doesn’t play a certain style of football isn’t going to be good enough for England. If you look at a Danny Ings, Glenn Murray, Callum Wilson, we would probably all be arguing ‘well, what do I need to be in the team?’ Because no offence to Danny Welbeck, I’ve got a lot of time for Danny Welbeck, but he’s not playing but he’s still being picked, so is it a case that’s just the team?<br /><br />I got up on my 30th birthday and went to the bathroom and looked into the mirror and thought ‘ooft, is this what it has come to? It was the first time I’d looked at my body and I wasn’t happy with what I was seeing. ‘This season I’ve been written off and people have called me fat so I’ve thought I’ll show you. I just need to be motivated and stimulated mentally. I know I can do anything if I put my mind to it<br /><br />Everyone’s got issues. There’s a stigma in football that you earn a certain amount of money, how dare you have issues. It’s perceived that money can take care of anything but in my experience it makes everything 15 times harder because you can’t act ‘normal’ and you’re not allowed to be vulnerable or weak but we all are. It’s gone from grieving, where I lost my dad and my grandad within 18 months, trying to learn how to grieve, how to let people back in, obviously, when I went to jail I closed up really quickly. I always break it down I am three different people. I’m Troy Deeney the footballer, I’m daddy who the kids get to see and I’m Troy which a few of my mates get to see. I’m genuinely a big softie, I put this front on, and I’m just a laid-back fool really. I’ve got a psychologist now, I still see him twice a week, it’s gone from lifestyle to sports management, how to get me into that zone</p>

  <p><b>[Watford forward Troy Deeney has confessed that he cannot stand the sight of Liverpool enforcer Virgil van Dijk]</b> I’ve said it many times, I hate him. I hate going up against him. He’s too big, too strong, too quick, too good on the ball, loves fighting, a good head of hair. One of those guys that sprays on his top as well, so it smells lovely! When he runs past you, it’s like ‘I can’t catch you, but…‘<br /><br /><b>[On Joe Gomez]</b> I’ve said for a very long time that I’ve got a massive respect for Joe Gomez. He could be England’s centre-half for the next 15 years. He is a beast of a player. And going next to someone like Van Dijk, he is only going to get better</p>

  <p><b>[Watford captain Troy Deeney was disgruntled by Raul Jimenez’s celebration of Wolves’ second goal in their FA Cup semi-final]</b> I genuinely didn’t see that until just now. There’s a bit of me that wants to say something nasty, but I won’t. But I’m glad he put that mask on, he can wear it out as well now that he’s a loser. Enjoy the mask, but we got the victory. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a top, top player. I was him and I think he’s very good, he plays the nine position on his own really well. I didn’t see the mask thing, so I’m kind of glad I’ve only seen it now because I probably would have lost my head if I saw that. I think you’ve got to wear the mask and do all that stuff when you know you’re going to win the game.<br /><br />The hard work, the desire, you’ve seen it there. At 2-0 down many teams would have called it a day but we kept going, we brought the little man on <b>[Deulofeu]</b>, had a little bit of magic, and the rest is just hard work. We’ve got room to grow. We’re a team that doesn’t have a ceiling on it just yet. We’re not seventh <b>[in the Premier League]</b>, we’re not in the top 10 regularly so there’s still loads to do. Personally, it’s just a case of, with these young boys coming up who are keeping me on my toes, making sure I try to get this new deal. If anyone’s watching, I’d like a new deal thank you!</p>

  <p><b>[Troy Deeney insists that he does not regret his comments that Arsenal lacked cojones]</b> I just gave an honest opinion and if a few people don’t like it, tough. Hindsight’s a wonderful thing, and I might have been better off just saving it for the boozer afterwards, but I don’t ever regret it.<br /><br />People used it as a pretext for saying Arsene Wenger should go as the Arsenal manager - but I never said that, and I’ve got nothing but respect for Mr Wenger. He built the Invincibles, one of the greatest football teams we’ve ever seen in this country.<br /><br />If I’m out in London now, I get Arsenal fans coming up to me and saying, ‘That cojones comment was out of order, but fair play for saying what you think’. Others will tap me on the shoulder and say, ‘Good on you, Troy, I’ve been saying that for years’. I was the first one to come out and say it, and one or two people piled into me. But when they lost at Brighton , Swansea, Bournemouth and others, it was safe for experts to come out and say, ‘They have the quality but they lack the fight’. It gave others a licence to repeat it</p>

  <p><b>[Premier League players boycott social media]</b> My team-mates and I have been on the receiving end of well-documented abuse from a minority of narrow-minded, ignorant people both on social media and on the pitch. Any racism in football is too much, and it’s essential that we fight it wherever and whenever we see it. On Friday we are sending a message to anyone that abuses players - or anyone else - whether from the crowd or online, that we won’t tolerate it within football. The boycott is just one small step, but the players are speaking out with one voice against racism - enough is enough</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>’s Troy Deeney has called on Twitter to support every player who is the subject of racial abuse on the social media platform, rather than just football’s biggest stars]</b> It takes that to shed the light on it but that’s the frustration. Why does it have to be the big guys? It could be anyone, unless you play for the big clubs, unless you’re high profile that’s when they take it seriously. I didn’t see the statement, but when I hear things like ‘trying’, interesting they’re ‘trying’. It’s not difficult to do and to identify what is and what isn’t. Let’s see, I’m not optimistic but let’s see. The big boys are involved now like your Man Uniteds and things like that so that then makes them a bit more proactive, so let’s see. Any help is a good help, but I’m at that point now where it’s been going on for so long that why would now be any different? I <b>[turned Twitter notifications off]</b> at one point but I turned it back on, I’m not letting them win<br /><br /><b>[Deeney added that at one point racist abuse became so prevalent that he had to stop himself using social media]</b> I just had to do it because I would have said something stupid. It’s more of a personal barrier to stop myself and also I think there’s a huge responsibility too. I’ve got kids that follow me, I’ve got my own kids, my little brothers on social media. So how can I not do something and go ‘this is acceptable’ - if they do it to somebody else then I’m part of the problem as well. It’s just frustrating. I know no one is brave enough to say it to my face, so you’ve got to take it for what it is. I’m from the era before the internet, so I know what’s real and what’s not so you’ve just got to learn to roll with the punches</p>

If you’re a manager you want someone who can close down the whole back four on his own, link play, come short - he scores goals and he gets assists. For me, he’s the best around at the moment. You have to look at the two boys he’s got either side of him <b>[Mane &amp; <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>]</b>, 20-plus goals each last season? He didn’t have a bad season at any point but when you have those two overshadowing all the time you kind of take away his importance. But I think when he’s not in the team you definitely see it.

  <p><b>[Deeney: Simple questions not answered over <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> player safety on coronavirus return]</b> I think the concern is very much that Phases Two <b>[when players start contact training]</b> and Three have not been clearly laid out. There has been a lot of what I would class as simple questions that have not been answered. For example, you can talk about the BAME situation. Government guidelines are saying it is four times more likely for people of colour to get the illness and twice as likely to have lasting illnesses, but there is no extra screening and no additional checks being done on any players because it costs too much money. Simple things like that are where people are asking questions and it’s not being answered. When people can’t answer the questions, you start to panic and start to worry. I saw <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> say his dad has asthma and he lives with him so he has concerns. It’s not just players at the bottom who are trying to stay in the league. There are concerns right across the board. I have had a lot of texts from players who are worried about coming out and speaking.<br /><br />We see a lot about care workers and key workers not getting tested and people dying in nursing homes and things of that nature, yet we are expected to have just short of 3,500 tests per month as football players, and PPE for all the staff. How long will it be until that’s the players’ fault? ‘Look at these prima donna footballers that are getting all this preferential treatment when there’s people dying on the street’. That was posed by one of my colleagues. As of five, six weeks ago the NHS was in dire straits and it was put on footballers to make donations, which was already going to happen. But when politicians are calling us out, there is an underlying message that no matter what we do we are painted to be the bad guys</p>

I feel sorry for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> because no matter how it plays out, they deserve to win the league. They deserve to get the trophy. But no matter how it plays out, even if we play all the games, it’s still going to be the year spoiled by the pandemic.

So I do feel sorry for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and their players and Jordan <b>[Henderson]</b>, but in terms of integrity, there’s no way you could say that this is a viable competition. It’s like running a marathon, 20 odd miles, stopping for two months and then sprinting the last bit and going: ‘Ah, that was a good time that.’<br /><br />Personally, I just think this is showing me that the players have so much power if they actually all came together. That’s what this is showing me. I’ve had a lot of messages of support from people that I wouldn’t normally – well, that I didn’t even know had my number for a start.

They’re there, they are 100 per cent there. I think people that are gay or from that community definitely are very worried about having to shoulder the responsibility of being the first. I think once the first comes out, there would be loads. If they came out and said it, I genuinely believe you would get, in the first week, at least 100 people that went ‘me too’. Just because they don’t want to be the face of it. I think there is now a bigger platform than ever to be a gay athlete of any nature.
