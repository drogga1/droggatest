  <p><b>[Football fans outside of Turkey were largely unaware that Ryan Babel was in Istanbul]</b> I tried to go to places I’d enjoy playing. I think <b>[he]</b> didn’t want to play here.<br /><br />When I arrived <b>[in England]</b>, no one helped me. I was all alone.<br /><br /><b>[A brilliant Tarik Elyounoussi volley pulled one back for the visitors, however, before Aboubakar saw red five minutes before the break. A Greek onslaught ensued]</b> I think everyone, including myself, was worried. So much so, that the stadium announcer took to the mi-crophone to call on the crowd’s support. We have beaten PSG, Barcelona and Liverpool here. The fans roared, the players gasped desperately for a second wind. We had to work so hard to fill the gaps left by the missing player. One of those gapes was filled by a man who himself had so frequently been described as ‘missing’.</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham announced on Tuesday that the club has signed Ryan Babel from Besiktas]</b> My first impressions are good and I’m very excited. I definitely have faith that Fulham can stay up. That’s one of the reasons that I’m here, to try and help that to happen. I’m ready to go, I’m excited and I can’t wait.</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham attacker Ryan Babel has claimed Virgil van Dijk does have a weakness in his game]</b> Virgil has definitely developed over the past few years. I think he can get better by 30 per cent. I still feel he plays on 70 per cent. He can do much more. He can be fast if he wants. He does have a weakness. I don’t want to say what it is. I don’t think in the Premier League anyone has made that aware yet.<br /><br />I do have a weakness for Liverpool and I do want them to be champions. I left Liverpool through the back door. It’s a prestige thing to prove people wrong. I was loved in Liverpool, I had good relationship with the fans and my team-mates but I felt I could do better. At the same time I was 21, 22, 23 - not every player has maturity and I needed the guidance I had at Ajax. What can you do if you’re not playing, what can you do differently?</p>

I don’t have to make a secret of that. But there are also discussions with other clubs. It wouldn’t be the first time in football or my own career for things to go differently than expected, so I will just have to wait and see.</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Babel claims <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> is capable of becoming the first defender since <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Fabio Cannavaro</a> to win the Ballon d’Or]</b> The last time I remember a defender winning the Ballon d’Or, it was <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a> in 2006. So it’s not impossible. I think it is fair that he would at least be on the shortlist. We will see in the end if he wins it or not. I would be very happy for him <b>[if he does]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Babel was one of three visiting players booked after catching Allan Nyom with a stray arm]</b> I don’t know if I would do it again. I found that the referee was fooled by the opponent at crucial moments. I was done with that. I thought the opponent was exaggerating a lot, so I got a yellow card. At times, we played nicely, but it wasn’t good enough. We have a lot to analyse. Hopefully we can make it up to the fans</p>
