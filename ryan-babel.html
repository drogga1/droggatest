  <p><b>[Babel was one of three visiting players booked after catching Allan Nyom with a stray arm]</b> I don’t know if I would do it again. I found that the referee was fooled by the opponent at crucial moments. I was done with that. I thought the opponent was exaggerating a lot, so I got a yellow card. At times, we played nicely, but it wasn’t good enough. We have a lot to analyse. Hopefully we can make it up to the fans</p>

You can tell when he has the confidence, he’s really unbeatable and very hard to play against.<br /><br />He’s very complete - he can score goals, he can tackle, can defend, recover balls<br /><br /><b>[This is also evident at Melwood, where the players voted him one of the five ‘captains’ of the squad]</b> Gini’s development is also incredible. <b>[He]</b> is definitely a person who is not shy to give his opinion. He has very strong opinions and is very much loved in the team process. Especially in the national team, he’s definitely one of the leaders and very important for us.<br /><br /><b>[Any doubts about Van Dijk’s suitability to the team or his ability to justify a massive transfer fee were quickly dismissed after moving to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, and he has only gone from strength to strength since then]</b> If you see how he developed since coming to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, his focus is incredible - 90 minutes fully sharp.<br /><br />Now with the leader that he’s become, he definitely deserves it.
