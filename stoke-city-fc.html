  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> friendly called off at last minute after Stoke boss O’Neill tests positive for coronavirus]</b> Stoke City can confirm that manager <a href="michael-o-neill.html">Michael O’Neill</a> has tested positive for the Covid-19 virus following the latest round of testing on Monday (June 8). O’Neill had tested negative in the previous five rounds of testing. He will now follow the relevant guidance and undergo a period of isolation, whilst continuing to be in regular virtual contact with his coaching staff and players. Assistant manager Billy McKinlay will take charge of training as the Potters prepare for their game against Reading on June 20. The Club will be making no further comment on this matter<br /><br />Everyone knows that we will have to be at our best, have to be focused against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. We know it’s a big game for everyone. We had <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> when we started the league this season so I’m confident that our players can go into the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> game with that mentality of going there to play a very good game of football. Training has been about recapping what we did well, tweaking maybe one or two things and looking at some new ideas, but hopefully we can see a lot of what we saw towards the end before the lockdown</p>
