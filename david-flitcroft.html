  <p><b>[David Flitcroft, Bury manager]</b> It was as if it was in slow motion. As soon as it hit the grass I thought, ‘That’s gonna turn and go in that’. When it did, first thing <b>[Dickov]</b> said was, ‘We’ve gotta let you score’. It was an incredible gesture</p>

  <p><b>[Bury manager David Flitcroft on former Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Paddy Kenny voluntarily cancelling his short-term contract 13 days into his new role after he tore his calf in training because he wanted to save the club money]</b> Paddy only had a seven week contract, we weren’t expecting it, but Paddy came to see us and said that he loves the club, he loves the fact we gave him an opportunity, but he doesn’t feel like he is going to earn his money now he is injured. Quite incredibly he has decided he wants to cancel the contract. Incredibly he had guaranteed money there, but he has said he can’t take money off the football club, which is quite a unique circumstance</p>

  <p><b>[Bury manager David Flitcroft on Callum Styles, who became the first player born in the 21st century to play for the first team in the Football League]</b> Callum came off after the game and the first thing he said to me was, ‘Wow, that was fast.’ These kids do not realise when they come from the youth team and the pace that we play at</p>
