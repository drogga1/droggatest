<blockquote>
  <p>[Bayer Leverkusen winger Leon Bailey may be lining out on British soil in the coming months] I am a Jamaican and Leon is born a Jamaican. We love our country. We want what’s best for the country, as long as it doesn’t affect Leon or Kyle or their careers. The main issue is and always will be whether we have a proper football culture to allow players to work in a uniform and systematic way.<br /><br />The English FA has reached out to us; spoken to them by phone; the offer is for both players and with things that come along with playing for England: endorsement contracts, salaries and things like that we’ve been discussing and we will further discuss later this week when we meet. It is something that you cannot not consider; you have to look at the options<br /><br />The reality, for me, is that Jamaica has the chance to get the players and to establish a national football culture and if they allow us to help with that then we would prefer to play for Jamaica<br /><br />…given Jamaica 10 days to come up with a solution or we will make alternative choices. England have made contact with us in the last few weeks and there will be more discussions in the future. England is not the only option - we have Malta and Belgium<br /><br />If you end up with 17 Jamaicans playing for different nations all from my Phoenix All Stars academy then what will that do the future of Jamaican football? It should force them to change how they view people instead of making it about personalities not football ability.</p>

  <p>[Leon Bailey is not ready to fully commit his international future to one country] It’s not that he didn’t make it. I didn’t supply them with the info they requested yet because we are not sure we are ready to commit to a national team yet.<br /><br />I have offered to show the JFF what I have learned from Belgium, Holland, Germany and even Slovakia on how to build a national program and fix the Jamaican football culture, but the JFF has refused to listen. Therefore, at this time, the boys will focus on their club careers</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Leon Bailey’s agent Craig Butler has played down transfer rumours linking the Bayer Leverkusen winger to Roma] Roma were interested in Leon a couple of years ago, but since then I haven’t heard from the Giallorossi, I spoke with Massara then. I do not know Monchi, maybe he does not have my number. Being linked to a great club like Roma is an honour if it were true. I don’t know if Roma are speaking to some intermediary, but they’d have to talk to me. It wouldn’t be wise not to listen to Roma, but always respecting our agreement with Bayer Leverkusen, a club that has my respect</p>
