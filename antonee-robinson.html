  <p><b>[Antonee Robinson’s season on loan at Bolton ended with the Wanderers avoiding relegation from the English Championship]</b> Next season will be the biggest of my life, whatever happens. Whether I break through at Everton or go on loan again to get more experience before my time comes. But I do believe if I work hard enough there is a chance for me to get in the first team at Everton. However they want me to do that, I am willing to give it my all.<br /><br />I did well and feel like I have developed as a player and established a minimum level I can play at. I would definitely say I am a much better player than I was at the start of the season. I have all that experience under my belt and have learned a lot more about the game. Now I want to improve and kick on</p>

  <p><b>[Antonee Robinson sat on a plane heading to the United States three years ago]</b> My dad was the first one who said, ‘you’ll have to learn it. It was one of the first things he said. When I got called up he said, ‘you’ll need to learn the national anthem’.<br /><br /><b>[The USMNT program came calling in March, around the same time that England’s Under-21 team reached out to him to attend a camp]</b> It just wasn’t even a decision. I was just like, ‘it’s clear to me which country showed more faith in me.’ Not only picking me at the youth level, but picking me for the first team, so I had to show that commitment right back<br /><br />When I found out I was starting the game it was pretty surreal. I remember at the start of camp I was quite nervous. I wasn’t performing as well as I wanted to be in training. Then the manager called in players into individual meetings and they called me in and they told me, ‘look, we’ve seen you’re quite nervous but you’re starting this game. We want you to be confident. You’re here for a reason so seize it’.<br /><br />It was like a movie. It was like being stood in the tunnel of a FIFA game and looking at every single star about to come out. It was surreal<br /><br /><b>[a successful loan stint at Bolton last season was enough to convince the Toffees to sign him to a new deal as a potential future long-term replacement for Leighton Baines]</b> It just showed to me that they give me a lot of faith with a three-year deal. They clearly have it in their mind that I should be starting or at least competing to be their left back. When a team shows you that sort of faith that’s a team you want to stay with<br /><br />As long as I keep consistently getting better, not only for my club but for the U.S. as well, I’ll be in a good position. If I can keep showing that I can play well and keep developing areas of my game, who knows, then next year that could be the next step for me. Fortunately I’ve gone to a club that plays really good football. They’ve just come up and they’re really ambitious so we’ve gotten off to a great start at the minute<br /><br />Every time I step onto the field for the U.S. it means something to me. I’m representing what I say is my country now. The fans have been really great towards me. I can understand where they come from in terms of some players wanting to choose which country they want to play for<br /><br /><b>[And what will he do when the national anthems play that day? Robinson definitely won’t be singing ‘God Save the Queen’]</b> No chance. I’ll watch respectfully, but I won’t sing it</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil teaches USMNT youngsters a lesson in mismatch]</b> After that first run I knew I had to be a bit more careful against <b>[Costa]</b>. Unfortunately a goal came from it. Sometimes you get lucky and that doesn’t happen and you switch your game up quickly. I’ve got to be a bit more careful and in the second half I thought I did that.</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney’s England recall]</b> I wouldn’t say it cheapens the fixture at all. Every player’s mindset will be the same, we all want to win. Rooney’s a legend, he’s achieved so much in his career, so it’s only fitting. On merit, you could say he’s had such a good season in MLS that he might have got a call up anyway, if he wasn’t retired</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> move for Antonee Robinson falls through on deadline day]</b> Wigan Athletic defender Antonee Robinson will remain at the DW Stadium after his move to <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> could not be completed. Robinson, 22, travelled to Milan this morning after the two clubs agreed a fee for the permanent transfer on Thursday evening. The USA international underwent a medical examination with <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>, though further medical tests with the Italian authorities were required, which were subject to a 72-hour deadline. As such, the deal could not be formally ratified before the 8pm Italian Transfer Deadline on Friday</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT defender Antonee Robinson opens up on how heart problem led to failed Milan move]</b> During my medical for a potential transfer to Milan on deadline day, an irregularity was picked up in my heart rhythm. Further testing was required to ensure the move could be finalised and ratified, though there was not enough time to complete this before the transfer deadline<br /><br />Following consultation with the club’s medical staff and independent specialists, it has been decided I will need a medical procedure later this month to address the irregularity in my heart rhythm - a procedure called an ablation</p>

  <p><b>[Wigan defender Antonee Robinson, whose January move to <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> collapsed because of a heart rhythm irregularity picked up during his medical, has now returned to training]</b> I would like to thank everyone who has supported me over the last few months, with a special thanks to club doctor Jonathan Tobin, the club’s medical staff and all of the team involved at the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Heart and Chest Hospital. I can’t wait to get back to doing what I love. It has been a challenging time but I have good people around me. I am glad to be able to get back to training with the lads and to have the opportunity to play for Wigan Athletic again</p>
