  <p><b>[Antonee Robinson’s season on loan at Bolton ended with the Wanderers avoiding relegation from the English Championship]</b> Next season will be the biggest of my life, whatever happens. Whether I break through at Everton or go on loan again to get more experience before my time comes. But I do believe if I work hard enough there is a chance for me to get in the first team at Everton. However they want me to do that, I am willing to give it my all.<br /><br />I did well and feel like I have developed as a player and established a minimum level I can play at. I would definitely say I am a much better player than I was at the start of the season. I have all that experience under my belt and have learned a lot more about the game. Now I want to improve and kick on</p>

  <p><b>[Wayne Rooney’s England recall]</b> I wouldn’t say it cheapens the fixture at all. Every player’s mindset will be the same, we all want to win. Rooney’s a legend, he’s achieved so much in his career, so it’s only fitting. On merit, you could say he’s had such a good season in MLS that he might have got a call up anyway, if he wasn’t retired</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> move for Antonee Robinson falls through on deadline day]</b> Wigan Athletic defender Antonee Robinson will remain at the DW Stadium after his move to <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> could not be completed. Robinson, 22, travelled to Milan this morning after the two clubs agreed a fee for the permanent transfer on Thursday evening. The USA international underwent a medical examination with <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>, though further medical tests with the Italian authorities were required, which were subject to a 72-hour deadline. As such, the deal could not be formally ratified before the 8pm Italian Transfer Deadline on Friday</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT defender Antonee Robinson opens up on how heart problem led to failed Milan move]</b> During my medical for a potential transfer to Milan on deadline day, an irregularity was picked up in my heart rhythm. Further testing was required to ensure the move could be finalised and ratified, though there was not enough time to complete this before the transfer deadline<br /><br />Following consultation with the club’s medical staff and independent specialists, it has been decided I will need a medical procedure later this month to address the irregularity in my heart rhythm - a procedure called an ablation</p>

  <p><b>[Wigan defender Antonee Robinson, whose January move to <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> collapsed because of a heart rhythm irregularity picked up during his medical, has now returned to training]</b> I would like to thank everyone who has supported me over the last few months, with a special thanks to club doctor Jonathan Tobin, the club’s medical staff and all of the team involved at the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Heart and Chest Hospital. I can’t wait to get back to doing what I love. It has been a challenging time but I have good people around me. I am glad to be able to get back to training with the lads and to have the opportunity to play for Wigan Athletic again</p>
