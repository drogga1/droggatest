<blockquote>
  <p>[Lionel Messi is considered to be a life form from another planet] I’ve never seen anyone from another planet, but it must be similar to him [Messi]. What you see on TV is what he does in training, you cannot get near him. His legs are so powerful, when he controls the ball, it’s like he has glue on his boot and he makes it look so easy, which makes you think you can do it too, but you try and you can’t, he is just something else. The best I have ever seen.<br /><br />Iniesta and Xavi were also like they were from a different planet. Iniesta looked like he was floating with the ball, he would dribble past everyone like this. Xavi was able to control the ball with his head up and never lose control of it, it was unbelievable. I’ve always been so lucky to train with the best players in the world, but Messi is at another level</p>
