  <p><b>[USWNT players thankful as nutrition bar company helps level wage gap]</b> It’s so cool what they’re doing for us and this team and just the statement they’re making for women and equality is absolutely amazing. We’re so thankful for them just making that statement. I’m at a loss for words</p>

  <p><b>[World Cup can be a tipping point for the women’s game]</b> The viewers, the knowledge about French soccer, especially the women is incredibly different now. The fact that it’s getting more and more popular is Europe is amazing, especially because it’s such a soccer culture in Europe.</p>

  <p><b>[Ellis is right to trust her team’s bench players, particularly her attackers, after two of her three subs found the back of the net against Thailand]</b> I think what’s so special about this team is the depth. I think any player that comes off the bench is bringing something new and different and amazing to our team and I think you saw that the other night.</p>

  <p><b>[The league has only has one sponsor committed beyond the current season, Nike. It has recently lost multiple key front-office employees, saw two teams fold prior to the 2018 season. It had been playing the 2019 season without a national television deal]</b> I was pretty annoyed that we didn’t have a deal at the beginning of the year. It almost felt like we were going backwards<br /><br />We have nine teams now and I hope we have expansion in the next year or so. I think that will help so much</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ask the U.S. players about how they’ve managed to start so strong]</b> It’s the mentality of the team, always coming out and wanting a goal early on<br /><br /><b>[Early goals have a dual effect on the game, giving a lift to the team that scores while also presenting early obstacles, both mental and scoreline-related, for the team that concedes]</b> It does help settle us into the game and it has helped us in these last few games. Some opponents have done well, England got a goal right after us but I think it does disrupt them. I’m happy we’ve done that and hopefully we can do that in the final</p>

  <p><b>[Confident, not arrogant: USWNT not taking upstart Dutch lightly in World Cup final]</b> They’re one of the top teams in the world and they’re playing in a World Cup final. I think it’s going to be a great game</p>
