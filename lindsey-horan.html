  <p>[The league has only has one sponsor committed beyond the current season, Nike. It has recently lost multiple key front-office employees, saw two teams fold prior to the 2018 season. It had been playing the 2019 season without a national television deal] I was pretty annoyed that we didn’t have a deal at the beginning of the year. It almost felt like we were going backwards<br /><br />We have nine teams now and I hope we have expansion in the next year or so. I think that will help so much</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Ask the U.S. players about how they’ve managed to start so strong] It’s the mentality of the team, always coming out and wanting a goal early on<br /><br />[Early goals have a dual effect on the game, giving a lift to the team that scores while also presenting early obstacles, both mental and scoreline-related, for the team that concedes] It does help settle us into the game and it has helped us in these last few games. Some opponents have done well, England got a goal right after us but I think it does disrupt them. I’m happy we’ve done that and hopefully we can do that in the final</p>

  <p>[Confident, not arrogant: USWNT not taking upstart Dutch lightly in World Cup final] They’re one of the top teams in the world and they’re playing in a World Cup final. I think it’s going to be a great game</p>
