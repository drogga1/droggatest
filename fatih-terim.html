  <p><b>[Fatih Terim on discovering he’d been dismissed as <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> coach]</b> I went to my room shortly after training and learned I’d been sacked through the media! I’ve never seen anything like this in my life</p>

  <p><b>[Fatih Terim has promised that Turkey will play without fear at Euro 2016 after being drawn against Spain, Croatia and Czech Republic]</b> We will not have fear from anyone and try to enjoy our football on the pitch. There’s no need to talk about Spain. The team is full of stars.<br /><br />Czech Republic coach Pavel Vrba had told me ‘see you in Paris’ when we last met. We met and we will meet again. He reminded me this just a few minutes ago. Everybody knows about the Czechs. Croatia are our opponents in our 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign too and the first test will be there. I am fully confident of my players. I believe we can do very interesting work there. We can introduce new starlets</p>

  <p><b>[Fatih Terim, the Turkey coach, has had Emre Mor in his sights]</b> After watching his videos I said he is not an ordinary player, he is an extraordinary player. I think that we made a good decision by calling him up. I insist on saying that he has to learn many things and physically he has to improve. He has the capability of becoming a special footballer. He made the decision to move to Borussia Dortmund and I think he made a good choice</p>

  <p><b>[Arda Turan’s static showing was in stark contrast to that of Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric, whose wonderful volley claimed all three points for Croatia]</b> Some players need to make more effort. I expected better from them.</p>

  <p><b>[Defeats to Croatia and Spain in their first two Group D matches have left Fatih Terim’s side on the brink]</b> I believe in my players. This is the last step, the last leg. It will be either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. We will either say ‘enough’ or ‘keep going.</p>
