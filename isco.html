  <p><b>[Why Isco is starring for Spain but struggling at Real Madrid]</b> When you don’t have that continuity with your club, games with the national team give me life. Here, the coach has confidence in me… maybe I haven’t earned that at Madrid. Julen shows his confidence in me with minutes. At Madrid I don’t have the confidence that a footballer needs. Maybe I’m the problem. I haven’t been able to earn it. I have to keep working to earn Zidane’s trust</p>

  <p><b>[Isco has claimed that he is not going to speak to Cristiano Ronaldo again after seeing him net a hat-trick for Portugal against Spain at World Cup 2018]</b> Don’t talk to me about Cristiano! I’m not going to speak to him again after what he did the other day. He doesn’t have a high strike rate <b>[from free-kicks]</b>, but when he has his day … his first two goals gave him confidence and got him looking for his hat trick.<br /><br />It’s true that it was a complicated situation for us to be in, but the hope and belief the squad has is way beyond any setback. I think we showed great maturity to deal with what happened and we realise that the most important thing of all is that we are here at the tournament. It’s a nice challenge for us to confront and we have to give everything we’ve got to put any issues behind us; we have to pull together and take this forward, like we did against Portugal<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether he could be a contender to claim the Golden Ball in Russia]</b> We’re still at the start and it’s not something I have in mind. The team comes first. If the team does well and we go far then it’s easier to be considered for those kinds of individual awards</p>

  <p><b>[Isco insists that Real Madrid are refusing to lament Cristiano Ronaldo’s sale to Juventus]</b> We can’t be crying for someone who didn’t want to be here. The press do not have the power to get rid of a Madrid coach. We believe fully in what this team can achieve, and the coach has full confidence of the players. After that, many things can happen, but I am convinced we can have a very good season. I think it would be crazy, you have to let him work. He has only been here for two months. If you get rid of the coach, you have to get rid of all of us. It is us that haven’t been scoring goals or playing well. It belongs to all of us, not just the coach.</p>
