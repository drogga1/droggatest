  <p><b>[Former Reds’ skipper Phil Thompson backed the call for the Americans to sell]</b> We’re just in nothingness at the moment, which is a large part of what’s happened since the two Americans have been in charge. We just want some direction. We hear in the press that they (Hicks and Gillett) want between £600m and £800m and then they’re saying it could take two years to happen. My goodness, that gets your heart when you’re reading those things. We want it and we want it like it was yesterday just to move on for a change of ownership. The ownership has to happen to give us some direction, to show something. We’ve had all the promises broken and broken and broken. <br /><br />We’re in the depths now, we need a little bit of help and if these people have got any sense of pride in what they do as businessmen and what they see happening to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club then please, <b>[let’s have]</b> a little bit of sanity to move this club forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Thompson says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s rivals are looking for <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s side to choke, fail and collapse]</b> I think this team has not only lived with the pressure but the expectancy of what 30 years without winning a title brings. I think nearly every <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan does not believe they will win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. They all know there is such a long way to go, so there is still an awful lot to be done. It is everybody else who is saying it is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s league. On the flip side, they are hoping that they will choke, fail and collapse, as it will be good to mock Liverpool<br /><br />Everybody will say that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> should win the title. I still say there is nothing guaranteed. It was a seven-point lead last year but everybody seems to have forgotten that! You have this great <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> side chasing them but you also have to point to the young <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> side and the emergence of Brendan Rodgers’ <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> team. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have won 11 and drawn one of their opening 12 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> matches, which is amazing, but you would have expected them to be even more points ahead. With the quality of those three teams, you cannot rest on your laurels. A defeat and a couple of draws and that soon gets clawed back. The only good thing is that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have played all of the big six and <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> but, before the turnaround of games, City have to play <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, and come out unscathed. When we get to Christmas, we will know a little bit more<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need to be focused. As a lot of the games have gone down to the wire this year, they cannot keep getting away with it, in the shape of late goals, some VAR decisions going in their favour, as well as injuries going for them. We have to keep injury-free, keep more focused in games, and start quicker, as we did against City. It is that little bit of luck, at times, the little bit of VAR going in your favour, that could equally go against you. Red cards will be massive too - you only need a red card and then your backs are against the wall, especially against the big boys. But the biggest one of all is injures. It has decimated City’s defence, and if they had everybody fit, they could have been a lot closer to Liverpool</p>

We were by far the best team in Europe<br /><br />We only knew one thing about Flamengo: <a href="zico.html">Zico</a>. He had great technique and was brilliant at free-kicks.

Hand on heart, I think there will be a hiccup somewhere along the way. Hopefully, it’s not too many games. But it’s hard to see. The Invincibles was quite an astonishing season for them, but they drew a lot more games than what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are at this moment in time<br /><br /><b>[When asked if victory over <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> on Saturday will have <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> believing that they are champions]</b> No we won’t, because <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> are still there as well. There are still 17 games to go after the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> game and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have to just keep chalking them off, making sure they keep going through this unbeaten.

  <p><b>[Phil Thompson says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> loves nothing better than to upset Liverpool]</b> Jose loves nothing better than to upset <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans. This will be another opportunity for him. I think it’s one of those big things that deep down, he would really have loved to have managed <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, so when it comes down to it he wants to beat us, and do his utmost to put one over on us.<br /><br />That’ll give him another opportunity this weekend. What will he do? How will he set up? Has he got the players to defend deep? Has he got the players to attack? This is a <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> side who are expected to win games playing a certain way, but sometimes Jose would rather sit back and hit on the counter-attack, and have a low block<br /><br />Greatness comes from doing this on a regular basis. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s broken that duck and it just happened to be against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, who they play this weekend. You look at what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> did last season, getting 97 points and not even winning the title, we didn’t do anything like that to win the league. But if this team are going to be one of the greats, and bring it back after 30 years of hurt, it’ll be a most wonderful thing - but then they need to keep on doing it.<br /><br />Everyone always says ‘back in the heyday’, but no, we didn’t do that. This team is quite extraordinary. The clean sheets they’re keeping, the goals they’re scoring, everything. There’s so many good things about this team and they just have to keep the focus now.

  <p><b>[How <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> missed out on <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> to <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> explained]</b> He was being touted around everyone. Tony Henry, the former <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> midfielder, was working for (agent) Paul Stretford, who was tasked by <a href="jorge-mendes.html">Jorge Mendes</a> to drum up interest in England. They were desperate to get <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> out of Sporting and invited me over for a game. I was told the fee was £4 million but they explained that it could be paid over the course of a four-year contract so essentially it was £1 million per year.<br /><br />I asked what kind of salary he would want and they said it was £1 million per year after tax. That was a lot for an 18-year-old kid but they said that was negotiable. It was a Sunday and I explained to them that I needed to go back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and speak to <a href="gerard-houllier.html">Gerard Houllier</a> and see what we could do. I fed all the information back to Gerard, who said he would speak to <b>[chief executive]</b> <a href="rick-parry.html">Rick Parry</a>.<br /><br />Lo and behold, the following week I’m at Melwood when the yellow ticker on Sky Sports News says, ‘Manchester United sign <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> from Sporting for £12.2 million.’ I couldn’t believe my eyes. How had the fee gone up from £4 million to £12.2 million in a few days? Gerard asked me to phone Tony to find out what had gone on. Tony told me that when he’d got off the plane on the Monday he had got a call to say he was off the deal. It was down to Stretford and Mendes instead. It was astonishing that the fee trebled. He was clearly a big talent but no one could have predicted back then how great he was going to be<br /><br /><b>[Thompson has also revealed that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were considering a move for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> stalwart <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> before the arrival of Roman Abramovich’s billions at Stamford Bridge]</b> <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> were in financial trouble at the time and John hadn’t signed a new contract. Gerard said to me, ‘What do you think?’ I said he would be perfect. John was still only a young lad but he was fantastic. He wasn’t blessed with great pace but he read the game so well and was clearly going to be a top centre-half. After the game Gerard had a quiet word with John and asked if he’d like to play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. The response was positive.<br /><br />Gerard sent <b>[director of scouting]</b> Alex Miller to get his agent’s details and he came back from the players’ lounge with John’s mobile number. Then a few weeks later Roman Abramovich bought <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and suddenly they had all this money.

He has been nothing short of top class so you want him to be available. You could have seen him being on the bench with the Champions League game coming up on Tuesday, but whether we would have been winning or losing, he would have been coming on to gain the relative game time. How fresh he looked will have warmed the heart of every <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan and probably the most of his team-mates too. He had this energy in his legs, which was an added bonus to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> winning the game<br /><br />This <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team is made of different stuff. Everybody thinks it will be all-out attack. There have been plenty of games where <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> and his staff have sussed out a team and set up their shape to engage at just over halfway. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> could go for it and press quite high or they could sit in and draw them in because of their reputation, looking to hit them on the counter.

  <p><b>[Phil Thompson says <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>’s leadership skills are proving to be a big miss for Liverpool]</b> The last two games have shown the importance of <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> to this side. Not only what he brings as a midfield player, but he would have been demanding a lot more from the players on the pitch, talking to them controlling them, and asking more from their performances. He is the leader and has the presence on the pitch so <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are missing him at the minute.<br /><br />I think everybody who watched the game <b>[at Watford]</b> could see <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were not at it, and it was complacency. It is not having a go - it is just saying that all of these top teams go into these games and are a bit blasé about it, especially at this time of year when these clubs at the bottom of the league are fighting for their lives<br /><br />Since the winter break, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have not been great at all. The words on the lips of a lot of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans was that they have been waiting for this to happen. Against <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>, it was not great, but they won. The game against <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> was not good, but they just won again. Maybe a lot of fans felt they got away with it in those games, but then you revert to the fact that this is how teams win the league, winning when you are not playing well.

It would be extremely hard to say <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> aren’t champions<br /><br />I would think so. I think they’re just giving themselves breathing time and it’s very difficult to see it get up and running then. They’ll be having meetings and every day it will change. I’m watching Sky News every day and it’s changing by the hour. Things are changing all the time. Playing behind closed doors is a contentious issue. I believe football is nothing without the fans, it’s a fans game and I like to think it could resume and the fixtures will be completed.

  <p><b>[Phil Thompson says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> &amp; <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> should’ve taken risk &amp; signed Chelsea-bound Werner]</b> I think you should always try and improve. When you’re on the up, when you’re playing well, that is when you should look to back it up. I would have loved to have seen him come but <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have not done that, they’re looking at it and it’s probably costing too much. <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> will be going, ‘Maybe I might not get in there’ and maybe <b>[Jurgen]</b> <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is thinking, ‘We can’t afford to have somebody for that price just sitting on the bench’. He’ll <b>[Werner]</b> be alright for three or four years and I would have taken that risk. If he wanted to come I think you have to improve your team when you’re on top and he would have improved us</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Thompson says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s title-winning exploits have allowed them to silence critics who have ‘taken the Michael’ for 30 years with the former Reds skipper seeing the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> giants firmly ‘back on our perch’]</b> We are back on our perch. It has been a long time coming, I won’t use the expletive that came before it but we are back. It’s been a long, long time. It has been a generation, 30 years, and yes, we have had the Champions League, which has been fantastic. But <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has always been out of the league championship, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and we have not been able to get our hands on it. It has been a burden to everybody. A lot of managers have had to carry it and to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> and the players, congratulations, I thank you so much because it has been hard. They have been an absolute pleasure to watch and I have to congratulate them. I have four boys and I have been desperate to watch them win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title, it has been the Holy Grail and we have done it<br /><br />We’ve been successful with trophies, we have won in the past and it has been wonderful. But as the years have gone by, <a href="gerard-houllier.html">Gerard Houllier</a> came second, Rafa <b>[Benitez]</b> came second, Brendan <b>[Rodgers]</b> came second. There have been some really good teams, but not as good as this one. This team has deserved it - 97 points last year and they didn’t bring it home. There are a lot of people who were giggling and thinking ‘you are not going to get that chance again’. So to go and compete with this <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> team is absolutely wonderful. Those young people who have not had that opportunity and those other fans who have taken the Michael out of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club because we hadn’t won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>…we have done it! If this team stays together, which I think it will, they will be a hell of a team to beat next year</p>
