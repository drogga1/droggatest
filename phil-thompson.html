  <p><b>[Former Reds’ skipper Phil Thompson backed the call for the Americans to sell]</b> We’re just in nothingness at the moment, which is a large part of what’s happened since the two Americans have been in charge. We just want some direction. We hear in the press that they (Hicks and Gillett) want between £600m and £800m and then they’re saying it could take two years to happen. My goodness, that gets your heart when you’re reading those things. We want it and we want it like it was yesterday just to move on for a change of ownership. The ownership has to happen to give us some direction, to show something. We’ve had all the promises broken and broken and broken.<br /><br />We’re in the depths now, we need a little bit of help and if these people have got any sense of pride in what they do as businessmen and what they see happening to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club then please, <b>[let’s have]</b> a little bit of sanity to move this club forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Costa would be a dream loan signing for Liverpool if he leaves Chelsea for Atletico Madrid]</b> Dare I say it: Diego Costa signs for Atletico Madrid and then gets loaned out to Liverpool? It would be quite a dream, wouldn’t it? I’d take him for six months. Going back three or four years when Liverpool were in for Costa, I think we offered £20m.<br /><br />It was £25m and the deal never got done. I was amazed. If we’d have had Suarez and Diego Costa, God, they’d have frightened everybody. You love these players. Every other supporter moans at them but you know as a Chelsea fan how much Costa will fight for you, do the battling for you. Good skills too. Good technique.<br /><br />Is <b>[Alvaro]</b> Morata going to be <b>[as effective]</b> when you get into battles in the Premier League? It didn’t matter whether you were playing against Hull City or Manchester United, you knew what you’d get off Costa</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool have been warned that Roma pose a different kind of threat in Champions League]</b> Roma have got the ability to frustrate Liverpool, whereas Manchester City can’t do that and Bayern Munich or Real wouldn’t do that, so it is a whole different prospect for the team. They’re direct with Edin Dzeko as the target-man and I’d expect them to target the full-backs with diagonal balls whenever they get into the final third. Roma actually played very well in the first-leg against Barcelona and we saw them battle Barca into submission, so we’ve got to be ready for that. We’ll have more possession but it is a different sort of game with their defensive strength. Daniele De Rossi is a great defender and a great organiser in front of their backline. You want to get off to a good start but, even though we’re an attacking outfit, the focus has got be on the defence, to keep the back door shut, as keeping a clean sheet is absolutely crucial because we know what they are capable of back in Rome.<br /><br />We have been a lot stronger since Virgil van Dijk has been in the defence, the ‘keeper has been better and so have Dejan Lovren, while Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson have been really impressive. When Jurgen brought in Joe Gomez and Alberto Moreno it seemed to have unsettled the team, so when West Brom went a bit longer they had some joy, so it was a similar test in terms of bombarding the penalty area rather than trying to pass, pass, pass. However, at 2-0 up they were slightly complacent at the end, whereas West Brom were fighting for their lives, and conceding those sort of goals hasn’t been the norm for some time now. Sometimes you need a kick up the backside and hopefully Saturday will serve as that ahead of dealing with Roma’s direct threat</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool got their timing spot on when appointing Jurgen Klopp]</b> think to be a great Liverpool manager you have to really ‘get’ the club. And what I mean by that is that any modern manager knows the history of Liverpool. But you have to get it, you have to sense it, to really feel it, to smell it. And Klopp does. I did a lovely interview with him for our Saturday programme. I went and chatted with him at our Melwood training ground and I asked him why he came? Did he feel that it was something that was meant to be, him and Liverpool? His first managerial job was at Mainz who he had played for and after it was ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ with Borussia Dortmund, and now he has come to Anfield, a club whose anthem has always been ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. Did he think it was always meant to be? And he said to me that he had the opportunity of going to Manchester United and thought: ‘I don’t think this fits, this doesn’t seem right.’ His wife said to him: ‘Jurgen, if Liverpool Football Club come for you, that is for you,’ and he felt she was totally right. He felt like a manager at the right time, the right fit, for Liverpool.<br /><br />When Liverpool took Jurgen Klopp, <b>[Louis]</b> van Gaal and <b>[Arsene]</b> Wenger were under pressure, so was <b>[Jose]</b> Mourinho at Chelsea. If Liverpool hadn’t moved when they did then any of those clubs would have taken Jurgen Klopp because he was available. And I think the timing of it all seemed to fit into place. He comes in, he understands the people, the people understand him. They see his passion and I think that’s a very, very important element of what it is to be part of Liverpool Football Club</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Maguire fits Liverpool’s philosophy and would be a perfect partner for Virgil van Dijk]</b> I’ve been a big fan of Harry Maguire since his days at Hull City. Since then he’s got better and better. He’s had a fantastic World Cup so far. I was saying long before the tournament started that he has all the attributes needed to be a Liverpool player. He’s big, he’s strong and positionally he’s very good whether as a two or a three at the back. He’s a lot quicker than people give him credit for. He dominates in the air and that’s a major asset both defensively and offensively. He’s also very comfortable on the ball. He’s better than John Stones when it comes to passing it out from the back. Harry has been one of the best defenders in the World Cup and he certainly fits Liverpool’s philosophy. I can’t speak more highly of him.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s signing of Alisson is a big ‘lift’ for the club ahead of the new Premier League season]</b> Liverpool have their business done nice and early, unlike some clubs who have been caught out. For Liverpool, though, I think it has been a fantastic window. What we are really pleased about is the goalkeeping situation. We all thought this had to be nailed down and there has to be a change. And he did it and he spent very, very big. That was fantastic and it gives everyone a lift. So that is a massive area and, if Liverpool go on and win the league title, he will be the signing of the window. We have seen how well David de Gea has done at Man Utd and the points that he saves. That was one area that needed to be sorted. This fella has kept Ederson out of the national side, so he is a good goalkeeper<br /><br />Then there is in midfield where we needed a bit of an aggressor, and Keita brings that. He was sent off four times last year, so a little bit of nastiness helps in the side. Plus he gets goals. And Shaqiri will bring goals from midfield</p>

  <p><b>[Xherdan Shaqiri’s enigmatic talents mean he could flop for Liverpool like Mario Balotelli]</b> He’s a player, as we know, who is maybe not a workaholic at the moment like Klopp would like. But my goodness he’s got an assist, he’s got a goal, set plays. So that’s the great thing Jurgen has done with the transfer market. He has identified the areas which he needs to improve his squad and gone for it. Shaqiri, yeah maybe a few problems about him, but he’s got this in his locker. Set plays, corner kicks, he delivers into dangerous areas.<br /><br />He’s going to a club now which in all intents and purposes is a bigger club than what Stoke is. I think the expectations and the demands on him will be as it should be. At £13m it is a snip and I hope upon hope that this goes right for the boy. It could be a Balotelli move, then again it could be a Mane move and that is the thing. He’s got to learn and that is the only thing, this high-pressure game that Jurgen demands from everybody. Everybody has to fit in and Shaqiri has to bring that to the table.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool must end their trophy drought under Jurgen Klopp]</b> It would be great, I would love to do it and it’s a trophy. Jurgen has to win a trophy this year. For the quality of squad he now has, he has to win a trophy. It gives him a great opportunity and I would gladly take the Carabao Cup, but you have to look where your priorities lie, which is what most managers do and make changes in these early rounds. Dare I say it, a lot of managers over the years, in the big six clubs, have put out weakened teams thinking if they do get knocked out they will take it on the chin and it will give them a better chance in Europe and the Premier League. They obviously don’t want to go out at the early stage, it’s not very nice, but come later in the season they will view it as a godsend</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will be an absolutely brilliant addition]</b> It would be an absolutely brilliant addition and it would be like having a new player. It’s so difficult. As players, you go through these turmoils, and it is a turmoil to you when you have to sit out. It will give the players a buzz to see him coming back and he will be a massive asset if he can get back for the run-in. We’ve got a very good midfield who don’t get as many goals as they should do, but that’s where Oxlade-Chamberlain comes in.<br /><br />He had it at Arsenal, it took a little bit of time to get to know the Jurgen Klopp way, the Liverpool way, but when he did, my goodness. He can dominate that drive from midfield, that powerful shot and the assists that he can bring. These are all assets that will help that midfield three that we’ve seen in the bigger games.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on what could stand in Liverpool’s way]</b> Manchester City. It’s as simple as that. They’re such a good side. They look like they can win every game until the end of the season. I hope that we can win every game and I think that’s the slight difference. Man City get into that mode where they’re wiping the floor with everybody, scoring three or four goals every game, and we have to do the same. That’s it.<br /><br />You’re looking at 15 games and thinking ‘we’ve got to win every one of them’. You’re ticking them down all the time and that’s how you get. It’s that expectation of each fan, but you’ve seen that Liverpool have been able to do that… Man City have been there and done it but for us, it has been a long time</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah will rediscover his best form for Liverpool heading into the end of the 2018-19 campaign]</b> You can see Mane in front of goal whereas Mo is finding it very difficult to find one. Everyone is willing Mo to score goals, but Sadio is so full of energy and confidence and when he gets anywhere near the goal, you do expect him to score. He is on fire but you feel with Mo that, when you need him, he always comes to the party and you feel like you are just getting ready to see him on fire before the end of the season. You do have to have concerns that Mo hasn’t scored for a bit, but you look at the number of times he keeps getting into the positions. With Liverpool, if Mane dries up, Mo will come to the table and so will Firmino.<br /><br /><b>[Thompson expects Spurs to pose the Reds a difficult challenge]</b> I’m expecting a massive game. They have big players and the nucleus of this wonderful England side is based around Tottenham players so Liverpool are going to have to be at their best on Sunday</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona striker warned hostile reception awaits at Anfield]</b> We have to be a little bit streetwise. We have to be ready because I think that is where they had the upper hand. Yes, there were the three goals, but being streetwise, play-acting, conning the referee. Luis Suarez, yes he played for Liverpool, but he made me believe what everyone else thought of Luis Suarez. He went over and above that. I hope Liverpool fans and the Liverpool players give it to him and wind him up something rotten. Some of the attitude he had in the first leg was absolutely outrageous. He’s a Barcelona player now and that’s all he’s thinking about. I have no problem with people celebrating goals and everything, and what Luis Suarez gave for Liverpool was fantastic, but some of the stuff he did made me understand what some of the other fans thought of Luis Suarez when he was at Liverpool. Some of the stuff he went through last week, I think he crossed that line. I know a lot of the supporters out there were outraged by some of the things that he did. So we have to be streetwise. Winding him up sometimes makes him play better, but this is Anfield and I think he will get a bit of a rough reception. I hope that’s from the players as well, that they can wind him up. Yes, he might get a bit angry but we’re 3-0 down and we have to be street savvy out there on that pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Thompson says Liverpool should be exploring the option of resigning Philippe Coutinho]</b> I would take him back in a heartbeat, but it would have to be now. You don’t want to leave it another 12 months, I think he still has the ability. He’s suffered at Barcelona. We’ve seen him playing out wide on the left, but he’s not Neymar. He likes to be in the middle where he can pull strings and is getting on the ball to hurt teams. He doesn’t do that and he’s not a left-winger and that’s where he’s playing at Barcelona; they don’t love him like Liverpool loved him<br /><br />He was that little bit clever, that creativity behind those front three that you could go to in games where you knew you were going to have the majority of the possession. He could open that door, he could score the goals that would get you the win. I would have him back, I don’t know about the football club, but he is the one with that ability. Knowing our club, we’ve been very shrewd, maybe there’s a buy-back clause in there for maybe less than half what we sold him</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Thompson says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s rivals are looking for <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s side to choke, fail and collapse]</b> I think this team has not only lived with the pressure but the expectancy of what 30 years without winning a title brings. I think nearly every <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan does not believe they will win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. They all know there is such a long way to go, so there is still an awful lot to be done. It is everybody else who is saying it is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s league. On the flip side, they are hoping that they will choke, fail and collapse, as it will be good to mock Liverpool<br /><br />Everybody will say that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> should win the title. I still say there is nothing guaranteed. It was a seven-point lead last year but everybody seems to have forgotten that! You have this great <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> side chasing them but you also have to point to the young <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> side and the emergence of Brendan Rodgers’ <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> team. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have won 11 and drawn one of their opening 12 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> matches, which is amazing, but you would have expected them to be even more points ahead. With the quality of those three teams, you cannot rest on your laurels. A defeat and a couple of draws and that soon gets clawed back. The only good thing is that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have played all of the big six and <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> but, before the turnaround of games, City have to play <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, and come out unscathed. When we get to Christmas, we will know a little bit more<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> need to be focused. As a lot of the games have gone down to the wire this year, they cannot keep getting away with it, in the shape of late goals, some VAR decisions going in their favour, as well as injuries going for them. We have to keep injury-free, keep more focused in games, and start quicker, as we did against City. It is that little bit of luck, at times, the little bit of VAR going in your favour, that could equally go against you. Red cards will be massive too - you only need a red card and then your backs are against the wall, especially against the big boys. But the biggest one of all is injures. It has decimated City’s defence, and if they had everybody fit, they could have been a lot closer to Liverpool</p>

It was a Sunday and I explained to them that I needed to go back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and speak to <a href="gerard-houllier.html">Gerard Houllier</a> and see what we could do. I fed all the information back to Gerard, who said he would speak to <b>[chief executive]</b> <a href="rick-parry.html">Rick Parry</a>.<br /><br />Lo and behold, the following week I’m at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> when the yellow ticker on Sky Sports News says, ‘Manchester United sign <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> from Sporting for £12.2 million.’ I couldn’t believe my eyes. How had the fee gone up from £4 million to £12.2 million in a few days? Gerard asked me to phone Tony to find out what had gone on. Tony told me that when he’d got off the plane on the Monday he had got a call to say he was off the deal. It was down to Stretford and Mendes instead. It was astonishing that the fee trebled.

Gerard said to me, ‘What do you think?’ I said he would be perfect. John was still only a young lad but he was fantastic. He wasn’t blessed with great pace but he read the game so well and was clearly going to be a top centre-half. After the game Gerard had a quiet word with John and asked if he’d like to play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. The response was positive.<br /><br />Gerard sent <b>[director of scouting]</b> Alex Miller to get his agent’s details and he came back from the players’ lounge with John’s mobile number.

  <p><b>[Phil Thompson says <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> is as important as <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> when it comes to attacking inspiration]</b> With him being out for a while, he has become as important as <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> in terms of goalscoring this season. He has been nothing short of top class so you want him to be available. You could have seen him being on the bench with the Champions League game coming up on Tuesday, but whether we would have been winning or losing, he would have been coming on to gain the relative game time. How fresh he looked will have warmed the heart of every <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan and probably the most of his team-mates too. He had this energy in his legs, which was an added bonus to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> winning the game<br /><br />This <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team is made of different stuff. Everybody thinks it will be all-out attack. There have been plenty of games where <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> and his staff have sussed out a team and set up their shape to engage at just over halfway. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> could go for it and press quite high or they could sit in and draw them in because of their reputation, looking to hit them on the counter. Overall, it is a really intriguing match. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> cannot play any other way than to attack at the return leg at Anfield</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Thompson says <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>’s leadership skills are proving to be a big miss for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> The last two games have shown the importance of <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> to this side. Not only what he brings as a midfield player, but he would have been demanding a lot more from the players on the pitch, talking to them controlling them, and asking more from their performances.

  <p><b>[Phil Thompson says Extremely hard to say <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> aren’t champions]</b> There’s still ramifications even if you do that. What do you do with the teams in the Champions League positions? Because <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> are quite healthily in third, they’d be extremely worried if you went to the teams that finished in the top four last season. There are still going to be problems. It won’t just end with it being null and void. It’s an extremely serious and unprecedented situation. But it’s not like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are two points clear, they’re 25 points clear and we’re three-quarters of the way through the season. It would be extremely hard to say <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> aren’t champions<br /><br />I would think so. I think they’re just giving themselves breathing time and it’s very difficult to see it get up and running then. They’ll be having meetings and every day it will change. I’m watching Sky News every day and it’s changing by the hour. Things are changing all the time. Playing behind closed doors is a contentious issue. I believe football is nothing without the fans, it’s a fans game and I like to think it could resume and the fixtures will be completed. As <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> said there are bigger issues to be concerned about but it would be good to get the fixtures completed because there’s so many issues to be decided</p>
