  <p><b>[Loris Karius has zero intention of departing Liverpool this summer as the goalkeeper prepares for the battle to become the club’s No.1. Florian Goll said]</b> There is absolutely nothing to the rumours that Karius will leave. He did not sign at Liverpool for the short term - he believes in the vision of the manager and he wants to be fully fit and prepared to fight for the No.1 position from the first day back. He has already started his individual programme to keep fit during the summer, because he wants to be completely ready when pre-season starts. He is extremely motivated by the competition</p>

  <p><b>[The agent of Loris Karius has denied reports that his client’s two-year loan to Besiktas will be terminated early]</b> Complete nonsense! I wonder where such things come from. This news is absolutely untrue. Loris is on loan to Besiktas for two years, that’s the situation. The club has no intention to end this loan contract prematurely. It’s fact that Loris is the clear No.1 at Besiktas, he played every game and showed good performances.</p>

  <p><b>[Florian Goll recently rubbished reports Loris Karius’s time in Turkey could be cut short]</b> Loris is on loan to Besiktas for two years - that’s the situation. The club has no intention of ending this loan contract prematurely.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> goalkeeper <a href="loris-karius.html">Loris Karius</a> has sued <a href="besiktas.html">Besiktas</a> for repeatedly failing to pay his wages during his loan spell at Vodafone Park]</b> I strongly condemn the fact that club representatives now want to portray Loris as a bogeyman. The payments have absolutely nothing to do with the corona crisis, even if the club likes to communicate it that way<br /><br />We did not separate. Loris is still under contract with Besiktas</p>
