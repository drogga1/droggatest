  <p><b>[The journey of Bordeaux defender Pablo is testimony to this as he achieved a lifelong dream on October 12 as he pulled on the icon colours of the Brazil national team for the first time]</b> I’m going to cry when I pull on my jersey. I was surprised when I got the call. I didn’t think I had a chance. My dad called me and said: ‘You’re in the national team!’ I said: ‘Is it a joke, Dad?’ It was true. I cried a lot and shouted with my wife. It was the best.<br /><br />My arrival in Bordeaux was very complicated. The football, the culture, how to adapt … I was young, I needed to have more experience. When I came back after the loan, I was stronger. Now I love France<br /><br />Staying at Bordeaux this summer was a choice for my family by also a sporting one because Bordeaux is a big club and it gives me more visibility to play for the Selecao. Now I’m here, the most difficult thing will be to stay here. I don’t just want to join the squad once</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil set to ring changes for Cameroon clash]</b> Of course, the older you are, the more care you have to take of yourself, but we’ve seen World Cup players 38, 40 years old. I’m 27, a little below them, but I believe that modern football has reached a different level. At the top, nothing can disrupt the mature players.</p>
