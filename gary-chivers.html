  <p><b>[Ex-Blues defender Gary Chivers believes <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have learned how to win without injured star <b>[N’Golo Kante]</b>(n-golo-kante.html) due to the emergence of talented teenager Billy Gilmour]</b> I’ve not seen someone come in at that age in that role and be that effective. When you think of <b>[N’Golo Kante]</b>(n-golo-kante.html)’s level, you think <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> more or less produced that. He wants to join in with the attack as well as defend.<br /><br />When he came in against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it was a tough game to come in for but he was so exceptional on the ball. The telling point was that his team-mates realised how good he was and they constantly passed him the ball. That’s how you know how good he is. He is an exceptional talent.<br /><br />I think they have now learned how to play without <a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kante</a> now <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> is on the scene. <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> and <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Kovacic</a> have also played well together. Now <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have someone who can defend and go forward at the same time. You wouldn’t think he was that young. It is like watching an experienced player, he plays it the first time and teams can’t get near him. It is obvious he is a good player<br /><br /><b>[Gary Chivers is particularly thrilled about seeing more of <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a> and <a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Loftus-Cheek</a> following their long injury lay-offs]</b> I am excited to see <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a> back. With everyone fit, it is a hard job to get in the starting eleven. <a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Loftus-Cheek</a> has been so unfortunate with injuries. It has really stopped his career progressing at a faster pace really.<br /><br />When he has come in and played he has been outstanding but then he gets a niggle and misses a few months. This one was a big injury of course. His career is hurtling forwards then it stops again. He is clever on the ball, quick feet and he is as strong as an ox at holding it up.<br /><br />He gives the midfield and defence support by not giving it away. You just want him to have four or five months clear of injuries so his career can progress rapidly again. When they are all fit like that it provides a great headache for <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> to have. All the players fit will all want to play and play for the shirt. He has got a hard decision to make when that first game comes. I think Frank will be trying to get all the trophies it will be all out for <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup but the most important thing is the top four spot to get in the Champions League. They have got every chance of doing that</p>
