<blockquote>
  <p>[Former Ajax defender Ruud Krol says Juventus will pose a tougher test than Real Madrid] It will be more difficult against Juventus, that’s for sure. Because in the round of 16, Real didn’t approach this game with the right mentality. We have seen this with the yellow taken by Sergio Ramos. He thought the second leg would be easy. Moreover, at Madrid, Ajax had nothing to lose. Juventus is another team. And Ajax will no longer be able to count on the surprise effect. Anyway, if they want to beat Juventus, they will have to produce the same game as against Real. But everything will also depend on whether Ronaldo plays or not. He is a player from another dimension. He is a phenomenon in the box and, if he does not play, the task will be less easy for Juve. Because with him, even the other players take advantage of his presence and the fact that he attracts the attention of the opponents.<br /><br />Surprised? No. I saw the style of play that this team produces, and especially in the two games against Real, I must admit that it’s good. There are many young people surrounded by some players with more experience. They perform well and produce excellent football. Young people are not yet fully mature, but they are progressing together and are all very versatile<br /><br />De Jong and De Ligt are going to leave, and maybe even two or three other players. It’s inevitable at Ajax. But the good thing is that they get a lot of money back. And it’s important to be able to reinvest. They have already got their hands on a young Romanian [Razvan Marin] for next season, to replace De Jong. And there will also be a need to strengthen in defence, by recruiting someone or betting on a young player from the club</p>
