<blockquote>
  <p>[AC Milan have announced the appointment of Paolo Scaroni as chairman as the club heralded the dawn of a new era under new owners Elliott Management] First of all, I would like to clarify the following. My purchase of Milan was neither a rash decision or one dictated by a passing infatuation. It stemmed from my passion for the team and belief in the economic potential of an investment in one of the noblest football teams in the world. Until June 30, 2018, I had paid almost €880m for AC Milan, of which only €280m was funded through Elliott, while I personally provided the remaining part.<br /><br />I was convinced that Elliott was a trustworthy investor and, above all, a partner to share the duties and honours of a stimulating adventure like the ownership of a team who, throughout their glorious history, have won, among other trophies, seven Champions Leagues and 18 Serie A titles. I made a mistake and only discovered it to my great detriment during my tenure. Elliott showed itself from the start to not be the partner I imagined but rather a lender totally disinterested in the complex management of a club of Milan’s standing, despite its control of the team’s board. All this happened despite repeated declarations from the fund regarding its alleged support for the club.<br /><br />During my time as president, I would like to remind all of you that I have never failed in my commitments and for this, I have proof of over €200m invested by me in the team under my ownership. I am ready to fight and I will do it to safeguard my rights and give assurances to the AC Milan shareholders, whom my beloved club deserve. Any deliberate and intentional manoeuvres to reduce the value of AC Milan will be prosecuted by law. Thank you for your hospitality and attention.</p>
