  <p><b>[Roberto Carlos has praised Real Madrid’s decision to sign Eden Hazard]</b> Last season was not what we expected, but we must not forget what we did in the previous five before that. Winning is always difficult, we have to think about La Liga first and then the Champions League. We have entered into a dynamic of always winning the Champions League and we forget the other competitions. Hazard is a player of the highest level who comes to win everything: the Champions League, La Liga and the Cup. For his part, <b>[Luka]</b> Jovic is a great player and he comes with great enthusiasm, I wish him good luck in Madrid. If I were the coach of Madrid I would not change much. The team has won a lot in recent years and when you win too much, it’s time to bring the group together and motivate them to win new competitions, nothing more than that.<br /><br /><b>[Carlos, however, is convinced that <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> remains the best left-back in the world]</b> <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> has a completely different style from mine. I always played close to the line but <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> has a lot of quality with the ball and without the ball and he’s won one Champions League more than me. It’s a shame that he didn’t go to Brazil <b>[for Copa America]</b> because of injury and the accumulated fatigue of playing with Real Madrid. But in the last 10, and also in the next 10, or at least seven years, <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> will be the best left-back in the world</p>

At least now the atmosphere of the Brazilian national team has calmed down a bit, there was not so much talk about football, there was more talk about the off-field problem. I hope Brazil will win <b>[Copa America]</b> again, it’s difficult to play a Copa America in my country because the press and the fans demand a lot and we have to be very strong psychologically to withstand and put up with the pressure.

  <p><b>[Roberto Carlos says Del Bosque put training in the afternoon, he knew we wouldn’t go in the morning]</b> <b>[Del Bosque]</b> was more a friend. You don’t need rules, the player knows what he has to do. He understood us perfectly. Monday workouts and sometimes Tuesday workouts were at 17:00. He didn’t put them at 11:00 in the morning because almost nobody came.<br /><br /><b>[The Brazilian went on to indicate that Antonio Camacho tried to be stricter with the players]</b> At the time of Galacticos there were seven and it was a danger in the locker room. We always controlled it well and we had a good relationship, except with Camacho who lasted 10 days. He came to the dressing room and greeted everyone, very seriously and with history at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I just watched to see what he was going to say and he said ‘I want everyone tomorrow at 7:00 in the morning’. Normally we trained at 10.30. We talked to him to try to change the schedule, as we had our habits<br /><br /><b>[Vanderlei Luxemburgo didn’t manage to deal with the dressing room and their special habits either]</b> The same happened with Luxemburgo, as we had the habit of arriving at the base, leaving our bags in the room and before dinner we had our beer and our wine. There were always two bottles of wine on the table.<br /><br /><a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and I told him ‘coach, the people here have their habits so try not to change them and don’t remove the bottles of wine and beer from the table before dinner because we are going to have problems.’.

I hope <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> is not better than me, but he is doing very well. It is necessary to see, but now he is the best left-sided defender that there is in the world.

He knows that sometimes he has to help Karim <b>[<a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a>]</b> and others to score. Nowadays he is the best in the world, there are games that he doesn’t score, but he is looking for space because he’s a reference point. I hope people realise how good <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is, because of the intelligence he has, but he is to blame for having scored so many goals. It’s complicated, it’s going to be a great game. If I was playing the game I’d say we’re going to win, but now I’m inside the club I’ve got another image. Let it be a great show, without violence.

I think in our generation it was harder to score goals. It was more physical back then and attackers were less protected. But Ronaldo could do everything<br /><br />I knew how unbelievable he was when he arrived but a lot of people at Madrid didn’t. He surprised a lot of people. I remember 80,000 people were very happy and pleasantly surprised by him<br /><br />We had an amazing atmosphere inside the club. Even though there were huge players, it was just a group of great people working in the same environment. We were all great friends and still are. It was spectacular. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is bigger than egos. The club is huge and the culture of the club was so big that we were able to sign huge players. It was then up to the players to adapt to the culture and not the other way around. Everyone had to speak Spanish in the dressing room. The only one who decided to speak more Portuguese than Spanish was <b>[David]</b> <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> because he wouldn’t leave my house! He was close to Ronaldo and me, so his Portuguese got better than his Spanish</p>

But, with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, it got very close. It was literally agreed and I just had to go there and sign the contract. It was just a week before I signed for Fenerbahce and I had been to Paris to meet both Roman Abramovich and (former chief executive) Peter Kenyon. Unfortunately, in the final moments something didn’t work out just before finalising, which happens a lot in football. There was an issue with the lawyer. It was all agreed, though, and I am 100 per cent sure I would have done well in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and it would have suited my characteristics<br /><br />I was still playing in Brazil with Palmeiras when <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> came in for me in 1995 but they couldn’t afford the deal.

He makes lots of rotations and whenever James comes on he always does well. The most important thing now is that he keeps on training as well as he has been and that he maintains the confidence he has in himself. The fans love him. To tell you the truth, I care for him and, whenever I see him, I give him a big hug. He has done so much for this club and even more for his country</p>
