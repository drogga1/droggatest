  <p><b>[Inter striker Diego Milito is delighted that <a href="gian-piero-gasperini.html">Gian Piero Gasperini</a> has been appointed as the club’s new coach]</b> I am pleased and excited about the arrival of <a href="gian-piero-gasperini.html">Gasperini</a> on the Inter bench. I was with him for a year at Genoa and we had a splendid season. <a href="gian-piero-gasperini.html">Gasperini</a> deserves it, you know why? Because in addition to being a great coach, he is above all an extraordinary man. Inter have hired a coach who will entertain the fans. He has clear ideas and now more than ever I think we can reclaim the Scudetto and the Champions League</p>

  <p><b>[Former Argentina international Diego Milito has announced he will retire from professional football at the end of the 2016 Copa Libertadores]</b> I am happy to say I will play another six months at the club. I will stay to play the Libertadores. It was not easy to stop playing football, something I have been doing my whole life. We are in a moment to enjoy, a historic moment and one in a positive way. I think I can continue to contribute to this great group we have formed and enjoy another Libertadores. In June 2016 I’m going to retire, no matter what. This is my last six months as a professional player<br /><br /><b>[Milito spoke about the injuries that have plagued him for the past 12 months]</b> I could not do the pre-season. I had pain in my knee and I said I’d rather not find out what it was. There were two paths; have surgery or not continue. But the support of so many people meant bit by bit it gets better</p>

  <p><b>[The Racing Club icon admitted he was gobsmacked but flattered by the initiative to name a road after him close to Estadio Juan Domingo Peron]</b> At first I laughed, it seemed a bit strong for me. These things leave me speechless, it even seems like madness. But I am very grateful for the affection fans give me and it is hard to explain what I feel today</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Milito responds to <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> rumours &amp; gives his <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> verdict]</b> I was convinced when I first saw him that he would do everything he is showing that he can do now. He has great potential to improve, his limits can only be set by himself. It is all down to Lautaro and where he wants to go in his career. But he can certainly become a top player. The greatest wish I have for him is that one day he will come to experience the same emotions that I felt, that he can do something people will remember. I feel proud to be part of Inter’s history. He has everything he needs to do that too<br /><br /><b>[Lautaro and <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> have struck up a telepathic understanding]</b> I like <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>. The numbers speak for themselves, he is a great striker. There is him, there is <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez as well. Inter are well covered up front. The feeling with Leo is natural, we can see just by looking that they have a good relationship. I don’t know how much truth there is in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s interest, but naturally I like it. But I know for sure that Lautaro is very happy to be at Inter<br /><br /><b>[Milito also had some words of advice for 17-year-old Inter striker Sebastiano Esposito, who has made three <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> appearances this season]</b> I saw him play against <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. It’s clear he has something different, that boy. He left a great impression on me, he has so much quality. But he is young, he was only born in 2002. Don’t worry, try to learn and enjoy the good fortune of being trained by <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> - he is perfect to grow under</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Milito says <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> capable of playing with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> at Barcelona]</b> He is not at Inter because of me, but because he is a great player. I think he’s fine at Inter, but of course he has great conditions for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and playing with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. He is a very complete player who is doing great at Inter. The truth is that I don’t know what will happen. I hear there are many rumours.</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Milito can appreciate why reported interest from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> will be turning the head of <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a>, with it easy to see the Inter forward slotting in seamlessly alongside fellow Argentine <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> at Camp Nou]</b> Lautaro can play for any team in the world, he’s a fantastic attacker, an exceptional boy, I appreciate him a lot. I’m especially happy that things are going so well for him. I think he’s happy at Inter, one of the best teams in the world. But if he has to go to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, I wish him the best. It will be great for him, I’m sure. How could he not gel with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>? I’m convinced he can play with Leo. He’s done it for Argentina<br /><br />Lautaro will be a top player during the next decade, he’s got everything to make that happen. He’s young but has very clear ideas. He’s a boy that always wants to improve and he’s got a lot of quality.</p>
