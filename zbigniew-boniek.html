  <p><b>[Former <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and Roma superstar Zbigniew Boniek has been analysing the situation at Milan and talking, in particular, about the clubs’ two Brazilian strikers <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> and Pato]</b> <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> is finished, he does not have the legs and the lungs any more. He can still hurt the opponent with the ball on his feet, but in today’s football you must run and <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> cannot do so any more. Pato is phenomenal, he’s a player who is growing also from the human side, apart from the technical one. Pato deserves to have guarantees. He sees his space inside the team grow and feels that he can become important for this Milan side</p>

  <p><b>[Zbigniew Boniek Foresees Close Affair Between Genoa &amp; Juventus]</b> The <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Rossoblu</a> will face a very strong and organised opponent. It will be tough for them to take maximum points. On the other hand, I also reckon that <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> will not find it easy to get a win at the . I don’t like making predictions and I just want to say that it will be a very close affair between these two teams, who play very good football. Genoa play the most beautiful football in the league. <b>[Gian Piero]</b> <a href="gian-piero-gasperini.html">Gasperini</a> has managed to turn a squad of players who were deemed ‘average’ a couple of years ago into an amazing unit</p>

  <p><b>[Zbigniew Boniek Reveals He Was Contacted To Develop Roma Youth Side]</b> I was personally contacted by the club a few months ago. It was an informal meeting, only to talk about things, but we did not reach an agreement. It gave me honour that I was contacted by Roma, but if I were to join the club to develop talent, it would not be for an ‘imaginary’ role. I would like a ‘real’ role, that can help the club. We can only see if in the future, a role like this comes along</p>

  <p><b>[Zbigniew Boniek has given a critical assessment on the state of play at Juventus]</b> Injuries and the lack of results have been problems, but another is the lack of leaders in the team. Those players are good at talking, but less so on the pitch. Managing certain players will be tough, but Zaccheroni has the experience<br /><br /><b>[Boniek, who played as a striker at the club between 1982 and 1985, turned his attentions to the boardroom]</b> I think that on a director level there is no strength or clarity which, in the past, distinguished <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. As for the pitch, there is not a single player out there who can decide a game</p>

He has personality, he never lets the ball slip and I like the way he conducts himself in goal. He is the Polish international goalkeeper and he has proven himself in the Champions League and was one of the best goalkeepers of the last European championships. After the injury to <a href="sebastien-frey.html">Frey</a>, with all due respect to Seba, <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> have improved</p>

I, for my former team, have always had great respect and I remember the day I came home to find a shirt of <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and a thank you letter which said I was added to the list of 50 stars. Then I learned from the press that they decided to exclude me from the list. I want to know the ultimate arbiter who changed their mind, and I challenge anyone to say that I said something wrong at Juve<br /><br /><b>[Boniek has previously spoken in disapproval of former <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> general manager <a href="luciano-moggi.html">Luciano Moggi</a>, who was charged for his involvement in the Calciopoli scandal, but he believes his criticism of the ex-official is fully justified, and offered his own view as to why he was removed]</b> Yes, I criticised <a href="luciano-moggi.html">Moggi</a>, but I think I should certainly be applauded. I do not know what to say, someone is probably bothered by the fact that I live in Rome</p>

The most important thing is to prepare a team for the European Championship.
