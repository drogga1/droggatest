Bournemouth are about to embark on their fifth Premier League campaign and their fixtures for the 2019-20 season have been confirmed</p>

  <p><b>[Bournemouth have sought to clarify their position when it comes to Ryan Fraser’s future]</b> Much has been written and spoken about the future of Ryan Fraser, as his contract with AFC Bournemouth heads into its final 12 months. As is the club’s policy, details regarding contract negotiations or transfer activity are kept confidential and do not enter the public domain. However, following some recent reports I felt it was imperative to speak publicly and provide balanced clarity on the situation.<br /><br />The offer of a new long-term contract has been on the table for Ryan for some time. In September 2018, at the request of Ryan’s representative, negotiations were paused to allow the player to focus entirely on his football. He went on to have an outstanding season, with seven goals and 13 assists helping the club secure a fifth successive season of Premier League football. During that time, I have been - and continue to be - in regular dialogue with Ryan’s representative, and have made it clear to both him and the player that our contract offer remains on the table. Quite simply, Ryan is a fantastic player and an integral part of our squad. We look forward to welcoming Ryan back to us next month after a well-earned break, upon which he can focus on having another standout season for AFC Bournemouth.</p>

  <p><b>[Bournemouth boss <a href="eddie-howe.html">Eddie Howe</a> becomes first <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> manager to take pay cut during coronavirus crisis]</b> There is no script for moments like this. No tactics and no set plays to find a winning formula. But as a board we are continually looking at ways to ensure the future of the club and our employees is protected when the season returns. With this in mind, the club’s chief executive Neill Blake, first team technical director Richard Hughes, manager <a href="eddie-howe.html">Eddie Howe</a> and assistant manager Jason Tindall have all taken significant, voluntary pay cuts for the entirety of this uncertain time. We have also advised a number of staff across all areas of the club that they will be temporarily furloughed, as a result of the ongoing pandemic. Throughout the entirety of this time, <b>[furloughed employees]</b> will continue to receive their full salary, with the club committing to topping up each furloughed employee’s wages to 100 per cent of their normal pay, while claiming back 80 per cent of their wages up to a maximum of £2,500 per month, as per government guidelines</p>

  <p><b>[Bournemouth follow <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in reversing furlough decision]</b> Earlier this month we announced that a number of staff at AFC Bournemouth were being temporarily furloughed, and that we would utilise the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. These measures were not taken lightly, given the operational pressures placed on clubs in such uncertain times. However well-placed our intentions were, we are aware of criticisms levelled at <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs applying for this scheme. We have listened to our supporters and have reversed our decision to furlough these employees. We, as a board of directors, will ensure that the club can continue to operate while the season is suspended, and we will not be applying for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme</p>

Previously, 748 players and club staff were tested for COVID-19 on 17-18 May, with six testing positive from three clubs.
