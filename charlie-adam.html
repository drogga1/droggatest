  <p><b>[Charlie Adam reveals he will be supporting Ireland at Euro 2016]</b> I’ll try and spend a couple of days in France. It’s right on the door step and I’d like to see the Irish lads from here <b>[Stoke]</b> do well. It’s great for them to get a chance to go to the Euros and play; they deserve it. They got the results that mattered in qualifying. I’ll be rooting for the home nations, of course, but some of the Ireland lads are my pals, so I’ll be keeping a closer eye on them.<br /><br />I was delighted to see my buddy Jonny <b>[Walters]</b> score twice against Bosnia and I’m equally delighted for the other Stoke lads who have done a great job too,</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke City midfielder Charlie Adam has claimed Arsenal are too easily outfought and labelled their attacking style of play madness]</b> The thing for Arsenal, I think it’s the front six want to just go and win the game, and they let the four defenders defend, and that’s it, that’s how it becomes. If you can get the ball back and get up the pitch quick you’re straight into their back four, and that’s the problem they’ve got. They are missing <b>[Granit]</b> Xhaka at the moment, but people like <b>[Francis]</b> Coquelin sitting in there, they want to go forward, they’ve got the intention to go forward, and it leaves them so wide open. At the weekend, <b>[Eden]</b> Hazard runs the ball 60, 70 yards, throws Coquelin out of the way and he finishes it. That’s the way Arsenal play, and at the moment, it’s not happening for them, they are struggling. For an opposing team, that’s how we feel we can affect them. They are great going forward, The front six can cause anybody problems, but when you get beyond that and straight at the back four, it can end up six versus four or five versus four, and you’ve got to punish them.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if they ever change or tailor their approach to a match]</b> No, never. It’s the same way, no matter if they are playing Stoke, Bayern Munich or Chelsea, they always try the same way. It is madness. I think that comes from a personal pride. Mourinho gets stick earlier in the season, but he goes to Liverpool, shuts up shop, he’s happy with a point. I don’t think Arsenal are happy with that. They think they have to win every game<br /><br />That’s one of the things that’s been labelled at Arsenal for a number of years. I don’t feel that they’ve got that drive, they just accept at Arsenal that it’s another game. Back in the day with Manchester United, Sir Alex Ferguson wouldn’t be having that, he wanted to win everything, every trophy, and that’s why he stayed in the game so long, and that’s why he was a champion. I think Arsene Wenger as a person must sit down at the end of the season and say: ‘I think <b>[we’ve]</b> gone as far as we can.’ There is an opportunity for someone else in there</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Adam believes the lack of Scottish players and managers in the Premier League is due in large part to teams feeling more comfortable with established foreign options]</b> It’s important to say there are good young Scottish players coming through and for the English clubs they do represent good value. But right now it’s all about the foreign market - they all want to buy foreign players down here.<br /><br />I’m still surprised the number is so low and it’s incredible to think there isn’t a Scottish manager in the Premier League now. But it’s tough because the league is evolving all the time. It’s getting bigger and more difficult to get into with every year that passes, so it will be hard to increase those numbers. The fact is the foreign market offers them more quality players right now. I’ve no doubt Stuart Armstrong at Celtic, for example, could come down and play in the Premier League. But the English clubs don’t want to do it at the moment<br /><br /><b>[On Harry Souttar]</b> We’ve got a young Scottish player at Stoke in Harry Souttar. He has real potential and could go on to play in our first team. He’s got the size, he’s quick and he wants to learn. He has the attributes to play for us in the Premier League. But these boys need an opportunity and that’s where it’s difficult. Even at a club like Stoke we can afford to go and spend £10 million on a player, so it’s hard to get them in. Rather than put a Harry Souttar in we can go and get Kurt Zouma on loan from Chelsea. That’s the reality<br /><br />I was speaking to Davie Moyes at the Fleetwood v Carlisle game recently and his insight on the game was incredible. Yet he’s out a job. He has so much experience in the game, he’s someone you want to learn from. Guys like Davie should still have an input into the Scottish game even when they’re out of work. But to get a Scottish manager in the Premier League now will be hard. There’s so much foreign investment in clubs now - the owners want a foreign coach as well</p>

  <p><b>[Steven Gerrard has been backed to handle the challenge of ending Celtic’s title dominance if he takes the Rangers job]</b> Stevie is a winner. He has been at the highest level. Yes, he has not got the coaching experience of others, but you have got to start somewhere.<br /><br />It is going to be a big one but I think he could be the one who could hopefully change the fortunes. Good-quality players need to come in and they are hard to find and it is going to cost a lot of money. This is a different scenario to coaching the Under-18s at Liverpool, and we can’t hide from that. There is a lot more pressure. Can he handle it? He has handled it all his career, so why can’t he as a manager? It is a difficult situation because Celtic are on the crest of a wave, they have won seven titles in a row, and with the momentum they have got, it is going to be hard to stop Celtic. Financially, Celtic can sell three or four players for £30-£40m in the summer and re-invest that and be strong again. So, it is going to be a tough ask, but I think he is the one at the moment who could change it.</p>

When the chips are down you look at your big players, you want your big players to bring magic in one moment in the season, and it times we felt like the so-called big players in the squad never turned up for us and never performed. Yeah, everybody else could help, but for all the plaudits the so-called bigger players were getting from certain members of the management staff last season - they weren’t producing. But, listen, he’s gone now. We move on and we look to the future. The future for us at the moment is in the Championship.</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke City midfielder Charlie Adam has admitted that he would relish the chance to play under Steven Gerrard at Rangers]</b> The Rangers thing is something that would interest me, absolutely. I’ve been back more times this season than in the last four or five years - I can see that it’s going in the right direction. At the moment I’m still contracted to Stoke but I want to play and hopefully there are opportunities during the <b>[winter]</b> window to play somewhere. Steven <b>[Gerrard]</b> has obviously put his authority on the club. The players are playing well and with an unbelievable amount of confidence.<br /><br />What a hell of a result against Celtic in the last game. The tails are up, they have momentum, but they know that it’s going to be a big challenge from now until the end of the season. At the moment there’s nothing to it <b>[the rumours]</b>. We are talking up something that is not there, but everyone knows I started my career at Rangers - I played in front of 50,000 with the pressure. It’s something I’d relish and enjoy. I want to play.<br /><br />I woke up on Tuesday and I had loads of texts about Hearts, but I’ve had no contact with any club in Scotland. I don’t know where it’s come from but there’s been no contact with me or my agent. I had a good relationship with Craig <b>[Levein]</b> at Scotland and I like him as a manager and a person. I’ve had a good career. I’ve enjoyed it. I have a lot to go and I still have a lot to learn. Hopefully I go to a place where I enjoy it and hopefully they enjoy me being there</p>

  <p><b>[Stoke City’s Charlie Adam has claimed Liverpool defender Andy Robertson is the best left-back in Europe]</b> I said to Stoke at the time we should have bought him for £8 million - it was cheap. Liverpool could afford to throw that at him though, and if it hadn’t worked it wouldn’t have been a gamble for them. What’s that £8m worth now? Put a five in front of it at least - it’s probably £60m, £70m, for a left-back. Fair play to him. And the biggest thing for him now will be if they can win that league - they’re in a great position<br /><br />If Liverpool won the league, he’d be a cult hero. The players love him, the fans love him - Liverpool have always had a tradition of Scottish players and the one thing they always love about them is how hard they work. We have the most endeavour, we want to win, we have a passion and they’ve related to him in that way. But don’t forget he’s also a quality player. His assists, the link-up play he has with <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane is fantastic<br /><br /><b>[Adam believes that makes Robertson’s short rise even more impressive]</b> Although it took him three or four months to get the opportunity, he hasn’t been out of the team since. Jurgen <b>[Klopp]</b> had him on the sidelines, but he did well in training, got his chance and has never looked back. He’s been the best left-back in the league, probably the best left-back in the Champions League as well. He’s proof that it’s not where you start your career that matters, it’s where you finish. No disrespect to Queen’s Park but Andy knows where the low point is, part-time, working on match-days at Hampden - to get to where he is now is incredible.</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Adam says Henderson up there with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s great captains &amp; a Player of the Year contender]</b> Did I envisage <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> winning the European Cup as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain? Probably not. But how things have changed, and he’s become comfortable in the role and since coming in as a young lad starting out, every season he’s got better and better. He’s played his best football this season that he’s probably ever played. He’s worked his way into the role and is a terrific role-model for young kids on and off the pitch, you never see him in the press for anything wrong<br /><br />You could put him up there with the great <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captains over the years. The great captains have been able to drag <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> through the mire, they’re the ones who have taken on the added responsibility. And he’s accepted the role very well, he’s taken it in his stride and the performances he’s been producing have been incredible. It’s a position he takes very, very seriously and he’s getting the rewards for that<br /><br />When I played with him he was a young kid coming in from Sunderland. He was playing out of position, it was difficult for him to get into the central midfield but as time passed, his importance as part of the club evolved over the years. He’s a mainstay of the team now, he’s the captain. I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are a very different team when he doesn’t play. The dynamics of the team are different, he’s very underrated.<br /><br />For me personally, I think he could be player of the year, that’s how much influence he has on the team. You talk about Kevin De Bruyne, you talk about <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> but <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> as an individual sets the tone and the markers for everybody else to go and play. He’s been terrific over the past few years and has grown into being <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain</p>

But the way he’s bounced back from that mental toughness has been incredible. I still say he’s one of the best number nines in the world where he could occupy a defence on his own. He’s hungry to score goals, he’s playing for one of the best teams in the world with the greatest player I’ve ever seen <b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>]</b>. It’s phenomenal to see that he’s made that step up. It was crucial for him when he left <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to go to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and everyone thought ‘was he the right type of player for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>?’ but he’s been phenomenal and I was grateful to be able to share the dressing room with him.<br /><br />The top players connect well. Even when <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> was there, the three of them seemed to connect. There was no ego about any of the players, they wanted the best for the team and that’s the important thing. You sort of saw it when they signed <b>[Ousmane]</b> Dembele. He was the other type of player that was all about him. When you’re at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> it’s all only about one person and that’s <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>. It’s not being disrespectful, but you have to try and manipulate your game to suit him because he’s the main man. But Dembele’s not really gone there and expressed how <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> did. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> knew that he wasn’t going to be the main man at that time, but he got his head down, knuckled down and they had some great success together, the three of them.<br /><br /><b>[Adam moved to <a href="stoke-city-fc.html">Stoke City</a> in 2012, where he played alongside former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> forward <a href="bojan-krkic.html">Bojan Krkic</a> and ex-Real Madrid man Jese Rodriguez]</b> Bojan was a player who came with the pedigree of where he’d played, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, he’d been at Roma and he’d been somewhere else <b>[<a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>]</b>, and then he came to Stoke. And from day one he just hit the ground running, he was phenomenal. On day one, you could see the talent he had. But most of all, he was a great guy. He was a great guy to have in the dressing room, always laughing and joking. But his mentality to work hard was incredible. The only thing about Bojan was when he got that knee injury, that was when his football went a different way. He had to change and adapt his game, he wasn’t as sharp as he was but <b>[he was]</b> a phenomenal player. It’s a shame to see an injury like that curtail someone’s career because he could have been phenomenal for Stoke. I loved playing with him, I was playing that night against Rochdale <b>[in an FA Cup match in January 2015]</b> when he did his cruciate <b>[ligament]</b> and it was heartbreaking for the lads to see it because in the dressing room he was a great guy and it was disappointing for him. Jese was one where he came to the club from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, he was the boy wonder at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. He got that serious knee injury from that tackle with <b>[Sead]</b> <a href="sead-kolasinac.html">Kolasinac</a> <b>[for Madrid against Schalke in 2014]</b> and he ended up with a cruciate injury as well. He probably never fulfilled the potential or the career that he was going to have before that injury and that’s what serious injuries do to you. For Jese, I think there was a lot of other things going on off the pitch, which probably never helped, and that was difficult. It was a strange one but, as a group of players, you’ve got to adapt and you’ve got to try your best but unfortunately, it never worked out for him</p>

I think a little because I was Scottish as well, that helped. He made sure everything was okay and it was great to be part of that and just being in his company was phenomenal.
