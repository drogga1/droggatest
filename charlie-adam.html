  <p><b>[Former Scotland international Charlie Adam expects a move away from Parkhead for <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a>]</b> I think it’s probably now time for him to leave Celtic. It’s the next progression for his career. Seeing how well Andrew Robertson’s progressed at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, as a player you’ve got to be thinking, ‘I want some of that’. He’s done amazing at Celtic, winning the treble-treble. It’s going to be difficult for him to leave because he is a big Celtic fan but if Arsenal do want him, they’ll have to pay serious money for him</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Adam says Henderson up there with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s great captains &amp; a Player of the Year contender]</b> Did I envisage <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> winning the European Cup as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain? Probably not. But how things have changed, and he’s become comfortable in the role and since coming in as a young lad starting out, every season he’s got better and better. He’s played his best football this season that he’s probably ever played. He’s worked his way into the role and is a terrific role-model for young kids on and off the pitch, you never see him in the press for anything wrong<br /><br />You could put him up there with the great <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captains over the years. The great captains have been able to drag <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> through the mire, they’re the ones who have taken on the added responsibility. And he’s accepted the role very well, he’s taken it in his stride and the performances he’s been producing have been incredible. It’s a position he takes very, very seriously and he’s getting the rewards for that<br /><br />When I played with him he was a young kid coming in from Sunderland. He was playing out of position, it was difficult for him to get into the central midfield but as time passed, his importance as part of the club evolved over the years. He’s a mainstay of the team now, he’s the captain. I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are a very different team when he doesn’t play. The dynamics of the team are different, he’s very underrated.<br /><br />For me personally, I think he could be player of the year, that’s how much influence he has on the team. You talk about Kevin De Bruyne, you talk about <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> but <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> as an individual sets the tone and the markers for everybody else to go and play. He’s been terrific over the past few years and has grown into being <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain</p>

I think <b>[Roberto]</b> <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> is a massive link to how <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> play and what they try to do. <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and <b>[Sadio]</b> Mane, since they’ve come in the door have been sensational. I’d get rid of <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>, I’d go for <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>. <b>[Mbappe’s]</b> the next big football star. He knows that himself, he said that in an interview not long ago didn’t he - ‘I know I’m a superstar’. You’d have to go for <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>, but it depends on where he’d play. If I’m going to be spending £150m-£200m on <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> he’ll be playing every week</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch has had podcast listeners guessing about the identity of a mystery teammate known only as Parched. So, in the end, Parched appeared on the phone]</b> It’s me, Charlie Adam. What do you mean it’s so obvious? The only reason I found out because some guy at Reading, some groundsman or something, came up to me and asked, ‘Who’s Parched?’<br /><br />I said, ‘What?’ and said I didn’t have a clue <b>[…]</b> He said he thought it was me and I said it definitely wasn’t. Then my mate text me saying I was even money to be Parched on Crouchy’s podcast and I said, ‘What? Let me text Crouchy!’<br /><br />So I got on my phone and said, ‘What is this Parched, big man? People keep asking me.’<br /><br />And he said, ‘Well, there’s good and bad news … ‘<br /><br />I never knew. In the seven or eight years I was at Stoke and you’s were caning me behind my back. I didn’t have a clue and now I’m paranoid in my head about it. I was just learning the game and when I become a manager I’ll understand what it’s all about.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team-mate Charlie Adam says <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> showed phenomenal strength to recover from biting bans to become a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> star]</b> He will have been disappointed at what had happened <b>[his ban for biting]</b>, how he got involved in the situation, both situations, and how it occurred. But the way he’s bounced back from that mental toughness has been incredible. I still say he’s one of the best number nines in the world where he could occupy a defence on his own. He’s hungry to score goals, he’s playing for one of the best teams in the world with the greatest player I’ve ever seen <b>[Lionel Messi]</b>. It’s phenomenal to see that he’s made that step up. It was crucial for him when he left <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to go to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and everyone thought ‘was he the right type of player for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>?’ but he’s been phenomenal and I was grateful to be able to share the dressing room with him.<br /><br />The top players connect well. Even when <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> was there, the three of them seemed to connect. There was no ego about any of the players, they wanted the best for the team and that’s the important thing. You sort of saw it when they signed <b>[Ousmane]</b> Dembele. He was the other type of player that was all about him. When you’re at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> it’s all only about one person and that’s <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>. It’s not being disrespectful, but you have to try and manipulate your game to suit him because he’s the main man. But Dembele’s not really gone there and expressed how <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> did. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> knew that he wasn’t going to be the main man at that time, but he got his head down, knuckled down and they had some great success together, the three of them.<br /><br /><b>[Adam moved to <a href="stoke-city-fc.html">Stoke City</a> in 2012, where he played alongside former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> forward <a href="bojan-krkic.html">Bojan Krkic</a> and ex-Real Madrid man Jese Rodriguez]</b> Bojan was a player who came with the pedigree of where he’d played, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, he’d been at Roma and he’d been somewhere else <b>[Ajax]</b>, and then he came to Stoke. And from day one he just hit the ground running, he was phenomenal. On day one, you could see the talent he had. But most of all, he was a great guy. He was a great guy to have in the dressing room, always laughing and joking. But his mentality to work hard was incredible. The only thing about Bojan was when he got that knee injury, that was when his football went a different way. He had to change and adapt his game, he wasn’t as sharp as he was but <b>[he was]</b> a phenomenal player. It’s a shame to see an injury like that curtail someone’s career because he could have been phenomenal for Stoke. I loved playing with him, I was playing that night against Rochdale <b>[in an FA Cup match in January 2015]</b> when he did his cruciate <b>[ligament]</b> and it was heartbreaking for the lads to see it because in the dressing room he was a great guy and it was disappointing for him. Jese was one where he came to the club from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, he was the boy wonder at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. He got that serious knee injury from that tackle with <b>[Sead]</b> <a href="sead-kolasinac.html">Kolasinac</a> <b>[for Madrid against Schalke in 2014]</b> and he ended up with a cruciate injury as well. He probably never fulfilled the potential or the career that he was going to have before that injury and that’s what serious injuries do to you. For Jese, I think there was a lot of other things going on off the pitch, which probably never helped, and that was difficult. It was a strange one but, as a group of players, you’ve got to adapt and you’ve got to try your best but unfortunately, it never worked out for him</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Adam says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> boss <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> is similar to club legend <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Kenny Dalglish</a> when it comes to building a rapport with players]</b> Both seem to be very well liked, very open to the players, they seem to embrace the players a lot. I don’t know Jurgen to work with, but what I see from the outside is he’s an incredibly passionate man and his work ethic is amazing. The people I speak to at the club say he’s there early in the morning, gets his work done and he goes home and he just keeps it simple. He’s got great players but you have to organise them and set a way and a discipline of how to play and he seems to have done that and he’s getting results from it. Somebody that embraces you, shows you passion and a bit of love is what every player wants and he’s phenomenal. He’s got great players around him and he seems to have got the best solutions for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at the moment<br /><br /><b>[Adam joined in July 2011 after impressing during Blackpool’s solitary season in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, with <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Dalglish</a> doing all he could to help his fellow Scotsman settle in at the club]</b> I was just lucky every day that when he was manager he would come and speak and come and sit and have lunch and make sure I was okay. I think a little because I was Scottish as well, that helped. He made sure everything was okay and it was great to be part of that and just being in his company was phenomenal. And that year we won the Carling Cup and got to an FA Cup final as well, so we did okay. I think that started the trend because <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> hadn’t won a trophy for a number of years and we were fortunate enough we were the team that managed to get them on that roll again and get them to cup finals</p>
