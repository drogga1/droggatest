  <p><b>[Cheikhou Kouyate believes <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> teammate <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> can turn out to be the best right-back in the English Premier League]</b> He <b>[<a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a>]</b> is a very good player and he is young. If he continues to play this way this year he could be the best right-back in the league. He has everything, he is clever and strong. This boy makes me happy.</p>

  <p><b>[Senegal vs Benin. <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>’s Cheikhou Kouyate on Benin’s quality]</b> If you want to win you have to play very well to show that you deserved to reach this stage of the competition. In today’s football there are no small teams, we are going to prepare well for the game</p>

  <p><b>[Senegal team-mate Cheikhou Kouyate says <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> didn’t win Ballon d’Or because he is African]</b> For me this Ballon d’Or is for <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, there is no doubt about that. Listen, if Sadio was a Brazilian or a European there would not have been no debate. It would have been him for the award straight away and it’s not because I play with him at international level, or because I know him; it’s just what people who watch football feel. Just go back and watch what he did for both club and country and you will see in between the lines that no one has been better than him<br /><br />We all know that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is really good, maybe the greatest player, but last season, come on. Maybe it’s not just football that they look at because there is no way three people had a better season than him <b>[Mane]</b>. It’s just unbelievable how some people are judged but that is not fair</p>
