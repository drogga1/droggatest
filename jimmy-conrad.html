  <p><b>[Concussion convinces Jimmy Conrad to call an end to an unbelievable career]</b> There’s a lot more research being done on the brain, and there’s still a lot of unanswerable questions. I mean, doctors can’t tell me what’s going to happen to me in 10 or 15 years, what my life’s going to be like<br /><br /><b>[Conrad hadn’t played for <a href="chivas-fc.html">Chivas</a> USA since his second appearance, when he took a punch to the head from Colorado Rapids goalkeeper Matt Pickens]</b> I had a real solid buzz in my head for two and a half, three months<br /><br />I take a great deal of pride in brainwashing America’s youth. When I coach kids, I let them know that there’s no magic pill you can take. Nothing I say is magically going to make you better. If you’re willing to put the work in, then you’re going to reap the rewards. It’s that simple<br /><br /><b>[Never blessed with considerable pace or even outstanding natural abilities, Conrad can look back on some impressive achievements during his 13-year career]</b> To me it’s not a sad thing, it’s a celebration of an unbelievable career<br /><br /><b>[Additionally, Conrad represented the U.S. national team, earning 28 caps including two during the 2006 World Cup]</b> I remember they had a video of Clive Charles that we’d watched prior to going, and he said just to take a moment when you’re on the field to take a look around, look at the crowd, smell the grass. I did that. I remembered that when I got on the field against Italy, and I did that. I can still remember how fresh and vivid that memory is in my mind because I took that moment<br /><br />Robin I think said it best: a story of determination. That I decided what I wanted to do early on and I wasn’t going to let anybody tell me that I couldn’t do it. I heard a lot of nos and that I wasn’t good enough and I was slow - I think those still follow me around. And here I am 13 years later with a lot of awesome accomplishments, with a lot to be proud of</p>
