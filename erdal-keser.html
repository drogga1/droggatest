<blockquote>
  <p>[The scapegoating of Mesut Ozil in the wake of Germany’s early exit from World Cup 2018 has been branded pathetic] I think it’s pathetic. That may sound bad, but what Bierhoff did was below the belt. It is not fair if the struggles at the World Cup are tied to these players and the DFB allows that to happen, or fuels it. That would be cheap.<br /><br />[Bierhoff told Welt when discussing the furore which has surrounded Ozil] We never forced any player of the national team to do something, but we always tried to convince them. We haven’t succeeded with Mesut. That’s why we should have thought about leaving him out from a sporting point of view. I think the fact that Mesut and Ilkay took these pictures did not keep the team busy. But the debate afterwards did. Looking back now, I would try to be clearer regarding this topic<br /><br />In my time it was even more extreme, there were only two foreign players per team, but in principle it’s the same as nowadays. If players like Ozil see their standards dip, they are the first to be attacked</p>
