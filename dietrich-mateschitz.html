  <p><b>[Mateschitz has since revealed a higher bid has been tabled for Keita, though he has reiterated the club do not want to sell their prized asset]</b> Lately we got a €75m offer for <a href="naby-keita.html">Naby Keita</a>. No way! He has a contract and he will accomplish it. To sell him would not only be a proof of distrust to our fans but also the wrong sign for our players like <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a>, who is in demand too</p>

  <p><b>[Rangnick visited England in late 2016 to watch <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, Charlton and Brentford in action, leading to rumours that Red Bull was about to invest in an English club. In January, the company’s founder denied speculation that they were interested in taking over Nottingham Forest]</b> There is nothing to it. That’s not even idle speculation. It moreover would be an enormous stupidity to think about an addition in England after a successful involvement at Leipzig. That would be wrong from a sporting perspective. To mix everything together would at one point also not be in accordance with <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> regulations</p>
