  <p><b>[Aleksandar Kolarov could have been forgiven for asking his former club for a few pointers on how to try and contain the free-scoring frontman]</b> I haven’t spoken to anyone at City about Salah because it is not about stopping one player. It would be dangerous to focus just on him. Liverpool are not only about Salah. They have a number of good players. Against Barca, we did not focus just on Messi. We played as a team and by playing in this way we can achieve great things.</p>

  <p><b>[Roma vs Real Madrid]</b> The fans have a right to be annoyed, we respect that, but they must be conscious of the fact they know nothing about football. I like tennis and basketball. I have played both since I was a kid and I get angry when my team loses, but I would never offer tactical advice because I have no idea about it. It’s a general problem, fans of every team should understand that.</p>

  <p><b>[Aleksandar Kolarov has agreed a contract extension with <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> that ties the defender to the club until the end of the 2020-21 campaign]</b> I want to thank the club for this contract extension, it means a great deal to me. Even now I see it as another starting point. I intend to keep on improving and developing in order to contribute to the growth of this club. I want to keep improving - physically, technically, my shooting <b>[…]</b> everything. At my age fitness is key, and I feel good. I’m convinced I can still improve a bit every day.
