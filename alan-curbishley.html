  <p><b>[Charlton have lost their first three home games and United are the next visitors. Curbishley praised his conquerors generously. After the reigns of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and United, he said]</b> maybe you will be talking about the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> of the 2000s. For that to happen you have to dominate for five to six years. He <b>[<a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a>]</b> has set it up and clearly thinks he’s got a chance to do that <b>[Curbishley appeared to be talking in the context of England. Can <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> conquer Europe this season]</b> We’ll have to wait and see</p>

  <p><b>[Conor Gallagher can be ‘the next Gilmour’ for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> You saw <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> <b>[recently]</b> and there are some good players coming through at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He needs to be playing, Gallagher has shown that this season that playing regular football has helped him enormously.<br /><br />He can play for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for sure in the future. He has got box-to-box energy, can find a pass and score a goal. He is a team player and a good lad as well, as I understand it, which helps.<br /><br /><b>[However, Curbishley went onto say that a move from South East London to South Wales wasn’t necessary to continue his development]</b> I was a bit surprised by that and I think they were as well. I saw him a couple of times. I didn’t quite see why he made the move to be honest. If <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> were in the top three or top two then fine but he was playing really well, living at home and that’s a big thing. These things happen and I think he is a good player</p>
