  <p><b>[Former Inter attacker Alvaro Recoba has shared his views on the future of <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Mauro Icardi</a>’s future with the club]</b> <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a>? I think like a fan, I really don’t know what happened with him. If it were up to me, I’d keep him for his quality. The reality is that every fan would like the best players in the team and it is normal that the will of the players and the leadership is important. They know the truth and what they want to do<br /><br /><b>[He then spoke on <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a>’s recent appointment as manager]</b> When you are a coach, if you are good you are good, even if you were with an opposing team first. I think he is a good coach, so he is welcome at Inter. If he does well if will be for the good of Inter. If he does badly, there will be people that say that he is not an Interista<br /><br /><b>[He concluded by discussing the idea of teams being the anti-Juventus]</b> I think that all the teams in Italy are trying to become the anti-Juve. Inter is doing a good job in this regard but I think <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> is still the strongest team, they have the confidence to win for several years. It is clear that they are not invincible, sooner or later the moment will come when they will not win. Inter can think of trying to win</p>

  <p><b>[Recoba says If <b>[Ronaldo]</b>(cristiano-ronaldo.html) and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> were playing at the same time, I would watch Messi]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> has been at the top for 15 years. People can say that he hasn’t moved from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. Yes, but his teammates have changed, and he’s still there. For me, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is the best of all time<br /><br />When it comes to <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, if they had played in different eras, it would be a different story. But since they have played in the same era, it is normal for them to be compared. Now, if both are playing at the same time and I have to choose a game, I prefer to watch a <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> match</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Recoba says Luis Suarez is ageing well like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> It’s a question of age. I’m not just talking about Luis here. It’s the same with Messi, his team-mate who’s of a similar age, also Cristiano, who’s a little older. They’ve all adapted to their changing physical capabilities, and the changing speed. Today Messi isn’t the same player he was 10 years ago. Now he can’t pick up the ball and run through the whole opposition team 10 times a game. He has to play differently. I think Luis plays differently today too. You know? Running a little less, less distance, but he still scores goals. Luis’ consistent goalscoring record season after season is incredible. So look, it’s normal to have to change your style as you get older. But he’s without doubt Uruguay’s greatest-ever striker and definitely one of the best in the history of football, too</p>

  <p><b>[Former Inter attacker Alvaro Recoba has commented on Inter’s lack of squad depth]</b> The Inter squad is not comparable to that of <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> at the moment, playing in two competitions will hurt Inter who are struggling with the squad they have. It is a factor that could have an effect at the end of the season as Inter do not have the depth <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> do to their squad. Now <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> is injured, they have Sebastiano Esposito and <a href="dominic-matteo.html">Matteo</a> Politano, who are not on the same level. Whenever there is a change of manager, the players grow in confidence. If <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> does not win the Scudetto, he will be equal to Luciano Spalletti</p>

  <p><b>[Alvaro Recoba started by explaining what made him decide to join Inter over other options that he had at the time]</b> Before arriving in Italy, I thought about all the other Uruguayans who had played there, above all Ruben Sosa, who was one of my idols. Six months before arriving at Inter I had done very well with Nacional, then my agent told me about two possibilities, Inter and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>.<br /><br />I was a kid, I was only 20-years-old. When I arrived at Inter I found myself in a completely different world, my wife and I were two kids. I had a responsibility to the fans who all depend on you. You determine whether they are happy or sad on a Monday.<br /><br />I played with <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibra</a>, Baggio, <a href="juan-sebastian-veron.html">Veron</a> and <a href="javier-zanetti.html">Zanetti</a> and I miss them. If I had been told that I would have had the career I did with Inter I would have never imagined it<br /><br /><b>[He then spoke on his relationship with former teammates, many of which are better than others]</b> I haven’t heard from <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> again but not for any particular reason. I’ve never been at his level. He was a mega player if we meet again we will have a hug.<br /><br />I have a different relationship with <a href="christian-vieri.html">Vieri</a>, <a href="javier-zanetti.html">Zanetti</a> and Almeyda, who I am very close. I speak to <a href="javier-zanetti.html">Zanetti</a> once a year but I still love him. Almeyda is a brother of mine. I have also stayed in touch with Moriero, Ventola, Di Biagio, <a href="sebastien-frey.html">Frey</a>, <a href="francesco-toldo.html">Toldo</a> and <a href="hernan-crespo.html">Crespo</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Next he discussed which of the goals he scored for Inter was the best one]</b> The first goal I scored against <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> seems to be one of the best. A goal can be beautiful, I liked it as much as the one against Lazio in Rome. It is difficult to choose<br /><br /><b>[He then revealed that former Inter owner and president <a href="massimo-moratti.html">Massimo Moratti</a> rejected a bid from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> for him]</b> In 2001 it looked like I could have gone to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. <a href="massimo-moratti.html">Moratti</a> was very close to their president but he immediately said no after just two seconds</p>
