  <p><b>[Mohun Bagan outclass George Telegraph 2-1 in a pre-season match]</b> Players are performing according to plans. Today’s weather was comparatively more humid than the last three days and the players complained about the conditions. Thus, it was pre planned that the first half of the game would be of one hour and the second half will be played for 30 minutes. The players did well but there is definitely a scope of improvement.<br /><br /><b>[On Stephane Bayi Kamo and Ansumana Kromah]</b> The players are committed to the team and are improving every day and adapting to the conditions<br /><br /><b>[They have got hold of wingers Israil Gurung, Nikhil Kadam, defenders Abhishek Das, Gurjinder Kumar and their former midfielder Denson Devadas]</b> They will join us very soon. There are some issues regarding the contract but that will be sorted and soon. Kingsley has some Visa related issues but we expect him to arrive soon and join practice. Depending on his fitness level, his chances of starting the opening match in CFL will be decided<br /><br />We want to play as many practice matches as possible which will help in improving the fitness of the team</p>

  <p><b>[The spy who came in from East Bengal]</b> The league has already crossed the half-way mark. We have not signed any news players either. I am not sure whether there is anything fresh that could be noted down from today’s tie.</p>
