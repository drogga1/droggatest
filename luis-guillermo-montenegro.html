<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Colombia goal machine Radamel Falcao’s World Cup dream is finally]</b> It’s his <b>[Falcao’s]</b> first World Cup and people are loving this moment. All the people think it’s a beautiful chance to demonstrate that he’s one of the best strikers in the world. Maybe it’s a chance to show to the world that he’s coming back. It’s his last chance to show the world that he’s world class. I think in England he didn’t have the opportunities of confidence of his coaches. Leonardo Jardim has lots of confidence in him and this is very important now. In Colombia, <b>[Jose]</b> Pekerman believes in him and this is an important thing. He’s like a hero because of his story. He worked very hard to return to the team and people believe he’s an idol, he’s an example for many kids and the country. Falcao and James Rodriguez are the heroes of the team.<br /><br />I think that Colombia is better than the 2014 World Cup. Players have more experience, many players are in first-class teams such as Yerry Mina at Barcelona, James at Bayern Munich, Falcao at Monaco, Juan Cuadrado at Juventus. Many players are better having had these experiences and the group Colombia have is easier than Brazil’s group. Maybe they have a chance to go to the quarter-finals or semi-finals at least</p>
