  <p><b>[Mexico defender Carlos Salcedo open to future Chivas return]</b> We’ve talked. We haven’t reached an agreement but I’ve never ruled out nor will I rule out <b>[a Chivas return]</b>. Whether it’s right now, in two or three years, I’m not ruling it out, but yes I’m realistic with myself and I know that I want to stay longer.<br /><br />I talk with Matias a lot. We have a really good friendship. We’ve both agreed that if it’s the moment to return now, it’s going to happen now. If it’s in two years, it’s going to happen then. I’m calm and thankful with him for all the advice he’s given me</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico defender Carlos Salcedo returned to training Tuesday for Eintracht Frankfurt]</b> We have an important match on Saturday and the chance to make amends for recent weeks. We can still qualify for Europe and to do that we need to give our all on Saturday.</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Salcedo’s return a big boost for Mexico]</b> We’ve shown that we don’t have to put limits on ourselves. Life is like that. Important challenges come and you should take them on as they are, move forward and show why the Mexican also is capable of being the protagonist in these types of stages.<br /><br />The truth is, I said it from the beginning, I wasn’t expecting that my body would react like this. I said that we were going to say, that I’d be honest with Profesor Osorio and see. I think the discipline, the work, I always am doing that and I can’t let that go. Today the work has borne fruits and I hope it also will be like that in the World Cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico made it two wins in two World Cup matches with a 2-1 victory over South Korea]</b> That’s been helping us a lot because when one of us makes a mistake we have the humility to accept that, to be a better player and a better person. I think it’s been a lot of help.</p>

  <p><b>[Edson Alvarez needs a lift]</b> We’ve talked with him. We’re talking to him in the locker room. They’re things that happen in soccer. They’re things that happen. I think we’ve always shown and always said that even when we have a good result and a good game the team can’t think to much of itself and when we have an afternoon that didn’t go like we wanted, the team can’t get too down.</p>

  <p><b>[VAR not bothering Mexico]</b> I don’t like to talk about that much. Ultimately, we’re all humans and we make mistakes at our job. Today we made mistakes, and we can’t get upset by the referee. The referee did what he thought was right and we have to respect that.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico defender Carlos Salcedo says his future with the national team is uncertain]</b> I’m really sad and have a lot of things to think about regarding my future. There are a lot things to think about. Personally, I feel really proud to have been part of a World Cup cycle with this team, and personally I have a lot of things to think about my future and see what’s going on.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he would keep representing Mexico]</b> I don’t know. I don’t know. I’m going to see things objectively, from my point of view, talk to my family, be honest with myself. There’s a lot to think about. I have a lot of things in my head right now. I don’t know<br /><br />You never know what can happen in the future. I’m really calm about my club situation. I’m talking about things that can happen with the national team. They’re personal things, and I have to look and be honest with myself</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Salcedo stepped in and played next to Cesar Montes with Nestor Araujo and Diego Reyes also capable of playing at center back]</b> We have to continue to play more minutes together. I don’t know if it’s going to be me, Araujo or even Hector if he comes back from the injury. At the end, we have to be focused on what we have and keep our focus on our goal to win the championship.<br /><br />That’s the goal, but I have to work for it. I think that’s the good thing Tata has made. Nobody has his spot guaranteed. I think we have to compete every day to see who’s going to be the starter. After that, with all the passion we’ve put into these last three games, we have to manage the same thing now in the official competitions</p>

  <p><b>[With Nestor Araujo and Carlos Salcedo potentially starting again, El Tri needs a dominant showing at the back to ease fears of future issues]</b> With respect to the criticism, what can I say? I take it on, but I don’t pay much attention to things that people are talking bout outside. I think if you analyze the game well, there are a lot more positive things than negative ones. Ultimately, the score is there</p>
