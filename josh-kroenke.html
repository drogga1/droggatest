  <p><b>[Arsenal actually have a very competitive wage bill but it has been poorly managed, with average players having been handed far too much over the years. That wage bill was manageable while the club were in the Champions League, but three years outside of Europe’s elite competition are now taking their toll]</b> It’s no secret that we have a Champions League wage bill on a Europa League budget right now. That’s a fact</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Kroenke issues open letter to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans amid protest campaign]</b> I’d like to start by clarifying that my family owns <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> together, and when it comes to the Club, my father and I are in constant dialogue. So when you hear from him you are hearing from me, and the other way round. So I pen this on behalf of myself, my father, my family and Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment. We know we have some of the most passionate fans in any sport, anywhere in the world. It’s part of what makes us such a special and unique Club. And while we understand, appreciate, and agree with concerns about our Club failing to achieve our goal of qualifying for the 2019-20 Champions League, we respectfully disagree about our Club being at a crossroads and that things need to change because so much change has recently occurred<br /><br /><b>[Kroenke highlighted the appointment of <a href="edu.html">Edu</a> as technical director, an appointment he describes as the ‘final piece of a very important jigsaw’ in the club’s football operational structure]</b> He <b>[Edu]</b> is first and foremost an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> man who understands the ethos of our Club and, as an Invincible, he understands the mentality required from top to bottom across the entire Club for us to return to the level at which we all expect to be competing. He joins Freddie, Per and <a href="steve-bould.html">Steve Bould</a>, all winners with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> DNA, who love our Club<br /><br /><b>[Kroenke insists KSE are ambitious and their aim is very much to win titles]</b> We want to be clear we are in sports for one reason and one reason only…to win. There is simply no better feeling in sport than winning at the highest level. We know there is a lot of hard work ahead and understand that supporters want success now. We will continue to push forward trying to balance the short and long term vision without abandoning the core principles of the Club that have sustained us for the past 133 years. We are not naive in our thinking that our ambitions can be achieved overnight, and are putting processes in place to ensure we are stacked not only with talent, but talent with the proper mentality to help us achieve our highest goals in the future</p>

There are a few things that I know our group are working on, and a few things we hopefully have on the doorstep. Nothing is ever a done deal until it’s a done deal, obviously, but we know we have key areas we want to address in our squad, both now and in the future. Our entire football operations staff have a great grasp on that and I’ve encouraged them to be as expressive as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Kroenke is delighted with the transfer business carried out by Arsenal]</b> So I think it’s important to have that type of conversation - but whether we’re going to be lauded for our efforts or perceived in a negative light, we want to be doing what we think is right for the club and I think we had a very strong summer. We addressed certain areas on the pitch for this season and in the years ahead. We had certain age profiles that we were after. Without Champions League football we weren’t exactly sure, but I encouraged our football operations department to be aggressive and when Arsenal Football Club knocks on a player’s door it’s a different knock. This summer, even though we weren’t in a position of strength coming out of Baku, I think there were a few people caught off guard that Arsenal Football Club still has the aura that it does. We’re excited to keep pushing that now and into the future<br /><br /><b>[Kroenke is adamant that a flurry of activity at Arsenal was not driven by supporter unrest]</b> I would say that if you’re reacting and doing club-record signings based on public opinion, you’re not going to go very far as a club. We weren’t reactive this summer, we were actually proactive. The transfer market is an evolving, living, breathing thing. There are certain moments in time; sometimes those moments are sooner, sometimes those moments are later in the window. We identified a few key targets, worked on those deals and over time we were able to execute them. I hope that our fans are just as excited as I am about the upcoming season, because I think we’ve got some talented new players in, at an age profile where they’re going to grow and improve on the pitch over the next eight to 10 months or so and well into the future. It’s an exciting time to be an Arsenal supporter<br /><br /><b>[The top priority at this stage is to secure a return to Champions League football]</b> Challenging for the Premier League title is always our goal, that’s what we talk about constantly. Based on the strength of our league, which is the greatest in the world, if you’re competing for the Premier League title, you’re competing elsewhere for other silverware as well - whether that’s the Premier League title, whether that’s <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, whether that’s European silverware… we want to go for it all. But we know it’s not a process that’s going to be easy and we know it’s going to require a lot of work - our work has already started and I’m thrilled to be with the group that we are, pursuing the goals that we are</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Kroenke admits There may be more departures from Arsenal this summer]</b> I would defer to our football operations staff but I know there are a few names that have come up who might not see as much playing time this season, so whether that’s via loan or permanent transfer I know there are discussions going on. I’ll leave that to our football operations staff<br /><br />That’s 100 per cent on our football operations department, but I would say whatever we’re doing we’re going to be aggressive and we’re going to be decisive, and we’re going to communicate well and honestly through it all. So from a player’s perspective, whether it’s good or bad news I think the best thing you can do is be honest with the player because they’ve only got a limited window where they can be at their physical peak. I would defer to all the <b>[football operations staff]</b> on all the contract decisions because I think they’re pretty good at it<br /><br />I think he’s doing a great job, has done a great job and is doing a great job. Turning the page from such a legendary manager and figure as Arsene - not only at Arsenal but in European football - was always going to be a difficult page to turn and as a club I think we’ve turned it as elegantly as we could. I think Unai’s daily approach is fantastic. He’s out there on the pitch, he’s working, he’s watching video, he’s communicating and his daily energy and devotion to his work is fantastic, it’s exactly what we need</p>

  <p><b>[Josh Kroenke says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have full faith in interim manager <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> and will not rush into finding a permanent replacement for Unai Emery]</b> First and foremost Freddie has <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> DNA. Obviously he was a player here for a number of years, the supporters know him very well and he’s worked diligently behind the scenes for the past several years, including the last year and a half or so with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> again. So it’s been great to have him around, he knows the club’s DNA and we feel he is the right person in the moment to take the club forward. My message to Freddie and the players was let’s get back to basics and most importantly let’s get back to having some fun. I think footballers are at their best when I see smiles on their faces and going out there and winning matches. That’s a winning formula to me<br /><br /><b>[Kroenke admitted that he regrets having to let the former <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> and <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> boss go, but did so for the good of the club]</b> Like all of our fans and supporters around the globe, we’ve been concerned about our recent string of performances. We wanted to support Unai and his staff until we decided it was time to make a change and ultimately we came to that decision over the last several weeks as a group between myself, Raul, Vinai and <a href="edu.html">Edu</a>.<br /><br />First and foremost Unai is a good man, someone that we all respect very much. His work ethic on a daily basis between him and his staff was fantastic. Ultimately we started to fall short of several goals that we set. We still feel that we can achieve those goals this season, which is why we decided to make the change now</p>
