  <p>[Coach <a href="marc-collat.html">Marc Collat</a> mainly instructs in French on the steamy morning, but there’s also a strong Haitian Creole influence. As the session ends, a number of players chat with each other in English] I know some fans question how we communicate. Some guys know Creole, some guys don’t. Some guys know French, some guys don’t. Some guys know Spanish. Some guys know Portuguese. But we’re able to bring it all together and communicate very well with each other on the field. Maybe our jokes off the field are not as good because of the language barrier, but at the end of the day we all know football. My French is not so good, but when it comes down to football, I’m quite fluent.<br /><br />Obviously the image around us has changed now. Nobody is going to be looking at us as the little country in the Caribbean any more. Now I’d like to say we’re a threat, and with the players that we have - we are</p>

  <p>[Andrew Jean-Baptiste speech was so moving for the players. Haiti’s players left NRG Stadium in a jubilant mood Saturday night after scoring three second-half goals to top Canada 3-2 and move into the Gold Cup semifinals] I pointed out that this may be a few guys’ last Gold Cup and I said I’m going to go out there and give every single thing that I can possibly give and I want my brothers to follow with me. We all do it together because our fitness coach put ‘Team’ on the board. I just kept on reiterating that we have to do this together. If we’re going to lose this game, let’s lose this game giving every single little bit that we have. That’s exactly what these guys did. We clawed and fought for it</p>
