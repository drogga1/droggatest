  <p>[Andrew Jean-Baptiste hoping for more after helping Haiti stay in Gold Cup mix] It was pretty surreal for me. When the first one happened it was kind of like, ‘Whoa!’ And when the second one happened, it being the winning goal, it was kind of like, ‘WHOOOOOOA! I had to take a step back and look at everything just, like, wow. But these things are not done without your teammates. With the players that we had, the great players that they are, some were missing on both teams, but we got the job done and that’s the most important thing. When you score goals contributing to a win, it means a lot. As a defender, I’d rather have a clean sheet and we win a 1-0 game, but that’s not to take away from a winning goal because I’ll take that as well.<br /><br />Our vice president of the federation included me as part of the core guys of this national team and going on further in the future. I mean, with that being said, when I heard him say that I had a warm feeling in my heart to be considered as a core guy for your country. I think it means a lot, it’s definitely a step forward<br /><br />For the most part, my Creole is good when we’re talking about football. That’s where my Creole is at its prime. As far as day-to-day conversations, that’s where it has limitations. I can pick up little conversation at the table with teammates and get a few chuckles but whenever they go into the full dialects back at home that’s where I’m a little bit out of it. Only in time, I’ll be a part of it. Even so, a lot of those guys speak English. That language barrier is not ever something that keeps us apart or separates us, and that’s the part I like about our team<br /><br />We easily could’ve just turned around in the 90th minute, scored an own goal and been done with it all and still qualified, but once again there’s too much respect and pride for anybody on that bench or on that coaching staff to ever accept that. When I first got there and I was talking to one of the managers, he mentioned the Caribbean rivalries that we have with Jamaica and Trinidad. In the last three matches, well, four matches now, we’ve beaten them. So an own goal, taking a loss like that? It would’ve been unacceptable<br /><br />The expectation for us, obviously has gotten higher because we made it to the Gold Cup quarters, then after that qualifying for Copa America. The results didn’t go our way in a couple of those games, but it gave our country hope and it showed that we’re able to compete. We just need to do a little bit more where we can start getting results in this tournament. You know what? The players that we had that were big time players and with the younger guys coming in, they have big shoes to fill but I feel like they’re going to fill them up pretty well. I just look forward to making as many tournaments as possible as long as I’m with this national team. I don’t want to be one of those countries that it’s a dream. It’s more something that’s expected of us</p>

  <p>[Coach <a href="marc-collat.html">Marc Collat</a> mainly instructs in French on the steamy morning, but there’s also a strong Haitian Creole influence. As the session ends, a number of players chat with each other in English] I know some fans question how we communicate. Some guys know Creole, some guys don’t. Some guys know French, some guys don’t. Some guys know Spanish. Some guys know Portuguese. But we’re able to bring it all together and communicate very well with each other on the field. Maybe our jokes off the field are not as good because of the language barrier, but at the end of the day we all know football. My French is not so good, but when it comes down to football, I’m quite fluent.<br /><br />Obviously the image around us has changed now. Nobody is going to be looking at us as the little country in the Caribbean any more. Now I’d like to say we’re a threat, and with the players that we have - we are</p>

  <p>[Andrew Jean-Baptiste speech was so moving for the players. Haiti’s players left NRG Stadium in a jubilant mood Saturday night after scoring three second-half goals to top Canada 3-2 and move into the Gold Cup semifinals] I pointed out that this may be a few guys’ last Gold Cup and I said I’m going to go out there and give every single thing that I can possibly give and I want my brothers to follow with me. We all do it together because our fitness coach put ‘Team’ on the board. I just kept on reiterating that we have to do this together. If we’re going to lose this game, let’s lose this game giving every single little bit that we have. That’s exactly what these guys did. We clawed and fought for it</p>
