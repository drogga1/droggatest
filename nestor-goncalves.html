<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Wiry and softly spoken, the Montevideo native began his football apprenticeship at Penarol at the age of 12, having caught the attention of Nestor Goncalves, son of the eponymous Manya legend and lead talent-spotter for the Uruguayan giants]</b> My first impression was the intelligence Fede had to get out of trouble, even though he was physically much smaller than the rest… that made him have to figure things out with his brain. If you don’t have that talent at that age, it is very hard to gain it later on. Fede’s playing style is very quick and intelligent. The potential he has is enormous. One characteristic of talent is adaptability and Federico grew as he became more experienced. When he left here, I told him that he wouldn’t see me again, but we would meet in the national team. And so it was.</p>
