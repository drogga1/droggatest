  <p><b>[Speaking through an interpreter, Muller recalled having played for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> against the Cosmos last year]</b> That was my only experience of American soccer. We thought we would beat them, but we never thought it would be 7‐1. After that, the Cosmos went right down in the eyes of German fans.</p>

  <p><b>[Long, long ago, before <a href="thomas-muller.html">Müller</a> finished his remarkable record of 68 goals in 62 matches for what was then West Germany, he tried to explain how he did it]</b> A voice inside my head said ‘Gerd, go this way,’ or ‘Gerd, go that way,’. So I went. The game has changed, speeded up since his time. The art of finishing remains the same.</p>
