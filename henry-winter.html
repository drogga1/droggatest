  <p><b>[On England National Team]</b> I knew England were going to screw up in the Euros. I didn’t think the manager was good enough, I didn’t think the players were good enough. The other thing is that they’re fairly exhausted when they go into tournaments. So it’s partly the quality of players, partly the quality of coaches but ultimately I think it’s psychological. There’s no reason England shouldn’t beat Iceland. But you looked at Iceland and they were just absolutely up for it. The shirt weighs heavy for England.<br /><br /><b>[Through his research he has gained an insight into the reasons why England underperform]</b> What we’ve got to do is develop more coaches, get more skills coaches into schools, sort out the academy systems and allow kids to stay longer in education. And make them a little bit more responsible about their careers off the pitch. St George’s Park is the most important building in this country. It’s the Oxford of coaching which is what we need. We need more English coaches. And if they’re not good enough then we’ve got to make them better through St George’s<br /><br />We will continue to produce fantastic, technical players. <b>[But]</b> if you don’t take responsibility off the pitch, how can you take responsibility on the pitch? There are kids in the under-15s, under-16s, under-17s, if they missed the coach in Paris or something they would be stranded. Swedish kids would go to the Embassy, sort themselves out, wouldn’t have a problem. But our kids we’ve stopped them being fighters and street-wise and that is just key<br /><br />An average 17-year-old who’s not even got anywhere near the first team in the Premier League is on £270,000 a year. That changes the dynamic with the mother and father because you cannot discipline that. Who’s the breadwinner in the family? So many things we’ve got wrong. The kids just get it too soon and it kills them. Too much too young<br /><br />I see the problems this country has got first-hand with obesity, problems in the estates. You go into state schools and the teachers don’t have the time or resources to go and teach. Also, they’ve lost so many of their facilities because they’re being sold off for housing. How much have they spent on Wembley? Three-quarters of a billion? Could you imagine if you put a 3G pitch all over the country. It’s what’s needed<br /><br />I went to see the health minister and said why don’t you take one percent of your budget, put it into state school sport and save yourself a problem in the long run. Their simple response was: ‘Why should I help my successor?’<br /><br />The system is increasingly looking at privately-educated kids because they are fitter. Isn’t that a great indictment? The England national team should be made up of hungry kids from estates. They’re hungry for the wrong stuff.<br /><br />You talk to academy coaches and if they’re getting kids at eight they’d rather take an overseas kid because he hasn’t been eating McDonald’s and drinking Coca-Cola for the last four or five years. It’s a huge problem.<br /><br />That’s a government issue as well as a football issue. There are privately-educated kids in football but, really, we need to be looking at the <b>[Wayne]</b> Rooney pathway. Rooney is the last of the street footballers because parents aren’t going to let their kids play. It’s tied up with societal problems as well as football problems<br /><br />As Nicky Butt points out, he’s got a huge problem with young Manchester United players; they’re all dislocating their shoulders. They don’t climb trees and they don’t know how to roll. He’s been bringing in parkour experts and people from circuses to teach them to fall. I would like them to play longer at their schools before they go into the system. I think if they join academies at 12 you might get a much more rounded individual and a much more rounded player<br /><br />They’re far too cossetted. It’s partly the media, it’s partly the obsession with England when we go abroad. It’s why we haven’t done anything. They are just holed up in a high-class prison when they should get out and experience it. I’ve been to Robben Island and seen the Dutch players there. John Terry - to his great credit - of the 23 that were there <b>[at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa]</b>, he went and did a private coaching session in a favela. David James got halfway up Table Mountain but the rest of them either went to play golf or went to a shopping mall. Half the players - including <b>[current England manager Gareth]</b> Southgate by the way - in 2003 turned down an invitation to fly out from Durban to Pretoria to see Nelson Mandela. Why turn that opportunity down? We’re blinkered. It’s partly because they’re scared of the media but it’s partly because they’re not plugged into the world because they’ve been plugged into football since they’re six or seven. That’s their parents’ fault, that’s football’s fault but ultimately we all have to take responsibility for our own careers - it’s their fault<br /><br /><b>[England play Scotland on Saturday in a World Cup qualifier at Hampden Park]</b> I think they’ll get out of the group. If they get to the quarter-finals that’s about par for the course of what we should be</p>

  <p><b>[Football journalist Henry Winter is interviewed in Man City’s Amazon documentary]</b> Everyone sees Guardiola as sort of creative artist, Michelangelo of the technical area. But actually, he’s a winner. Mourinho, who was a very Machiavellian individual, plays his mind games. He knew how to press Guardiola<br /><br />Guardiola doesn’t understand the concept of ‘parking the bus’. He just unleashes the Ferraris. I don’t know the plan from my opponent, but we came here today to try to win the game</p>
