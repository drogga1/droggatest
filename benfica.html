The conditions for its negotiation are public and known, taking into account the termination clause defined in the amount of 120 million euros.<br /><br /><b>[Benfica have also angrily denied reports emanating from the Portuguese media claiming that agent <a href="jorge-mendes.html">Jorge Mendes</a> would profit from the deal]</b> More serious, and that deserves our most vehement repudiation and denial, is the false news that refers to negotiations that involve commissions of 30% and which, unfortunately, was echoed in Portugal by the newspaper A Bola, with intentions and goals that we do not know at all. We repeat: this information is totally false, absurd and has clear intentions for the reputation and dignity of Benfica.</p>
