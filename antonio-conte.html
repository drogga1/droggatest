  <p><b>[Antonio Conte says Italy must become more clinical in front of goal]</b> I don’t want to speak about individuals. I think Marco is a play on whom we can rely but he must grow. Gigi made an important save for us but he’s always a guarantee. We got six points from two games <b>[after beating Malta 1-0 on Thursday]</b> but I’m a little disappointed that the result remained in the balance given we dominated the game. We deserved more goals. We have to be more clinical. We created a lot but didn’t take our chances. Anyway, there was real commitment so I’m happy.</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte insists that Daniele De Rossi is aware of his mistake after he was sent off for kicking out at Bulgaria’s Iliyan Mitsanski during Italy’s 1-0 victor]</b> Honestly I didn’t see the incident, but if he did react then obviously he was in the wrong. It’s very, very simple. I didn’t see what happened, but if he did react then he committed a mistake because he could have compromised everything and that cannot happen. Again, though, I didn’t see what happened, but I think that he knows what he did was wrong and there is very little to say about it.<br /><br />Well I think that this is a match which is fairly simple to analyse. We created many chances, but we weren’t able take advantage of them. Obviously this allowed the game to be completely open up until the end and in turn we became slightly apprehensive, because this result was very important for us … especially after what happened in the game between Norway and Croatia, with Norway winning 2-0. At the start many proclaimed ours to be an easy group, but I think they were proven wrong. Actually this might even be the hardest group there is, as Croatia - who many said was the best team in the group - is starting to realise now. So now there is still a tough road ahead of us and we will need to fight if we want to qualify, which is still anything but certain at this point</p>

I hope he’ll be able to recover for Norway.<br /><br /><b>[Conte’s current deal expires after the European Championships]</b> I’m not thinking about the contract. It’s not a priority at the moment, I’m thinking about qualifying and playing a great European Championships. I thank the President, because these are expressions of esteem, and they’re pleasing.

I am happy as we are working well and I saw a team growing, so we must continue this work. Our fitness levels were important, but we also changed on a tactical level. The squad is becoming more and more aware of its potential and that can bring us great things. My side has grown but we must continue to improve. We even changed formation today, so we’re also working on perfecting that<br /><br />We’re now focused on the Norway match. We have to make sure we don’t relax. We have to honour qualification with a great game in Rome against Norway</p>

  <p><b>[Excited Antonio Conte targets top-four Euro 2016 showing]</b> Going to the Euros will be a unique experience. I’ve been jealous of colleagues who have gone <b>[to the tournament]</b> before, but this time the pleasure will be mine. Our goal will be to finish in the top four, but it will depend on how good we are and how things fall in place. We certainly won’t start as favourites. I’ve always found it difficult to go into a competition with an idea of how far we should progress. Quality and luck usually decide.<br /><br />Verratti took a knock to his leg. If tomorrow’s game was decisive I would risk him, but we will give him a rest. He’s very devoted. Any new players coming into the squad will obviously have to prove their worth if they want to play at Euro 2016. We’ll try to use as many of the previous eleven in Rome, especially <b>[Graziano]</b> Pelle and Eder. I’m lucky to have players who believe in what we’re doing. That makes me very confident. I think Norway and Croatia will both be at Euro 2016. We know that the game will be difficult, but we’re going for a win</p>

It’s a shame about the friendly defeat against Portugal. Otherwise, we’d be taking about an unbeaten team.<br /><br />I don’t think that six months out from the Euros is the time to be speaking about it. You saw how it went with Prandelli, who renewed his contract before the World Cup and was then dismissed<br /><br />Compliments to our opponents; Norway are a good team. But we have done what we needed to do. We wouldn’t have deserved to lose. I’m happy with the intensity and the grit. We’re on the right track. We also put Norway in difficulty in the first half and we were unlucky to go behind but changing the system to a 4-2-4 during the game was planned. Knowing how to interpret various tactical situations is our strength</p>

He is a player who I hold in high regard, but I must be cold in my analysis. We will see how he is, but he will be 37 in May. I have to start to look around and consider the possibility that I can’t take him to the European Championships.<br /><br />Fiorentina being top of the table is important for Italian football. When you do things right, in every way, the results arrive. I congratulate Fiorentina and coach Paulo Sousa, although they seem less well-equipped than the usual big teams. Then there are Napoli and Roma who are doing well and Juventus and AC Milan, who are recovering. It’s a league that’s good for the supporters</p>

You change from one team to another team, and you change expactations totally. Things happen and there can be pressure. N’Golo went into the team very well and when he arrived at pre-season, he arrived later than his team-mates because he finished his holidays later. But he started very well. In the first days, you are in the market and it is right to think about what’s best for your team. It is for this reason that we bought N’Golo because last season he played a fantastic campaign with Leicester. He is showing that our choice to buy him was right. We pay him with good money and his value is good.<br /><br /><b>[On Claudio Ranieri]</b> I asked him a lot of question about the work in England, not on the life because I stay in London and it is fantastic. I only asked him about work and his work with his team, the problems that he had with his team. The conversation was very good and taught me a lot of things. It was important to understand, very quickly, the attitude in England. The habits in England, for example, the music in the changing room before the game. They eat eggs, the players. This is just an example, he taught me to understand these habits and accept these habits and focus on the more important things. The music in Italy is not in the changing room - only in the headphones. I am starting to appreciate this music</p>

For this reason, today he wasn’t available for the starting XI, for the bench or to come with the squad.

Every time Diego has played for Chelsea, he always gives his all for this shirt, for this club. This is the most important thing. I know this and I’m pleased for this. For this reason, I’m sure on Sunday that, if Diego starts the game, he’ll give his all for this club, the shirt and the fans, and do everything he can to win the game. If Diego is not concentrated and he starts the game, the fault is mine because I didn’t see it and I made my choice, and it would have been a bad choice. It wouldn’t be the player’s fault, it would be mine because, this week, I didn’t see that the player wasn’t focused or concentrating and was thinking about other situations.<br /><br />I don’t think this situation can happen.

It’s important for me to be focused on everything: on me, on the players, on the fans and on the game, because it’s a really important game for us to win. Our fans are really important, always. Because our fans are great. They push a lot when we play at home. They push a lot when we play away. And, for us, for me, they are the 12th player on the pitch.

I think that the situation can change a club-by-club <b>[on who signs the players]</b>, in Italy for example there is a sporting director to talk about the transfer market also with you and to answer these questions and for the coach. It’s easier because I understand that in England it’s a bit different and in every press conference in this period it’s normal to get this kind of question.

My hope is to have this player very quickly.<br /><br />Ross Barkley is a really good player. First of all we have the necessity to bring him in the best physical condition.

This is life. For sure he was our target but as you know this is football. We can have a lot of targets but you must be able to reach those targets. The transfer market is not simple for any club. Liverpool bought Van Dijk to reinforce his defensive line, and I think Van Dijk is a top defender. And they spent 85 million euros for this player. At the same time, they sold very well <b>[Philippe Coutinho]</b> because when you sell a player for this amount of money, and then you have the rest of money to invest and to improve your team.

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte was left fuming with the referees as Willian was not only turned down for a penalty]</b> I think that we need to improve if we want to use this new system. Today, in this game, there is a situation very clear with Willian at the start of the first period of extra-time. I think the situation was very clear. I watched it and this is a penalty. Very clear. But this is not because I’m not happy with a referee’s decision. The referee took quickly a decision to book Willian. That means you don’t have doubt. If you do this quickly, it means you don’t have doubt. Instead, I repeat, if we want to improve - it’s only to try and improve the system - we have to wait to check with the person who is watching the game and then, if this person is sure 100 per cent that it is simulation, go and book Willian. Instead, I think the person watching the game, at least you must have a doubt. There is a kick to Willian and he should call the referee and tell him. Maybe it’s a penalty, for me. In Italy, before to arrive to use this new system, they tried, tried, tried… But if you want to try quickly this new system, then you have to find the best solution.<br /><br />For me, this is not the right solution if the referee doesn’t refer a doubtful decision. The final decision stays with the referee on the pitch, not the one watching the game. But it’s only because we want to try and use this new system, and this is my opinion to help the referee use this new system. We have been using it in Italy for six months, and you can reduce a lot the referee’s mistakes. But you must be sure, 100%. And, despite this, there is another person checking the situation. If the person checking the situation calls you and says it’s a penalty, you say you made a mistake, take back the yellow card and give the penalty. I think we have to find the right solution to try to help the referee.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea don’t find it easy to compete with the likes of Manchester City and United for top players in the transfer market]</b> This question is one for the club. For sure, now there are strong, big realities and it’s not simple to fight them. But I don’t know. I’m not in condition to follow up with that. In this moment, about Ross Barkley, I think the club took a good opportunity to buy an important player, an important English player, and not spend a lot of money. Ross’ evaluation is more than £15m.<br /><br />In every sport you have to fight if you want to reach great achievements. I think in England, it’s very difficult to win the title, more than in other country. Because you start the season with six top teams trying to win the title. This is the only country where you can find this type of situation. At the same time, it’s very difficult to fight and find a place in the top four. Last season, Manchester United and Arsenal stayed out. Two seasons ago, Liverpool were out and Chelsea finished 10th. They were out. But we must be ready, we must be ready to fight for a place in the top four. It won’t be easy because every team wants to reach this target<br /><br />This target is very prestigious for every team because this competition, <b>[along with]</b> the Champions League, is the biggest in the world for clubs. We must be optimistic. There are four months to play. Good targets. We are in the semi-final of the Carabao Cup with the possibility of reaching the final, the fourth round of the FA Cup, the Champions League, and we’re fighting for a Champions League place in the league. We must be optimistic and continue to work. Our work must give us the right optimism. At this moment, Manchester City are one of those in the Champions League places. I don’t know if they’ll win the <b>[Premier League]</b> or not, but they are 12 points from the second and 20 from Arsenal<br /><br /><b>[Conte admits he’s unhappy that Pedro dived but says that he knows he has made a mistake]</b> I think, during the game, the player can be tired, a bit tired, but Pedro’s reaction was to stand up quickly. I think the player understood, at that moment, the mistake and wanted to stand up and admit it was a mistake, ‘I was a bit tired’. But, sometimes we can make mistakes. The most important thing is to try and recognise the mistake and try and avoid repeating them next time. If you see, he didn’t ask for a penalty</p>

Today I’m satisfied for the work, for Batshuayi’s job. For sure in this period it is not simple, it’s not easy for the players - especially for the players who want to go on loan. It’s not simple but at the same time in my head there is the idea to work with these players and to continue to work with all these players. As I said during the press conference, I’m very happy to work with this group of players because they show me in every moment a great commitment, they show me they want to do what they want in the game.<br /><br />Batshuayi is a Chelsea player and we are working with him very hard in the same way that we are working with <b>[Alvaro]</b> Morata, we are working with <b>[Eden]</b> Hazard, Willian and Pedro and now with <b>[Ross]</b> Barkley. For me, Michy is a Chelsea player and in my mind there is the will to continue to work with him and to try to improve. Then I don’t know if the player decides to take other solution or if he wants to play with regularity.<br /><br />You don’t know, it can happen. But at the same time in my mind there is tomorrow to continue to work with all my players and try to improve everyone. I think if you are in a team like Chelsea, before you arrive in this type of team you know you have to challenge and this is a big challenge. You find a lot of good players. Otherwise you decide to stay in a medium team or low team and probably you can play every game. But I think that every single player that decides to come to Chelsea, they must be prepared to have this type of challenge.<br /><br /><b>[Christensen could look to the man who replaced him, David Luiz, to improve his passing range]</b> I think from the start that Christensen has improved in a fantastic way. I think there is only one word, this is improvement. Work, work and work. This player - despite he is a young player, he’s only 21 years old - I think he could be come a really important defender, not just for Chelsea. The important thing is to continue to be humble, to continue with the will to improve, with the will to work, but I’m pleased with the improvement. I think he has to improve a lot with the ball. He has a lot of space for improvement, to have more personality like David Luiz. Luiz with the ball is important because he has great personality and in this way <b>[Christensen]</b> can improve a lot. He’s ready tomorrow for the training session. The referee saw the head against head, and then he saw the player touch his head, and for this reason he thought not to force but to suggest a substitution. The player didn’t agree, but I repeat when you have a player on the bench like David Luiz and you’re winning 2-0, I prefer to make the substitution. I was a simple contusion <b>[bruise]</b>, and the player is OK. If we had to play another game now, he would be ready</p>

We won the league and reached the FA Cup final, and we finished with a profit of £50m in the transfer market. In the past, this had never happened. For this reason, the situation changed. When the situation changes, you have to fight to try to give all of yourself for Chelsea. Now, for sure, United and Manchester City stay there, stay there <b>[at the top, financially]</b>. The first thing is I trust in my work. And I think that, if I stay here, for this reason, it’ll be because the club trusts in my work. And not only the money.<br /><br />You can do two types of football: only with money and you pay a lot of money and take the best players; the other way is to try and put a bit of money in and then hard work. We are in the middle. We are working and trying to do our best during the transfer market. Last season I think we did a fantastic job and did a little miracle. I repeat, this season is showing this. For me, this is already a good season. Because we are doing 120 per cent. I’m doing a fantastic job, the same as my players. It’s not important if you reach the final or win a trophy or win the league. The most important thing is to see if the coach and players are working very hard and very well. This, for me, is a successful season. I think, for sure, in this moment there are two teams in this league who are ‘top’. They stay there. The others have to fight.

If we stay with the same players from the start, it doesn’t change. One player goes out, one player comes in. One player comes in, one player goes out.

He wasn’t available against Brighton because this problem was there the day before as well <b>[regardless of his suspension]</b>. I don’t know but, for sure, he’s having this problem now. Now it’s with the medical department to try and solve this problem and give him the opportunity to have a training session without pain. But this is the real problem now. Not that he’s not scoring or that his confidence is down. For every striker, you can pass this type of moment. But the real problem now is he has to overcome this problem in his back. I hope to solve this problem very quickly because we need Alvaro. We need Alvaro’s commitment<br /><br /><b>[On Ross Barkley]</b> He’s in the squad.

It is right to dream <b>[of success]</b> and then there is the reality and you have to fight the reality to try sometimes to overcome the reality like last season and to do something special, but for sure it is not simple, not easy. I think that there are different times for every team to understand if you can go to fight for everything or go to work very hard. To dream but at the same time to be ready to fight for a place in Champions League or fight to try to reach a semi-final or a final.<br /><br />It is not simple for sure, it is not simple but people who know me very well they know that I live this job with great passion, with great love and for this reason sometimes I don’t sleep. Especially when you have to face with difficult situations and you want to try to do the best for the team, the players, the fans the club. And to play every three days, for us, it is not simple and we have to hope to have all players available. Otherwise we have to try to invent something before the game or during the game.

Then sometimes I start to work, watch the game or try to find a new solution. I think to watch the game many times is important to understand positive things and negative things and to try to improve your team especially when you lose. For me, it is very important to understand very quickly which is the reason because we lost. I think this period is very busy and it is normal to have this period especially if you go forward in every competition. Don’t forget that we missed only one game in the Carabao Cup and reached the semi-final, and if you compare to last season, we were out after only the second game against West Ham.

  <p><b>[Chelsea manager Antonio Conte says that he will not change his approach to press conferences]</b> Chelsea’s history speaks very clear. This is a great club. This is a great club. No regrets, no. I think when I take a decision, I don’t want to look behind. I want always to look at the present, to look in front of me. I think this is the best way to improve yourself, to try to find a solution, don’t try to find alibis, excuses. I think this is the right way. When you take a decision, you have to go forwards and to try to find a solution, a solution, a solution. You ask me if I had regrets, my answer is this: I think when you take a decision, you have to go straight. Because I think this is the best way to find solutions. Otherwise you continue to complain.<br /><br />You have to go straight and to try to improve your future if this is possible. Otherwise you must continue to work. I am this way, I am this way. For sure, I’m not a diplomatic man. I think you can see this. Who knows me very well, they know I’m not a diplomatic man. At the same time, I think I’m very honest and when you are honest with yourself and with others, no one thinks that I am a failure. I think this. I’m sure if I try to change myself, it’s right to stop, to stop my career when I was a footballer, to stop my career, in this moment that I’m a coach. I repeat: I think the honest person speaks very clearly in every moment. I prefer to be honest, to tell the truth in every moment. I hate the fake person.<br /><br />When I was the coach of the <b>[Italy]</b> national team, I took this decision to have international experience. I had this opportunity to have a chance in a fantastic country, in one of the best leagues, maybe the best league in the world and to face this type of situation. I’m enjoying a lot this situation, but, as you know very well, if you want an easy life, you make easy decisions. To come and to be a coach in England, now, in this league, you don’t have an easy life, because in every game you have to fight a lot. If you play in Carabao Cup, or the league, it’s the same. This league is different to the other leagues for this reason. For sure I’m enjoying a lot my time here. I’m really proud, because I think that we are doing fantastic things and I’m really proud because to work in this way you must be really proud for what we are doing, me and the players<br /><br />I don’t know. It’s very difficult to understand when there is the right time to stop. But I think that sometimes you think that you are cutting a lot of time with your family. Then on the other hand, when you are afan of your job, the football misses you. For sure, the way that I do my job, you lose a lot of energy. Also because, I repeat, I’m not a manager who stays in his office and then every three days you decide your formation, you have your staff to work on the pitch and you stay with your legs on the table to watch the TV. I’m a coach. My life is on the pitch, to try to improve my players, to try to put my idea of football on the pitch. For sure in this way you spend a lot of energy. To prepare the game every three days, you spend a lot of energy. I’m very young to decide, or to think to retire myself. I think maybe another 10 years and then I’ll start to think about this</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has praised Ross Barkley’s fitness levels after spending eight months due to undergoing on a hamstring problem]</b> No, I thought I’d find a player who was not in good physical condition. Instead, I was surprised to find a player in good physical condition. Yes, yes, a positive surprise. You saw that during the Arsenal game. He played. He was my first substitution after the Willian injury. My worry is not about his physical condition, but only to go into our idea of football, to understand the movement without the ball and with the ball. For this, he needs a bit of period to go into our idea of football. To understand this. My worry is not about his physical condition, but to get into our idea of football. Every player is desperate to play every game. I have to try to make the best decision for the team. Sometimes I’m forced to take decisions. But, I repeat, in this case I’m very happy. In my mind I thought that his physical condition was worse than the situation I found <b>[when he came]</b>. When you arrive from a bad injury and didn’t play for six months, it’s not simple to recover very well the best form. But my players are working very well and I gave him the chance in the Carabao Cup against Arsenal, maybe because I was forced to do this. In a normal situation, I’d take more time with him. But the player is working very well. The player is working to come into our idea of football. Tomorrow I don’t know, but tomorrow he could be in contention to play. For sure, we have to put a part of the risk to push the player, to push the player to come into the team quickly. Because we need to do this. When you have Morata and Willian out through injury, we don’t have many solutions. I’m very happy because the player has great potentiality, and for sure he’s changing his way to play. Now he has to think, to think with the ball and without the ball.<br /><br />There is time. But, at the same time, in every game when you decide to play for a great team, in every game you are in contention with other players. You have to try and exploit every chance you have to play and show you deserve to play. The time is right to find a place in the World Cup <b>[squad]</b>, but for sure it won’t be easy because, in the England squad, they are very strong. There are strong players in the national team<br /><br />It’s before the game against Barcelona, Hull. As you know very well, you can speak about a good draw after the game when you’ve won and you are through into the next round. Otherwise, this cup is very difficult. Every game is very tough. We have to pay great attention also in this game because we want to continue our run in this competition. For sure, this is positive. I must be honest, it’s an advantage to play at home. You saw in the past that, in the first game against Norwich, we struggled a lot and went through at home. To play at home before the Barcelona game is positive, but positive because we have a great opportunity to go through to the next round with only one game</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte believes the rumours that he will leave Chelsea in the near future have come as a result of the club’s reputation for sacking managers]</b> The players are used to this speculation. The speculation has been going on this season and many players answered this question, that we don’t want to repeat what happened in the past. But it’s normal. The history is this. We can’t change the history of the club. But don’t forget the history of this club. It’s always the same. Not only with me. Also with other coaches. I understand this, it’s normal. I don’t understand why other coaches are not under pressure after a defeat in the way that you <b>[the media]</b> are doing with me. But, I repeat, this is not a problem because I don’t read it or go online. My ambition is to have another season in England and to respect my contract, to complete this path. This is my desire. This is my ambition. Then we will see what happens. Anything can happen. But, when my contract with Chelsea has finished.<br /><br />But I think now we must be realistic and understand what our level is. Now we have to struggle to fight for a Champions League place. That is top. We must be realistic. We must be strong to accept this type of situation. Then, in the future, if there is the possibility, you have to try to buy only two or three players - not eight players. Don’t forget, this summer we brought in eight players and spent a lot less than other teams who bought only two or three. We have to build something important. To do this, you must have 15 or 16 players. In the summer we changed eight players. That means you don’t have a basis, a great foundation. We must have great patience to understand the moment. We lost strong, experienced players in the last few years, so we must have patience to understand that. We have to appreciate the moment, be realistic, create a basis and then build something important to face big challenges with the other teams<br /><br /><b>[I was]</b> not surprised. I think Arsenal bought two important players in this transfer market. For Aubameyang, they spent a lot of money, for Mkhitaryan they spent a lot, and Lacazette in the summer, too, so they have many strikers in the squad. Don’t forget that Chelsea sold Petr Cech to them. The transfer market is also about this. We sold Matic to Manchester United this season</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has asked the club to publicly deny persistent speculation about his future]</b> I must be honest, when there are these type of rumours or speculation after the first game of the season against Burnley, maybe I’d like the club to prepare a statement for me, to say they trust me in my work and my job. But, at the same time, I know this never happened in the past, so why should I hope for something different? But, for sure, I’d like to have a statement of support against this speculation. The challenge is that, in the past, this never happened. So it’s a big challenge to change the approach now. But, for sure, I’d be glad. You only have one person to speak <b>[to make this happen]</b>. I don’t want to exploit … I don’t want to be an opportunist <b>[to ask about a new deal]</b>. It’s not right, not right. It’s not the right time to be opportunistic. We have the time to make the best decision. I’m trying to … no, I’m giving all myself, me and my staff and my players, for this club. We are doing the maximum for this club. If the club understands this and the club wants to extend a new contract, we can talk. We can talk. Why not? But I repeat, I don’t like to try to push with the press for a new contract. My contract expires in 2019. My desire and my will are to continue to work with this club.<br /><br />You can see the other teams are working very hard, very strong to improve their squads. It’s not simple, not simple. I think a club like Chelsea must have more patience than other teams. For sure it would be very difficult. If you compare it to the past, the situation has totally changed. Yes. But especially for this reason, you have to understand that only through a great work, a big work, can you go and try to be closer to these teams who maybe don’t have this type of financial problems. As you can see, we are working a lot with people like <b>[Ethan]</b> Ampadu, 17, and <b>[Callum]</b> Hudson-Odoi, 17. <b>[Andreas]</b> Christensen is 21, <b>[Tiemoue]</b> Bakayoko 23, <b>[Davide]</b> Zappacosta 25. We took a lot of young players in the market and, in Christensen, we are developing a young player form the academy. In my vision, we are doing a fantastic job. Then I don’t know if, in other people’s vision, they are thinking in a different way. But in my vision, we are trying to build something important with our work; not with words, not with money.

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has once again asserted his commitment to remain Chelsea manager]</b> I think that maybe there are a lot of rumours and speculation, despite… We are doing… we are keeping our expectations. I don’t think that anyone trusted us to win the title this season. If I remember back, there were two teams fighting for the title, both from Manchester. Also last season. We started behind (them). For this reason, there are too many speculations around this club, around me, around this team. I think that, maybe, you have to find a bit more balance. I understand that we have to live with this pressure, and it’s okay for me. It’s okay for me and my players. I don’t think talking about my future can affect the players. Otherwise, from the first game we lost against Burnley, this could have happened. My players are not used to it, but they are getting used to these rumours and speculation. But, for sure, I’m very happy. I’m very happy with the commitment of my players, and the behaviour of my players. The players show me every day they want to overcome this situation. This situation, I repeat, we are talking about a team that is fourth in the league, that is preparing to face the game against Barcelona.<br /><br />We are in the FA Cup competition, and we reached the semi-finals in the Carabao Cup. Yeah, I think we understand that, when you lose two games in a row, the situation is not simple. But, maybe, we are increasing the difficulty of this team. After the summer? But… as you know very well, my contract expires in 2019. In my hand, there is the will. I know I have a contract. In my will, there is the will to stay and continue to work for this club. Yes.<br /><br />This is my opinion. At the same time, I have great respect for every opinion. If the club decides to send me away, I don’t know when, it’ll be because they’re not happy with my work. This question is about the players? I think every team tries to keep their best players. Because, for sure, if they want to try and win, the most important thing is to have good players. Top players. Especially because, now, in England, there is a lot of competition here.<br /><br />I think that, in my opinion, a manager, a coach… you continue to work with a manager or coach not because of what he achieves in one season, but because you trust in him. Then you build something with him. But it doesn’t mean you have to win something, because that’s not simple. Not easy. Especially in England, it’s not simple. But in my vision, you can win but, at the same time, the club might not be happy to stay with you. For this reason, it’s right to send the coach away. At the same time, you can trust in a coach and his work and continue with him even if you don’t win, and try and build something important. There are two ways. There is a stupid way and an intelligent way.<br /><br />I think the most important thing is to understand the situation and understand what your targets are. It’s simple. For sure, when you start a season, every team… all these six top teams want to fight for something important, for the title. Then, sometimes it can happen, like it did for us last season. Other times you have to fight for a place in the Champions League, like this season. But to try and forecast is very difficult. You have to finish this season in the right way, too</p>

But, if I have time to work with the players and you have the whole week, and you try to start the week with physical session, then in midweek I start to go on the tactical aspect and prepare the game. But I think that, usually when you work, you don’t smile. Especially if you work hard. It’s very difficult to smile. But, at the same time, you understand that only through work can you reach a fantastic target like last season. Last season, our work allowed us to reach an incredible target. They were very happy to have had three days off, to see me after three days off, yes. I think it was a great opportunity for them to spend three days with their families. For this reason, they were very happy to see me. I think we are ready. I think we are ready to face the game against West Brom, and them to play against Hull City and then Barcelona. We must be ready to play three games in eight days. We are ready, I think</p>

If a player deserves to play, and shows me during the training session that he is on top of his form, and wants to work defensively, he plays. If not, stay on the bench, stay in the stands. But this is not only for one player, but for all my players. This is what a winning mentality is. Not if one player is happy or if he is not happy if he doesn’t play. It doesn’t matter. I have to make the best decision for the team. He is playing now and I am very happy with my choice. Willian deserved to start in the previous game, and played well. I made a fantastic choice, and I want to take credit for that.<br /><br />But about this player I can talk only really well because he played with us last season. I think he was one of the key players in winning the title. Now Matic, unfortunately, is playing for Manchester United. I wish for him the best. Not on Sunday, but in the future<br /><br />I think that we have just started to play massive games, with Barcelona, now United and City, then Crystal Palace and then another important game … also Palace is an important game for us, but then there is Barcelona. We have just started to play these massive games. For sure, my hope is to have all my players available. When you have to play these massive games, you must hope to have all players available. Otherwise we are in trouble</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has revealed that his family worry about him when he tries to contain his excitement on the touchline during Chelsea]</b> My family start to worry if they don’t see me <b>[being passionate]</b>. They start to worry because it means I’m not happy. They don’t recognise me. A lot of time I start the game with this idea to try to enjoy the game, to stay sat down. To enjoy the game in this way is not the same for me. It is not the same for my players, it is not the same for the fans, or for my father. My father watched the game against Watford. He said ‘oi, I didn’t see you with the right hunger, the right passion. You finished the game with your voice. That’s not for you’. Maybe in the future when I become older, for sure, I have to try to stay more calm. To live the game more relaxed but I think also that this is my thing. To stay on the touchline and push my players, to push myself. This is the result because I won something in my life. You have to know that my first owner when I started to play football was my father. He was the owner, the coach, the kit-man, he drew the lines <b>[on the pitch]</b>. I spent my life from the start, my life on the pitch. To follow the team of my father, for this reason. I think we have to thank him for this passion that I have for this sport. I started very young. In my first season I was assistant coach. I remember in some games, I shouted more than the head coach, a lot of the time, at the end of the game I said sorry because <b>[I shouted so much]</b>. But this is my way to live the game. In the future, I hope to be more relaxed and enjoy and to sit and watch the game. I think you must have passion in every game. If you play against Barcelona or you play with a low team. It doesn’t matter, honestly I don’t think my passion against Watford was less. For sure, it was a strange night for everyone.<br /><br />I don’t think that my passion was less, my passion must always be the same way when we play against an important team or a team that’s less important. In that moment I am alone. I don’t see what happens on the other bench, I don’t see what the other manager does. In that moment I am alone. There’s the pitch, my players, the game. I don’t see what happens because my focus is only on the pitch. It is great this for me. After the game, if we win, I think there is great peace in myself. This is the moment that I find the peace completely, in my mind and body. I am tired but when we win it is the best moment for me. I enjoy that moment. I know that probably the time is two hours or three hours to enjoy this moment, especially if we play every three days, but then start to think and I prepare for another team. When we lose, I prefer to stay inside. I think after the game it is not good to speak, especially if you are angry, it is dangerous. It is very important to be calm and not be sad. Take one day, two days to recover and then restart<br /><br />I think this type of game is the perfect game for top players because they want to show something. Especially in these games. Eden Hazard is performing well. He is scoring, he can score more, he can improve things. He has the possibility to improve his level, to work very hard with and without the ball, to help his team-mates. At this level you need all players to play with the ball and without the ball, to help the team with and without the ball. I think at this point, it’s important for the coach to try to speak to improve on the pitch and during the training sessions. To have conversations about how to reach another level but it is very important, you must be yourself to have this ambition, this will to do this</p>

We are disappointed with the final result. We had a great chance to get three points against a competitor for a place in the Champions League, but in the end we are talking about another defeat.

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has fired a warning to Chelsea over the club’s ambition]</b> I have great ambition, but I don’t have money to spend for Chelsea. The club knows very well what is my idea, what is my ambition. That is very clear. That ambition must always be the same. When you decide to work with this type of coach, you must understand that you take a coach with great ambition. Not a loser but a winner. For this reason, you must understand this. I don’t know <b>[if the Chelsea board share my ambition]</b>. I don’t want to talk about this. Now it’s important the present, and staying to be focused on the present. These topics are for the future. For sure, but when you have a good manager and a lot of money to spend, probably you can have a successful season. If you have a good manager to work very well with the players, and a lot of money to spend.<br /><br />It’s very important to have the coach and the club with the same ambition: to improve the team, to improve the idea of football, to improve the quality of your players. If you find this situation, probably the season will finish with success. You can win the league, the cup, the cup and league, the Champions League. You start the season trying to do your best. I think we are doing our best. We are trying to do everything for this club. We are continuing to do this. But this league is very tough and will be very tough especially in the future, because there are a lot of teams improving in a fantastic way. We have to know this and accept this and find a new solution for the future.<br /><br />I have great admiration for Pep. Pep showed himself to be a great coach. I think that, now, it will be very difficult for other teams to fight Manchester City. When you have a great coach and the possibility to spend a lot of money and keep happy your coach and your staff, it’s difficult for the others. Very difficult. This is not the first time I’m telling this. This is a great danger for the panoramic of the other teams. For a long time. The situation is going to improve. Not to stop, but to improve for them. I think that last season we did a fantastic job. We were a great surprise for the league, but also for our competitors. Our competitors didn’t rate Chelsea in this way to fight for the title, to win the title. But then, when you start, you have to continue to build something important with the coach<br /><br />I think that the players and I, and the club, we must be happy not to fight for the title, or to fight for something important. Because the league finished after the first part of the season. The league finished this season. Manchester City won it in the first part of the season. This must be a great frustration for me, for my players, for my club. If your name is Chelsea, you have to try to fight until the end. For this reason, we must have great frustration for this</p>

I have great admiration because they found the right way to be strong for a long time, to have successful seasons for a long time, from now until I don’t know. There is a great coach, great players. And then there is the possibility to spend a lot of money and have the same ambition of the coach. This is the fantastic result for Manchester City. Manchester City is not the only club to spend a lot of money. The way they are spending money, especially the way I think the club is making Pep happy during the transfer market, to take the best choices for the coach, for the manager. There is only one situation very clear, that Manchester City will be stronger next season. Do you think it could be enough, to win again the title? <b>[To not qualify for Europe?]</b> If you think this, I think you are a dreamer.<br /><br /><b>[When asked his opinion on whether Chelsea spend money as well as City do in the transfer market]</b> I don’t know. I didn’t spend money. The club spent money. I have great respect for every club to spend money. The decision with the money is for the clubs.<br /><br />When I arrived here the club didn’t play the Champions League, Europa League, if you remember two years ago and life goes on. I think we have to continue to put all of ourselves in this effort. This will be an important effort from now until the end to try to find a place in the Champions League. Don’t forget we have to play against Crystal Palace before Barcelona and then we have to play Leicester. For sure, it’s a moment that is very crucial for us.

At the same time, when you’re arriving from a bad injury after a long period when you didn’t play, the risk to have little injuries is easier than another player. Ross is a young player, he’s a really good guy, he’s a good player. Now he has to put all of himself to try to recover in time and show he deserves a place to play in the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has no regrets over his use of Eden Hazard]</b> If I think it’s right for the team to play this way, it’s OK. Otherwise I can take another decision and play with a striker. Maybe I can take different decisions. There are three players for two places. One has to go on the bench. Then I have to decide who has to go on the bench. For sure, <b>[Giroud]</b> is ready. He has specific characteristics, Olivier. He’s a strong player and has a lot of physicality. I think that, in some games, it’s right to start with him. In other games, it’s right to start with Morata. In others, it’s right to continue with Hazard as a No.9. Olivier, he played against West Brom from the start, and played against Hull, and then came on in every game, I think. But he’s ready to play. But I repeat, I don’t like to speak to the press what happens with one player, with two players, with the team.<br /><br />I like to talk with the players face to face, or in meetings with all the players<br /><br />The tactics were the same against Barcelona. Defensively, we were very good in both games. If you look at the stats, we conceded only two shots to Manchester City: one they scored, and another after a free-kick and <b>[Cesar Azpilicueta]</b> saved it on the line. I don’t see a lot of shots on goal from Manchester City, and this is very strange. Usually when you play against Manchester City they shoot about 20 or 25 times every game. For sure, compare that with the Barcelona game, I think we were not so good in ball possession. We missed a lot of last passes. And, for sure, we have to improve. We have to improve in personality, especially when there is a lot of pressure from our opponent. But the tactics were the same against Barcelona and, against Barcelona, I didn’t hear anyone complaining. But, I repeat, we have to improve. We have to improve, especially with the ball<br /><br />We played a game, a massive game against Parma when they were first and we were second. We won 3-1. After the game, there was an international break. During the international break <b>[I gave]</b> an interview. The journalists asked me if I was happy with the team and with this important win. My stupid answer was, ‘We are winning, but I’m not happy because I’m not enjoying the role the coach decided to give me’. When I came back to Turin, it was a meeting with Lippi and all the players and he killed me. He killed me in a bad way, not in a soft way, in front of the players. After training, the club called me. They killed me another time and gave me a big, big fine. And then, in the next game, I didn’t play. I was on the bench against Piacenza. He told me it was a lack of respect for my team-mates, first of all, and then for him, the club and the fans. He killed me. But I took this experience to heart and, after that, I improved a lot. Not to be selfish. I started to think for the team. I became a captain of the team after that<br /><br />You can check. That’s in the past. This is a funny story. No, I think there are different situations <b>[between me at Juventus and Hazard]</b>. I don’t think this is the same situation. When we are players, the risk of making a lot of mistakes, it’s enormous. It’s big. The players, it’s normal… When I was a player, until one point of my career, I was selfish. Because you think about yourself if you play. If you don’t play, you’re unhappy. You don’t think about the team. When you arrive at that point in your career, though, you start to have your mind more open, to be less selfish, and to start to think for the benefit and best of the team, and not only for yourself. I’m talking about my experience - not the others. This is the best way. I’m saying that I was selfish until one point in my career, and then I became a team player with my mind</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte believes it is harder to win trophies in England than in other top leagues around Europe]</b> I think that every manager wants to win a trophy. I must be honest, if you want to win trophies, maybe for important managers, it’s easier to go to another country - if you want to win easy trophies. In England, if you stay here, never, never will it be easy to win trophies. I think there is the club who judges the work of the manager. But, for sure, every manager wants to try and win a trophy. But, I think that every important manager wants to finish the season with a trophy. This is the truth. We work very hard to try and reach this target, but not only for myself: for the players, for the club, for our fans. When you are the coach in an important team, the target must be this. For sure, to reach this target, you need to have the possibility to reach this target in every season<br /><br />I must be honest, I consider Mauricio Pochettino a really good manager. I think that, if Tottenham grew a lot in this period, he deserves a lot of credit for that. Don’t forget that only one team can win the title and, in England, it’s not simple. You start every competition with six teams, six top teams who are ready to win something during the season. For example, last season Chelsea won the title, Manchester United won the Carabao Cup and Arsenal won the FA Cup. This season, probably Manchester City will win the title, but they dropped in the FA Cup. It’s not simple. We are talking about a team who, in the last period for many years now, they are competing to win the title. Don’t forget that two years ago they were very close to winning the title when Leicester won it. Last season they tried to compete with us. Don’t forget that our final of the season was incredible. We won 10 games - otherwise Tottenham were ready to win it<br /><br /><b>[Conte denied that Morata had lacked competition]</b> I think the problem wasn’t the competition. I don’t think this was the problem. I must be honest: For sure, now, there are two strong possibilities, and I have to make the best decision. I’m very happy that, in the last game, Alvaro scored an important goal for us and for him. Now I’m waiting for a great final <b>[part]</b> of the season from Alvaro, from Olivier, but especially for the team. <b>[Morata]</b> had this problem in his back. If you remember, it was a serious problem because… I don’t know the real problem. If you remember, I said I didn’t know the time of his recovery - one day, one month, if the season had finished. He solved the problem and our medical department was very good to put him in the best physical condition to solve this problem. I think, at the start of this period, he continued to feel a bit of pain in his back. But now he’s ready, totally fit. For sure, when a striker is not scoring, the confidence can go down. For the strikers, the goals are of vital importance: for himself, for his confidence. But no, I repeat, I saw him very well in this period. I think it has been an important period for him. He needed to rest and then to have hard sessions of work to find his best physical condition for the final part of the season</p>

We have a different job. For us, it is not sure. You can have a contract but you don’t know what will happen after one or two games. We depend a lot on the result. Last season we were very good to have another target, the possibility of winning the league after a 10th place finish. This season we are aiming for another target, to try to get a place in the Champions League, then to try and reach again the final of the FA Cup and win that trophy. The mentality must always be the same to get three points in every game. It will be important for us to try to get three points. We are having the season we deserve, last season we were very good to have this target but maybe it was a fantastic season for us. In this season, we deserve to play for another target but, for sure, everyone is trying to do our best to get the best target possible for us. I want to do this.<br /><br />Zappacosta is a clear example for this type of situation. We are talking about a young player, a player who is in the first season to play Champions League, and maybe international games. But I think in this team there are many good players, for example, Emerson Palmieri. He’s a young player who is a really good prospect but he needs to improve in many aspects. Andreas Christensen is another, Tiemoue Bakayoko, 23-years-old. We have a lot of young players who need experience and need to improve, not only on the pitch, but charisma and personality. You can do this only if you play important games</p>

When you win, you don’t see the real problems. I think that when you don’t win, you have a lot of strength to try to change your situation, to try to have a good answer. During a defeat it makes you stronger than weaker. I think now is not the right moment to speak about this topic <b>[plans for next season]</b>. The most important thing for us is to finish the season in the best possible way. To focus on the present and to go game-by-game. Then, if we arrive at the right moment, we will speak about the future<br /><br />I think Manchester City have created a fantastic path to the league. They won the Carabao Cup. In the FA Cup, they were eliminated. Now they are in another competition, in the Champions League. I think every team has to understand what is your target before the season starts, which is your target that makes you happy about your season. Then to understand at the end of the season whether you reach your target or not. The table is showing that now there’s a great gap with Manchester City. To speak about the gap between us and Manchester City now is not right. The most important thing for us is to focus on ourselves and finish the season in the best possible way. That must be our focus. Then we arrive in the right moment to think about the way we can work to reduce this gap. We have to try to do our best in every game. We have to look forward but at the same time, we have to look behind <b>[at Arsenal]</b>. The only thing we can do is to try to do everything in every game - to show great desire, to show great pride to finish the season in the best position in the table</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has denied that his players are struggling for motivation with a top four finish looking unlikely]</b> I think that I can’t accept these comments because I think that I was a player and that the player must play every game, not for me, but for the club and fans. They must have great respect for this badge, they don’t have to play for the coach, they have to play for the club and for our fans. To show great character, like today. This is the best possible way for a player to show that he is a fantastic professional. Now, the most important thing is that my players, they have had this reaction, it doesn’t matter if the coach speaks at half-time or says anything <b>[at all]</b>.<br /><br />I think the most important thing is that in the second half, I saw the right reaction of all my players. I think you have to play to try to win because we work very hard every day. I work very hard, my staff work very hard and my players work very hard. Especially in this type of situation when there is a great difficulty, you must show that you are a man rather than just a player. I think this happened in the second half.<br /><br />Yes <b>[it was the biggest difference that I have seen at Chelsea]</b>. For sure, in the first half I was very disappointed for the way we were playing. For the spirit that we were showing during the game. I said in the second half that we must be pleased because I saw the right fire and desire in my players. I saw the right will to comeback and find a difficult result because when you are 2-0 down it is not simple. We must be pleased and as I said before a lot of times, we have to try to finish this season in the best possible way. In every game, we have to show great enthusiasm, great passion, great spirit and great desire to try to fight for these colours, this team and our fans. We must show this in every game and today, I think that in the first half we didn’t do this and I am the first person to take the responsibility for this, because I am the coach of this team. In the second half, we must be pleased because we have had a great reaction and I hope from now until the end of the season to see this fire in the eyes of my players.I think that it is not a problem about the formation or about my choices in the starting eleven. It is important that in every game to have the right passion, enthusiasm and spirit. The most important thing is this. I think the coach has to transfer this to the players. When you are not able to do this, it means you have to take responsibility<br /><br /><b>[On Antonio Rudiger]</b> No, I think it was a tactical decision today about Rudiger</p>

  <p><b>[Conte has been impressed with Sean Dyche’s leadership]</b> He <b>[Dyche]</b> is doing an important job. I think that he is doing a great job in this season, but I think if you start the season to fight to avoid the relegation zone, it is more simple. It is more simple. Also if you have a small budget, because you count on a team that you <b>[worked with]</b> in the past. You then reach the qualification to play again in the Europa League. It is more difficult when you have to prepare the transfer market to win something, because only one team wins. The others must watch the other team win. I think it is more simple because you have to avoid the last three places at the bottom.<br /><br />Then you can stay between 10 teams that can play only for this target. And then, I repeat, if you have a good base and in the previous season you played very well, you can count on these players. You have to fight only to avoid this. It is difficult if you have to play to win because only one team wins and the other don’t win. Then you <b>[the journalists]</b> are the first to speak about a failed season, if you don’t win the FA Cup, the league, Carabao Cup, it is a failed season and for this reason it is more difficult to play for this target. In my life, my career I fought to avoid the relegation zone. I didn’t start with Juventus, I started with Arezzo, the bottom. It is not important <b>[what I think about Chelsea’s season]</b>. We have to finish our season, our job and then there <b>[are people]</b> who has to judge if the season is a failure or not. This is not my job.<br /><br />I didn’t read the team. Usually you have to wait to finish the season and then do this because with five games to go, to prepare this, I think it is not fair. I think in this formation, you have to consider all the players from the whole <b>[league]</b>, not only the best teams. As you said before, for sure there are Burnley players that deserve to stay in this top team. I don’t know if they picked Burnley’s players or not. <b>[They made]</b> two mistakes, <b>[doing this]</b> before you finish the season. You have to wait to finish the season to pick the best 11 players and then you must involve the players of the whole league. If Burnley stay in this position, it means the players of the whole team, many players, are performing very well and they deserve to stay in the top 11.<br /><br /><b>[3-2 defeat to Dyche’s side remains in his thoughts]</b> I remember very well that game. If you remember after 10-15 minutes, we got a red card for <b>[Gary]</b> Cahill. We started to play this game with a guy <b>[Jeremie Boga]</b> that was then sent on loan in the Championship. We went 3-0 down then came back to 3-2, it was a strange game. They deserved to win. It was important to improve their confidence but they showed during the season that to play against Burnley is very tough, not simple</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte says he envisaged becoming Arsene Wenger-like figure]</b> When you start to work for a new club, for sure your hope is to stay for many years because you bring your culture, you bring your football, you bring your methodology and your mentality. Sometimes this is possible because you find the right situation. Sometimes this is not possible. But we must be ready, for every coach, every experience you start in your mind, there is the hope to stay for many years. You have to know that, every time you change and go to another team, you have to restart. You have to restart your work and bringing your ideas, your football, your culture, your methodology. And to restart every time is very difficult. Football is changing. If you compare this football with the past, it’s totally different.<br /><br />In England, for example, in the past the managers could stay here and work for the same club for many years.When you know this and have this possibility, you live football and you stay more relaxed because you know you have time to work, to show the importance of your work. In the present, football is not the same like in the past. In England, you can see this difference. Now every club is ready to change manager if you don’t get results, if you don’t win. I think to live football in this way, your career could be less long because you live football with more pressure than in the past.<br /><br />I’m enjoying having this experience. For me and for every coach who has the possibility to work in another country, it’s a great opportunity. But, at the same time, I can tell you that it’s not simple to work in a different country because you have to understand quickly and to adapt yourself to life in the new country. In Italy, we have different habits and a different culture. Different ways to have the training sessions. I’m enjoying <b>[life in England]</b> a lot but, at the same time, it’s not easy. It’s not simple to go into another country and bring your idea of football, especially if you have an idea of football. If you want to manage the situation, manage the players, it’s more simple for everyone. But if you want to bring your idea of football, it’s not simple to go into another country<br /><br /><b>[Conte believes such difficulties can forge a better manager]</b> I consider this experience fantastic for me, and now I’m stronger than before I was when I started this experience. I’m stronger as a coach and stronger as a manager than I was at Juventus and with Italy</p>

Don’t forget that the first 100 games with Mourinho were many years ago. Now it’s not simple, I think, to have this type of results in this moment, in this present Chelsea.

Only for this <b>[reason]</b>.<br /><br />I think there are different eras. I have to consider this. I won a title with Juventus after two seventh places. When you win a title in this way, it’s a great, great achievement. Not a simple achievement. Last season we won a title after a 10th place. When you win a title in this way, it means it’s a great, great achievement. Not a simple achievement, only because your name is Chelsea and it’s normal because, in the past, you won many titles.

  <p><b>[FA Cup much more difficult for Chelsea this season]</b> I must be honest and I think that last season we missed a great chance to win the FA Cup and, also in the Community Shield this season, we missed a great chance. This season, I think that if you can win against Southampton and to reach the final it will be more difficult against Tottenham or Manchester United. Last season, we were in the best condition to win the FA Cup and I think we missed that chance last season and it was our fault. I remember that some refereeing decisions weren’t good. The first goal that they scored with Alexis Sanchez was handball. Then we finished the game with 10 men. Despite this we managed to draw level but we conceded a goal at the last moment because of our mistake. Last season Arsenal did a great job to win the FA Cup. For sure, <b>[Arsene Wenger]</b> has a great capacity to prepare his team. His career speaks very clearly. You can win only once because you are lucky, but if you win many times then that means you are a winning man. When you are a winning man, you transfer your winning mentality to your team.<br /><br />Last season, I repeat, the final of the FA Cup, we could have done better. We had a great chance to win the FA Cup because in that moment we were stronger than them. This season it will be more difficult. You have to know that I play only to win. I don’t play to enjoy. I play only to win. I try to transfer this mentality to my player. Every season I start with only one idea in my mind. <b>[Even]</b> if you know that maybe it will be impossible to win something during the season. In my mind, heart and soul there is always this mentality and I try to transfer this mentality to my players. If I win something, I did my job, not something special. When I don’t win, I am very angry with myself but at the same time I am ready to work harder to try to win something in my next chance<br /><br />I think if the team that played the first half and part of the second half plays then we must be concerned. Really concerned. If we go to play with the right team spirit like against Burnley or in the last 30 minutes of Southampton’s game, I think we have the possibility to reach the final. My players have to know this, my players have to know that this is the way we have to follow. I think there is only one way. To go to the pitch with the fire in our eyes and to reach this final and have the crowd with us. We must give them the best satisfaction. It is a semi-final against a team that, for me, I am very surprised to see them in this position in the table. They are fighting to avoid relegation and despite this, I think they have good players, talented players. Don’t forget, only one week ago, we were losing 2-0 after 60 minutes. I think that the last game showed it will be very important to approach this right, for our future in this competition<br /><br />With Juventus, we did the same in my first season. To win a title without losing is not simple. I think it is an incredible achievement. I remember that season. When we talk about Arsene Wenger, we have to remember the whole story and for that reason we have to show great respect. We must pay him a great tribute because we are talking about a really important manager, one of the best managers in the world, along with Sir Alex Ferguson. Especially for this country. I remember everything. I think when you have that type of season and your confidence is very strong, you feel it is very difficult for teams to beat you. You become invincible in your mind. You start the game and you know in your heart and soul that it will be very difficult for your opponent to beat you</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has denied that his rift with Jose Mourinho is ongoing after Chelsea booked an FA Cup final date with Manchester United]</b> With Jose, we have clarified the situation. This is the most important thing. There is not a problem between him and I. I think this final is a game between two great teams: Manchester United and Chelsea. For sure, in my mind, I can tell you that we played last season in the final and arrived as favourites against Arsenal. This season, we are arriving not as favourites. But, as you know very well, we lost the final despite being favourites in my mind. We are talking about two managers with strong characters, and two winners. When in your mind and your heart and your blood there is the will to win, for sure, we want to try to win this trophy. The same way Manchester United want to do this<br /><br /><b>[On Olivier Giroud]</b> He has been a good signing for us. As you know very well, I needed a player with this characteristic: strong physically, to hold the ball up and allow our No. 10 to make combinations with him. Morata is an important striker. I think he’s younger than Olivier. He has less experience. He is less strong physically but, at the same time, is very fast to act on the space. I’m pleased for both, for both, because in the last game against Burnley we started the game with both players and they showed a great link-up. I’m very pleased to see that, because I have another option now. Another card in my hand during the game. Today I decided to start with Olivier because I knew we had to play against the three central defenders, very strong physically, so I decided to start with Olivier. But when Morata came on, the impact was impressive. In the same way as Pedro’s impact, which was important. And also <b>[Tiemoue]</b> Bakayoko.</p>

Cahill deserves to be <b>[at the World Cup]</b>, because he’s playing well. He’s in good physical condition. We’re talking about an important player with great experience - he’s played in big competitions.

He has to make the best choices for the national team and I’m sure he’ll make the right decision<br /><br /><b>[They face Swansea City on Saturday evening]</b> It won’t be easy. The only way for us to have a hope of a place in the Champions League is to take three points from every game. Tottenham are a really good team. I like the way they play - and it can happen, to have bad results for a short period. But they have played <b>[Manchester]</b> City and United in the last three games, and drew at Brighton. It will be very difficult, but we have to push and try to put a bit of pressure on. The only way to do this is to win at Swansea tomorrow.

I think then there are, for sure, other situations that we have to improve, but <b>[against Swansea]</b> I think we had good balance with the three midfielders. We were very dangerous offensively with Hazard, Giroud and the penetration from midfield. In fact, Fabregas scored from midfield. I repeat, it is very important for us to try and do our best until the end. The situation is not in our hands about our place in the Champions League, but if we want to keep the pressure on and keep the hope alive, then we have to try to get three points in every game. In the next game we will play against Liverpool. As you know very well, if you want to win, you have to score. In this season I think we dropped many points. I remember, for example, in the last game against West Ham, we dropped two points that were of vital importance for us. We dominated the game and created I don’t know how many chances to score and we kept the result at only 1-0. In the end, they scored and drew and bye-bye. For sure, the only is way to put a little bit of pressure on the teams that stay ahead of us to win because, if we hadn’t got three points then I think that the situation for the Champions League would end.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about how he sees the January signing’s partnership with Hazard after they started against Swansea]</b><br /><br />I think that they played a really good game. They showed a good link between them. I am very pleased for their performance. Not only of those two players but for the team. It wasn’t easy to get three points against Swansea because I think they are in a good run of form, especially at home. In the last five games, they won four games and they drew only one game. We must be happy also because we kept a clean sheet for the second time in a row. These are positive things but we have to try to continue until the end to try to do our best and then at the end of the season what will happen, will happen<br /><br /><b>[Conte refused to be drawn on whether it would be better for the Reds to win or lose their huge match at the Stadio Olimpico AS Roma]</b> I think that for me it is very difficult to say something about this game because I am an Italian.

You can see that he’s present during the game. He wants to help his players during the game. You can see that he’s always present, in a positive or negative situation, so I have great respect for him. But every coach has his own style to follow the game. Every coach wants to try to pick the best situation to follow his team. Fans like it. But you must do this because you are this way. In the past, in the present, in the future. Not only because the fans like this situation. You must be natural to show who you are. It’s important not to change your behaviour or your characteristics, otherwise you are a fake person.<br /><br />I think that, in the league, you have 38 games to show you deserve to win the league. To show you are the best during the season. In the Champions League, when you reach the last 16 or quarter-finals or semi-finals, one situation - positive or negative - can change your future in this competition. For this reason, I think that to win the Champions League you must be luckier. You must be good to deserve it, but at the same time you must be lucky. One referee’s decision can settle your future totally. In the league, over 38 games, usually the team who deserves to win it wins it. Luck is always important in every competition, but when you have the possibility to play 38 games you can show you are the best. In a little tournament, like the FA Cup or Carabao or Champions League or Europa League, sometimes one decision can move your future. Sometimes you are lucky or you are unlucky.

But it’s a pity because, also today, I saw a fantastic commitment from my players. They tried to get three points but they weren’t able to score one goal more than our opponent. Football is simple: if you want to win, you have to score one goal more than your opponent. We weren’t able to do this. Again.</p>

For this reason, I’ll try and make the best decision, also for the game against Newcastle. I want to win and try and get the three points, to continue to have the possibility <b>[of getting into the top four]</b>. If someone falls asleep in the last game, you must be ready. So, every decision I make will be to try and win. Probably I can change something, but not because I’m thinking about the FA Cup final.

Maybe we missed the Champions League this season because we tried to play very open and in this moment you can’t do this especially with a strong team because to concede three goals in seven games it means you don’t have stability. A great team doesn’t concede three goals or four goals against Watford. Then, against Manchester United, it was the only way, the only way to lift a trophy. Now we are in this moment and if you want to change then we can change our idea, but you must change many players.

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boss Antonio Conte has described <a href="n-golo-kante.html">N’Golo Kante</a> as one of the best players he has ever coached]</b> In my opinion, he can play in every position in midfield. We are talking about an amazing player, a top player. He is amazing with and without the ball. When you have N’Golo in your team, you can think you are playing with one player more. You can find a smile on his face every day. He is a very positive guy. He is one of the best players I have had in my career as a coach<br /><br />Generally to be the manager of a top club is not easy. Because when you are in a top club the demands are very high. You must win to keep your job. My experience at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> was amazing. I have great memories about the relationships with the players, fans and also the club. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is one of the best teams in England in the last 10-15 years. They won a lot of trophies. It is normal when you arrive at such a club that the demands are high but it is normal for a top club</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boss Antonio Conte says <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> can be one of the best managers in the world]</b> I think he is doing a really good job, Frank. This is his second experience after <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> so to be the coach of a top team is not easy. I think he has the skills and ability to become one of the best managers in the world. He has to continue to work in this way and I wish him the best for the future<br /><br />I think it was a crucial moment for me and for my team. We lost against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> but in the previous game we lost also against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Usually when you are in a top club and you have two defeats in a row it is not an easy moment for you and the club. But it was a crucial moment because I decided to change system and play with a 3-4-3 or 3-4-2-1 with <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>, <a href="willian.html">Willian</a> or <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> behind <a href="diego-costa.html">Diego Costa</a>, and three at the back. I think it was an important moment and we put the pace in for our title in at that moment. The coach must be a tailor and try to find the right suit for your team. After two months working with the players I decided to change formation and to put them in the best situation to exploit their quality. I think I did this and for that reason we won the title and reached the final in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte felt Inter deserved to reach the Coppa Italia final]</b> Looking at both matches, we deserved much more. In terms of the performance, I have very little to reproach the boys about. This is the football we want to play; we created a lot and were aggressive. Maybe we should have been more clinical in front of goal, but <a href="david-ospina.html">Ospina</a> performed miracles. Their goal was disappointing because it was a careless situation that we could have avoided. But I’m satisfied because we’re on the right path, we controlled the game against a strong <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> team. My glass is half-full. We created numerous opportunities and had 18 efforts at goal. <a href="david-ospina.html">Ospina</a> was the best player on the pitch. Obviously, we can improve, and we need to be more ruthless in the future, but I don’t have anything to complain about in terms of desire and determination. We did what we’d worked on in training. It’s disappointing for the lads not to qualify for the final because, based on what we did over the 180 minutes, we deserved to do so</p>

Then, there are 12 league games to play. Personally, I don’t think the gap is that massive. I have positive feelings. But naturally I need to see the response in matches.

  <p><b>[Conte was frustrated that his team did not put the game to bed earlier]</b> When you have the opportunity, you have to kill the opponent. Just look at the game with Napoli: you have the opportunity to win it, it ends 1-1 and you are criticised. Today you had to be bad, determined, cynical…otherwise you get in trouble. It’s not that you suffer, but you go from the possible 3-0 to 2-1, knowing that the game is as vital as they will all be from here to the end</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has stressed that Inter are still in the hunt for the Scudetto]</b> This evening, we had no choice but to get the victory so we could close the gap to six points. We fuel the hope that we can achieve something extraordinary. It’s true that we could’ve sealed it earlier by making more of our chances, but instead we conceded at the first Samp attempt and got a little anxious. It was a good performance, anyway. I repeat, it’s not a fitness issue, but when we have scoring opportunities and do not take them, which also happened in the Coppa Italia with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, all it takes is one lucky ricochet and it’s all up for grabs again. I hope these games will help us realise we must kill - in a sporting sense - the opponent and kill the game when we have the chance<br /><br /><b>[Inter next meet Sassuolo on Wednesday and Conte stressed his side can’t afford to take any game lightly]</b> We’re six points off the top with 12 rounds to go. There’s no margin for error, whereas <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> can have the odd mistake and get away with it. This is why need that ferocity in front of goal, because with a strong lead, we can then relax on the ball.</p>

  <p><b>[Inter coach Conte banned for one match after fifth yellow card]</b> I think we deserved much more considering how much we created, whereas I don’t recall any Samir Handanovic saves. It’s something we keep repeating in this pattern and are paying a heavy price. I am very disappointed and so are the lads. When you play this type of game and put so much into it, you have the chance to win despite the difficulties in the key area of midfield, you have to take home the three points. We didn’t do that, it’s disappointing and troubling. We had the chances to finish it and we didn’t. I don’t know what more we can do other than keep working. I am happy with the performance, we’ve got to be more careful on the details. That is where we can grow and improve</p>
