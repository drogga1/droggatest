And <a href="asmir-begovic.html">Begovic</a> for me will stay. I understand all the players but I think it’s important also for the player to understand me and the club. Now it is very difficult because not one club is able to sell you a good player. We are open to help him if there is the opportunity to replace him in the best way. If it is not possible then <a href="asmir-begovic.html">Begovic</a> will stay with us. At the end of the season we will evaluate the situation in the best way. I don’t know about a lot of names that I read. For sure there is this situation and Bournemouth asked about him but he is <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s player and I am very happy for him to stay in the squad, His commitment, his behaviour outside of the pitch. He is very important in the changing room. Only if we can have a good substitution can he go<br /><br /><b>[Defender <a href="branislav-ivanovic.html">Branislav Ivanovic</a> is another to be linked with a move but Conte would not be drawn on his future]</b> I don’t know. For sure this is a particular month because there is this window. There are a lot of speculations. There are a lot of lies but there is also truth in some situations. I don’t know what will happen at the end of this window. The club knows my thoughts about this. If we stay with these players, I am very happy too. I think that we have to improve our squad in <b>[terms of]</b> the number of players because in some roles we are short with a few players. If that happens I am very happy. If it doesn’t happen we will continue in this way<br /><br /><b>[He could not, however, confirm whether Kenedy or Charly Musonda will be allowed out on loan]</b> I’ve read a lot of good names in the newspaper, yes. I think that sometimes you know more than me about this! I have confidence in my players. I don’t know if we will sign new players I must be honest. For sure, if Kenedy and Musonda play only one second they must stay with us for the rest of the season. The players know this, the club and me know this. But I think that they are two young players with good prospects. They have a good will to fight and to try to improve and work. If we take this decision to stay here I think that the players will be very happy and the club and I the same. For this season, Ruben and Chalobah, for sure they continue to stay with us for the rest of the season. We will continue in this way to try to develop our players, like Musonda, Kenedy and <b>[Nathan]</b> Ake</p>

When this type of situation happens I am a 47-year-old, a former player, and a coach. You think - for sure, this could happen to me. You think about this, and you hope that this situation never happens to someone. But when it happens, you reflect a lot about life. And sometimes you think <b>[you should]</b> live the life more, and not sometimes be angry for stupid problems. Because you don’t know if the day after you’ll be here, or another place.

There is a great tradition in this competition and we want to respect this. But I think also when there is a clash with a game you have to play in the league this situation is very clear for us, we are in trouble to face this situation. I have to take the best decision, to find the right balance.<br /><br />We have to enjoy this moment, because this moment is great for everyone. For me, in my first season, and for my players because they worked a lot to arrive at this point. I think we have to enjoy this moment, to help each other, and to live with joy because if we think of where we started this season, I think every one of us would have signed up to have the situation we face now<br /><br /><b>[Conte dismissed <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s suggestion that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s gilded recent history and current league leadership make them heavy favourites for the game as an excuse]</b> I think that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> must be considered at the top, because they are now a really great power in English football. They have been working three years and I think it’s the right moment not to consider them underdogs and have this excuse. They are a great team and for the second year they are fighting for the title. Last year they missed this, this year they are trying again, and I think in the future they will fight every year for the title because they are full of strong players and they are building something important</p>

I don’t smoke, but tomorrow I’m hoping to smoke a cigar if we win. I’m ready to do this<br /><br />But I can tell you that, to celebrate the win, the moment of the celebration is less. The low from a defeat is longer than the high after a win.<br /><br />At the moment, my situation is very clear. I have two more years’ contract with the club. Then, if the club give me the possibility to stay here and to extend my contract, for sure I am available to do this. But we have the same idea about the future. The way we have to do things together, to improve the squad and the team. But, I repeat, I’m happy for this season and am happy to stay here. I hope to stay here for many years.<br /><br /><b>[As ever, Conte draws inspiration from the bad moments to deliver the good times - the 3-0 defeat at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in September which triggered a major tactical rethink]</b> In my career, I had tough moments, at Arezzo in my first role. I started my career with a team in the lower divisions. But, for sure, when you arrive at a new club like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and the level of expectation is so high, you have to be ready to face this moment.<br /><br />I think, at this moment, you see the real value of the coach. In these moments you can appreciate the reaction of the coach, if the coach is able to understand the moment and find a solution to completely change the season. But, honestly, I was always very calm. I knew that I was putting all of myself, all my strength, into this new job. Myself and my staff were working so hard for the club and the players. Anything can happen in a season, but the most important thing is your soul, your heart, are calm.</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte says he found it easy to accept the role as Intermilan coach]</b> It was easy to choose Inter. We found ourselves having the same vision and this was very important for me when I found myself talking to the manager and the president. We found ourselves sharing the same ambition, the same desire to build something important knowing that we will have to go through a path made of hard work, effort and sweat. The presence of director Giuseppe Marotta was certainly an incentive. He knows me well, he knows what my strengths and weaknesses are as I know his. I chose a club with great tradition, one of the most important in the world, it was easy to accept<br /><br />I am a person who has no limits and I don’t want others to set themselves at the beginning of the season. In setting limits I would immediately give the team excuses and I don’t want this to happen. We know very well that in the last few years that a huge gap has been opened up for two teams, especially Juventus, but there is also Napoli, who have shown they can compete at a high level. We know that we are called to work harder than others to fill this gap, but we must start with the ambition to give everything we have and in the end we will see what happens.<br /><br />We need to talk little and work hard. ‘Head down and ride’ should be our motto, we will have to be fierce and focused on our goal, which is to bring stability. If we want to have a season as challengers we must have these characteristics, we must work, sacrifice ourselves, question ourselves and every Sunday we will have to leave the field with a sweaty shirt. This is what I will demand from the players and I know they can do it</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> boss Antonio Conte says <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> can be one of the best managers in the world]</b> I think he is doing a really good job, Frank. This is his second experience after <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> so to be the coach of a top team is not easy. I think he has the skills and ability to become one of the best managers in the world. He has to continue to work in this way and I wish him the best for the future<br /><br />I think it was a crucial moment for me and for my team. We lost against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> but in the previous game we lost also against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Usually when you are in a top club and you have two defeats in a row it is not an easy moment for you and the club. But it was a crucial moment because I decided to change system and play with a 3-4-3 or 3-4-2-1 with <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>, <a href="willian.html">Willian</a> or <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> behind <a href="diego-costa.html">Diego Costa</a>, and three at the back. I think it was an important moment and we put the pace in for our title in at that moment. The coach must be a tailor and try to find the right suit for your team. After two months working with the players I decided to change formation and to put them in the best situation to exploit their quality. I think I did this and for that reason we won the title and reached the final in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup</p>

We are talking about a top man, a really good man and then a top player. He helped me a lot in my first season in and out of the pitch. He was very important in the training ground, during the sessions to keep the concentration standards high<br /><br /><b>[The current Inter boss added on bringing the curtain down on an iconic career at Chelsea]</b> He decided he wanted this because 26 was his squad number and for me it was a pleasure to give him this opportunity. I will never be able to thank him enough. He was very important for me and our team</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte felt Inter deserved to reach the Coppa Italia final]</b> Looking at both matches, we deserved much more. In terms of the performance, I have very little to reproach the boys about. This is the football we want to play; we created a lot and were aggressive. Maybe we should have been more clinical in front of goal, but <a href="david-ospina.html">Ospina</a> performed miracles. Their goal was disappointing because it was a careless situation that we could have avoided. But I’m satisfied because we’re on the right path, we controlled the game against a strong <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> team. My glass is half-full. We created numerous opportunities and had 18 efforts at goal. <a href="david-ospina.html">Ospina</a> was the best player on the pitch. Obviously, we can improve, and we need to be more ruthless in the future, but I don’t have anything to complain about in terms of desire and determination. We did what we’d worked on in training. It’s disappointing for the lads not to qualify for the final because, based on what we did over the 180 minutes, we deserved to do so</p>

  <p><b>[Conte backs <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> to come good and boost Inter’s title charge]</b> I think he’s now found his feet and fully settled here.

Then, there are 12 league games to play. Personally, I don’t think the gap is that massive. I have positive feelings. But naturally I need to see the response in matches. We want to give our all in this end of season run-in. We are not ruling anything out. There are no limits to what we can achieve. I think the side has improved in all areas.

  <p><b>[Conte was frustrated that his team did not put the game to bed earlier]</b> When you have the opportunity, you have to kill the opponent. Just look at the game with Napoli: you have the opportunity to win it, it ends 1-1 and you are criticised. Today you had to be bad, determined, cynical…otherwise you get in trouble. It’s not that you suffer, but you go from the possible 3-0 to 2-1, knowing that the game is as vital as they will all be from here to the end</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has stressed that Inter are still in the hunt for the Scudetto]</b> This evening, we had no choice but to get the victory so we could close the gap to six points. We fuel the hope that we can achieve something extraordinary. It’s true that we could’ve sealed it earlier by making more of our chances, but instead we conceded at the first Samp attempt and got a little anxious. It was a good performance, anyway. I repeat, it’s not a fitness issue, but when we have scoring opportunities and do not take them, which also happened in the Coppa Italia with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, all it takes is one lucky ricochet and it’s all up for grabs again. I hope these games will help us realise we must kill - in a sporting sense - the opponent and kill the game when we have the chance<br /><br /><b>[Inter next meet Sassuolo on Wednesday and Conte stressed his side can’t afford to take any game lightly]</b> We’re six points off the top with 12 rounds to go. There’s no margin for error, whereas Lazio and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> can have the odd mistake and get away with it. This is why need that ferocity in front of goal, because with a strong lead, we can then relax on the ball.</p>

  <p><b>[Conte was pleased with how <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> had settled at the San Siro but explained he wanted more goals from the Danish playmaker]</b> We had the chance to work with him. We had the time to improve from both physical and tactical point of view. Nowadays he fits our project but he needs to be more decisive because he had many chances to score and he must score. But I am pleased the way he played, as the team, because we are going to play again in three days and those three points will be decisive for us</p>

  <p><b>[Inter coach Conte banned for one match after fifth yellow card]</b> I think we deserved much more considering how much we created, whereas I don’t recall any Samir Handanovic saves. It’s something we keep repeating in this pattern and are paying a heavy price. I am very disappointed and so are the lads. When you play this type of game and put so much into it, you have the chance to win despite the difficulties in the key area of midfield, you have to take home the three points. We didn’t do that, it’s disappointing and troubling. We had the chances to finish it and we didn’t. I don’t know what more we can do other than keep working. I am happy with the performance, we’ve got to be more careful on the details. That is where we can grow and improve</p>
