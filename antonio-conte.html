If it is not possible then <a href="asmir-begovic.html">Begovic</a> will stay with us. At the end of the season we will evaluate the situation in the best way. I don’t know about a lot of names that I read.

I don’t know what will happen at the end of this window. The club knows my thoughts about this. If we stay with these players, I am very happy too. I think that we have to improve our squad in <b>[terms of]</b> the number of players because in some roles we are short with a few players. If that happens I am very happy.

I think that sometimes you know more than me about this! I have confidence in my players. I don’t know if we will sign new players I must be honest. For sure, if Kenedy and Musonda play only one second they must stay with us for the rest of the season. The players know this, the club and me know this. But I think that they are two young players with good prospects. They have a good will to fight and to try to improve and work. If we take this decision to stay here I think that the players will be very happy and the club and I the same. For this season, Ruben and Chalobah, for sure they continue to stay with us for the rest of the season. We will continue in this way to try to develop our players, like Musonda, Kenedy and <b>[Nathan]</b> Ake</p>

They have been working three years and I think it’s the right moment not to consider them underdogs and have this excuse.

Last year they missed this, this year they are trying again, and I think in the future they will fight every year for the title because they are full of strong players and they are building something important</p>

I don’t smoke, but tomorrow I’m hoping to smoke a cigar if we win. I’m ready to do this<br /><br />But I can tell you that, to celebrate the win, the moment of the celebration is less. The low from a defeat is longer than the high after a win.<br /><br />At the moment, my situation is very clear. I have two more years’ contract with the club. Then, if the club give me the possibility to stay here and to extend my contract, for sure I am available to do this. But we have the same idea about the future. The way we have to do things together, to improve the squad and the team. But, I repeat, I’m happy for this season and am happy to stay here. I hope to stay here for many years.<br /><br /><b>[As ever, Conte draws inspiration from the bad moments to deliver the good times - the 3-0 defeat at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in September which triggered a major tactical rethink]</b> In my career, I had tough moments, at Arezzo in my first role. I started my career with a team in the lower divisions. But, for sure, when you arrive at a new club like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and the level of expectation is so high, you have to be ready to face this moment.<br /><br />I think, at this moment, you see the real value of the coach. In these moments you can appreciate the reaction of the coach, if the coach is able to understand the moment and find a solution to completely change the season. But, honestly, I was always very calm. I knew that I was putting all of myself, all my strength, into this new job. Myself and my staff were working so hard for the club and the players. Anything can happen in a season, but the most important thing is your soul, your heart, are calm.</p>

This is the first time for me. Last season was my first season, but we didn’t play Champions League or Carabao Cup, because we lost Carabao Cup in the second game and were out. This season we play Champions League and are going forward to the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup.<br /><br />We are playing FA Cup. For sure, not only for the players, it’s a busy period. Maybe it’s a busy period more for me because I have to prepare the game in only three days. Anyone who knows me, I don’t just prepare the game only to pick the starting XI. I prepare the game on particular aspects. I’m working a lot in this period. But this is our job and we must be happy because it means we are playing for all competitions</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte insists he does not envy Pep Guardiola after defending Manchester City’s right to spend their considerable cash reserves]</b> No, I don’t like people to envy the other person. I don’t like the person that has this type of sentiment. I have great admiration because they found the right way to be strong for a long time, to have successful seasons for a long time, from now until I don’t know. There is a great coach, great players. And then there is the possibility to spend a lot of money and have the same ambition of the coach. This is the fantastic result for Manchester City. Manchester City is not the only club to spend a lot of money. The way they are spending money, especially the way I think the club is making Pep happy during the transfer market, to take the best choices for the coach, for the manager. There is only one situation very clear, that Manchester City will be stronger next season. Do you think it could be enough, to win again the title? <b>[To not qualify for Europe?]</b> If you think this, I think you are a dreamer.<br /><br /><b>[When asked his opinion on whether Chelsea spend money as well as City do in the transfer market]</b> I don’t know. I didn’t spend money. The club spent money. I have great respect for every club to spend money. The decision with the money is for the clubs.<br /><br />When I arrived here the club didn’t play the Champions League, Europa League, if you remember two years ago and life goes on. I think we have to continue to put all of ourselves in this effort. This will be an important effort from now until the end to try to find a place in the Champions League. Don’t forget we have to play against Crystal Palace before Barcelona and then we have to play Leicester. For sure, it’s a moment that is very crucial for us. These two weeks are very important for us<br /><br /><b>[On Ross Barkley]</b> With Ross, as you know better than me, he had a really bad injury with Everton. He played with us in the Arsenal game, after in the Carabao Cup. He played after seven months. When you have this type of bad injury, you must have great patience to try to work. At the same time, when you’re arriving from a bad injury after a long period when you didn’t play, the risk to have little injuries is easier than another player. Ross is a young player, he’s a really good guy, he’s a good player. Now he has to put all of himself to try to recover in time and show he deserves a place to play in the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has no regrets over his use of Eden Hazard]</b> If I think it’s right for the team to play this way, it’s OK. Otherwise I can take another decision and play with a striker. Maybe I can take different decisions. There are three players for two places. One has to go on the bench. Then I have to decide who has to go on the bench. For sure, <b>[Giroud]</b> is ready. He has specific characteristics, Olivier. He’s a strong player and has a lot of physicality. I think that, in some games, it’s right to start with him. In other games, it’s right to start with Morata. In others, it’s right to continue with Hazard as a No.9. Olivier, he played against West Brom from the start, and played against Hull, and then came on in every game, I think. But he’s ready to play. But I repeat, I don’t like to speak to the press what happens with one player, with two players, with the team.<br /><br />I like to talk with the players face to face, or in meetings with all the players<br /><br />The tactics were the same against Barcelona. Defensively, we were very good in both games. If you look at the stats, we conceded only two shots to Manchester City: one they scored, and another after a free-kick and <b>[Cesar Azpilicueta]</b> saved it on the line. I don’t see a lot of shots on goal from Manchester City, and this is very strange. Usually when you play against Manchester City they shoot about 20 or 25 times every game. For sure, compare that with the Barcelona game, I think we were not so good in ball possession. We missed a lot of last passes. And, for sure, we have to improve. We have to improve in personality, especially when there is a lot of pressure from our opponent. But the tactics were the same against Barcelona and, against Barcelona, I didn’t hear anyone complaining. But, I repeat, we have to improve. We have to improve, especially with the ball<br /><br />We played a game, a massive game against Parma when they were first and we were second. We won 3-1. After the game, there was an international break. During the international break <b>[I gave]</b> an interview. The journalists asked me if I was happy with the team and with this important win. My stupid answer was, ‘We are winning, but I’m not happy because I’m not enjoying the role the coach decided to give me’. When I came back to Turin, it was a meeting with Lippi and all the players and he killed me. He killed me in a bad way, not in a soft way, in front of the players. After training, the club called me. They killed me another time and gave me a big, big fine. And then, in the next game, I didn’t play. I was on the bench against Piacenza. He told me it was a lack of respect for my team-mates, first of all, and then for him, the club and the fans. He killed me. But I took this experience to heart and, after that, I improved a lot. Not to be selfish. I started to think for the team. I became a captain of the team after that<br /><br />You can check. That’s in the past. This is a funny story. No, I think there are different situations <b>[between me at Juventus and Hazard]</b>. I don’t think this is the same situation. When we are players, the risk of making a lot of mistakes, it’s enormous. It’s big. The players, it’s normal… When I was a player, until one point of my career, I was selfish. Because you think about yourself if you play. If you don’t play, you’re unhappy. You don’t think about the team. When you arrive at that point in your career, though, you start to have your mind more open, to be less selfish, and to start to think for the benefit and best of the team, and not only for yourself. I’m talking about my experience - not the others. This is the best way. I’m saying that I was selfish until one point in my career, and then I became a team player with my mind</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte believes it is harder to win trophies in England than in other top leagues around Europe]</b> I think that every manager wants to win a trophy. I must be honest, if you want to win trophies, maybe for important managers, it’s easier to go to another country - if you want to win easy trophies. In England, if you stay here, never, never will it be easy to win trophies. I think there is the club who judges the work of the manager. But, for sure, every manager wants to try and win a trophy. But, I think that every important manager wants to finish the season with a trophy. This is the truth. We work very hard to try and reach this target, but not only for myself: for the players, for the club, for our fans. When you are the coach in an important team, the target must be this. For sure, to reach this target, you need to have the possibility to reach this target in every season<br /><br />I must be honest, I consider Mauricio Pochettino a really good manager. I think that, if Tottenham grew a lot in this period, he deserves a lot of credit for that. Don’t forget that only one team can win the title and, in England, it’s not simple. You start every competition with six teams, six top teams who are ready to win something during the season. For example, last season Chelsea won the title, Manchester United won the Carabao Cup and Arsenal won the FA Cup. This season, probably Manchester City will win the title, but they dropped in the FA Cup. It’s not simple. We are talking about a team who, in the last period for many years now, they are competing to win the title. Don’t forget that two years ago they were very close to winning the title when Leicester won it. Last season they tried to compete with us. Don’t forget that our final of the season was incredible. We won 10 games - otherwise Tottenham were ready to win it<br /><br /><b>[Conte denied that Morata had lacked competition]</b> I think the problem wasn’t the competition. I don’t think this was the problem. I must be honest: For sure, now, there are two strong possibilities, and I have to make the best decision. I’m very happy that, in the last game, Alvaro scored an important goal for us and for him. Now I’m waiting for a great final <b>[part]</b> of the season from Alvaro, from Olivier, but especially for the team. <b>[Morata]</b> had this problem in his back. If you remember, it was a serious problem because… I don’t know the real problem. If you remember, I said I didn’t know the time of his recovery - one day, one month, if the season had finished. He solved the problem and our medical department was very good to put him in the best physical condition to solve this problem. I think, at the start of this period, he continued to feel a bit of pain in his back. But now he’s ready, totally fit. For sure, when a striker is not scoring, the confidence can go down. For the strikers, the goals are of vital importance: for himself, for his confidence. But no, I repeat, I saw him very well in this period. I think it has been an important period for him. He needed to rest and then to have hard sessions of work to find his best physical condition for the final part of the season</p>

We have a different job. For us, it is not sure. You can have a contract but you don’t know what will happen after one or two games. We depend a lot on the result. Last season we were very good to have another target, the possibility of winning the league after a 10th place finish. This season we are aiming for another target, to try to get a place in the Champions League, then to try and reach again the final of the FA Cup and win that trophy. The mentality must always be the same to get three points in every game. It will be important for us to try to get three points. We are having the season we deserve, last season we were very good to have this target but maybe it was a fantastic season for us. In this season, we deserve to play for another target but, for sure, everyone is trying to do our best to get the best target possible for us. I want to do this.<br /><br />Zappacosta is a clear example for this type of situation. We are talking about a young player, a player who is in the first season to play Champions League, and maybe international games. But I think in this team there are many good players, for example, Emerson Palmieri. He’s a young player who is a really good prospect but he needs to improve in many aspects. Andreas Christensen is another, Tiemoue Bakayoko, 23-years-old. We have a lot of young players who need experience and need to improve, not only on the pitch, but charisma and personality. You can do this only if you play important games</p>

It is impossible to find a fault in only one of these three parts. You have to share, you have to understand which are the reasons about this result.

To speak about the gap between us and Manchester City now is not right. The most important thing for us is to focus on ourselves and finish the season in the best possible way.

Also if you have a small budget, because you count on a team that you <b>[worked with]</b> in the past. You then reach the qualification to play again in the Europa League. It is more difficult when you have to prepare the transfer market to win something, because only one team wins. The others must watch the other team win.

And then, I repeat, if you have a good base and in the previous season you played very well, you can count on these players. You have to fight only to avoid this.

Then you <b>[the journalists]</b> are the first to speak about a failed season, if you don’t win the FA Cup, the league, Carabao Cup, it is a failed season and for this reason it is more difficult to play for this target.

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte says he envisaged becoming Arsene Wenger-like figure]</b> When you start to work for a new club, for sure your hope is to stay for many years because you bring your culture, you bring your football, you bring your methodology and your mentality. Sometimes this is possible because you find the right situation. Sometimes this is not possible. But we must be ready, for every coach, every experience you start in your mind, there is the hope to stay for many years. You have to know that, every time you change and go to another team, you have to restart. You have to restart your work and bringing your ideas, your football, your culture, your methodology. And to restart every time is very difficult. Football is changing. If you compare this football with the past, it’s totally different.<br /><br />In England, for example, in the past the managers could stay here and work for the same club for many years.When you know this and have this possibility, you live football and you stay more relaxed because you know you have time to work, to show the importance of your work. In the present, football is not the same like in the past. In England, you can see this difference. Now every club is ready to change manager if you don’t get results, if you don’t win. I think to live football in this way, your career could be less long because you live football with more pressure than in the past.<br /><br />I’m enjoying having this experience. For me and for every coach who has the possibility to work in another country, it’s a great opportunity. But, at the same time, I can tell you that it’s not simple to work in a different country because you have to understand quickly and to adapt yourself to life in the new country. In Italy, we have different habits and a different culture. Different ways to have the training sessions. I’m enjoying <b>[life in England]</b> a lot but, at the same time, it’s not easy. It’s not simple to go into another country and bring your idea of football, especially if you have an idea of football. If you want to manage the situation, manage the players, it’s more simple for everyone. But if you want to bring your idea of football, it’s not simple to go into another country<br /><br /><b>[Conte believes such difficulties can forge a better manager]</b> I consider this experience fantastic for me, and now I’m stronger than before I was when I started this experience. I’m stronger as a coach and stronger as a manager than I was at Juventus and with Italy</p>

Don’t forget that the first 100 games with Mourinho were many years ago. Now it’s not simple, I think, to have this type of results in this moment, in this present Chelsea. I must be pleased for the players, for the club, but for sure, we could do better. It’s a different era. A different era in the history of the club. Only for this <b>[reason]</b>.<br /><br />I think there are different eras. I have to consider this. I won a title with Juventus after two seventh places. When you win a title in this way, it’s a great, great achievement. Not a simple achievement. Last season we won a title after a 10th place. When you win a title in this way, it means it’s a great, great achievement. Not a simple achievement, only because your name is Chelsea and it’s normal because, in the past, you won many titles.

  <p><b>[FA Cup much more difficult for Chelsea this season]</b> I must be honest and I think that last season we missed a great chance to win the FA Cup and, also in the Community Shield this season, we missed a great chance. This season, I think that if you can win against Southampton and to reach the final it will be more difficult against Tottenham or Manchester United. Last season, we were in the best condition to win the FA Cup and I think we missed that chance last season and it was our fault. I remember that some refereeing decisions weren’t good. The first goal that they scored with Alexis Sanchez was handball. Then we finished the game with 10 men. Despite this we managed to draw level but we conceded a goal at the last moment because of our mistake. Last season Arsenal did a great job to win the FA Cup. For sure, <b>[Arsene Wenger]</b> has a great capacity to prepare his team. His career speaks very clearly. You can win only once because you are lucky, but if you win many times then that means you are a winning man. When you are a winning man, you transfer your winning mentality to your team.<br /><br />Last season, I repeat, the final of the FA Cup, we could have done better. We had a great chance to win the FA Cup because in that moment we were stronger than them. This season it will be more difficult. You have to know that I play only to win. I don’t play to enjoy. I play only to win. I try to transfer this mentality to my player. Every season I start with only one idea in my mind. <b>[Even]</b> if you know that maybe it will be impossible to win something during the season. In my mind, heart and soul there is always this mentality and I try to transfer this mentality to my players. If I win something, I did my job, not something special. When I don’t win, I am very angry with myself but at the same time I am ready to work harder to try to win something in my next chance<br /><br />I think if the team that played the first half and part of the second half plays then we must be concerned. Really concerned. If we go to play with the right team spirit like against Burnley or in the last 30 minutes of Southampton’s game, I think we have the possibility to reach the final. My players have to know this, my players have to know that this is the way we have to follow. I think there is only one way. To go to the pitch with the fire in our eyes and to reach this final and have the crowd with us. We must give them the best satisfaction. It is a semi-final against a team that, for me, I am very surprised to see them in this position in the table. They are fighting to avoid relegation and despite this, I think they have good players, talented players. Don’t forget, only one week ago, we were losing 2-0 after 60 minutes. I think that the last game showed it will be very important to approach this right, for our future in this competition<br /><br />With Juventus, we did the same in my first season. To win a title without losing is not simple. I think it is an incredible achievement. I remember that season. When we talk about Arsene Wenger, we have to remember the whole story and for that reason we have to show great respect. We must pay him a great tribute because we are talking about a really important manager, one of the best managers in the world, along with Sir Alex Ferguson. Especially for this country. I remember everything. I think when you have that type of season and your confidence is very strong, you feel it is very difficult for teams to beat you. You become invincible in your mind. You start the game and you know in your heart and soul that it will be very difficult for your opponent to beat you</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has denied that his rift with Jose Mourinho is ongoing after Chelsea booked an FA Cup final date with Manchester United]</b> With Jose, we have clarified the situation. This is the most important thing. There is not a problem between him and I. I think this final is a game between two great teams: Manchester United and Chelsea. For sure, in my mind, I can tell you that we played last season in the final and arrived as favourites against Arsenal. This season, we are arriving not as favourites. But, as you know very well, we lost the final despite being favourites in my mind. We are talking about two managers with strong characters, and two winners. When in your mind and your heart and your blood there is the will to win, for sure, we want to try to win this trophy. The same way Manchester United want to do this<br /><br /><b>[On Olivier Giroud]</b> He has been a good signing for us. As you know very well, I needed a player with this characteristic: strong physically, to hold the ball up and allow our No. 10 to make combinations with him. Morata is an important striker. I think he’s younger than Olivier. He has less experience. He is less strong physically but, at the same time, is very fast to act on the space. I’m pleased for both, for both, because in the last game against Burnley we started the game with both players and they showed a great link-up. I’m very pleased to see that, because I have another option now. Another card in my hand during the game. Today I decided to start with Olivier because I knew we had to play against the three central defenders, very strong physically, so I decided to start with Olivier. But when Morata came on, the impact was impressive. In the same way as Pedro’s impact, which was important. And also <b>[Tiemoue]</b> Bakayoko.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea manager Antonio Conte admits it has not been easy replacing former captain John Terry’s leadership skills within the club]</b> It wasn’t simple replacing John Terry because we are talking about a great leader. It’s something you have in your blood. I think Gary Cahill developed a lot this year, but we have three or four players who take responsibility, who try to lead the team. Cahill deserves to be <b>[at the World Cup]</b>, because he’s playing well. He’s in good physical condition. We’re talking about an important player with great experience - he’s played in big competitions. To play in the World Cup on European Championships, it’s important to have players with great experience because the pressure will be strong for everyone. I think Gary deserves to play. But, at the same time, I have always shown great respect for Southgate. I think he’s a really good manager. He has to make the best choices for the national team and I’m sure he’ll make the right decision<br /><br /><b>[They face Swansea City on Saturday evening]</b> It won’t be easy. The only way for us to have a hope of a place in the Champions League is to take three points from every game. Tottenham are a really good team. I like the way they play - and it can happen, to have bad results for a short period. But they have played <b>[Manchester]</b> City and United in the last three games, and drew at Brighton. It will be very difficult, but we have to push and try to put a bit of pressure on. The only way to do this is to win at Swansea tomorrow. We have to try to finish the season in the best possible way. In this moment, we don’t have a priority. We know that, for the second time in a row, we have an opportunity to win <b>[the FA Cup]</b>. This is very important for the club, our fans and the players. At the same time, we have to try and finish the league in the best possible way.

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte believes poor finishing has undermined Chelsea’s season]</b> No, I think that football is very simple, if you want to win you have to score. I think in this season our main problem is that we are not so clinical, also today, we had the chances to kill the game. You have to take them otherwise the result stays in the balance until the end. I think then there are, for sure, other situations that we have to improve, but <b>[against Swansea]</b> I think we had good balance with the three midfielders. We were very dangerous offensively with Hazard, Giroud and the penetration from midfield. In fact, Fabregas scored from midfield. I repeat, it is very important for us to try and do our best until the end. The situation is not in our hands about our place in the Champions League, but if we want to keep the pressure on and keep the hope alive, then we have to try to get three points in every game. In the next game we will play against Liverpool. As you know very well, if you want to win, you have to score. In this season I think we dropped many points. I remember, for example, in the last game against West Ham, we dropped two points that were of vital importance for us. We dominated the game and created I don’t know how many chances to score and we kept the result at only 1-0. In the end, they scored and drew and bye-bye. For sure, the only is way to put a little bit of pressure on the teams that stay ahead of us to win because, if we hadn’t got three points then I think that the situation for the Champions League would end.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about how he sees the January signing’s partnership with Hazard after they started against Swansea]</b><br /><br />I think that they played a really good game. They showed a good link between them. I am very pleased for their performance. Not only of those two players but for the team. It wasn’t easy to get three points against Swansea because I think they are in a good run of form, especially at home. In the last five games, they won four games and they drew only one game. We must be happy also because we kept a clean sheet for the second time in a row. These are positive things but we have to try to continue until the end to try to do our best and then at the end of the season what will happen, will happen<br /><br /><b>[Conte refused to be drawn on whether it would be better for the Reds to win or lose their huge match at the Stadio Olimpico AS Roma]</b> I think that for me it is very difficult to say something about this game because I am an Italian.

You can see that he’s present during the game. He wants to help his players during the game. You can see that he’s always present, in a positive or negative situation, so I have great respect for him. But every coach has his own style to follow the game. Every coach wants to try to pick the best situation to follow his team. Fans like it. But you must do this because you are this way. In the past, in the present, in the future. Not only because the fans like this situation. You must be natural to show who you are. It’s important not to change your behaviour or your characteristics, otherwise you are a fake person.<br /><br />I think that, in the league, you have 38 games to show you deserve to win the league. To show you are the best during the season. In the Champions League, when you reach the last 16 or quarter-finals or semi-finals, one situation - positive or negative - can change your future in this competition. For this reason, I think that to win the Champions League you must be luckier. You must be good to deserve it, but at the same time you must be lucky. One referee’s decision can settle your future totally. In the league, over 38 games, usually the team who deserves to win it wins it. Luck is always important in every competition, but when you have the possibility to play 38 games you can show you are the best. In a little tournament, like the FA Cup or Carabao or Champions League or Europa League, sometimes one decision can move your future. Sometimes you are lucky or you are unlucky. I think we are talking about two big achievements. To win the league is important. To win the Champions League is important. The same level. Two important competitions, two difficult competitions to win</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has thanked his friends at Chelsea]</b> I would like to thank all of my friends at Chelsea Football Club for their hard work and support over the past two seasons which enabled us to win the Premier League and FA Cup together. To the players, whose talent and commitment was so important to our successes, I thank them for everything. It has been a pleasure working with them every day. To my staff, who always worked so hard, I must say thank you and well done for their professionalism and dedication throughout. I have enjoyed my time in England and London so much and I want to thank the Chelsea fans who have been amazing to me and my family. It was fantastic for me to be able to share my emotions, passion and enthusiasm throughout two unforgettable seasons with these amazing Chelsea supporters, who will always stay in my heart. I hope Chelsea will continue to be successful and I wish everyone well for next season. I have made many memories during my time with Chelsea, which I will take with me into my next challenge.</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Conte claimed <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> feared his team following their 2-0 Champions League victory on Wednesday]</b> <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> changed their system to five at the back, which means they were afraid of us and wanted to play by changing their approach to mirror ours. We had prepared for a very different match, but did well to adjust. When <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> switched back to 4-2-3-1 after the break, we adjusted again and took control.<br /><br />We had prepared to press them in certain areas of the pitch and they changed their system, so that was no longer valid. The most important thing I told the lads was not to lose possession in central areas, as that is where they push forward on the counter. Roberto Gagliardini, <a href="nicolo-barella.html">Nicolo Barella</a> and <a href="marcelo-brozovic.html">Marcelo Brozovic</a> did a great job both in defending and attacking. I often tell Brozo off for attacking too much, but he had a great game tonight with both phases. <a href="nicolo-barella.html">Barella</a> is so generous and passionate, but he does give me anxiety attacks when he gets booked after 10-15 minutes<br /><br />It’s tough against <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>, who are a very good team. It’s still difficult to qualify, but we know that we’re alive and kicking. It is not a simple situation. The lads did well and dealing with a series of injuries, we still put in a great performance. I am happy above all for the players, as these nights reward them for their sacrifices. I told the team that they worked so hard with <a href="luciano-spalletti.html">Luciano Spalletti</a> to qualify for the Champions League, so it was important we give our all to keep that dream going. We’re not the favourites in this group, but we had to win to stay in the running and we did it. Now we’ve got <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> coming up, not even three days away, so we need to be very wary, as Saturday is the toughest game and not tonight</p>

We must be good at finding situations that can bring us benefits. We must find cheap opportunities, otherwise I see it being hard. The ideas are there, if there is the possibility, we will improve. What you can’t get with money you have to get with intelligence and wit.<br /><br />We have made an important first step. We have faced serious problems and despite this, we have gained 46 points. The second half of the season will be difficult, we know it, there will still be a lot of room to fight and to grow. The most important thing about this course was the feeling that was created between me and the boys and the fact that they fully embraced my project</p>

I repeat, it’s not a fitness issue, but when we have scoring opportunities and do not take them, which also happened in the Coppa Italia with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, all it takes is one lucky ricochet and it’s all up for grabs again. I hope these games will help us realise we must kill - in a sporting sense - the opponent and kill the game when we have the chance<br /><br /><b>[Inter next meet Sassuolo on Wednesday and Conte stressed his side can’t afford to take any game lightly]</b> We’re six points off the top with 12 rounds to go. There’s no margin for error, whereas <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> can have the odd mistake and get away with it. This is why need that ferocity in front of goal, because with a strong lead, we can then relax on the ball.</p>

  <p><b>[Conte was pleased with how <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> had settled at the <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> but explained he wanted more goals from the Danish playmaker]</b> We had the chance to work with him. We had the time to improve from both physical and tactical point of view. Nowadays he fits our project but he needs to be more decisive because he had many chances to score and he must score. But I am pleased the way he played, as the team, because we are going to play again in three days and those three points will be decisive for us</p>

  <p><b>[Inter coach Conte banned for one match after fifth yellow card]</b> I think we deserved much more considering how much we created, whereas I don’t recall any Samir Handanovic saves. It’s something we keep repeating in this pattern and are paying a heavy price. I am very disappointed and so are the lads. When you play this type of game and put so much into it, you have the chance to win despite the difficulties in the key area of midfield, you have to take home the three points. We didn’t do that, it’s disappointing and troubling. We had the chances to finish it and we didn’t. I don’t know what more we can do other than keep working. I am happy with the performance, we’ve got to be more careful on the details. That is where we can grow and improve</p>

  <p><b>[The <a href="inter-milan.html">Nerazzurri</a> are now all but out of the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> title race after squandering two precious points]</b> I think we deserved much more considering how much we created, whereas I don’t recall any Samir Handanovic saves. It’s something we keep repeating in this pattern and we are paying a heavy price. I am very disappointed and so are the lads. When you play this type of game and put so much into it, you have the chance to win despite the difficulties in the key area of midfield, you have to take home the three points. We didn’t do that - it’s disappointing and troubling.<br /><br />There are situations where we need to score goals and we are paying for these naive errors. We had the chances to finish it and we didn’t. I don’t know what more we can do other than keep working. I am happy with the performance, we’ve got to be more careful on the details. That is where we can grow and improve. We must try to win all of our remaining matches, regardless of what will happen, because I want the team always aiming for the maximum. I don’t want any regrets, but we have some tonight<br /><br />When you play for Inter, you’re part of a great team and need to move on immediately. The away trip to <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> is a chance to get back on track. We need to think like a great team. We are focused on winning. Since we’ve been back, we’ve had more opportunities than our opponents. Failing to kill off games has become a problem.</p>

That’s the best thing about the game, the atmosphere around the soccer being played. These decisions have been taken with public health in mind but I hope that everything returns to normal as soon as possible</p>
