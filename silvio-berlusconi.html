  <p><b>[<a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> owner Silvio Berlusconi has revealed he attempted to bring <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> to the club when the Spaniard was head coach at Barcelona]</b> As a coach, I was courting <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. He then became coach of Bayern - but the game expressed at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> was what satisfied me more<br /><br /><b>[Though Milan have broken the world transfer record three times under his ownership, the last time they did so was in 1992, signing Gianluigi Lentini for a relatively modest £13million]</b> The names are known, but the demands are there to show how football now has become like a kind of monopoly. These top figures have no connection with what are reasonable prices</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> president Silvio Berlusconi said the only way for the <a href="ac-milan.html">Rossoneri</a> to become great again is if the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> club is handed back to him]</b> These are phrases someone should only say if he walks into the toilet and closes the door first. As for how we get Milan back to being the great Milan of the past, that is simple, yet at the same time difficult to make happen: give the club back to Silvio Berlusconi.<br /><br /><b>[Berlusconi - who owns Serie C side Monza - added]</b> These are lovely projects, I am sure it’ll be a modern and beautiful arena. We are fond of <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> because we won everything there, every spectator gets a good view and I hope that a solution is found to prevent the old stadium being knocked down. Otherwise, I’d propose the city give it to Monza</p>

  <p><b>[Silvio Berlusconi: Former <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> owner takes AC Monza into Serie B]</b> There’s no point hiding - we want to take this city, the third-biggest in Lombardy, into <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. Now comes the hard bit, but the conditions for us to achieve our goal are all in place.<br /><br />The goal now is to build a top team, we already started talking about transfers. Our budget will be used to go in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, we won’t go crazy but we will do what’s necessary<br /><br /><b>[A modest, provincial city just a stone’s throw away from Milan, football fans in Monza tend to gravitate towards either of the <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> clubs, so it’s easy to think they can join Inter and <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> as a third Milanese club in Serie A]</b> It’s a compliment that can give me pleasure, but Monza is not the third team of Milan. It’s the team of the city of Monza, of the province of Brianza and its 900,000 inhabitants. Monza is different to Milan, it’s got its own clear identity. We will set up a team to aim to the top of Serie B. It’s well known that promotion <b>[to Serie A]</b> depends on many factors, some of which are unpredictable. But we know very well the predictable ones and we will do our best to take advantage of them</p>
