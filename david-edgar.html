<blockquote>
  <p><b>[David Edgar feels Whitecaps need ‘little tweaks’ to be playoff contenders again]</b> To be sat here <b>[with the season over in November]</b>, it feels weird for me. I feel like I haven’t had a full season, which technically I haven’t because it was my offseason in England. It feels a bit strange but I’ll sit down with the gaffer and I have an offseason program to do. I don’t know if anything will come up in England, but we’ll see.<br /><br />We definitely underachieved. Since I’ve been here, in terms of the quality we’ve got, we missed out on the playoffs but we knew we were good enough to make the playoffs. We just fell short of that<br /><br />It’s different. There was a bit of a transition. It’s very athletic here. Boys are fit, fast, strong, athletic compared to England, compared to what I’ve been used to. That’s a transition, but the quality’s there for everyone to see. In terms of individual qualities, it’s fantastic in the league<br /><br />That’s hard to put your finger on. Since I’ve been here, it’s almost been a confidence thing because things weren’t going our way. In football, as in any sport, when things aren’t going your way it feels that everything goes against you in terms of results and whatnot, but it’s hard to put your finger on. It’s just minimal things. Small things<br /><br />It’s marginal. It’s just little tweaks. Things that didn’t go our way, a bit of bad luck here and there, bad performances, but it’s minimal. Very minimal. We’re there and there about and in this league anything can happen</p>
