  <p><b>[Mohamed Hosseini on his son Arat Hosseini]</b> When Arat was a little boy he was constantly moving and was always active. He started doing gymnastics even before I brought him to a small club. He was very enthusiastic. He was five at that time and I encouraged him and sought better opportunities for him. He’s been always passionate about sports<br /><br /><b>[Asked about the global fame his son achieved]</b> Arat became well-known in Asia as a gymnast when he was very young. When he started playing football, more people around the world started to watch him, and we got a chance to talk to many people including celebrities like DJ Khaled and Novak Djokovic. Arat is now considered a role model for kids, which is great<br /><br /><b>[Mohamed recognises the pros and cons of fame, especially on social media, something he advises his son on]</b> I talk to Arat about the positive responses we get to his videos, and I use that to motivate him to achieve his goals. However, at the same time it’s very important to protect children from the downsides of social media. After all, he’s still a child who is growing up and learning as education is very important for us<br /><br /><b>[It appears that the massive popularity that Arat has achieved through his distinctive social media videos is just a step towards a bigger goal for father and son]</b> Arat wants to be the best player in the world. At the same time, we’ll provide him with the best education and training and will take concrete steps in that direction<br /><br /><b>[As for his expectations for his six-year-old son]</b> I’m sure he’ll become a great player. He’s very talented and self-motivated. It’s a long journey and we’ll maintain our focus to achieve our goal. He’ll be the youngest player to appear at the World Cup. We’re thinking about the future and the steps we can take. Nothing will stop us. Arat loves school and football. He’s currently training with the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool FC</a> Academy and wants to be the best player in the world. So I’m doing all I can to help him</p>
