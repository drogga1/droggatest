  <p><b>[AC Milan have tumbled out of the Deloitte Football Money League for the first time ever]</b> This is a new low. There’s a real lack of a success on the pitch and that means matchday and broadcast revenues are flat and commercial revenues have fallen. On-pitch performance has had a knock-on effect; they can’t go out and talk to sponsors to draw value.<br /><br />Seventeen of the top 20 are in UEFA competition. Chelsea, Liverpool and Everton are the only three who are not but all three benefited from new broadcast deal. If you want to be in the top 20, European competition is vital - particularly if you are not an English club<br /><br /><b>[On Financial Fair Play]</b> If UEFA imposes sanctions, that can result in removal of the right to play in UEFA competition. That removes the right to receive distributions from lucrative UEFA competition, which has a knock-on impact on club revenues and their ability to spend in the transfer market and operate the wider business. Any ruling from UEFA on that basis can have quite severe consequences</p>

  <p><b>[UK Premier League money drying up means overseas broadcasters could now call the shots]</b> The 2019-2022 cycle has gone for about £1.5 billion per annum for 160 games. The previous cycle was for 168 games and it went for £1.7bn. That means the current cycle just went for £9.3 million per match as opposed to £10.2m per match.<br /><br />You’ve still got 40 games because the Premier League are offering more this cycle. Of those 40 remaining games they are all going to be played simultaneously. What that means is that those 40 games are going to be four rounds of 10. Whoever buys the rights to those will be streaming them all at the same time or showing them on TV at the same time. Given that, you would expect the value of those rights wouldn’t get to the same level as what was achieved in the last cycle. So, we don’t think it’ll reach £1.7bn for the total package. It might fall five or 10 per cent short<br /><br />If you look at the overseas rights, whilst the domestic rights have plateaued or held constant, the overseas rights could get quite close to the level of the domestic rights. The value of the overseas rights is about £1.1bn per annum. The Premier League sold rights to USA, South Africa, China, Brazil and key African markets in the last 18 months. Some of those were on significant increases on the previous rights deals. There are still some left to be drip-fed out to the market in the coming months. So, we’d expect an uplift in the overseas rights which we think will stimulate growth in the value of the overall rights packages<br /><br />The total pot of whatever it will be for the next cycle, it will be distributed and every club will get the same amount. So, as the value of those rights increases, the larger clubs and more successful clubs in the league have started to probe the question of the Premier League - why aren’t those distributed on a similar basis?<br /><br />For smaller clubs ultimately, if they are currently getting a good share of a large number, the risk through their eyes is they may see it as relinquishing an amount they are currently guaranteed to get. The Premier League is a competitive league. For it to be competitive and have value, the unpredictability of the Premier League is what’s been such an attractive trait. The fact that any club, at any point in time, can pretty much take points off the others, a lot of the mid-table and other clubs would argue that’s just as much of a driver as having your big Uniteds and Citys in the league and doing well in European competition<br /><br />For the bigger Premier League clubs, they arguably create the value of the brand overseas. So, for the Manchester Uniteds, the Citys, those are the ones that appeal to people in Hong Kong, in China, Japan, in the US and they are driving the brand value of the Premier League. Their argument is they should be entitled to a larger share. They’re contributing to that<br /><br />The Premier League are definitely altering the kick-off times. The timeslots they’ve made available in the new package are probably more attractive for some of the key markets definitely<br /><br />The rights holders that are streaming the Premier League in those countries could argue it would be great given that we’re paying a significant amount, we should have a game hosted in our country for our market. There are a lot of logistics that go behind that, thinking how it could play out fairly for all clubs. I don’t think we’d expect to see that in the next few years</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid have regained their place as the highest-earning club in world football in the latest edition of the Deloitte Football Money League]</b> The substantial presence of Premier League clubs continues to be felt in this year’s Deloitte Football Money League.<br /><br />However, with the Premier League’s tender for the next cycle of domestic rights from 2019-20 complete and sale of overseas rights nearing conclusion, it is clear that Premier League clubs will be unable to rely on explosive growth in broadcast distributions as a source of future growth, as has been the case in recent years.<br /><br />As a result, we expect an even greater emphasis among these clubs on generating their own growth in the coming season, and in particular the optimisation of commercial revenue, which has been a key area for differentiating growth across most of Europe’s leading clubs in recent years</p>
