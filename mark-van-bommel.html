  <p><b>[Robin van Persie faced criticism from members of the Netherlands setup after shooting instead of passing to Klaas-Jan Huntelaar when 1-0 down to Kazakhstan]</b> Van Persie is the captain, he should solve these problems in the dressing room. It’s not good what Robin does but we must not exaggerate. From that corner, Van Persie should just shoot on target.</p>

You must pay attention, he’ll amaze everyone with what he can do. He is a top professional, just like the others of that generation. Looking at what he has achieved, he can make younger players better. Even if it’s just in training.</p>

Can I confirm that Gutierrez is an option? I cannot confirm anything now. We have only just sealed qualification and now is not the time to talk about transfers. I understand it’s a talking point, though, as we only have 48 hours until the end of the transfer window.</p>

  <p><b>[PSV vs Barcelona]</b> The little things are always decisive in football. We took the lead in three of out four group games. Just take the Inter game. If their keeper had been sent off for a professional foul on Steven Bergwijn, we could have made it 2-0. Deduct three points from Inter’s total and add three to ours and you may wonder how different the table would look.<br /><br />We know it will not be easy but we are still in the race for third place</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="psv.html">PSV</a> head coach Mark van Bommel has admitted that he is interested in bringing <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a> back to the club as a free agent this summer]</b> There’s been more than one call. But it’s very simple, he’s the one who has to make the decision. He knows that we would love to have him here and we now have to give him the time he needs to make a decision. I am not going to put any pressure on him to force a decision. It’s an important decision for him. He could retire or he could continue to play. He could join us, or he could go elsewhere. He will have received loads of offers.<br /><br /><b>[Another potential departure is left-back <a href="angelino.html">Angelino</a>, who is being linked with a return to former club <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> There is a chance he could leave, yes.

He has got amazing qualities and fits neatly into our style of play. Bruma is only 24 but brings good experience. He has featured in several foreign top leagues and knows what it takes to perform on the international stage. We have an extra option with him and that is a good thing, also considering the interest in our players</p>

  <p><b>[From signing <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> to developing <a href="memphis-depay.html">Memphis Depay</a> - inside <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>’s youth academy revolution]</b> I think the youth academy is really important for Dutch clubs. We are trying to make our academy better and better. We are working on a brand-new building for the academy. Of course, the other teams have a lot more money than we have, but we are trying to develop our own players in a very good way. Ideally, you want as many academy graduates as possible in the first team. It would be perfect if you had the whole squad, but that’s not possible. You need a good mix of players from different age categories and different styles of play.<br /><br /><b>[Out of that group, <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Steven Bergwijn</a> seems closest to earning himself a big-money move after a superb 2018-19 campaign]</b> Stevie is close to Memphis’ level back in 2015. It’s always difficult to compare players, but if you look at their qualities, then Memphis was playing more or less in the same position. It can be possible that a club pay almost the same amount for him as they did for <a href="memphis-depay.html">Memphis Depay</a>.</p>

It could be possible that a club pay almost the same amount for Steven as they did for Memphis. But the transfer market always changes, it also depends on which club is after a winger. Of course, wingers are always interesting, but it’s hard to say whether he will go for about €40m.</p>

  <p><b>[It was at that aforementioned training camp that Van Bommel got a first glimpse of <a href="mohamed-ihattaren.html">Ihattaren</a> in a senior environment, having previously worked with him at U19 level. Unsurprisingly, he was impressed]</b> He has the quality with the ball that is extraordinary for his age. And it’s good that he is with us because he is developing really well. He’s 17 but I think he’s learning more than at the youth academy because he was at the top of the youth academy. And no matter if you are 16, 17 or 19 - if you are good, you have to train with the first team.<br /><br />He has the quality to make the right decision in a difficult situation. And that’s not normal. We speak about if you have a good decision in a difficult situation then that’s good. But it’s not always like that and he’s only 17. He’s playing with the older guys and he does the same things he did at the youth academy. If you can do that, then you’re a good player</p>

The matches are the defining moments, but the process around them is also decisive. We monitor this intensively. <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> is a club where we try to help and support each other.
