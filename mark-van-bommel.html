  <p><b>[From signing Ronaldo to developing Memphis Depay - inside PSV’s youth academy revolution]</b> I think the youth academy is really important for Dutch clubs. We are trying to make our academy better and better. We are working on a brand-new building for the academy. Of course, the other teams have a lot more money than we have, but we are trying to develop our own players in a very good way. Ideally, you want as many academy graduates as possible in the first team. It would be perfect if you had the whole squad, but that’s not possible. You need a good mix of players from different age categories and different styles of play.<br /><br /><b>[Out of that group, Steven Bergwijn seems closest to earning himself a big-money move after a superb 2018-19 campaign]</b> Stevie is close to Memphis’ level back in 2015. It’s always difficult to compare players, but if you look at their qualities, then Memphis was playing more or less in the same position. It can be possible that a club pay almost the same amount for him as they did for Memphis Depay.</p>

  <p><b>[Mark van Bommel would not be surprised if Bergwijn commanded a similar transfer fee as when Depay joined Manchester United for an initial price of €34 million back in 2015]</b> It’s always difficult to compare players, but Memphis was playing more or less in the same position and has similar characteristics. It could be possible that a club pay almost the same amount for Steven as they did for Memphis. But the transfer market always changes, it also depends on which club is after a winger. Of course, wingers are always interesting, but it’s hard to say whether he will go for about €40m.</p>

  <p><b>[It was at that aforementioned training camp that Van Bommel got a first glimpse of <a href="mohamed-ihattaren.html">Ihattaren</a> in a senior environment, having previously worked with him at U19 level. Unsurprisingly, he was impressed]</b> He has the quality with the ball that is extraordinary for his age. And it’s good that he is with us because he is developing really well. He’s 17 but I think he’s learning more than at the youth academy because he was at the top of the youth academy. And no matter if you are 16, 17 or 19 – if you are good, you have to train with the first team.<br /><br />He has the quality to make the right decision in a difficult situation. And that’s not normal. We speak about if you have a good decision in a difficult situation then that’s good. But it’s not always like that and he’s only 17. He’s playing with the older guys and he does the same things he did at the youth academy. If you can do that, then you’re a good player</p>

  <p><b>[PSV have sacked head coach Mark van Bommel in the wake of a 3-1 Eredivisie defeat to Feyenoord on Sunday]</b> The decline is too large and unworthy of <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>. The matches are the defining moments, but the process around them is also decisive. We monitor this intensively. <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> is a club where we try to help and support each other. That has also been the case in recent months. The club’s interest has always been paramount and the evaluation ultimately resulted in this painful decision. We have all done everything to turn the tide. Unfortunately, that did not work</p>

  <p><b>[PSV have sacked head coach Mark van Bommel in the wake of a 3-1 Eredivisie defeat to Feyenoord on Sunday]</b> Although I have to fight against the whole world, I am not giving up. I have seen one of the best <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> matches this season, only the result is very bad. We came back against the odds, we dominated the game. Football is sometimes unfair. Normally you just have to win here. Apparently the poisoned cup must be completely empty</p>
