  <p><b>[FC Dallas puts aside CONCACAF Champions League dream - for now]</b> This will help lift the team’s spirits. We knew we all were hurting after the Pachuca game, but we also know that we have to leave this in past. Those are things that happen in soccer. Unfortunately, it happened where we lost in this way, but it will help teach us for what is coming and what we’re going to face. And we hope to keep working as well as possible, as the coaching staff wants us to, and keep getting points. That’s what we want.</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Barrios also said the atmosphere that coach Oscar Pareja has fostered at the club contributed to his desire to help the club lift silverware]</b> This club, for me, is huge. It’s a family that has welcomed me. Since I got here, the directors, whole coaching staff, my teammates who have been with me. They’ve always extended their hand to me when I need it most. They’ve spoken with me in the hard times and that’s why I’ve tried to give everything I have.<br /><br />The team gave me the chance to leave Colombia and I’m very thankful <b>[to]</b> them, thankful to everyone here. I think the most important thing now is to keep trying to give new things to them, more happy moments with the club, game by game and season by season. Now I have to wait for what might happen and take it a moment at a time</p>

  <p><b>[Reggie Cannon feels ready for starting role as FC Dallas looks to rebound]</b> Last year, I had the chance to play a few games with Reggie. He’s a strong, fast player. He’s always well-positioned when we’re playing defensively. He’s very good in one-on-one situations. Good getting into the attack, giving me overlaps and helping me with the transition to defense. I think he’s going to be important for us. We’re working with the coaches to understand each other better and do really good things.</p>

  <dd><a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> found himself at the centre of VAR controversy for DC United last night when his straight red card was overturned. The former England international’s side found themselves 1-0 down against Dallas on Thursday evening and looked to have been reduced to 10 men after Rooney’s lunge on Michael Barrios saw him receive a straight red card from referee Nima Saghafi. However, in dramatic fashion VAR was utilised in order to review the incident, and upon a second viewing Saghafi opted to overturn his decision and show the forward a yellow card and keep him on the pitch</dd>
