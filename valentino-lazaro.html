<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Intermilan have completed the signing of Valentino Lazaro from Hertha Berlin, with the Serie A club confirming the move Monday]</b> Lazaro knows how to win. He plays mostly on the right flank but is versatile and used to playing in different roles. Like many greats of the game, he developed at a young age by playing on the streets, giving him a great base in terms of skill and tactical selflessness</p>

  <p><b>[Valentino Lazaro says <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> aren’t thinking about winning <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> in two or three years - they want to do it now]</b> I can’t wait to play my first minutes for Inter. I have been following <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> for a while, you can see how great players have come to Italy and how the league is growing. The fans are crazy about football, it’s incredible. It’s something I’ve never seen. I can’t wait to experience the big games at San Siro. People talk about winning it in two or three years, but the clear goal for us is to win the Scudetto this year. The club’s ambitions are, of course, very, very high; I think Inter remains a world-class club, and now, after the changes this summer, with a new coach, new players and a new philosophy, the goals are even bigger<br /><br /><b>[In Lazaro’s absence, <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> has picked Antonio Candreva on the right wing]</b> From when I started training with <b>[Conte]</b>, I had always trained in the starting line-ups. I was always there until I got injured. It was a shame to have been out for three weeks. But the coach told me not to worry, that I would immediately get back in shape and I would gradually fit in. And he hopes I can do very well<br /><br /><b>[Lazaro would love to help <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> lift the Champions League again]</b> Milan? It would be very special to play in that game, but I hope I can make my debut first and maybe play from the start in the next two games. In the coming years, the goal is to be able to bring the Champions League to Milan once again, with the coach, the president and the whole team. But I like to think that this year too we can focus on doing important things. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> are not such bad opponents</p>
