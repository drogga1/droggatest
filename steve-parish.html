  <p><b>[Eagles chairman Steve Parish has grown accustomed to seeing star turns in south London linked with moves elsewhere]</b> There is so much said around our top players. I could lay out probably a thousand articles from the last seven years about where Wilf is going to go and when he is going to go. Wilf is focused on between now and the end of the season. Clubs have to match the ambitions of the players. We have to move this club forward. It isn’t just supporters that get excited by things improving, it is the people within the club, the staff, the players obviously included</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish says he will not prevent <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> from joining a top club in the next transfer window]</b> I’m sure it has a happy ending for everybody. That’s what I want to generate and I’m sure we’ll make that happen. We’ve all been young, but the situation was not right for anybody this summer. You think at the time it is, but I wouldn’t put a cap on this kid’s talent. I’ve watched him every week for 10 years, he scored the first goal in the first game after we bought the club when he was 16. So there’s even a bit of me that wants to see what he can do at a top club, and I certainly wouldn’t want to be the person who stopped that.<br /><br />I feel he deserves to get there, I hope it happens and sometimes it mystifies me he’s not up there already. I don’t know what he’s got to do - run the length of the pitch and beat four players? If people stood in my shoes having to replace him, trying to find someone in world football to do what he does, they would know. We’re lucky to have him. But if that top club comes along and the money’s right, he’s an extraordinary talent and it’s going to be very difficult for us<br /><br />I’m here to do a job and my relationship with Wilfried has always recognised that. I’ve never asked him for a favour, he’s never asked me for one. It’s a professional relationship. It was just at that moment we weren’t aligned, but I’ll try to find a solution from here. <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> went to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, so if top clubs come in for our players with the right money, then it’s a timing issue. We have to make a plan for the evolution of our squad. Wilfried won’t be here forever, and we must be ready for him to go, if he does go. The last day of the transfer window, however, is not going to be it</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish says he is unsure what will happen regarding the future of star player Wilfried Zaha]</b> You say a transfer request came in but let’s pass on that. It was no secret that <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> would like to further his career - possibly with a Champions League club and that is a discussion I have had with him. A Champions League club did not offer us anything like the kind of money that would be acceptable to any football club. I don’t think anybody thought it was an amount of money that was acceptable so the player did not leave<br /><br />Every transfer window there is a chance to buy and sell players. I do not have a crystal ball, I do not know what is going to happen. There will be circumstances where it will be the right move for Wilfried and the football club and there will be circumstances when it won’t be and that will be down to the state the club is in at the time and the situation of the buying club. This is someone who has a strong affinity with the club and he is an extremely good person. He loves the fans, he loves the club. These things happen in football, he is aware of that. We want to look after him as best we can but I know he will always do the best for this football club</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace have signed <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s <a href="cenk-tosun.html">Cenk Tosun</a> on loan until the end of the season, a little over two years after the Turkey striker expressed relief about not ending up at Selhurst Park]</b> We’ve enjoyed a great first half of the campaign and Cenk’s arrival will bolster our squad as we push for a top-half <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> finish. Cenk has a proven record as a goalscorer and we’ve admired him for some time, so I’m very pleased to welcome him</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish thinks the measures proposed to allow <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games to resume amid the coronavirus pandemic would make them one of the safest places]</b> The issue of player and staff welfare has to be treated with the utmost seriousness. We must bring the players with us, we must listen to them, we must put the health of them and their families front and centre whenever we play again. It should be not just about rendering it safe for them but also making sure they feel safe. However I’ve seen all the proposals for training and travel and while there are challenges, those proposals offer a level of protection to players, staff and officials that I believe will render <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football one of the safest places in society to co-exist, much safer than a journey to the supermarket at present<br /><br /><b>[Aguero’s City team-mate Kevin De Bruyne suggested <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would return because of the financial aspect]</b> But, yes, it is partly about the money. And we should all care about the money. I’ll tell you why. Nobody wins if <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> receives less money. Nobody. We are already facing losses no one can quantify - and if we don’t finish the season we are entering uncharted waters</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has admitted that <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> may not return in 2019-20]</b> We would be derelict in our duty if we didn’t find a way to try and bring the game back. It may prove beyond us. The German example could provide a blueprint for us and clearly we can see some of the early challenges. They may prove insurmountable, but the concern for us is that if they prove insurmountable now then we may be in for a very, very extended period of not being able to play and that has huge ramifications for the game<br /><br />Deciding it competitively would be best, obviously if we can play in our own stadiums that would be preferable for everybody, but for the moment that situation is with government and the authorities and not with us. The police have made it clear that they don’t think they can police every ground. I have enormous sympathy with <b>[Watford chief executive]</b> <a href="scott-duxbury.html">Scott Duxbury</a>’s position. Having said that, I think it may well prove to be the least worst option. There are no easy answers, we have to work through it as a collective and I think we will come out with a consensus in the end<br /><br />Football is entirely unimportant in the context of the public health crisis, that has to come first. We will want assurances as clubs that we are not taking resources away from anyone. We simply can’t take tests away from anyone who is more needful than us. We have been told so far that these are private facilities that are not being utilised for this particular public health crisis. We will all want more clarity on that, it is essential that that is the case</p>
