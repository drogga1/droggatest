  <p><a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> announces he will take a break from fighting. Hang a 75-pound weight from his waist and <a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> will happily do one chin-up after another<br /><br />… a shopping list of distractions finally took their toll on one of Canada’s most famous athletes. Citing the pressures of being champion and of being in a constant limelight, St-Pierre said his life has become ‘completely insane’ and a ‘freaking zoo’<br /><br />UFC president <a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a> said No. 1 contender Johny (Bigg Rigg) Hendricks will fight No. 3 (Ruthless) Robbie Lawler for the title on March 15 in Dallas<br /><br />St-Pierre had cast doubt about his future last month following UFC 167, a controversial split decision win over Hendricks, when he said he needed time away from the sport to sort out some personal issues. That enraged White, who did not like the idea of one of his biggest assets walking away – especially in the aftermath of a controversial decision. But White calmed down after talking to St-Pierre later that night. And on Friday, he continued to downplay the drama<br /><br /><a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> said he has already conquered Everest three times before, when he lost to Matt Hughes (in 2004) and Matt (The Terror) Serra (in 2007) and when he came back (in 2012) from knee surgery. ‘And if I have to do a fourth time, believe me, I feel like I’m, going to do it’<br /><br /><a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a> called <a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> ‘the greatest welterweight ever’ and ‘the gold standard in everything’<br /><br />In 2008, he missed an interview session with a visiting reporter who was left standing outside a Montreal gym. His manager at the time advised that St-Pierre had suffered a minor injury earlier in the day and had forgotten about his interview with the reporter. The journalist told the manager not to worry, given they had already had a previously scheduled appointment for the next day. St-Pierre, however, had a different idea. He drove to the gym to collect the reporter and took him out for dinner to do the interview. Then he drove the reporter to his hotel, apologizing again for having being late<br /><br />While other fighters wore T-shirts and sweats, <a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> – taking a page from some champion boxers – always wore a suit for his post-fight news conferences<br /><br /><a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a>, who said he will keep training, has no need to fight again. He has made millions and made a point of looking after his family when the cheques started coming in. One of his first duties as champion was to pay off the mortgages of his parents and sisters<br /><br /><a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> was the first Canadian to hold a UFC title since Carlos (Ronin) Newton, who held the welterweight crown for seven months in 2001 before losing it to Matt Hughes<br /><br /><a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a>’s initial reign at champion was short-lived. Beset by family illness and lacking focus, GSP was upset by Matt (The Terror) Serra in his first title defence at UFC 69 in April 2007. … At the suggestion of a sports psychologist, he carried a brick around with Serra’s name inscribed on it. Then he threw it in the chilly waters of Montreal’s South Shore to bury the memory of the Serra loss<br /><br /><a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> also leads the UFC records in total strikes landed, significant strikes landed, takedowns landed and takedown accuracy rate, according to FightMetric<br /><br /><a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a> is not the first UFC champion to give up their title. Tim Sylvia voluntarily gave up the heavyweight championship belt in 2003 when he tested positive for steroids, which was a pre-emptive strike to being stripped. And Frank Shamrock voluntarily vacated his title in 1999 and retired, although he later returned to action outside the UFC</p>
