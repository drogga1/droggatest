He is a dynamic and versatile attacking player and thus increases the variability in our game. We are delighted that this highly talented player has chosen our club and we believe he will help us with his qualities</p>

He is 18 but already has international experience and can play both in the defence and in the defensive midfield. Despite many English offers, Ethan has decided to join us, and we now have another top talent in our ranks that is versatile enough to give our squad even more variation</p>

But the player absolutely wanted to change now. And that’s where our situation is simply different. His agent <a href="mino-raiola.html">Mino Raiola</a> called me and said that Erling has decided to join another club<br /><br />There is basically much more to it than just the transfer fee. There is the salary, signing fee, fees for the consultant and clauses on top of it<br /><br /><b>[When asked if <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> would be playing regularly if he had joined Leipzig]</b> No, with us there is no playing guarantee for any player! We have strong competition with <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a>, <a href="yussuf-poulsen.html">Yussi Poulsen</a>, Matheus Cunha and Patrik Schick. <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> would have fought for a place in the team with them.

He’s a fantastic player who’s technically very dangerous and has outstanding qualities in possession of the ball.
