  <p><b>[David McGoldrick extends <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> stay until summer 2022]</b> There’s nowhere else I’d rather be spending the next two years, so I’m over the moon to sign this extension and remain a part of this fantastic journey the club is on. As everyone has seen, this is a club that rewards and ties down those players that have contributed heavily to the success it’s enjoyed so I’m delighted the gaffer sees me in the same bracket as Billy, <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Ollie</a> and before that Enda and Flecky.

But the good news is coming back out of the club and I’m really pleased to have committed my future. It all starts again at Villa and that will be a tough first game back. It’s going to be different to normal in a lot of respects, but we believe we’re 100 per cent ready and as we’ve proved on numerous occasions that we’re a match for anyone</p>

  <p><b>[Sheffield United’s number one fan <a href="chris-wilder.html">Chris Wilder</a> lifts team]</b> You’ve got to remember our manager is a die-hard Blade and he shows all the emotions when we win, lose or draw. When we’re behind closed doors, we know we have one of our biggest supporters on our touchline, so we know we always have to put in a hundred per cent. It was great to see him celebrating, and all the boys celebrating in the changing room after. It was special and it’s special times at the minute.<br /><br />I obviously haven’t got that first <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> goal yet but we are seventh in the league and we are doing well. We’ve waited 15 years to be back in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, so just to be out there playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is special for me. I’m sure I will get that goal - no doubt about that, and the rest will follow after that. But as long as people are stepping up and scoring goals and keeping us in the top half of the table I’ll <b>[more than happily]</b> keep playing and not scoring for a long time!<br /><br />It’s a huge challenge for us on Saturday against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, a rejuvenated <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> really under the manager this year. I obviously know Frank from our tussles in The Championship. They were two really tight games we had last season against Derby. The way they play, I think they are one of the most free-flowing football teams in the division. Looking at it, it will certainly be one of the most difficult evenings we will experience in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> because they have got threats from everywhere. They are comfortable players who are very technical. They’ve got legs, they’ve got pace, they have got movement and they have got ability. I’m not surprised by the position they are in. They are challenging to get as high up as possible, like we are</p>

  <p><b>[Sheffield United investigate after David McGoldrick is racially abused]</b> As a club we will support David McGoldrick and will do all we can to find the perpetrator of this disgusting message. We will work with the relevant authorities to ensure the person behind this post is brought to justice. This cannot continue. Something needs to change</p>
