  <p><b>[on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, Suarez, and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>]</b> It’s amazing how they’ve worked it out. Suarez looked a bit of a square peg in a round hole when he first arrived. He was playing on the right side of attack.<br /><br /><a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> was still the centre-forward and didn’t look at home. I think we used the excuse, or the reasoning, that Suarez hadn’t played until October in that first season so he was a little bit rusty, but I think it was more the positional change.<br /><br />Eventually, we’re led to believe the three of them got together, particularly <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and Suarez, and suggested Suarez play as the focal point in attack and that’s allowed <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> to drift around to get on the ball.<br /><br />Whether he goes right, left or drops deep, in the past when <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> wanted to roam around as the false nine, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> lacked a centre-forward. It was left to a central midfield player to get there and to be the striker. The way they’ve worked it out is quite remarkable</p>

  <p><b>[Spanish football expert Terry Gibson has called the unfolding situation a bizarre episode and believes <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> is stagnating in his career]</b> He’s started one of the games since the return to play and he doesn’t even warm-up on the touchline now. He just sits there. He had the facemask pulled over his eyes and pretended he was asleep and the other night there’s a new picture where he’s got something rolled up and it looks like he’s looking for a telescope at the game. It’s bizarre. But I think it’s a real shame. I think it’s a lesson for big clubs that when they buy these big players they have to have a use for them because not many others can afford to take them off your hands</p>
