His progress is a reflection on him as a person and as an athlete, and to all those who gave him the opportunity to go the Olympics and become a member of the national team. Europe is now enjoying a player who was formed at Palmeiras.<br /><br />It is unfair to accredit Guardiola in such a short time. It was Cuca who was the foundations for him to star at Palmeiras, it was Oswaldo de Oliveira and Marcelo Oliveira who worked with him previously. Let’s be fair in that regard: Guardiola is reaping the fruit of the other coaches</p>

But on Thursday the two best teams in the campaign will face one another.<br /><br />Uruguay have won all six of their home games, five of which they have won in the first half. They set a strong tempo, with a very vertical style. They are players of high quality with great intelligence, real game intelligence. We will have to match them<br /><br />I am aware of the ability and quality of Suarez, but this team is very strong. The absence of Suarez is going to be important, but Uruguay have players to cover for that.

The message to all Brazilians is that talent alone does not win the World Cup, it’s about working hard.<br /><br />Luan had a fantastic Olympics and has shown a strong level consistency in his performances.

That is absolutely correct. Mano Menezes did the same. We have to grow and get better, always looking to get to a higher level.

They are opportunities to open up our range of options and evaluate them. Jemerson and Danilo are examples of us doing that.

By challenging them to be better than the opposition, to be more competitive, more loyal. When you demand performance, players raise their game technically. But if you put all the emphasis on results, that brings their level down. We can’t control the final result but we can control performance. I’m a coach who demands performance of the highest level.

I spoke to the players and allocated an area of responsibility to each of them. When you have one of the top three players in the world, it’s very easy just to leave the responsibility up to them. The fact is, though, each of us are all responsible to some extent for what happens. And that’s where the individual side of things and creative talent come in. I’ve made this an essential part of teamwork. I haven’t left it to one individual.<br /><br />On a personal level, he has a big heart. He’s a good kid. He has a supportive and caring side and not many people know that.</p>

  <p><b>[Tite gives his take on the modern game]</b> Technique is the most important thing in today’s game. That’s what the ability of coaches to organise their teams tactically, make them balanced and get their ideas across to players depends on. Physical fitness is also a key factor, especially when it comes to challenging for the ball and switching direction. Another factor, and perhaps the most important one, is mental strength, the ability to handle pressure and the mental demands of getting a result, which are always there. The ability to deal with pressure is hugely important. Success hinges on these four things</p>

This is a team in a process of consolidation, that has to mature mentally, and our two opponents in March will provide that, especially Germany<br /><br />It varies, but 15-18 players are already assured their World Cup, due to their performances at club level and for Brazil. This is a mobile team, physical and agile, but with a structure, able to think and execute very quickly. Coutinho, Willian, Gabriel Jesus, Neymar, Douglas Costa, Taison … they think fast and execute fast. The final third of the pitch requires that.

Anybody who wants to compare <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> to any other athlete…do you know what I do? I hear but I don’t listen. Once I said that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is extraordinary. I meant he’s extraordinary to the present time and among humans, with his creativity. <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> is out of normal patterns and I’m not saying this because I’m a Brazilian. You can’t find a defect. If somebody comes to me and starts to make comparisons, for me it has no credibility</p>

  <p><b>[Tite says <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is essential but not irreplaceable]</b> <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> reassures you, because he brings unpredictability to your game. Because he will offer you an individual or collective solution that others cannot, and with him, the potential of a team is not the same, because he will sparkle. The <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> I am speaking of is the one who was within full mental and physical capacities. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is essential, but not irreplaceable<br /><br /><b>[After his side’s last eight exit at the hands of Belgium at the World Cup in Russia two years ago]</b> The position has become very exposed, the responsibility is immense and each coach is faced with the same challenge</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil boss Tite says Guimaraes or <a href="lucas-paqueta.html">Paqueta</a> can be Selecao’s De Bruyne]</b> We currently lack a relay midfielder. A player like Falcao in the past. Or like De Bruyne today, able to play sometimes lower to help <a href="casemiro.html">Casemiro</a> and make the game start again, sometimes higher to bring more creativity, speed and percussion. <a href="bruno-guimaraes.html">Bruno Guimaraes</a>, who just signed for <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> and was the best under-23 player qualified for the (now postponed) Olympic Games, has enormous potential and can be that player. I also think of <a href="lucas-paqueta.html">Paqueta</a>, who plays in Milan.<br /><br /><b>[Tite saw De Bruyne’s talents up close when his rasping strike proved decisive in the 2018 World Cup quarter-final between Belgium and Brazil]</b> Of all the matches I have run, this is the one where we have displayed the highest quality. The result is not indicative of our performance</p>
