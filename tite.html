  <p><b>[Tite speaks about how his successful start managing the national team]</b> By challenging the players to achieve excellence, to be better and better regardless of whether we’d qualified or not. By challenging them to be better than the opposition, to be more competitive, more loyal. When you demand performance, players raise their game technically. But if you put all the emphasis on results, that brings their level down. We can’t control the final result but we can control performance. I’m a coach who demands performance of the highest level. Maybe that’s the fuel the national team needs to keep on developing</p>

  <p><b>[Tite gives his take on the modern game]</b> Technique is the most important thing in today’s game. That’s what the ability of coaches to organise their teams tactically, make them balanced and get their ideas across to players depends on. Physical fitness is also a key factor, especially when it comes to challenging for the ball and switching direction. Another factor, and perhaps the most important one, is mental strength, the ability to handle pressure and the mental demands of getting a result, which are always there. The ability to deal with pressure is hugely important. Success hinges on these four things</p>

We talked about three aspects that we can make public, not all the conversation but these things we can. Firstly, his moment and how he felt.

We have to give him time and take care of him. He still has to perfect a lot of things, but his natural talent is bigger than everything he needs to improve on. He also has to work hard on an emotional level and look after himself. He has a charisma like no other and everyone loves him. He has earned everyone’s love</p>
