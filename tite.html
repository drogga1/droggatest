  <p><b>[Tite speaks about how his successful start managing the national team]</b> By challenging the players to achieve excellence, to be better and better regardless of whether we’d qualified or not. By challenging them to be better than the opposition, to be more competitive, more loyal. When you demand performance, players raise their game technically. But if you put all the emphasis on results, that brings their level down. We can’t control the final result but we can control performance. I’m a coach who demands performance of the highest level. Maybe that’s the fuel the national team needs to keep on developing</p>

  <p><b>[Tite gives his take on the modern game]</b> Technique is the most important thing in today’s game. That’s what the ability of coaches to organise their teams tactically, make them balanced and get their ideas across to players depends on. Physical fitness is also a key factor, especially when it comes to challenging for the ball and switching direction. Another factor, and perhaps the most important one, is mental strength, the ability to handle pressure and the mental demands of getting a result, which are always there. The ability to deal with pressure is hugely important. Success hinges on these four things</p>

  <p><b>[Tite says Lionel Messi is an alien but Brazil were able to neutralise him in their Copa America semi-final defeat of Argentina]</b> I talked to Scaloni, maybe after he spoke to you <b>[the media]</b>, but Messi is an alien. Messi is exceptional. He deserves such consideration, that reverence he deserves. And to neutralise such a player, with your actions on the field, you can’t stop him. We had to tinker with the structure of the team, so we brought Firmino a little further back to close the midfield to reduce his actions, and also to explore our speed. We scored and then got less possession of the ball than we normally do, but we brought effectiveness and we were decisive. It’s another step, happy, but it’s another step to the final and tomorrow <b>[Wednesday]</b> we will see the other opponent.<br /><br /><b>[Brazil were without Richarlison, Filipe Luis and Fernandinho against Argentina but Tite hopes the trio may be available for the final]</b> Filipe Luis is already recovering from the injury, but as for the physical aspect, he could not withstand the 90 minutes, even more with a possibility of extra time. And on the other hand, Alex Sandro has come in very well. Fernandinho is in a process of evolution, maybe if I needed him during the game, he would come in. Even with some restriction. And Richarlison, I do not know, but he’s had a good recovery time for mumps. I believe the time has passed</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil coach Tite says star player Neymar would never be left out of one of his squads as long as he was fit to feature]</b> What I will say is that, concerning to a player with such a level and quality as Neymar, we would never leave him out of this group. We talked about three aspects that we can make public, not all the conversation but these things we can. Firstly, his moment and how he felt. He said he was happy, feeling okay and he had been working normally. I asked about his emotional situation because this influences the athlete’s performance. He said he was calm, that he knew things were taking their way and that he was waiting for PSG to give a definition of his situation. The third aspect we talked about was how he felt about playing before our matches, because there’s an optimal time to play as long as he’s available<br /><br /><b>[Philippe Coutinho was reportedly included in Barca’s offer to PSG for Neymar, and though the playmaker has struggled to cement a place at Camp Nou, Tite is confident he will soon rediscover his best form for club and country]</b> He’s had highs and lows. He started the Copa America, more precisely the first two matches, being the star of it. And then he drops a bit, but gets back to his level. He’s a great player and hopefully he’ll get back to that pattern from Liverpool. But it’s normal, sometimes, when you change clubs. I’m sure that getting back to his former level is his goal and ours too</p>

If he wasn’t fit, he wouldn’t be with the national team. We are not irresponsible to force a situation when it concerns the athlete’s health. Me and the coaching staff will be very attentive to his development.

I spoke a lot with him during these days and he is an amazing lad that has extraordinary talent. He has six or seven gears and incredible speed. When we see him playing in Madrid, we overvalue his ability to mature. Things are happening very quickly in his life. At times we forget that he is only 19 years old. We have to give him time and take care of him. He still has to perfect a lot of things, but his natural talent is bigger than everything he needs to improve on. He also has to work hard on an emotional level and look after himself. He has a charisma like no other and everyone loves him. He has earned everyone’s love</p>

It’s not that you can only see it, you can feel it. <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a> is playing his normal football in a role that he also has at Liverpool<br /><br /><b>[Tite was criticised by <a href="rivaldo.html">Rivaldo</a> after the loss to Argentina. However, Tite would not be drawn into firing back at Rivaldo]</b> I respect opinions, I don’t give opinions on them. I learnt to respect them. And I also have a very clear opinion on <a href="rivaldo.html">Rivaldo</a>. He was a great player and the image that comes to me is of him controlling the ball on the chest and scoring in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. The most beautiful thing in this world. That’s my opinion</p>

  <p><b>[Tite rejected criticism of his decision to play <a href="rodrygo.html">Rodrygo</a> Goes for just two minutes in Brazil’s 3-0 win over South Korea on Tuesday]</b> It’s one thing to throw <a href="rodrygo.html">Rodrygo</a> into a system that’s already structured, like <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. It’s another thing to put him in a team that is being reassembled, even if he was doing the same job in the same position. It was so hard to organise for the team for today and they responded well. They were close to scoring a fourth and a fifth. It was a chance for <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a>, Renan Lodi and Militao. They earned the chance and asserted themselves. Could it have been <a href="rodrygo.html">Rodrygo</a>? Yes, but I preserved the continuity and the good moment of the team in the game<br /><br />I talked to <a href="rodrygo.html">Rodrygo</a> and said he had to be very proud of his behaviour. As a person, as an example. I asked him to give a hug to his parents for the education they gave. Say thanks to Jair Ventura, the coach who launched him. He is an example for a lot of young boys who would like to be in his position. He must think I am a little crazy, because I was talking and I do not know him, this is our first meeting. But I saw that when he scored the first goal <b>[against Galatasaray]</b> he went to hug <b>[Karim]</b> <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a>, who assisted. When he completed the hat-trick, I saw the television camera was focusing on him and he didn’t look at the camera. He took the ball and kissed it and stood there. He becomes an example for a number of boys. Football is a transformation agent, both for good and for bad. He’s like that, and I ended up telling him to hug his parents. I don’t know them, but they deserve it.</p>

  <p><b>[Tite on comparisons between <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> and Lionel Messi]</b> <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> is incomparable. Anybody who wants to compare <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> to any other athlete…do you know what I do? I hear but I don’t listen. Once I said that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is extraordinary. I meant he’s extraordinary to the present time and among humans, with his creativity. <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> is out of normal patterns and I’m not saying this because I’m a Brazilian. You can’t find a defect. If somebody comes to me and starts to make comparisons, for me it has no credibility</p>

  <p><b>[Tite says <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is essential but not irreplaceable]</b> <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> reassures you, because he brings unpredictability to your game.

  <p><b>[Brazil boss Tite says Guimaraes or Paqueta can be Selecao’s De Bruyne]</b> We currently lack a relay midfielder. A player like Falcao in the past. Or like De Bruyne today, able to play sometimes lower to help <a href="casemiro.html">Casemiro</a> and make the game start again, sometimes higher to bring more creativity, speed and percussion. <a href="bruno-guimaraes.html">Bruno Guimaraes</a>, who just signed for <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> and was the best under-23 player qualified for the (now postponed) Olympic Games, has enormous potential and can be that player. I also think of Paqueta, who plays in Milan.<br /><br /><b>[Tite saw De Bruyne’s talents up close when his rasping strike proved decisive in the 2018 World Cup quarter-final between Belgium and Brazil]</b> Of all the matches I have run, this is the one where we have displayed the highest quality. The result is not indicative of our performance</p>
