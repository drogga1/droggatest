  <p><b>[Manchester United confirmed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as their new interim manager on Wednesday]</b> Obviously, Kieran worked with a lot of the <b>[Under-18s]</b> boys last year and knows them well, and Michael Carrick has been absolutely fantastic with all the young players. He’s absolutely brilliant with the way he speaks to them, and the way he comes and speaks to them after training sometimes. It’s a great support, it’s very much the way Manchester United is, a family feel. We’re all working together for a common purpose in the academy and that’s to get players through to the first team.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s Under-18s head coach Neil Ryan hailed Mason Greenwood a match-winner]</b> Mason’s the match-winner it’s clear, you can see he’s going to get you goals and he’s always dangerous, but you can’t underestimate the rest of the team and the work they’ve done. D’Mani Mellor ran himself into the ground, and so did every player on the pitch. We’re not just a one-man team, it’s the full squad and we have players to come back. Yes, Mason was fantastic, I can’t fault that. Great goals, and he gets a hat-trick in one of the biggest games, and we want more of these big games for our boys<br /><br />I think we’re a good club for making sure we quieten all that hype down because he’s still got a long way to go, let’s get it right. He’s doing very, very well this year; he was on the bench last week against Valencia, which was a great experience for him. We’ve got great staff who are looking after him on and off the pitch, and for ourselves as coaching staff it’s our jobs to make sure we get him to the next level. It’s going to be a challenge for him, but a great challenge and he’s had a great four or five months so far and we’ve got to keep working with him<br /><br />Any tournament you enter you want to win, don’t you? Every player in there wants to win every tournament they enter. We’re in the league, the Premier League Cup quarter-finals, we’re into the next round <b>[of the Youth Cup]</b> and we’ll have a difficult game against Brighton - I’m sure of it - and we’ll just continue to keep going</p>

  <p><b>[After impressing in his early appearances for Neil Ryan’s U18s side, it was not long before <a href="hannibal-mejbri.html">Hannibal Mejbri</a> was called up to the U23s]</b> He is a talented boy and like all good players he will get targeted by any opposition. That is what he has to learn, how to channel and focus his energies and not to get caught up in that</p>
