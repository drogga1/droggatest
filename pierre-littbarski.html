  <p><b>[1990 winner Pierre Littbarski in FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour]</b> When I touched the cup, I felt myself back on the stage when we actually received the World Cup. It’s really just an indescribable feeling.</p>

  <p><b>[How European mega stars are adapting to Japan &amp; the J-League]</b> This must sound strange but I was falling a lot because the grass was totally different. Especially with my style of playing - short turns and moves, and dribbling a lot with the ball - I was falling quite a few times over the ball because the game was slower. It was really strange. I couldn’t understand what was happening. It took me two weeks to adapt to it.<br /><br />Very simply, you can say that generally, the European footballer is playing more for himself, for his own success. The Japanese is thinking about the team’s success. That is a huge difference<br /><br />I was really positively surprised about how they treated me, not only because I was a famous player. Generally, even people who didn’t know me were very helpful, very open. When I had a problem, they tried to help. Sure, the language barrier was there but generally, everybody was very kind. That was not what I was expecting<br /><br />When I started in ‘93 with the J-League, there were huge differences between Europe and Japan in terms of reacting professionally and having tactical answers in terms of reacting to situations, changing the game’s rhythm when the opponent is one goal up<br /><br />They are much more flexible. They actually study other football styles, other tactics, and they’re quite good in bringing them to the pitch. In the last World Cup, the national team really played with a lot of flexibility in some games. In terms of finishing, they still lack quality in front of the goal. But the games are more competitive in the league<br /><br />They’re really respecting the opponents. That is different than in Europe. In Europe, you just play to win and use everything possible<br /><br />I came as a little stubborn German personality, small-minded, and it was actually an eye-opener for me that you can really do things differently. My daily life was totally different<br /><br /><b>[Littbarski grew]</b> from a very small-minded football player to a quite open personality, understanding and seeing other cultures, understanding that there are several ways to approach people, having some respect. I think they gave me a lot in terms of seeing the world differently, you know.</p>
