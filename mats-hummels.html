  <p><b>[There is nothing complicated about putting the ball in the net but it has proven beyond <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s batch of forwards this season. In a campaign as tight as this, that is a crucial fact]</b> We have to be more efficient. We have created 270 chances this season, yet we sit last in the league table. I don’t know what’s up. This is a unique situation <b>[…]</b> Our situation has not improved. I understand the fans’ frustration. We all feel the same. We didn’t put in a lacklustre performance, but we did not play well either. We always score fewer goals than our opponents and sit last after 19 games. It would be a disgrace if one of the players were to get angry with the fans for their reaction</p>

We have a very good relationship and we talk a lot, we talk a lot. I like his ideas, I am very surprised if they interpret my words as criticising the coach. I do not think so at all<br /><br /><b>[Specifically addressing his post-Paderborn comments]</b> If we have to press and press, my opinion is that we are better in this system. I feel that the coach had the same impression against Paderborn, otherwise he would not have switched to it</p>

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels says the <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> players are sometimes too quiet on the pitch]</b> We just look at our performances - and they have been very changeable this season. But nothing is lost yet. When we find our shape and go on a run, we can quickly get where we want to go in the table. It would be nice if we are in top form when the titles are given out. Until then we have to stay up there. Part of us sometimes have to be woken up a bit in games. The 4-0 win against Leverkusen (in September) sounds convincing, but in fact we had big problems in the first 20 minutes. We sometimes go into the games and see how it works. Sometimes we flip the switch only when there is no other way. If we get that under control, we can be a top team. This is not a thing you change in one or two days. We have to work it out for ourselves. When you look at the training sessions, there has been a development in recent weeks: mentality, attitude and sharpness<br /><br />I try to fill that role in life and take responsibility. Especially on the pitch where I verbally try to drive, order and cheer. It is already an issue in our team that sometimes we are a bit quiet. That is why it is very important that the leaders take the lead. And also, outside of the pitch, you have to perform this role positively and as a role model for appointments, interviews and autograph sessions<br /><br />In the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, no team really marches ahead. This is mainly because the level - contrary to what is often written - has clearly increased. The small teams no longer travel to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> or (Bayern) Munich to be shot down. They have become much stronger tactically and individually and have a clear plan. That’s why the well-known teams lose more points. In my view, this year (personally) has been absolutely satisfactory. I fought back at <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> after being in a difficult situation and won the double. In <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> I immediately regained my footing. My big goal is to round off the good first half of the season in the new year with a title. We want to stay in all three competitions and be there when it matters</p>

Of course I give him some tips how this works. He has more goals in 57 minutes than I will score in the whole season<br /><br /><b>[I hope <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> stays]</b> as long as I am here. At least I wish so. I played together with <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> for many years, so I know a good striker when I see one. <b>[<a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>]</b> is not at the same level yet, though</p>

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels speaks after his side’s narrow semi-final defeat by <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> in the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League]</b> We deserved it. <a href="toni-kroos.html">Toni Kroos</a> told me after the game: ‘We did not win that thing. You only have yourselves to blame that you are not in the final.’ Unfortunately, he is right. I think it’s an even bigger disappointment <b>[than 2017]</b> because throughout the game, we were so close to knocking out one of the best teams in the world, which is rare. But somehow, Real gets through these matches again and again this year. These games are things to remember after your career. But honestly, I think it will hurt in ten years</p>

Anyone who knows me knows that Munich will always be a special place for me. But after the talks with the people in charge in Munich and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, it soon became clear to me that my footballing home would again be at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> in the future.

We just have to hope that they will drop points three times in six games. If there’s any chance, we want to be there to take it.</p>
