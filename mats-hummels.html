  <p><b>[There is nothing complicated about putting the ball in the net but it has proven beyond <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>’s batch of forwards this season. In a campaign as tight as this, that is a crucial fact]</b> We have to be more efficient. We have created 270 chances this season, yet we sit last in the league table. I don’t know what’s up. This is a unique situation <b>[…]</b> Our situation has not improved. I understand the fans’ frustration. We all feel the same. We didn’t put in a lacklustre performance, but we did not play well either. We always score fewer goals than our opponents and sit last after 19 games. It would be a disgrace if one of the players were to get angry with the fans for their reaction</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern star Mats Hummels admits to Champions League fear of Klopp’s men]</b> I know how strong Klopp’s teams are. I know how good his teams are when they get to this level. Sometimes it is a bit more difficult against the teams in the lower half of the schedule. But his teams always perform at the highest when they face the best teams. That’s for certain. I don’t think there was a team remaining who wanted to face Liverpool. They work so hard, they play so intense and aggressively with the quality of players they have - especially up front.<br /><br /><b>[On Jurgen Klopp]</b> It was almost like family between us. Of course we had our issues from time to time. One day we would be there, screaming at each other. But the next day? It was all fine. He understood me, I understood him. Each of us would know why the other one would act like he did. We never, ever had a big problem. He always considers what you say. He doesn’t always agree and he has the final word. But he considers it and he will say ‘OK’ or … ‘Think about it again’. He is the boss</p>

You only have yourselves to blame that you are not in the final.’ Unfortunately, he is right. I think it’s an even bigger disappointment <b>[than 2017]</b> because throughout the game, we were so close to knocking out one of the best teams in the world, which is rare. But somehow, Real gets through these matches again and again this year. These games are things to remember after your career. But honestly, I think it will hurt in ten years</p>

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels’ take on the debate as evidence that Leroy Sane’s perceived arrogance had counted against him]</b> Leroy Sane has not the same standing as Thomas Muller or Mesut Ozil. Sometimes it takes time to have the same standing in the national team as in your club. It is noticeable that the guys coming up from youth ranks - at Bayern too - are different guys to 10, 12 years ago. That is the new generation. They are characterised by a different behaviour, like on social media. I was always the youngest one in my team and I had to carry the goals. That is simply normal. Nowadays you notice some 18-year-olds don’t understand why they have to do this. I didn’t talk a single word in the Bayern locker room during the first weeks. I only talked to Stephan Furstner and Michael Rensing because I knew them from the second team. To everyone else, I maybe said ‘hello’, but today everything is faster and after one week players behave like they’ve already played three years for the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Germany defender Mats Hummels has hit out at the media and fans for disrespecting the 2014 World Cup winners]</b> They’re attacking everything right now, it’s disrespectful in my opinion. It’s actually disrespectful of what the players are showing. It’s not that we are living somehow in the past. It is still true that we have a really good team. We have a lot of top players and usually a good national team, but we are being treated like full-time amateurs. We have to live with that, and that will always be the case in football with the media and the fans. We have to deal with this disrespect.<br /><br />It’s a mixture of bad luck and the failure to convert chances in attack, but three goals is too many. In my opinion, we have not played a bad game since the World Cup, but we did not get good results. We did not play well and did not get good results at the World Cup. The mood in the dressing room was a bit different. We’re playing well but failing to reward ourselves, and of course we made mistakes on the goals we conceded. The big picture is not bad<br /><br />We’re playing against the reigning world champion in France, which will not be an easy task again. First of all, the performance has to be right, but the result has to be right now too. We have to win in France, we can not go behind. It’s the classic case of we have to make our own luck</p>

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels has lamented the part he played in Bayern Munich’s 3-2 defeat at the hands of Borussia Dortmund]</b> Unfortunately it got me a bit on Friday. I really wanted to try playing, first because it’s such a big game and secondly for myself personally. But there you have it, you saw my head was not quite there. Two such mistakes since 2010 or around then.<br /><br />We played a very, very good first half, completely dominated the game and deservedly got to the break with the lead. Then it became more open in the second half. We had done well to prevent them countering in the first half, their main strength, but that came in the second. We didn’t help ourselves by losing the ball easily, and I was partly to blame<br /><br />There are still six games left until the winter break. If we make it up a bit before then, it doesn’t look so bad, but if we lose a few points before then, then that’s that. So, we have to make sure we can get the job done, build on our first half, and get back to our real game in the next few weeks</p>

  <p><b>[Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels have not been playing well enough to warrant Germany call-ups]</b> If seven or eight players play offensively, then it’s clear that the offensive force is greater than the defensive stability. That’s what I often say internally. Our stability is not good, you have to say - often only Jerome <b>[Boateng]</b> and I were at the back, so they mercilessly attacked us.</p>

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels believes the Champions League last-16 tie against Liverpool is finely balanced after the 0-0 draw at Anfield in the first leg]</b> Still at 50:50. If we do not win our home game, we will not get another chance. We are satisfied. But we did not win 2-0, so we definitely have to win the second leg. This is always possible for a team like Bayern Munich. The result is satisfactory, but nothing more.<br /><br />We will act more aggressively, but at the same time we will have to put a stop to the concentrated offensive power of Liverpool. We have got a better starting position than most people would have thought<br /><br />We managed to slow down the pace of Liverpool. We wanted to prevent the opponent with three fast offensive players in the counter play. We have done well. The back four was focused on the defence. We did not offer as much space as in the league<br /><br /><b>[on Niko Kovac’s gameplan]</b> He specified exactly what we have finally implemented. The plan worked. We wanted the opponent not to play properly. They kept trying to set the mood, but then we took a bit of time out of the clock and let the ball run through the back rows</p>

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels has admitted he does not understand Joachim Low’s decision to retire him, Jerome Boateng and Thomas Muller from the German national team]</b> With a little distance, I also want to comment on the decision of the national coach. Regardless of the, in my view, difficult sporting decision (which I respect, of course), the way I received it is incomprehensible … In my opinion, I always had a good relationship with the people involved in the DFB and we have always treated each other fairly. Thomas, Jerome and I have been giving everything to the national team for years and in my opinion this decision does not do justice to what we have accomplished and achieved. And that leaves me anything but cold, because I loved playing for Germany! For me, I can say: they were wonderful years, 70 international matches that exceed everything that I once dreamed of as a child, by far. A total of four big tournaments where I was allowed to participate, crowned by winning the 2014 World Cup. I will carry that feeling forever and I would really like to do EVERYTHING to repeat something similar</p>

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels says the <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> players are sometimes too quiet on the pitch]</b> We just look at our performances - and they have been very changeable this season. But nothing is lost yet. When we find our shape and go on a run, we can quickly get where we want to go in the table. It would be nice if we are in top form when the titles are given out. Until then we have to stay up there. Part of us sometimes have to be woken up a bit in games. The 4-0 win against Leverkusen (in September) sounds convincing, but in fact we had big problems in the first 20 minutes. We sometimes go into the games and see how it works. Sometimes we flip the switch only when there is no other way. If we get that under control, we can be a top team. This is not a thing you change in one or two days. We have to work it out for ourselves. When you look at the training sessions, there has been a development in recent weeks: mentality, attitude and sharpness<br /><br />I try to fill that role in life and take responsibility. Especially on the pitch where I verbally try to drive, order and cheer. It is already an issue in our team that sometimes we are a bit quiet. That is why it is very important that the leaders take the lead. And also, outside of the pitch, you have to perform this role positively and as a role model for appointments, interviews and autograph sessions<br /><br />In the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, no team really marches ahead. This is mainly because the level - contrary to what is often written - has clearly increased. The small teams no longer travel to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> or (Bayern) Munich to be shot down. They have become much stronger tactically and individually and have a clear plan. That’s why the well-known teams lose more points. In my view, this year (personally) has been absolutely satisfactory. I fought back at <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> after being in a difficult situation and won the double. In <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> I immediately regained my footing. My big goal is to round off the good first half of the season in the new year with a title. We want to stay in all three competitions and be there when it matters</p>
