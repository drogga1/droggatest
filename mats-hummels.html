This is a unique situation <b>[…]</b> Our situation has not improved. I understand the fans’ frustration. We all feel the same. We didn’t put in a lacklustre performance, but we did not play well either. We always score fewer goals than our opponents and sit last after 19 games. It would be a disgrace if one of the players were to get angry with the fans for their reaction</p>

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels acknowledged Germany must improve in the final third if they are to make an impression at Euro 201]</b> Of course it is annoying if we do not seize the opportunities, because it would make our lives much easier. This is a matter on which we have to work. We knew that the Georgians are technically much stronger than it says <b>[in]</b> the world rankings. This is something that the coach clearly addressed before the game. In some situations, the Georgia players were running up very freely with two or three players to us because we were pushing forward as we had not taken our chances. That is hard for any team.</p>

  <p><b>[England are among the favourites to win Euro 2016]</b> In my opinion they are one of the top teams, and among the five or six teams that will challenge for the trophy next summer. They have a lot of good, young players and have managed to build a very strong squad - both defensively and offensively. They have proved that both in World Cup and Euro qualification - it will be a good test for us. It is important, especially in terms of building confidence. Although you have to say, the Euros are not won in early spring. We want to put in a good performance, and give the fans something to enjoy.</p>

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels has stated his support for introducing ‘orange cards’ in football as well as cracking down on time wasting]</b> Timed penalties <b>[off the pitch as punishment]</b> are an option, I think that’s not a bad idea. Of all the proposals, this could be the best to implement<br /><br />I think we need to start to punish time wasting more rigorously, for example with more additional time or earlier yellow cards. We had some opponents this year which started time wasting in the 15th minute. If referees were willing to show a yellow card after 20 minutes, the issue would have been settled and the player who did it could not do it again. But currently it is often the case that the refs wait until the 87th minute to show a card<br /><br />A video referee is useful for sure. Some people may say wrong decisions belong in football, but if a final is decided in the 90th minute by a wrong decision, for me that is not a fair result. A mistake decided the game. If we talk about that, I would be delighted If I would know you can watch the replay afterwards. And if <b>[there is not enough evidence]</b> to overturn the decision which was made you just retain the original call. In my eyes that’s quite simple<br /><br />The shootout <b>[proposal]</b> is an idea, but I don’t know if that would make any difference in contrast to penalties and in a few years’ time we would be thinking about something new again. You could do that, but actually penalties already offer a lot of drama<br /><br /><b>[On getting rid of offsides]</b> No, that makes no sense</p>

Of course it’s a pity for me that he is having such a bad period at the moment. They were eliminated from the FA Cup and League Cup. I’m supporting him and I wish him success. They are having a hard time at the moment.<br /><br /><b>[Carlo Ancelotti’s side are finding it tougher to exert their authority on domestic rivals]</b> I’ve not been here so I only observed it externally. Nevertheless, it’s true we are less dominant than Bayern have been in the last few years. But I think in general across Europe, you see many teams having these problems. There is not a single team playing well all of the time. Maybe it’s the case this year that the supposed smaller teams are even stronger and are making it more difficult for the giants. The Bundesliga table is strange if you compare it to the pre-season expectations</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich defender Mats Hummels has insisted that his side are not playing their best football at the moment]</b> For me personally, everything is great this season. I’m very happy with how I’m doing as a player. As a team, our results and our position in the table is okay. Even though on the pitch we aren’t always playing at the level we expected. That’s one thing we see, but it’s something you can change immediately simply because you’ve noticed it. We must work hard in order to change it. Nevertheless we’re in first place, four points clear of the rest which means that we can’t have done too badly so far. But yes, of course, we’re still very far from our best.<br /><br />It’s a difficult but very attractive tie. It’s nice, because it’s in stark contrast to all our other matches. Arsenal are a team that wants to play football, they like to be in possession. Since Arsene Wenger’s been there, so about 20 years, that’s what they’ve stood for. It will certainly be a completely different game to what we face in our Bundesliga matches. They’re not an opponent that only defends and attempts the counter attack. So you have to classify this game in complete isolation to any others and not consider what’s happened before, or what can happen after<br /><br />For me it’s always difficult <b>[to make such comparisons]</b> as you have ups and downs during a season. They had a period where they looked the strongest Arsenal team for a long time. I think they won seven or eight league games. But that’s the same as us. We have good periods and bad periods. You can’t predict what sort of form Arsenal or Bayern will be in</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich defender Mats Hummels believes that the scoreline in Tuesday’s Champions League win over Arsenal does not reflect the true nature of a competitive match]</b> The 5-1 does not tell the story of the game. The red card was a defining moment, then we had one man more on the pitch and scored to make it 1-1. That stole Arsenal’s thunder as they would have needed to score four goals to reach extra time. With one man down it was clear they would not reach that.<br /><br />I think the ref decided correctly. From the pitch it didn’t look like a duel for the ball but instead a cynical foul to prevent a clear chance.<br /><br />Theoretically there are four more games until the final. It’s foreseeable we can reach it, but to get there, we have really to deliver. There will be only difficult tasks now. We are in very good shape, but we have to go game by game. We should not think that two convincing results mean we will reach the final. We have to know one bad day can be the end and that’s why we have to prevent that</p>

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels is adamant there is no reason to feel sorry for Arsenal after Bayern Munich hammered Arsene Wenger’s side 10-2]</b> I don’t know if you can feel sorry in sports <b>[for your opponent]</b>. You just have to do your best and it was very unlucky in the end for them. They had 50 good minutes and it can happen. Maybe we will face them in the coming years and face the same problem as them. I don’t think we have to be sorry, it is just sports. If you win, you just enjoy it. It doesn’t look good, of course, <b>[for Arsenal]</b> and that’s too bad. Maybe they felt they could score the goals and it was okay for them to keep playing like this but then we played things really well. I experienced it for myself. I lost 5-1 to Bayern Munich <b>[when I was at Dortmund]</b>, when we felt we did a good job and we were not that bad to get beat like that. It was in Munich, in my last season with Dortmund. We lost 5-1 and it was pretty close until they scored the fourth goal. Bayern are a team that can go fast in one direction.<br /><br />Of course, we tried to focus but we have to say we weren’t that aware of the game 100% from the beginning and I think there were some situations where you can see that we were not thinking as fast as we usually think. You saw Arsenal got a lot of second balls in the first half which was a problem for us and you can say it was not 100% from the beginning, we were not lazy, but it was not 100%. It was tough in the first 45 minutes and the chance from Giroud meant they had the chance to make it close, but with the red card, the game was over and everybody knew. They <b>[Arsenal]</b> wanted to keep being offensive and scored one goal, the way they played <b>[up until the red card]</b>, maybe they felt like they would have deserved to win. Then when they went down to 10 men, we were very clever on the counter-attacks. We had some very nice goals. They lost the balls sometimes too easily. Sometimes these results can happen in a game which was clearly not a five-one</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern star Mats Hummels admits to Champions League fear of Klopp’s men]</b> I know how strong Klopp’s teams are. I know how good his teams are when they get to this level. Sometimes it is a bit more difficult against the teams in the lower half of the schedule. But his teams always perform at the highest when they face the best teams. That’s for certain. I don’t think there was a team remaining who wanted to face Liverpool. They work so hard, they play so intense and aggressively with the quality of players they have - especially up front.<br /><br /><b>[On Jurgen Klopp]</b> It was almost like family between us. Of course we had our issues from time to time. One day we would be there, screaming at each other. But the next day? It was all fine. He understood me, I understood him. Each of us would know why the other one would act like he did. We never, ever had a big problem. He always considers what you say. He doesn’t always agree and he has the final word. But he considers it and he will say ‘OK’ or … ‘Think about it again’. He is the boss</p>

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels’ take on the debate as evidence that Leroy Sane’s perceived arrogance had counted against him]</b> Leroy Sane has not the same standing as Thomas Muller or Mesut Ozil. Sometimes it takes time to have the same standing in the national team as in your club. It is noticeable that the guys coming up from youth ranks - at Bayern too - are different guys to 10, 12 years ago. That is the new generation. They are characterised by a different behaviour, like on social media. I was always the youngest one in my team and I had to carry the goals. That is simply normal. Nowadays you notice some 18-year-olds don’t understand why they have to do this. I didn’t talk a single word in the Bayern locker room during the first weeks. I only talked to Stephan Furstner and Michael Rensing because I knew them from the second team. To everyone else, I maybe said ‘hello’, but today everything is faster and after one week players behave like they’ve already played three years for the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Germany defender Mats Hummels has hit out at the media and fans for disrespecting the 2014 World Cup winners]</b> They’re attacking everything right now, it’s disrespectful in my opinion. It’s actually disrespectful of what the players are showing. It’s not that we are living somehow in the past. It is still true that we have a really good team. We have a lot of top players and usually a good national team, but we are being treated like full-time amateurs. We have to live with that, and that will always be the case in football with the media and the fans. We have to deal with this disrespect.<br /><br />It’s a mixture of bad luck and the failure to convert chances in attack, but three goals is too many. In my opinion, we have not played a bad game since the World Cup, but we did not get good results. We did not play well and did not get good results at the World Cup. The mood in the dressing room was a bit different. We’re playing well but failing to reward ourselves, and of course we made mistakes on the goals we conceded. The big picture is not bad<br /><br />We’re playing against the reigning world champion in France, which will not be an easy task again. First of all, the performance has to be right, but the result has to be right now too. We have to win in France, we can not go behind. It’s the classic case of we have to make our own luck</p>

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels has lamented the part he played in Bayern Munich’s 3-2 defeat at the hands of Borussia Dortmund]</b> Unfortunately it got me a bit on Friday. I really wanted to try playing, first because it’s such a big game and secondly for myself personally. But there you have it, you saw my head was not quite there. Two such mistakes since 2010 or around then.<br /><br />We played a very, very good first half, completely dominated the game and deservedly got to the break with the lead. Then it became more open in the second half. We had done well to prevent them countering in the first half, their main strength, but that came in the second. We didn’t help ourselves by losing the ball easily, and I was partly to blame<br /><br />There are still six games left until the winter break. If we make it up a bit before then, it doesn’t look so bad, but if we lose a few points before then, then that’s that. So, we have to make sure we can get the job done, build on our first half, and get back to our real game in the next few weeks</p>

This is always possible for a team like Bayern Munich.

We have got a better starting position than most people would have thought<br /><br />We managed to slow down the pace of Liverpool.

Thomas, Jerome and I have been giving everything to the national team for years and in my opinion this decision does not do justice to what we have accomplished and achieved. And that leaves me anything but cold, because I loved playing for Germany! For me, I can say: they were wonderful years, 70 international matches that exceed everything that I once dreamed of as a child, by far. A total of four big tournaments where I was allowed to participate, crowned by winning the 2014 World Cup.

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels says the <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> players are sometimes too quiet on the pitch]</b> We just look at our performances - and they have been very changeable this season. But nothing is lost yet. When we find our shape and go on a run, we can quickly get where we want to go in the table. It would be nice if we are in top form when the titles are given out. Until then we have to stay up there. Part of us sometimes have to be woken up a bit in games. The 4-0 win against Leverkusen (in September) sounds convincing, but in fact we had big problems in the first 20 minutes. We sometimes go into the games and see how it works. Sometimes we flip the switch only when there is no other way. If we get that under control, we can be a top team. This is not a thing you change in one or two days. We have to work it out for ourselves. When you look at the training sessions, there has been a development in recent weeks: mentality, attitude and sharpness<br /><br />I try to fill that role in life and take responsibility. Especially on the pitch where I verbally try to drive, order and cheer. It is already an issue in our team that sometimes we are a bit quiet. That is why it is very important that the leaders take the lead. And also, outside of the pitch, you have to perform this role positively and as a role model for appointments, interviews and autograph sessions<br /><br />In the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, no team really marches ahead. This is mainly because the level - contrary to what is often written - has clearly increased. The small teams no longer travel to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> or (Bayern) Munich to be shot down. They have become much stronger tactically and individually and have a clear plan. That’s why the well-known teams lose more points. In my view, this year (personally) has been absolutely satisfactory. I fought back at <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> after being in a difficult situation and won the double. In <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> I immediately regained my footing. My big goal is to round off the good first half of the season in the new year with a title. We want to stay in all three competitions and be there when it matters</p>

  <p><b>[Mats Hummels has joked about giving <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a> tips on how to score goals]</b> <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> is doing well. Of course I give him some tips how this works. He has more goals in 57 minutes than I will score in the whole season<br /><br /><b>[I hope <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> stays]</b> as long as I am here. At least I wish so. I played together with <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> for many years, so I know a good striker when I see one. <b>[<a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>]</b> is not at the same level yet, though</p>

  <p><b>[Hummels said of his three-season stint at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>]</b> I was able to get to know many great people and to experience many wonderful moments. Anyone who knows me knows that Munich will always be a special place for me. But after the talks with the people in charge in Munich and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, it soon became clear to me that my footballing home would again be at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> in the future. Hopefully we can build on the successful years we had before!</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="joshua-kimmich.html">Kimmich</a> delighted with ‘best goal’ of his career]</b> Sometimes games are decided by moments of genius. That was the case today. I think that all other teams are out of the title race. Now, it’s all in the hands of <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. We just have to hope that they will drop points three times in six games. If there’s any chance, we want to be there to take it.</p>
