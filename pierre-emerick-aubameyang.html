To rush and give a press conference while my father told him he would give his answer the next day: negative (by the way).<br /><br />Without even giving him the choice, for example, to negotiate over his staff … In short the day when the federation stops showing amateurism, the national team may then be able to move forward and find consistent results.</p>

Mesut Ozil and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang are among the Arsenal players chosen to model their new away kit for the 2019-20 campaign. The new kit, designed by Adidas, is based on the Gunners’s iconic ‘bruised banana’ kit worn during the early 1990s</p>

Hopefully he will start soon<br /><br /><b>[The 30-year-old also believes that the Gunners deserved their victory at St. James’ Park, despite the lacklustre nature of the game as a whole]</b> Yeah, I think <b>[the win was deserved]</b>. I think we fought a lot today. It was a great game against a good team in Newcastle. It was important today to start with a win. Last season we started badly and this season we won, so we are happy. It’s always positive for the squad <b>[to win the first game of the season]</b>. Everybody is now happy to have those three points.

  <p><b>[Aubameyang and Lacazette ready to fire with ‘weapon’ Nicolas Pepe]</b> We are happy that Nicolas came. Of course I have a special partnership with Laca, but I think we both have the same mentality. We play for the team first, so I think it is going to be easy <b>[to play with Pepe]</b>. We have tried to connect with him in training and for the moment it is going good, very good<br /><br /><b>[And that raises the prospect of all three of Arsenal’s star attackers starting for the first time together]</b> I think everybody is excited about that. We know he <b>[Pepe]</b> can help us to reach our goals. It is another weapon for us and that is very, very good. It will be difficult I think for him <b>[Unai Emery]</b>, but that’s the game. When you have a good team it is like that and you have to make choices. The next game we play at home and we will see what is the decision of the coach, but as I say I am looking forward to it<br /><br /><b>[His expert finish from Ainsley Maitland-Niles’ fine pass ensured Arsenal returned home from the north-east with maximum points]</b> It is always good to start like that when you are a striker. When you score you feel happy, you feel confident. We were happy to start like that. I think last season we started a bit bad, but this time we did well and were happy to get the three points. Every game is important, but of course the first game of the season is really important. I am happy that we took the three points away. We knew it was going to be hard and it was, but we didn’t concede a goal and it was a good job from the team<br /><br /><b>[Two players who were not involved in Newcastle were Mesut Ozil and Sad Kolasinac, who both stayed at home due to the ongoing security situation involving them and their families in London. And Aubameyang admits it is tough to see his team-mates having to endure such a distressing situation]</b> I think everyone is a bit sad because it is not good when you have problems in life, especially when it is your team-mates. I feel bad for them, but I hope that it is all going to be good. I am thinking about their families. I know it is not easy, but hopefully the police will do good things for them and protect them. We send them messages. When we see them at training we are happy they are safe and hopefully it is going to be a better situation in the future. We were thinking about them <b>[on Sunday]</b> and we got the win for them, so that’s good</p>

Players like David Luiz, Dani Ceballos, they came here and now we feel stronger.

I think that this team has a lot to do and can improve a lot. It can fight for competitions, it’s going to be step by step, working hard. It’s a pleasure to be here. Everybody’s humble, everybody wants to learn, everyone wants to improve. We want this club to shine again. It’s great to feel the support from everybody, I just try to do my best. Our style is to play football and also understand the plan for the game. When you train, when you have confidence with the team, you have to try the plan.

  <p><b>[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang believes his budding partnership with Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pepe can be as productive for Arsenal as the fearsome front line pieced together by Liverpool]</b> As we’ve seen from last season, Liverpool play with three up front and they play very well. Why not us? I think we can do it. It will be a tough game against them. They are great players. They always try to go forward and try to get goals and assist each other. They are one of the best trios in the world<br /><br /><b>[The Gabon international added on Arsenal’s crop of frontmen and comparisons to Liverpool’s]</b> I see a lot of similarities. Pepe and me, we are quick players like Mane and Salah, while Laca is a player who can keep the ball and is really good with his feet like Firmino. So yes, we can say we are close enough<br /><br />If asked, playing out wide is not a problem. I’ve played a lot of times on the right and the left during my career, so I am used to it<br /><br /><b>[On the challenges of playing out wide]</b> You have to run a bit more! You have to provide a few more crosses for the guys in the middle. It’s a bit of a different job. When you are a striker you have to keep hold of the ball and you have to score goals. When you are out wide you have to run and defend a bit more than if you are playing as a striker through the middle, but it’s not a problem<br /><br /><b>[He went on to say, having netted 31 times across all competitions last term]</b> My target this year is to get more goals than last season. It was only my first full season so I can be happy because I shared the Golden Boot with Salah and Mane from Liverpool. It was a big challenge, but I did it and I’m really happy. This season, first of all, hopefully we can reach our goal of qualifying for the Champions League and of course, personally yes, if I can get more goals than last season, I’d be happy. Hopefully it’s going to be a good season for Arsenal</p>

We have a game on Thursday and we will start from this game to try to turn things around. In this case, it’s really not easy for everybody but we are men and we have to carry on to try to sort it out. We are a group and we can find a solution internally. That’s what we are going to do.

To give them all my positivity. As always I try to be an example, working hard. We have tried to find more confidence in winning games. We try our best. We have to maybe be cleverer in the transition, maybe make some fouls. That’s part of the game to not concede goals</p>

  <p><b>[Arteta has already made a big difference at Arsenal]</b> He’s only been in charge for a few days, but we’ve seen a big difference already. We needed someone who would come in and shake the whole squad up. We needed someone with new ideas, with a new message and someone who would take us in a different direction. Mikel has brought all of that. We needed a fresh new start and something different and we can feel it already. He is very rigorous and demanding on the training pitch. It’s all about details with him so he talks a lot, repositions us, explains a lot of little things. If you analyse our display against Bournemouth closely, you can see tactically the changes that Mikel made, like the positions of our two full-backs, Mesut <b>[Ozil]</b> and I playing between the lines behind <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Laca</a> <b>[Alexandre Lacazette]</b>, Granit <b>[Xhaka]</b>’s position as well in the build-up play<br /><br />His message to the players was clear and well received.

It’s exciting for us because it’s so different to everything we have done and experimented with before. It is a new dawn and you can feel how positive everyone is at the club about it</p>

You don’t need to win trophies but if you win it, it’s better<br /><br />I think it’s possible, everything is possible. Last season, we were 10 points down from the top four and we came back at the end and were really close, but I think we can do it. When you see the games we have and what the other teams have, I think everything is possible. We have to be focused on what we’re doing and I think the team is doing well. We have some thing to improve, but I’m sure that now we have more pressure because we only have the chance to be in the Champions League because of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.
