You could say that his style is a bit like that of Guardiola. In any case, they play with the same spirit.

Sunday was important for us because it was the last game for the boss. It was important to win this game for him.

Since over the last few seasons - you have to tell the truth - the club has stagnated a little bit, I think everyone is actually a little bit excited to see what happens next season. It is strange that the coach has left after 22 years. But that’s life - we have to look forward.
