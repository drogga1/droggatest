  <p><b>[Former Arsenal legend Thierry Henry has called on the authorities to introduce technology to help referees in the Premier League]</b> Last weekend, that penalty on Raheem Sterling? How do you not see that? The Hull penalty when Marcos Alonso tripped Abel Hernandez, the Koscielny offside for Arsenal’s winner. How are they not given? Chelsea could have drawn 1-1. So could Arsenal. City would have won. These things affect title races. They were all clear to see. Whether they are tricky decisions or easy ones, we need to help the guys in the middle. The game is so fast and they are missing so much. But you try keeping up with Hector Bellerin on the counter attack! There’s also so much analysis that these guys are made to look bad. So there has to be a fifth official - who knows the game, by the way - in front of a TV screen who can make quick decisions and relay them to the man in the middle. People worry that it would slow the game down - but it would take no time. Look at goal-line technology and the Fraser Forster save for Southampton against Liverpool. It was sorted in a flash and the right decision was made. There was no debate. The arguing can take as long as it does to get the decisions right, anyway.<br /><br />When Claudio Ranieri came out last weekend and said he’d got his tactics wrong at Leicester, that was it. End of story. No one slaughtered him because he’d been honest. The same would happen if refs explained themselves on TV after matches. They would seem more human and more accessible and we would have more sympathy with them. And they shouldn’t just talk about the bad decisions but the good ones too. Then we could all understand the process better</p>

I know of him for a very long time, he’s been at Sociedad early in his career. No one wanted him in France by the way, when you think that he had to go to Sociedad to find his way, that tells you the character of the man and how great a player he is when no one thought he was going to do it. For now people talking about him going to Manchester United and what he can bring to the league and not only Manchester United if he goes there, it speaks volumes on how far he came from. But yes I think he should come here. Is it Man United? I don’t know but I think he should come to the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Oxlade-Chamberlain convinces Thierry Henry of potential following ‘stupid’ jibe]</b> Oxlade-Chamberlain deserves praise for what he’s done during his short time at Liverpool so far. But we didn’t see that clearly at Arsenal. My point is if I use the example of Frank Lampard, everybody knew what he was good at. His forte was running from deep - making late runs into the box and scoring goals. And also giving plenty of assists. At Arsenal, there has always been a lot of debate as to what Oxlade-Chamberlain’s best position is. One day he was a wing back, one day he was a left winger, one day a right winger and on another a No.10. That was the problem, we just didn’t know. It’s so difficult to find out who you are and what you are good at if you don’t have a run of games in a settled position. It’s really difficult to get your momentum going and the stats back that up. In 132 games for Arsenal in the Premier League he only scored nine goals and got 14 assists but for Liverpool, he already has three goals and five assists.<br /><br />For Liverpool, we are now seeing a midfielder that puts the pressure on the opposition at every opportunity, he wins the ball back, he scores goals and also gives assists. Now we can see clearly what type of player he is. We can now see the player he can become at Liverpool. The potential was always there. Now, he is playing magnificently well. If he continues at his current ratio of goals and assists, he will go past the ratio he achieved at Arsenal so easily. He is a different player from the one we saw at the Gunners and the Arsenal fans would have loved to have seen this Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at the Emirates Stadium</p>

I just hope the guy who’s going to go to Arsenal is going to have massive shoulders, because it is not an easy job coming after Arsene and he’s going to need time. After that, my phone didn’t ring.<br /><br />I think sometimes we tend to judge a manager on trophies. But when you change a club for the good, I think that’s what we should see where his legacy is because I remember watching Arsenal before, they were up for the fight, they were going to score and you knew at 1-0 that it was over. Was it entertaining, maybe not but they were still successful and then Arsene changed the whole way people saw Arsenal and what they were saying. The biggest compliment I always had when I used to play for Arsenal was people telling me ‘we like the way you play’, it was never ‘you won this, you won that, you stayed unbeaten’. I swear the only thing they used to say was ‘we like to watch you play because we know we are going to see a good game of football’, and that speaks volumes to the vision the man had and what he did to the club. And, yes, people will tell me but the title there, the title this, but I think sometimes you can also judge a man on what he did for the club overall.</p>

A pass of 35 meters I think from Denayer between two players. I cannot understand how that pass happens. Then there’s a guy who wants to focus, to score and one who does not want to defend. You can play four or five defenders but with a lack of desire, it’s hard to win a football match. It was a lack of desire tonight on the goals. So, no excuses, no excuses. I think we made life too easy for Lyon. On the goals, we are at fault. We made the match too easy. It’s a heavy, hard defeat. Above all, when we make too many mistakes, a team like Lyon, which has many qualities, will score goals. We will have to do what there is to do against Guingamp and try to get out of the relegation zone before going on holiday.<br /><br />But try to stay a little on what we did in Amiens and Caen. I know that when you play against a team like Lyon, you find yourself immediately in trouble when you make this kind of mistake, as we are well aware. But we try to stay positive anyway. I see the team every day in training. I do not feel that it is the desire that is missing. But I think that maybe in our situation, it’s the head that makes us make mistakes.

I like to lead and it’s on me to make it happen. The same when I joined <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> as a player, the same when I went to Belgium with Roberto. It’s an evolution. Communication and honesty from the start is key. What’s the job? Is the job to stay up, is the job to win the League or be in the Champions League? But how and what is success? Is success improving players? Ultimately, results are the most important thing, but I want to improve players as well<br /><br /><b>[Henry also says he expected to be given more time to fix the team and mould it to his vision, but he was never given that time as <a href="monaco-fc.html">AS Monaco</a> moved on in an attempt to secure their survival from relegation]</b> There is something I always say. You win or you learn, and, as you can imagine, I learned a lot. I still have <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> in my heart, it’s the club that gave me my first opportunity as a player and gave me my first opportunity as a coach, so I will always be thankful to the people who gave me that, people who are there, some are gone. My heart talked at the time. I wanted to go back to where I started everything. I have zero regrets about what happened. It was a very difficult task and I felt that if I’d had more time I could have done more. But if you don’t get results, no matter what the circumstances, you have to go.<br /><br />All I would say is that if you don’t pass that line and sit on the bench, then you don’t know everything. I’ve heard a lot of people give their opinion on what happened at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> and, boy, they were wrong, but I will never go into details. If I knew I only had three months, then maybe I would have acted a different way, but I was trying to plan something for the future and doing that in such a little amount of time is very difficult. I’m proud of what we did achieve with such a young team. We had to win in Caen and Amiens, and those six points were very important. I had no doubt that team was going to stay up because there was enough quality. I came out of it fully reassured that’s what I want to do, zero doubt about it. I saw some of my ex-coaches after I left and they said ‘now you can say you are a coach because you’ve been sacked. Now you are a coach Thierry’. I am not complaining and I can only say thank you to everybody, but to build a legacy and build something for the future, it takes time</p>

But at times, I guess it’s not always easy to know the ‘when’ you are coming back. A competitor would like to know when he’s going to compete.<br /><br />You have to trust them, give them information, give them exercises that they need to do. And when they come back, if you are a champion and you are a competitor, you will come back fit because that’s what drives you and that’s how you should be at the end of the day<br /><br />Sometimes one of the things I do is think about the games that we played.

How am I going to say to someone to stay when I left? Things happen but that doesn’t kill the love that you have for a place. As an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fan you want him to stay, but as a football player he will assess the situation with his family, with his dad, and see what is the best for them. If you’re an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> man then you don’t want him to leave, but the guy has a career and I don’t know what’s in his head. All I know is that we are definitely going to miss his goals if he does leave. He does score goals and if you take the goals of <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> away, it’s a tough one. I respect people and what they have to go through and what desire or dream they have, but as an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> man, any <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fan would be crazy to say he should leave. I don’t want him to leave, but on the other side you have to understand the guy has a life and maybe he needs to see something else. Who knows? I hope that he stays.<br /><br />It’s a tough one because <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> was getting them to a certain place, you could see the organisation, they were more compact, difficult to beat, and then that happened. I can tell you as a coach now that is not easy to deal with because you want to carry on with what you are doing. With the players, although you are talking to them it is better to train and try to see what you can do after training at the weekend. It depends on who is going to leave, who is not going to leave. We don’t know about that. Who’s going to come? I just want <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to do well and compete. I wish them the best all the time. <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a>, too, because that’s a tough job, as everyone knows. We have to give him time</p>

  <p><b>[France legend Thierry Henry had admitted that his <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team-mates used to make fun of him for trying out new skills and techniques in training, but that he was ultimately vindicated after scoring one of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s most famous goals against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in October 2000]</b> It’s kind of weird because I used to try stuff and when it wasn’t working <b>[people]</b> used to… look, I can’t say it because it’s swearing, but they used to say, ‘What the … was that?’. They used to joke like ‘What are you trying to do?’. But that was me, I always used to try stuff. People called me cocky at times, people called me arrogant - I was confident. I knew I could score goals. I used to do more difficult stuff than that in training to make sure I could do it in the game. But to go back to the goal, it’s so weird because I was behind <a href="denis-irwin.html">Denis Irwin</a> and that’s something that always used to work - I always used to put myself in the offside position because it’s the most difficult thing for the defender. He didn’t know if I was going to come from the right or the left and by the time he sees me it’s too late. I felt like chipping it and volleying the ball, but the most difficult skill in that goal is when I flicked it, the ball went a bit away, right? And so if I smashed it, it would have gone all the way onto the road. I knew I just had to cushion it a bit and make sure it was going to float over and the ball went in.<br /><br />I would try some stuff where you would look at it and say to me, ‘What was that?’ - and that’s the beauty of the game, you have to try stuff, you have to entertain people. Luckily enough, the ball went in, it was against <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> <b>[…]</b> I say all the time, I’ve scored more difficult goals than that, but they were not against Man Utd</p>

  <p><b>[Thierry Henry on ‘The Invincibles’ team of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in the 2003/04 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season]</b> I keep on saying to everybody we were competitors, wanting to win and would do anything to win, competing against Man united but the hardest thing ever was to train. The training session, you saw what we did and what we didn’t do. All you are facing is <a href="sol-campbell.html">Sol Campbell</a>, <b>[Martin]</b> <a href="martin-keown.html">Keown</a>, Kolo <b>[Toure]</b>, every morning, That is what I had to deal with every morning and they had to deal with us. It was so hard in training. Sometimes we would fight in training, battle. It makes me laugh when you hear ‘oh we argued’ but it was meant to happen.</p>

  <p><b>[Henry admits to screaming at &amp; arguing with ‘father figure’ <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> during iconic <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> spell]</b> He was like a father figure for me. So, as you can imagine, with your dad, you argue, you scream, he punishes you. Then, I want to show him the same relationship that you have with a dad: it’s complicated at times, sometimes it’s the best, sometimes we’re best friends, sometimes we’re worst enemies and we argue. But that’s what happens when you love someone. Because you care, that’s why you argue. But I’ll tell you, there are two guys - since we’re mentioning Arsene. Arsene triggered my brain, and every day, it was something about my brain, about asking myself the right questions. And then you have Pep <b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>]</b>, who tactically triggered my brain. So those two guys had a massive impact on me, but I cannot, obviously, talk about my career without Arsene, because I think one of the most important things in the world, not only in sport, is to trigger the brain of someone, to stimulate the brain of someone every single day. If not, it’s close to dying, if your brain is not functioning properly</p>

You have to adapt to what comes your way and understand the protocol and whatever protocol it is you have to adapt to it. We try to prepare the team the best way we could physically and also mentally<br /><br /><b>[Nashville confirmed two of their players had tested positive last weekend, followed by a further three on Monday.

I am not in their dressing room to know exactly what happened, a decision has been taken - I didn’t take that decision - so we just have to follow protocol</p>
