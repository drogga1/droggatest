  <p><b>[Former Arsenal legend Thierry Henry has called on the authorities to introduce technology to help referees in the Premier League]</b> Last weekend, that penalty on Raheem Sterling? How do you not see that? The Hull penalty when Marcos Alonso tripped Abel Hernandez, the Koscielny offside for Arsenal’s winner. How are they not given? Chelsea could have drawn 1-1. So could Arsenal. City would have won. These things affect title races. They were all clear to see. Whether they are tricky decisions or easy ones, we need to help the guys in the middle. The game is so fast and they are missing so much. But you try keeping up with Hector Bellerin on the counter attack! There’s also so much analysis that these guys are made to look bad. So there has to be a fifth official - who knows the game, by the way - in front of a TV screen who can make quick decisions and relay them to the man in the middle. People worry that it would slow the game down - but it would take no time. Look at goal-line technology and the Fraser Forster save for Southampton against Liverpool. It was sorted in a flash and the right decision was made. There was no debate. The arguing can take as long as it does to get the decisions right, anyway.<br /><br />When Claudio Ranieri came out last weekend and said he’d got his tactics wrong at Leicester, that was it. End of story. No one slaughtered him because he’d been honest. The same would happen if refs explained themselves on TV after matches. They would seem more human and more accessible and we would have more sympathy with them. And they shouldn’t just talk about the bad decisions but the good ones too. Then we could all understand the process better</p>

I know of him for a very long time, he’s been at Sociedad early in his career. No one wanted him in France by the way, when you think that he had to go to Sociedad to find his way, that tells you the character of the man and how great a player he is when no one thought he was going to do it. For now people talking about him going to Manchester United and what he can bring to the league and not only Manchester United if he goes there, it speaks volumes on how far he came from. But yes I think he should come here. Is it Man United? I don’t know but I think he should come to the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Thierry Henry does not believe Arsene Wenger has to leave Arsenal for them to win the Premier League]</b> Does this team have enough to win the Premier League? It can be debated. On paper, yes. If Chelsea is ahead, Arsenal also can be. But it is necessary to be in tune with all the players, to work in training. This team is not aware of what they can achieve. There must be self-management and self-discipline. I don’t think Arsene has to leave. Should he change his tactics and his way of doing things? I don’t know. But what he must do there is mental work. The tactics help, but what I saw against Chelsea is a mental problem. This is not easy to manage. The problem is more mental than quality. Because if Leicester can win the championship… For now, it is true that they are missing something. Statistics are there to prove that.<br /><br />If I were to tell you that I don’t want to coach Arsenal, I would be lying. But I have not done anything yet. I think about it, but it’s far away, let me learn, we’ll see later<br /><br />Guardiola impressed me a lot. He made me see football in a different way. The last windows that were not open yet with Wenger, he opened them for me. In one word, if I were to define it, I would say ‘intense’. His way of seeing the game is extraordinary. But it is also his problem. With him, you must always be ready. I learned a lot with him and his vision of football is enormous. At City, this is the first time in his life that he is not first or second. It’s not easy to manage. At City, too, there is an end of generation. There were problems. He must also learn in relation to what happens at England. I thought he would adapt faster</p>

  <p><b>[Thierry Henry has lauded extraordinary Olivier Giroud]</b> I would like to have played with him. As someone who brings others into play, he is extraordinary. I never criticised him. I responded to a question: ‘What must Arsenal do to become champions?’. To that I said that Giroud cannot be the only forward if Arsenal are to win the league. Some weeks before that question I was praising him. But no-one remembers that. It’s been the situation for two years. I replied that Arsenal need a stronger spine, few injuries and for Mesut Ozil to lift his level to that he had played the season before. And another attacker other than Giroud, so there are more solutions and options in attack. There you go, that’s what I said.<br /><br />I won the title because Kanu, Sylvain Wiltord and Freddy Ljungberg all scored at the end of the season. The goal in Manchester was scored by Wiltord, not me. This season, Alexis Sanchez is playing in attack. He’s the spearhead. And Olivier is doing enormous work, he is staying strong in his job</p>

I hear that his signings weren’t good enough or there are problems with the coaching staff. Behind closed doors, a lot of stuff must be happening. It doesn’t mean he has to go. The easiest thing to do is to sack the manager, because you can’t clear the whole team out. But he’s just won the league with Leicester. I saw the tweet of Roberto Mancini, saying he will remain in the history of Leicester. He will stay in the history of football, not only in England, but in the world - he won the league with Leicester. Six months after, he’s gone. That’s crazy.<br /><br />Like everybody else, I’m shocked, disappointed for the man. It seems that winning doesn’t secure you anything anymore. It’s a weird one. He won manager of the year with FIFA and now he’s out of a job. He won the league, he’s gone. Pellegrini won the League Cup last year, he’s gone. Van Gaal won the FA Cup last year, he’s gone.

I think he will but it hasn’t been said properly.<br /><br />I think at one point, the board could have come out and clarified the situation properly with Arsene and other players, that would have been a bit more helpful in terms of what the fans were thinking. We would have had an idea of what was happening but it is very much like Arsenal to not say what is happening right up until they make a decision. I’m sure we won’t hear about it right up until the final of the FA Cup<br /><br />I’m sure he wants to be successful with Arsenal but if he sees it is not going to happen like this year and next year, there will be no Champions League so he has to wait another year and then there are no guarantees you will make it the year after so let’s see what is going to happen this summer but it is vital to keep him<br /><br />When Mesut Ozil is on tune and at the top of his game, there is no one like him in terms of vision and how he pauses the game. He plays the right ball at the right time, but you would argue that he doesn’t do that every weekend. I don’t know why but that is what he is going to have to do.<br /><br />He had a similar period last year where he was assisting everybody, he was having an amazing run, and then he didn’t finish the season well. This year, people were having a go at him in terms of consistency and I think that’s what we talk about when discussing him.<br /><br />We all know he has the quality of one of the best ever in that position but sometimes the consistency doesn’t match the quality of the man</p>

It is a weird one because you could feel yesterday, when he went to clap the Arsenal fans, you could sense there was something a bit more into it. He did what he had to do for Arsenal.<br /><br />On the other side, the World Cup is coming, Chelsea are coming for you, they’re ahead of Arsenal at the minute, Arsene is not playing you. A lot of players are in front of you. I cannot fault him or be upset with him. He adds another option up front where he likes to play. Very much the way Antonio Conte wants to play, a target man with a brain. I wish him all the very best. But we lost, at Arsenal, a member of the supporting cast</p>

At Juventus he used to play in a certain position where they clearly didn’t trust him in the middle of the park so they played him more on the sides. Then when he is on the ball he can have an amazing impact on the game. Can he do a job? Yes he can do a job, but is he N’Golo Kante? No. Kante senses dangers and knows what the ball is going to be.

You cannot be on the bench and missing games, missing learning about the game and stopping that momentum, and an example is Rashford. Michael Owen had the opportunity to back up what he did the year before because he played, and he played, and he played, and he played - and I can give you more examples. But Rashford at times could not capitalise on what he did from that year <b>[after his debut]</b>, because sometimes he is playing on the right, <b>[sometimes]</b> on the left. Leave is a strong word. Obviously being from there, he wants to play for United. But he has to play and it is becoming even more difficult for him since Sanchez has arrived.

  <p><b>[Oxlade-Chamberlain convinces Thierry Henry of potential following ‘stupid’ jibe]</b> Oxlade-Chamberlain deserves praise for what he’s done during his short time at Liverpool so far. But we didn’t see that clearly at Arsenal. My point is if I use the example of Frank Lampard, everybody knew what he was good at. His forte was running from deep - making late runs into the box and scoring goals. And also giving plenty of assists. At Arsenal, there has always been a lot of debate as to what Oxlade-Chamberlain’s best position is. One day he was a wing back, one day he was a left winger, one day a right winger and on another a No.10. That was the problem, we just didn’t know. It’s so difficult to find out who you are and what you are good at if you don’t have a run of games in a settled position. It’s really difficult to get your momentum going and the stats back that up. In 132 games for Arsenal in the Premier League he only scored nine goals and got 14 assists but for Liverpool, he already has three goals and five assists.<br /><br />For Liverpool, we are now seeing a midfielder that puts the pressure on the opposition at every opportunity, he wins the ball back, he scores goals and also gives assists. Now we can see clearly what type of player he is. We can now see the player he can become at Liverpool. The potential was always there. Now, he is playing magnificently well. If he continues at his current ratio of goals and assists, he will go past the ratio he achieved at Arsenal so easily. He is a different player from the one we saw at the Gunners and the Arsenal fans would have loved to have seen this Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at the Emirates Stadium</p>

Like I said to you and I said it the other day and I will be clear with that, I said I will never back down from a challenge because that’s my life. I just hope the guy who’s going to go to Arsenal is going to have massive shoulders, because it is not an easy job coming after Arsene and he’s going to need time. After that, my phone didn’t ring.<br /><br />I think sometimes we tend to judge a manager on trophies. But when you change a club for the good, I think that’s what we should see where his legacy is because I remember watching Arsenal before, they were up for the fight, they were going to score and you knew at 1-0 that it was over. Was it entertaining, maybe not but they were still successful and then Arsene changed the whole way people saw Arsenal and what they were saying. The biggest compliment I always had when I used to play for Arsenal was people telling me ‘we like the way you play’, it was never ‘you won this, you won that, you stayed unbeaten’. I swear the only thing they used to say was ‘we like to watch you play because we know we are going to see a good game of football’, and that speaks volumes to the vision the man had and what he did to the club. And, yes, people will tell me but the title there, the title this, but I think sometimes you can also judge a man on what he did for the club overall.</p>

Tonight, we did exactly the same thing. Look at the first two goals. On the first goal, we give them the ball for free. The second goal sums up the match for me. A pass of 35 meters I think from Denayer between two players. I cannot understand how that pass happens. Then there’s a guy who wants to focus, to score and one who does not want to defend. You can play four or five defenders but with a lack of desire, it’s hard to win a football match. It was a lack of desire tonight on the goals. So, no excuses, no excuses. I think we made life too easy for Lyon. On the goals, we are at fault. We made the match too easy. It’s a heavy, hard defeat. Above all, when we make too many mistakes, a team like Lyon, which has many qualities, will score goals. We will have to do what there is to do against Guingamp and try to get out of the relegation zone before going on holiday.<br /><br />But try to stay a little on what we did in Amiens and Caen.

My heart talked at the time. I wanted to go back to where I started everything. I have zero regrets about what happened. It was a very difficult task and I felt that if I’d had more time I could have done more. But if you don’t get results, no matter what the circumstances, you have to go.<br /><br />All I would say is that if you don’t pass that line and sit on the bench, then you don’t know everything. I’ve heard a lot of people give their opinion on what happened at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a> and, boy, they were wrong, but I will never go into details. If I knew I only had three months, then maybe I would have acted a different way, but I was trying to plan something for the future and doing that in such a little amount of time is very difficult. I’m proud of what we did achieve with such a young team. We had to win in Caen and Amiens, and those six points were very important. I had no doubt that team was going to stay up because there was enough quality. I came out of it fully reassured that’s what I want to do, zero doubt about it. I saw some of my ex-coaches after I left and they said ‘now you can say you are a coach because you’ve been sacked. Now you are a coach Thierry’. I am not complaining and I can only say thank you to everybody, but to build a legacy and build something for the future, it takes time</p>

I see it as an easy thing if you’re a competitor. You obviously have to train and work hard and be ready for whatever is going to come your way. But at times, I guess it’s not always easy to know the ‘when’ you are coming back. A competitor would like to know when he’s going to compete.<br /><br />You have to trust them, give them information, give them exercises that they need to do. And when they come back, if you are a champion and you are a competitor, you will come back fit because that’s what drives you and that’s how you should be at the end of the day<br /><br />Sometimes one of the things I do is think about the games that we played. I know they are not a lot, but the situation made it like that. But I’m thinking about stuff that we might change or not, or how we can play or what can be the next step or new way of training, if we are going to do the same way or not.

I hope that he stays.<br /><br />It’s a tough one because <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> was getting them to a certain place, you could see the organisation, they were more compact, difficult to beat, and then that happened. I can tell you as a coach now that is not easy to deal with because you want to carry on with what you are doing. With the players, although you are talking to them it is better to train and try to see what you can do after training at the weekend. It depends on who is going to leave, who is not going to leave. We don’t know about that. Who’s going to come? I just want <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to do well and compete. I wish them the best all the time. <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a>, too, because that’s a tough job, as everyone knows. We have to give him time</p>

  <p><b>[France legend Thierry Henry had admitted that his <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team-mates used to make fun of him for trying out new skills and techniques in training, but that he was ultimately vindicated after scoring one of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s most famous goals against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in October 2000]</b> It’s kind of weird because I used to try stuff and when it wasn’t working <b>[people]</b> used to… look, I can’t say it because it’s swearing, but they used to say, ‘What the … was that?’. They used to joke like ‘What are you trying to do?’. But that was me, I always used to try stuff. People called me cocky at times, people called me arrogant - I was confident. I knew I could score goals. I used to do more difficult stuff than that in training to make sure I could do it in the game. But to go back to the goal, it’s so weird because I was behind <a href="denis-irwin.html">Denis Irwin</a> and that’s something that always used to work - I always used to put myself in the offside position because it’s the most difficult thing for the defender. He didn’t know if I was going to come from the right or the left and by the time he sees me it’s too late. I felt like chipping it and volleying the ball, but the most difficult skill in that goal is when I flicked it, the ball went a bit away, right? And so if I smashed it, it would have gone all the way onto the road. I knew I just had to cushion it a bit and make sure it was going to float over and the ball went in.<br /><br />I would try some stuff where you would look at it and say to me, ‘What was that?’ - and that’s the beauty of the game, you have to try stuff, you have to entertain people. Luckily enough, the ball went in, it was against <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> <b>[…]</b> I say all the time, I’ve scored more difficult goals than that, but they were not against Man Utd</p>

  <p><b>[Thierry Henry on ‘The Invincibles’ team of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in the 2003/04 <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season]</b> I keep on saying to everybody we were competitors, wanting to win and would do anything to win, competing against Man united but the hardest thing ever was to train. The training session, you saw what we did and what we didn’t do. All you are facing is <a href="sol-campbell.html">Sol Campbell</a>, <b>[Martin]</b> <a href="martin-keown.html">Keown</a>, Kolo <b>[Toure]</b>, every morning, That is what I had to deal with every morning and they had to deal with us. It was so hard in training. Sometimes we would fight in training, battle. It makes me laugh when you hear ‘oh we argued’ but it was meant to happen.</p>

  <p><b>[Henry admits to screaming at &amp; arguing with ‘father figure’ <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> during iconic <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> spell]</b> He was like a father figure for me. So, as you can imagine, with your dad, you argue, you scream, he punishes you. Then, I want to show him the same relationship that you have with a dad: it’s complicated at times, sometimes it’s the best, sometimes we’re best friends, sometimes we’re worst enemies and we argue. But that’s what happens when you love someone. Because you care, that’s why you argue. But I’ll tell you, there are two guys - since we’re mentioning Arsene. Arsene triggered my brain, and every day, it was something about my brain, about asking myself the right questions. And then you have Pep <b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>]</b>, who tactically triggered my brain. So those two guys had a massive impact on me, but I cannot, obviously, talk about my career without Arsene, because I think one of the most important things in the world, not only in sport, is to trigger the brain of someone, to stimulate the brain of someone every single day. If not, it’s close to dying, if your brain is not functioning properly</p>

  <p><b>[Thierry Henry: Montreal Impact boss calls on team and <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to adapt]</b> We all know that it is not ideal in terms of preparation, but it is what it is. You have to adapt to what comes your way and understand the protocol and whatever protocol it is you have to adapt to it. We try to prepare the team the best way we could physically and also mentally<br /><br /><b>[Nashville confirmed two of their players had tested positive last weekend, followed by a further three on Monday.

I am not in their dressing room to know exactly what happened, a decision has been taken - I didn’t take that decision - so we just have to follow protocol</p>
