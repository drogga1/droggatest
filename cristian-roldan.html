  <p><b>[USMNT vs Jamaica. Berhalter’s experimental USMNT lineup falls flat in Gold Cup tune-up]</b> In the end, sloppy giveaways led to their goal and changed the momentum of the game, so we have to be cleaner in that sense. I felt like I our pressing was a little off. I felt we were just trying to go every time, and you can’t physically do that in a game and so we got tired I think. That led to sloppy giveaways. It’s a new group, and you obviously have to be patient, but in the end I think it was just sloppy from us</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT vs Curacao. If Curacao’s qualification was only sealed at the last gasp, the U.S had the luxury of being able to rotate their entire squad for their last meeting against Panama]</b> In this tournament we have to use all 23 guys and we had a game plan going into it. We kept a shutout, kept them to one shot, zero corners, <b>[we’re]</b> pretty happy with it</p>

  <p><b>[Once youngster, now leader: How Cristian Roldan have grown as Sounders prepare for another <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup final]</b> It’s so good to see <a href="jordan-morris.html">Jordan Morris</a> have fun. He’s having the most fun he’s had in his career, I think. A large part has to do with switching from right to left wing. Once he got back from the Gold Cup, he was a bit sharper, he seemed a bit fitter, stronger in every category<br /><br />Anytime I’m facing <a href="michael-bradley.html">Michael Bradley</a>, I want him to feel that I’m good enough to be on the same field as him. I’ve played alongside him and what a competitor he is. Anytime I get to have a conversation with him and learn and enjoy the moment I have with him is really a unique experience. I had his jersey growing up, so it’s going to be really fun to face him again</p>

  <p><b>[The Seattle Sounders and Toronto FC will collide on Sunday for an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup rubber match that looked all too improbable just several weeks ago]</b> Maybe other people think differently, but I don’t feel like there’s a true rivalry here. I think there are two teams that mutually respect each other and have the same attitude and intensity and mentality to win trophies. It’s really cool to see Toronto here again and it’s the best team that wins<br /><br />It’s hard to be consistent in this league, first and foremost. The fact that Toronto didn’t make the playoffs last year and now they’re back in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup, it’s hard to do. To get back for the third time in four years is incredible in a league that’s so parity driving. It’s two clubs that are willing to take chances on players and willing to spend a bit of money, but, at the same time, it’s the mentality within the locker room, the front office, to say, ‘Hey, we’re going to go for another trophy<br /><br /><b>[Sunday is one last chance to see two historically-consistent sides go head-to-head. Or is it?]</b> The reality is, if you win a trophy, it should motivate you to win another one. Losing shouldn’t motivate you. Once you win it, you want to get there again. It would just mean we need to play another game, right? Another final. And the reality is I think these teams will get to another final and play each other again</p>
