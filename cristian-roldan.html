  <p><b>[Cristian Roldan has evolved into fierce young leader for Sounders]</b> I think I had to become a leader this year. When you become a leader you aren’t afraid of making mistakes. Some guys, younger guys especially, that come into the league, once they come in and become starters they’re still a little timid and still a little afraid to make mistakes on the field and really play your game.<br /><br />A lot of responsibility fell on my shoulders. A lot of players went down. I had to play as a six this year, as a 10, as a right back, so I led in several ways. I led by example and vocally I felt like I was more vocal this year and I’m very proud of that because a 22-year-old coming into the locker room we have is really tough<br /><br />You see guys like <b>[Christian]</b> Pulisic, who are playing at an all-time high because of their confidence. So I think now, being a leader, having that confidence of not caring what people think and playing my game has helped me this year</p>

  <p><b>[Cristian Roldan has evolved into fierce young leader for Sounders]</b> I think last year I tried to keep it simple, one-two touches. I defended for others, but then I realized I was fit enough to play box to box, get into the box at times and pick and choose the best times during the game. That’s definitely part of my game that has improved and next year I want to add a couple more elements to my game.<br /><br />Being on the bench for those games totally motivated me. I came back and I was just this new player who just wanted more. To be part of the United States team that won the Gold Cup, but not play very much on that team, I don’t feel like I won the trophy. I want to be part of the team, I want to play every minute. Until then I need to improve, and when I improve hopefully by next year I can become a starter then<br /><br />I think I can improve from this year. I do believe I haven’t hit my potential and I want to keep going. I’ve set my mind to improving on little things like my passing, my forward off-the-ball running. Stuff like that can make the biggest difference for next year. This year it’s nice that I had the year that I did, but I don’t think I’ll be satisfied if we don’t win MLS Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Can TFC-Sounders be the Lakers-Celtics rivalry of MLS?]</b> You want a final like this each and every year. Obviously it’s nice to see the underdogs go at it, but I think it’s two powerhouse teams with fantastic quality</p>

  <p><b>[Sounders will have plenty of chances to build an advantage against Chivas’ defense]</b> Offensively, we have to make them defend. They’re away from home, they have to feel that they are away from home. Sometimes Mexican sides come in and play just as well as if they were in Mexico. They have to feel like they’re in Seattle and we’re going to take the game to them.</p>

  <p><b>[Cristian Roldan is another option against a Paraguay side led by Miguel Almiron that boasts a high-powered attack]</b> I think you’ll see a lot of players who are committed to pressing and defending and bringing energy to the game. There’s a lot of young guys who are here and our mindset is to play free and mentally we have to be ready, but also physically. I think this group is more than ready for a challenge. Paraguay brings a lot of counterattacking football and we have to be really keen and sharp on the day.</p>

  <p><b>[United bid victory has MLS and USMNT players excited for lead-up to 2026]</b> I’ll have a chance to play a World Cup on home soil. Even just going to a World Cup would be incredible, but being able to play in front of your family and friends would be even more incredible. I’m just stoked, not just individually, but for all the American players that will have a chance to play, and all the Americans who will have a chance to see a World Cup before their eyes. At that point I’ll be 31 years old, so it might be tough to make it. It’s tough right now, at 23, but it’ll be even tougher at 31. If I can continue to progress I’ll have a chance. I’ve already set some goals for myself, like the World Cup in Qatar, but the World Cup in the United States is definitely another one.</p>

  <p><b>[Sounders looking to ride another miracle run through to third consecutive MLS Cup final]</b> I think we always believed in ourselves. We always thought we would get back into the flow of things and make a run for the playoffs, but not in this manner. I don’t think anybody really could have expected this. At this point, we’ve lost two games of 16 or 17 and I think that’s a pretty incredible run and I hope we can continue that into the playoffs. Morale-wise, this team is as confident as ever and I think we’re just a team that’s really hard to beat at this point.<br /><br />We had a lot of things going on,and unfortunately it didn’t go our way. I really didn’t anticipate the run in which we’ve had, but it says a lot about the team and the belief that we all had from the very beginning<br /><br />When Raul Ruidiaz came in, it only helped. It just catapulted this run even more. The combination of Nico (Lodeiro) being in-form, Victor (Rodriguez) was back from injury, Chad (Marshall) and Kim (Kee-Hee) were playing extremely well in defense. The team was just on a roll and it all continued to go our way<br /><br />I picture it as a cage match to be honest. It’s two teams that I wouldn’t say are afraid to open up, but want to be smart defensively first and foremost. It might come down to set pieces or one mistake. These matches, especially this rivalry, will add so much heat of the moment, passion and emotion into the game. It’s more of a coin-flip. It’s two teams that match up extremely well together, that don’t want to give the other team an inch. It can be anybody’s game. we feel like we’re hot, we’re confident, but you go to Portland and with all the fans and the intensity, for all I know it can be an open game and they can score many goals. That’s how good Portland can be at home. If we can contain that, we’ll have a better shot at winning the series</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT ready for tougher March test from veteran Chile side]</b> Chile’s going to be a really good team for us, a really good team to measure ourselves against the world. They’re not doing too well at the moment, but Chile has quality players and they put guys forward, so it’s going to be a tough challenge but in the end it’s going to make us stronger.</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT vs Jamaica. Berhalter’s experimental USMNT lineup falls flat in Gold Cup tune-up]</b> In the end, sloppy giveaways led to their goal and changed the momentum of the game, so we have to be cleaner in that sense. I felt like I our pressing was a little off. I felt we were just trying to go every time, and you can’t physically do that in a game and so we got tired I think. That led to sloppy giveaways. It’s a new group, and you obviously have to be patient, but in the end I think it was just sloppy from us</p>

We kept a shutout, kept them to one shot, zero corners, <b>[we’re]</b> pretty happy with it</p>

  <p><b>[Once youngster, now leader: How Cristian Roldan have grown as Sounders prepare for another <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup final]</b> It’s so good to see <a href="jordan-morris.html">Jordan Morris</a> have fun. He’s having the most fun he’s had in his career, I think. A large part has to do with switching from right to left wing. Once he got back from the Gold Cup, he was a bit sharper, he seemed a bit fitter, stronger in every category<br /><br />Anytime I’m facing <a href="michael-bradley.html">Michael Bradley</a>, I want him to feel that I’m good enough to be on the same field as him. I’ve played alongside him and what a competitor he is. Anytime I get to have a conversation with him and learn and enjoy the moment I have with him is really a unique experience. I had his jersey growing up, so it’s going to be really fun to face him again</p>

  <p><b>[The Seattle Sounders and Toronto FC will collide on Sunday for an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup rubber match that looked all too improbable just several weeks ago]</b> Maybe other people think differently, but I don’t feel like there’s a true rivalry here. I think there are two teams that mutually respect each other and have the same attitude and intensity and mentality to win trophies. It’s really cool to see Toronto here again and it’s the best team that wins<br /><br />It’s hard to be consistent in this league, first and foremost. The fact that Toronto didn’t make the playoffs last year and now they’re back in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup, it’s hard to do. To get back for the third time in four years is incredible in a league that’s so parity driving. It’s two clubs that are willing to take chances on players and willing to spend a bit of money, but, at the same time, it’s the mentality within the locker room, the front office, to say, ‘Hey, we’re going to go for another trophy<br /><br /><b>[Sunday is one last chance to see two historically-consistent sides go head-to-head. Or is it?]</b> The reality is, if you win a trophy, it should motivate you to win another one. Losing shouldn’t motivate you. Once you win it, you want to get there again. It would just mean we need to play another game, right? Another final. And the reality is I think these teams will get to another final and play each other again</p>
