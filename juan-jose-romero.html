<blockquote>
  <p>[Junior Firpo has been tipped to emulate the brilliant career of Sergio Ramos by former Real Betis youth guru Juan Jose Romero] He is the footballer who most impressed me in his first training session. He looked like a beast of a footballer from the very first moment. He has the formidable maturity and personality which give him the chance to go far, he has a bullet-proof character, he is a defender of great quality and has confidence in himself. That confidence can be a problem sometimes because he believes in himself a lot but it is a trait which could be positive if he handles it correctly. Sometimes he looks cocky and that leads him to make very visible mistakes. But he could end up having a career similar to that of Sergio Ramos. He also came to Real Madrid and the national team as a full-back, to end up in the middle of defence and, even though Junior doesn’t have the defensive power of Ramos as a centre-back, neither did Ramos have the attacking threat Junior is showing<br /><br />[Despite his tender age, Romero has no doubt that Firpo will be a success at Barca] If he keeps his head down we are talking about a left-back with great physical conditioning, quick, good in the air and with good technique. It is very hard to find players with so much ability. [Former Betis coach] Quique Setien and I brought him up to the first team when he showed the talent to play in the middle, at Betis we used to play with three centre-backs and he played on the left, he played some great games. He also played in midfield and even as a centre-forward [in the Betis youth teams]. I spoke with Setien more than once about Junior’s future, he is one of those players of whom you can say the bigger the stage, the better the artist plays. I would tell any big club not to think twice over Junior, he has been in the first team less than a year and a half and you just have to look at his progression</p>
