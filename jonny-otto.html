  <p><b>[For Jonny Otto, Wolves’ left wing-back, he returns home to a young son and a pregnant partner. Another baby is on the way. A girl this time]</b> I am very anxious about it. Of course you think about it. But then you realise that you just have to get over it. That’s hard. Really difficult. But we are playing again against <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> so we have to try to get some more points<br /><br /><b>[Strong characters within the <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> dressing room soon begin the process of raising spirits]</b> We have a lot of people here to support us. We have the medical team. We have the coaching staff. All of these people are trying to encourage us to move forward. Then we are back out on the pitch. After being so long without doing anything you at least want to keep in shape<br /><br />The day before the game and the day of the actual game is when we look at it. That is when we get all the details. All the individual player performances are sent to us by email.<br /><br /><a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> is what we need to focus on but European football is important for us because it obviously helps you grow as a footballer. We have been in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> for two years and it has been really hard, working all year round to achieve good results. We are still working very hard for European competitions and there are only four matches to decide the final classification. We are very close now to deciding what is going to happen</p>
