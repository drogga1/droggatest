  <p><b>[Daniel Sturridge on <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a>]</b> Mario is really cool and I get along with him. But everyone says similar things about him, like he is wild and then he ends up getting stereotyped. He is under the microscope and he is at that level where he is known around the world and he does get scrutinised. I think the average 24-year-old, or guys who go to university who are a little younger, will have done a lot crazier things than him</p>

  <p><b>[Daniel Sturridge looked really good on his return to action with Liverpool]</b> I saw a lot of good things from Daniel. Impressed? It takes a lot for Daniel to impress me because I know about his quality. Very positive week and today he looked really good. We started playing football when he was involved. That’s how it is.<br /><br />Twenty-two players and nobody injured. Actually more, 44 players. The first half I was not happy of course, the game was not good and it looked stiff. To be honest, it’s not that I look five hours on the line-up and think that would fit together. So they have to work together in preseason, especially in the first game. Yes, we were worked hard in the week. Yes, the pitch was dry. Yes, the wind makes the pitch even drier. It’s not nice. The opponent was organised. You saw that it was difficult in the first half, we didn’t play good football. The second half was much better - only two, three players more played together. It was easier for the players in the second half to show up a little bit. Naby, especially, looked pretty well. That’s good signs</p>

  <p><b>[Daniel Sturridge claims to be feeling amazing at Liverpool]</b> I’m feeling great <b>[and am]</b> looking forward to contributing to the team. I’m feeling amazing so I can’t really complain, I can have no complaints. I’m just excited for the next month coming up and hopefully we can get some good results in that month. Whatever the manager feels is best for the team <b>[is best]</b>. Whoever’s the right players to play, <b>[we]</b> will push ourselves to the limit. We’ve got a great squad so you’ve just got to be ready to give your all, give your everything, to push yourself to the limit. Every game’s important for this team, whether it’s the cup, the league, the Champions League, whatever it is, every single game is just as important as each other. So, however many minutes you get, whether you’re starting or you’re coming off the bench, you want to support the team as best as possible and help them be successful.<br /><br />I think it will be tough. The games are always difficult off the back of international breaks: players are tired, they’ve travelled, the week’s not as long in terms of we can’t do as much tactical work as we would usually do throughout the week. And obviously players have gone away and done different tactics with their national teams, played in different positions and roles, so it kind of poses a little bit of a ‘<b>[can we]</b> get back to what we’re used to doing?’ <b>[question]</b>. I hope we go there and we get a result, that’s the main thing. We’ve just got to stay focused on that. We never will underestimate any team. People will say we’re favourites but we’re going into this game and we’re both on the same playing field. It’s the Premier League, so every team is strong in this league</p>

  <p><b>[Daniel Sturridge remained coy on his future having seemingly brought the curtain down on his <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> career]</b> Oh of course, yes I contributed. And even the players who haven’t played a minute. There are guys who have been on the bench and haven’t played a single minute, but they have been a part of it: from training, to acting like the opposition that we have been playing against, to doing a job, to sacrificing themselves and the way that they play just to train to do a job on the training field to help them prepare themselves the best way that they can. It’s amazing. I don’t even want to talk about all that stuff. I feel like it has been an incredible time and I am not going to talk about next season or anything. What’s important now is celebrating something so momentous, something we were striving for, working for for a long time. to finally win something is amazing.<br /><br /><b>[Sturridge believes that this is likely to be first of many pieces of silverware that the club will pick up under the charismatic German coach]</b> It’s my second time winning it. It’s almost similar. The one with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> was the first in the club’s history and this is the first under this manager, so it’s a similar kind of feeling. Once you win one, you hope the floodgates open and you continue winning. It’s that culture of getting over the finishing line. When you have been trying so hard and you have been pipped at the post many times - we have lost in I think three finals since the manager has been here - you feel as if ‘are we ever going to win a trophy’, so, to be able to do it, to be able to lift silverware is what you work for every day, day in day out, as a group of players, it’s a beautiful feeling<br /><br /><b>[Sturridge believes the pain of those near-misses - the 2016 League Cup and Europa League finals, last season’s Champions League and this season’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> - played a part as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> kept their nerve this time around]</b> You learn, you definitely learn. You understand what you didn’t do. There are always little things that you can nit-pick about that you didn’t do, so to be able to win - that’s what it’s all about, it’s amazing. The difference is that the heartache never goes away: you always think about it. People were saying ‘if we win we won’t think about it’ but you do. You always think ‘what if? what could we have done differently, how can we prepare differently?’.<br /><br />All the things when you lost, you take them into a game because you’ve learnt from them: all the pain, all the heartache you had prior to that. And when you come into a game like this, you go: ‘ok, cool’. You come in at half time and you talk different. You’re like: ‘ok, remember what happened last time guys. Let’s do this’. We had meetings as a group of players in the week. We said: ‘ok, if we go one up how do we play? If we go one down how do we play?’ I’s about being prepared for everything. <b>[The players’ meeting]</b> was just like: ‘look, it’s our time, we’ve prepared ourselves as best we can.’ It was just about ‘if we go behind how do we deal with it, if we go ahead how do you deal with it?’ And we haven’t had those conversations before. And I feel like maybe before the Europa league final we didn’t prepare as well. Last season, we said ‘we didn’t prepare well the season before and we have learnt’. This year we have had two finals now, so you have learnt so much more. I think that’s what makes teams so successful. They have experienced it.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> striker Daniel Sturridge has been banned from football for six weeks - four of which are suspended - and fined £75,000 for breaching FA betting rules]</b> Mr Sturridge faced 11 charges. Nine of those charges (1a, 1b, 2, 5, 6a, 6b and 7-9) concerned alleged breaches of the inside information rule, in that, it was said, Mr Sturridge had provided inside information to friends and family about his possible transfer moves in January 2018, which information had then been used for, or in relation to, betting. Those charges were dismissed by the regulatory commission.<br /><br />The regulatory commission found proved charges 3 and 4, which alleged that, in that same transfer window, Mr Sturridge had instructed his brother, Leon, to bet on a possible move by him (Daniel) to <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla FC</a>. In issuing that instruction, the regulatory commission found that, as a matter of fact, Mr Sturridge had provided his brother with inside information for that purpose.<br /><br />By way of sanction, the regulatory commission imposed on Mr Sturridge a six-week suspension from participation in any domestic football matches (including friendlies), such suspension being effective from 17 July 2019. Four weeks of that ban have been suspended until 31 August 2019, meaning that Mr Sturridge will be able to resume participating by 31 July 2019 in the event he commits no further breaches of FA Rule E8. In addition, the regulatory commission imposed a fine of £75,000 on Mr Sturridge. <a href="fa.html">The FA</a> respectfully disagrees with the regulatory commission’s findings and will be appealing against the charges which were dismissed and the sanction which was imposed</p>

It’s not ‘The Wave’ which <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> called it, it’s not the name. It’s ‘The Sturridge dance’ so let’s get that straight and fine and dandy. Hanging out with my cousins and my friends in my apartment. There was some house music playing, filming us, a couple of drinks flowing, you know. I literally just started doing that move. It wasn’t as smooth, it wasn’t as clean but I was a little bit tipsy and just decided to start moving that way. We all found it hilarious and then I was just like ‘You know what, if I score, I’ll do it!’. I think the very first time I did the dance, we played Man United in the Carling Cup at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> when I was playing for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.
