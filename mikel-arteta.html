  <p><b>[Mikel Arteta says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> boss <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> is not just a tactical genius, but also a ‘tireless worker’ behind the scenes]</b> With <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>, it is a daily challenge. He is super-efficient with himself, and those around him should always be seeking improvements. The challenge is how to be better than the day before, than the previous game. He is a tireless worker. People say: ‘Pep is a genius’. And yes, it has a lot of validity. But if I had to define it, I would say, first, that it is a tireless ‘worker’. Commit and give us all the responsibility that one wants to assume. He tells you: ‘Do what you want, as far as you can’. Share success and failure. And, in addition, he is very brave. His decisions are always focused on the attack. If there is any doubt, put the one who plays best forward. Love the attack.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> enforcer <a href="rodri.html">Rodri</a> has emerged as a target for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> champions in recent weeks]</b> <a href="rodri.html">Rodri</a>? he closely resembles what ‘Busi’ <b>[<a href="sergio-busquets.html">Sergio Busquets</a>]</b> is. Few people read the game alone, those who anticipate scenarios, who are mentally stable, who can be a coach in the field, in the case of <a href="xabi-alonso.html">Xabi Alonso</a> or <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi Hernandez</a>. I do not want to get into names, but our ‘six’ must understand our game. It is vital. He is the one that makes everyone work, the one that frees those in front, the one who finds superiority, the one who sets the pace</p>

He will have success. Sooner or later it’s going to happen (Arteta becoming a manager). He’s a young, young manager. He has experience already, handling big players and big teams. He’s got an incredible work ethic. He has a special talent to analyse what happens and to find solutions. We talk a lot about what he believes and how he feels. He was a holding-midfielder too and I think he reads the situations. The best <b>[midfielders]</b> play thinking about what the team needs in every single moment. He was a master of that.

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> assistant Mikel Arteta says that midfielder <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> has limitless potential]</b> His potential is limitless. He is going to set his own limits. The most important thing is that, as a club and around the team, we have created a really healthy, inspiring and challenging environment. That’s exactly what he needs. The door is open. We have a manager who trusts in young players and he’s going to get opportunities. With that type of environment, to grow and to always be going in the right direction is the most important thing.

How much he wants to learn and what he’s able to do to improve. Of course, he’s got the skills and physical ability and he’s got a very good coach and very good team-mates who are going to help him.

  <p><b>[Back in 2014, Arteta gave a fascinating insight into how he would approach management]</b> My philosophy will be clear. I will have everyone 120 per cent committed, that’s the first thing. If not, you don’t play for me. When it’s time to work it’s time to work, and when it’s time to have fun then I’m the first one to do it, but that commitment is vital. Then I want the football to be expressive, entertaining. I cannot have a concept of football where everything is based on the opposition. We have to dictate the game, we have to be the ones taking the initiative, and we have to entertain the people coming to watch us. I’m 100% convinced of those things, and I think I could do it</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s new boss Mikel Arteta has claimed being ruthless and consistent is what has made <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> such a successful manager]</b> What I’ve learned mostly is you have to be ruthless, consistent and fit every day the culture of the club to have a winning mentality. To sustain it is even harder, so every day is important, every act is important, every word of the organisation is important. <b>[Pep’s]</b> work rate is incredible. How inspirational he is to people is incredible, but to me the secret is the players and staff have to believe what you deliver. You have to be able to transmit it and then people will buy into that. When you do that, you have a team, everyone is united, and we will be strong<br /><br /><b>[The former midfielder insists his relationship with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> and City remains intact]</b> The relationship between him and me is incredibly good. Obviously, he was sad, the timing wasn’t the best for him, but he understood. He knows how I’ve been growing and the needs that I had, emotionally, the ambitions that I had. If I had admiration for him before, after working with him, I could not explain how much of a nice person he is and what a professional he is. The way he reacted, he knew that I was suffering, because I was in a moment where <b>[City]</b> needed me as well, so I felt in that sense sad, but he has been so supportive. The relationship could not be any better. I said goodbye yesterday to all the staff, the players. I cried, because they’ve been my family for three and a half years, and we had incredible moments. We had a dream to do something in England with Pep that people said was impossible. ‘The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>, you will get bullied’. We did it, in the way we wanted.

If we can create and build a culture where everybody is accountable we can bring some leadership in to the team and some expectations and put some passion and clear direction in to what we do and then we create an identity. If they feel part of that identity they will want to stay as they will enjoy it. At the moment, I feel as though they suffer a little bit. When you are suffering, sometimes you want to go away. When you enjoy you want to be part of something</p>

I tried to tell them exactly what they were going to face and after 32 minutes we had won one duel, I think. We changed our attitude, desire and organisation at half-time and then we were completely different. They had to experience how hard and tough it was going to be.

  <p><b>[How Arteta plans to get <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> ‘addicted’ to trophies again]</b> When I arrived here we were trying to fight for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. At the time we didn’t quite have the level to sustain every year to do that so the cups became very important. Obviously this club has a massive history with that and it was years without winning absolutely anything. For us to lift that first FA Cup for this football club was a massive relief. It generated a really good belief and unity around our team. That helped that group of players to achieve what they achieved later when they won other cups<br /><br />Winning brings togetherness. When you have beautiful experiences together and win trophies those experiences stay within the group. You like more the people you work with, you believe in them, you share some fantastic moments. That stays. That habit of winning, winning, winning. When you win you don’t want to stop. You become addicts to that. We have to try to implement that at this football club<br /><br />It’s too powerful, the fan base we have. Our history. How much these people have been with this football club, the great players and teams they’ve seen. That connection is so powerful. Without it I think that’s impossible. They’re looking for success again for this football club, they’re used to that, there’s a history relating to that</p>

I wanted him to step up, I wanted him to put all his qualities - his personality and his experience - towards the team and he has made a big step forward. I am very very pleased with him.

If you don’t talk to each other there are always moments or gaps when your focus can go and the back four can’t have those moments</p>

  <p><b>[Arteta opens up on ‘long-term’ <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> project]</b> I am convinced that we are going to do some great things together. We have every element that we need to be successful and take the club forward - and to do it in the way we want as well. It’s great to feel that the players are enjoying it, and that they believe in what we are trying to do.<br /><br />Now it’s down to us to accelerate the process as much as possible, without killing the process but by winning as many games as we can. The first thing was to make those changes in terms of our culture, how we live together, some of the behaviours that I expect from players and staff and some of the values that we have to have at this club.<br /><br />I think we changed the energy at this club. I think we brought the team and the fans together, which wasn’t an easy thing to do. And then, on the playing side, I think we are starting to see some signs of how I want the team to play, how I want it to behave, and the type of passion and commitment that the players have to show under me<br /><br />It has to be a long-term project. In the short-term, we cannot achieve all the things that this club needs. It wants to fight now with the top teams in this country and in Europe, but it is not possible. We are very far behind at the moment and everything shows how far behind we are. We need to make that gap shorter and shorter. But it’s going to take a lot of right decisions and a great amount of energy and commitment<br /><br />Without an identity, you cannot plan and you cannot convince a player to do what you want. How do you recruit a player if you don’t really know what it is that you are trying to do? How do you convince a player of the way you want to play if you don’t have clarity yourself over why you want to do it? That is the first thing, I think. You have to say, ‘This is the direction and this is what we want to do’. Then you have to convince the players and get them on board with what you are doing, and after that, you can start to build. But the identity is the foundation for everything</p>

What the club is doing at the moment is assessing the situation and trying to clarify a lot of uncertainties that we have in the future. We have to make big decisions and time-wise it is difficult to fit them in with our needs. We are trying our best and the club is trying their best.

We will try and do our best to improve the squad, maintain the players we want to maintain and move forward.<br /><br />Some leaders appear when others go and that is the responsibility. We know how the dressing room has to be managed, what type of people you need. You need a balance and obviously you need some leadership. You are talking about two players (Luiz and Xhaka) that are natural leaders, but there are many ways to be a leader. We have other people that have to step up, even if those two aren’t here. It is one of the things that in our club culture has to be implemented and they have to understand how important that is as well</p>

  <p><b>[Mikel Arteta interview: <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> must build on progress in ‘vital’ summer]</b> That is the reason why we do what we do. It’s good that these things actually happen in games because it helps to convince the players and it’s a reward for the effort that they are putting in. Those are the areas we want to press the ball, that’s how we want to do it, and this is how aggressive we want the side to be<br /><br />I would still like to see it in a more consistent way, with more speed and more intent at times. But the structure is getting there, whether we are playing with one formation or another, and so is the flexibility, the rotation of positions, the movement and the patterns of play. There are some good signs<br /><br /><b>[Those signs were not immediately apparent in the wake of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s losses to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and Brighton following the restart]</b> It was difficult to handle, after three months of lockdown when the players were so willing, getting hit in the face straight away<br /><br />At Brighton, I think at moments we played really, really well. We completely dominated and should have gone two or three-nil up. But then we gave the opponent the game in seven minutes. We cannot accept that. But the response was really good. We can never fault the players’ effort, how much they are trying, it’s just about competing in certain moments<br /><br />From then on, we needed another step in terms of commitment, of aggression, of willingness, of trying to be better, and we won three games in a row against very difficult sides<br /><br /><b>[doubts remain over the future of <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> - despite Arteta’s insistence]</b> I know that the situation that we have at the club and the context that we are in, but the club knows my plan. In January, the situation was that we had to fill some gaps and give some stability to the squad. Now is the moment to make another step forward and improve the squad and the players that we have<br /><br />Yes, absolutely. We have a very strong group <b>[working on signings]</b> and the communication is really clear, not only with <b>[head of football]</b> Raul <b>[<a href="raul-sanllehi.html">Sanllehi</a>]</b>, <b>[managing director]</b> Vinai <b>[Venkatsham]</b>, <b>[contract negotiator]</b> Huss <b>[Fahmy]</b> and <b>[technical director]</b> <a href="edu.html">Edu</a>, but also with the ownership about where we want to go<br /><br />The margin for error is very, very small. The gap between the two top teams and the rest is really, really big and everybody is trying to catch up. The competition is between six, seven, eight, maybe even nine clubs now to fight for those positions, so we have to be very smart and we have to be very decisive when we make our decisions<br /><br />I learned then how important it is that everybody buys into what you are doing if you want to create something long-term. We weren’t able to change what we had to change in the first season, but we were able to do that in the second season. We were very aggressive and suddenly everything clicked and everything changed<br /><br />First you have to identify where you can get better, but then you need everyone to be willing and to make a big effort to do it, because the process can be very slow or it can be very quick. That depends on how strong you are in your decision-making, and whether someone is doubting because a few results don’t go their way, or whether they are even more aggressive, they can see what you are trying to do and they support you totally<br /><br /><b>[Backing Luiz, supporting <a href="william-saliba.html">Saliba</a>]</b> His attitude and the way he has behaved with everybody at the club, not just in easy moments but in difficult moments, tells me everything about the person. He knows the role he has here. You can ask any player in the team how he is with his team-mates, what he brings to the table, and how willing he is to do well at this football club<br /><br />He made a really difficult decision to leave <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> with two years left on his contract. It was a complicated decision to change clubs in London like that. But he felt it was the right move and that is the type of character he is. I will keep pushing him, keep trying to make him better and stop his weaknesses so that all the positive things he has can flourish<br /><br /><b>[Mikel Arteta on <a href="william-saliba.html">William Saliba</a>]</b> I’m sure about how he is going to treat him, how he is going to look after him, how he is going to guide him. The young players need stable players around them with experience who have lots of leadership. The way David supports them is very important to us<br /><br />I am excited to work with him but I am worried about the expectations because I know how difficult it is to play as a central defender in this country.<br /><br />It is one of the most complicated positions here. The step is really, really big. William had a really positive season last year, but he has had a really difficult one this year with injuries. We know where the potential is, but to fulfil that potential every three days at the highest level is a different task<br /><br />So, tranquilo<br /><br />He is, in my opinion, in phase one or two of his development. He has a lot of things to learn but hopefully, we can give him the right environment to make that process very quick. I know the player. He has the right mentality, the right attitude, the right physique. But he needs to fit in and that’s something nobody knows until the moment he lands in that dressing room<br /><br />I am always very optimistic. I didn’t expect this many challenges in the first six months here, but it’s part of our job. There are always a lot of unexpected things that arise. We just have to try to solve them in the best possible way, be positive and move forward</p>

  <p><b>[Mikel Arteta: <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> boss says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> is still a world class manager]</b> Absolutely <b>[he’s still a world class manager]</b>. They have had some up and downs, but overall you can clearly see what he wants to bring to the club. He manages the energy, the momentum and established a really strong culture in strong football club that does it. I have huge respect for Jose and what he’s trying to do. He makes sure that he wins and he has won at every single club he has been. I’m sure he will be successful. It will take him a bit of time. He has a very clear way of playing and how he manages games. Clean sheets is a big part of what he wants to do. They have had a lot of injuries, that’s a big disadvantage that they have. I know that he has done it <b>[before]</b>. I know people who have worked with him, he always finds a way to be successful. I’m sure he will do it again<br /><br /><b>[<a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> can end Spurs’ trophyless run]</b> Yes, but they have been really close. They have come so far as a club and as a team and they have been competing with top teams in Champions League finals, which is a huge thing to do. That’s probably one of the reasons that they have brought Jose in, because of his experience in dealing with those situations and having that extra edge to become a winning team<br /><br /><b>[Sunday’s game will be refereed by Michael Oliver, the VAR official who came under fire from <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> after he ruled out a <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> goal against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> last week]</b> I never have any concern about the decision of the referee. Nowadays, everything’s so professional, dedicated and they’re under so much pressure and criticism. I know they try their best with the decisions that they have to make. They’re getting more and more complicated because of the speed of the game and how quickly they have to react, and the pressure they have with the new VAR system as well. We’re here to support them, we need them, they’re a big part of that. Now we complain that we don’t have the fans and we realise how important they are, maybe one day we won’t have referees and we’re going to say, ‘Wow, they were crucial for this game to work’.</p>

  <p><b>[Mikel Arteta happy to help <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> settle in at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> I am very impressed with him. Just how he was acting and working on his rehab. Everybody loves him at the club and it is not a coincidence, he earns that every single day: the way he treats people, the way he works around the way, the energy he brings to the place. Then with his performances I am delighted. He has adapted really well. He is a player that gives you everything in every session and every game and the quality as well that he is adding. You help him with pleasure because of what he brings, how willing he is all the time to work, improve and give his maximum to the team<br /><br />He had a really difficult period because of the injuries, because he moved to a different city, a different context that he had in Glasgow with a club that was winning all the time and where he was very settled. It was a challenge for him. He has been dealing with that in the best possible way, with some difficulties. He needed the club to support him, he needed his team-mates to make life easier for him. We are all trying to help him.</p>

  <p><b>[Mikel Arteta says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> will try to emulate <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> ‘our way, with our resources’]</b> Obviously, it took them some time to rebuild the squad and to create a new culture, a new philosophy, and a game model that suited the coach. They started to recruit every single player in relation to what they needed and I think where they were really smart is they bought a specificity for every position that was required. And financially they had big backing and made some big signings, which completely changed the club. The context right now is different to what it was four years ago and the abilities for a club to rebuild something are more limited, but certainly it is something we have to look at, how they did it, because it’s a great example. But we know we have to do it our way with our resources, having in mind the context right now is different. But we are heading to be the best, that is my only objective with this club, and we have to find a way to do it.<br /><br />if you look at the last games and the way they have played, and the line-ups they are putting out, you can tell they are coming here with total commitment and trying to win. The result they had at (Man) City (a 4-0 defeat), it could have been completely different, and you cannot question the attitude, the energy of that team, in any minute of any game. That is probably one of the non-negotiables they have and you can see that in every game<br /><br />I believe it is important to have momentum going into important matches and in order to do that, you have to go game by game. We will assess how the players are - a lot of them have played crazy minutes up to now and we have games every two and a half days. But we will have the strongest team possible here (for Liverpool) and again on Saturday.</p>

But a lot of things change and a lot of things of changing. And a lot of clubs that were always in their history in the Champions League are now not, so we are not the only ones in that situation. It’s never in the history of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> that you had seven teams at that level competing for those places. These records are there to break, so it’s something that has happened, so obviously we need to know that there is a reason behind it. It’s not bad luck, it’s not one element or two elements. It’s a lot of things that have to be changed in order to accomplish again the level that we want for this football club.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defender <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> in action]</b> I’m so happy for him. It’s been a difficult period for him since he moved, just trying to adapt to a new club, a new city, with the injuries that he had. His effort, his energy and his willingness is paying off, and it always does long term. So it’s a very clear example that if you keep fighting, keep achieving your goals and you work hard and you are always humble and you are always positive and trying to help, things come your way</p>

  <p><b>[Arteta: City deserve Champions League]</b> There is no question about what happened. They completely deserve to be in the Champions League because what they done on the pitch is unquestionable - and the regulators have looked at it and have decided that they haven’t done anything wrong. So, you have the two aspects that are really clear and transparent. They are going to be in the Champions League and they deserve it for what they do on the pitch and what they do outside the pitch</p>

They have to come to a deal with him; maybe he’ll take £200k a week somewhere else. I don’t know how this gets resolved though. Does he want to play football? If he loves football, he has to come to a deal with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, but it’s easy to say that. Nobody wants to lose £150k a week, no matter how much you earn!

You can see how <b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> build their squad and there is no magic, you need to improve the squad with quality, quality players. And we need a bigger squad to compete in this competition. That is the challenge. It’s a massive job. You only have to look at the difference between the two teams - it’s enormous. The gap in many areas we can’t improve it in two months but the gap between the accountability, the energy, the commitment and the fight between the two teams is now equal. Before it wasn’t like this. I’m very proud of that. The rest will take some time but at least we’ve got that now and my message to the players is with that we can create something</p>

That’s not the issue, for sure. There are many different aspects. Obviously the financial one, depending on where we finish, is one.

Everybody has the same ambition, we are in all of this together. But if you ask me if I know right now what do I have and how can I do it, I’m sorry but I don’t know because there are a lot of questions that we cannot resolve right now with the situation we have. One is financially and the other one is because we do not know if we are in Europe, and because we have players that we don’t know what’s going to happen <b>[with]</b>. That’s the reality<br /><br />It’s not about sending a message, we all have the same objective which is to try to bring the club back as quickly as possible, fighting with the top teams in the country and in Europe and that’s it, and I want to do that as quickly as possible. I speak with them <b>[<a href="josh-kroenke.html">Kroenke</a> and the directors]</b> and I have a really, really good and open relationship, that’s why when you mention that I am surprised because I don’t need to do that. I can make a phone call and speak to them and they have been very, very supportive from the first day that I joined the club and they were very much participating in the decision to bring me back here - and the same with Raul and Vinai and <a href="edu.html">Edu</a>. There are no gaps or friction or anything there</p>
