  <p>[Younes Belhanda says Nice team-mate Mario Balotelli is a world star] He is a world star and is recognised everywhere. When you have Mario Balotelli coming to OGC Nice, that’s a big thing! He can unlock a situation at any time. We have seen him throughout the season when we are stuck at 1-1 or 0-0, he has managed to get a goal. He got a double against Lille, for example. I came here to play football and have fun. I had nothing to prove at all. We have had a great season and it is not over. It’s the same for Mario. I do not think he came here to raise his game, he does not have anything to prove, but he needed time to play and that’s how he should be viewed.<br /><br />There is always a chance. As I have already said to some media, it is not my responsibility. That’s with the club. If it was my decision, then I will stay because I feel good. We have enjoyed a great year, we are qualified for the preliminary rounds of the Champions League</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The Moroccan playmaker, Younes Belhanda, says the club’s surge this season with an attractive on-field identity can lure great players to the Allianz Riviera] We want to dictate the game. We’re not direct and we don’t play long. We want to be on the ball, creating, ,moving the opponent, playing one-twos. That’s what the manager wants and that’s what you want as a player.<br /><br />I saw their style of play last season and they played well with the ball. That’s what we want as footballers: to be on the ball a lot, not being in a team that’s always defending. Players will want to come here because they know the club plays great football. We also know that it’s a club that has ambition and that’s been demonstrated this year<br /><br />Lucien Favre is a coach who wants his team to play. Before matches he tells us that we will win because of the process. He does not focus on winning, he focuses on playing our game, that’s all. And we demonstrate that game after game</p>
