  <p><b>[Blues legend Trevor Francis says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> must include a loan return to <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> in any deal for Jude Bellingham]</b> Wherever Jude Bellingham goes I think he should have it written in the contract that he immediately goes back to <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham City</a> to play as a loan player because he has got to improve and the only way he is going to improve is by playing regularly. To go to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> or <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> or wherever it may be, with respect to the lad he is not going to be a regular in the first team and he needs to be playing regular first team football to improve as a footballer<br /><br />I think he is a very talented young man; I sound like <a href="brian-clough.html">Brian Clough</a> saying that don’t I? For his age he has shown a lot of maturity when I have watched him. I think he is blessed with great individual talent. I am not exactly sure at this moment what his best position is but then again I think his manager would probably say exactly the same, but he is just a natural footballer who I think is capable of playing in any kind of position</p>
