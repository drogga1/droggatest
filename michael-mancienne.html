  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> youngster Michael Mancienne says More English players should follow the lead of <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> in playing abroad to develop their game]</b> Obviously <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> is a great player and it is good to see English talent playing abroad. Foreigners come to England all the time and it obviously seems like a normal thing. I know <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is one of the best leagues in the world but to go and get that experience of playing abroad is massive and it can make you a better player. It can definitely help your career, especially for a young player struggling to break into their first team. If you get the chance to go abroad I think that’s massive and it can further your career<br /><br /><b>[Asked if more English players should go to the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>]</b> Yeah most definitely, I think it is massive<br /><br /><b>[Mancienne has praised manager <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>]</b> I think <b>[<a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>]</b> has done a brilliant job. He came in and he changed a lot. People weren’t sure if it was the right thing to do but giving younger players a chance to have that experience is only going to make them a better team and a better squad. You saw Germany years ago, their U21 team that I played against in the U21 Euros, that team went on and won the World Cup. They trusted that team and they kept them together. It doesn’t matter how old you are, young players need that experience if they want to improve. <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a> has been brilliant in pushing, not changing the team and making it younger, more vibrant and full of energy</p>
