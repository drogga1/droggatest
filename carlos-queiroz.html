  <p><b>[Carlos Queiroz speaks about Lionel Messi]</b> I’ve always said that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is an extraordinary player. He’s out of this world. If he were human, he wouldn’t have had that magical moment in that match <b>[Argentina beat Iran in the group phase with a late <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> goal]</b>. I don’t usually like losing, but I didn’t come away from that defeat with a negative feeling. It’s when something magical like that happens that you know that football is alive and kicking, and that’s why it’s one of the best sports in the world to watch. And it’s even more of a special moment when it comes from a player who shouldn’t be allowed to play by <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> until it’s proven that he’s actually human!</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Queiroz on Colombia win 1-0 against Qatar]</b> It’s always like this when you have a team with the obligation to win and another which is very organised and that plays very tight on defence, not giving up spaces. If you don’t score early, you are going to suffer. We won because Colombia played the way I like Colombia to play, fully focused during the 90 minutes</p>

  <p><b>[Iran coach Carlos Queiroz revealed himself to be a big fan of VAR technology despite the replays having ruled out Ezatolahi’s strike because of a marginal offside]</b> For me VAR has come in 10 years too late. If we had six more months (without it) maybe we would have had a point - but it is good for the credibility of football. We showed tremendous fighting spirit against a favourite to win the World Cup. There is no doubt Spain play wonderful, stylish football but I thought we deserved a better result. We came to this World Cup and nobody gave us a chance but we can still qualify for the second round and I think that is something we should applaud. We can guarantee that we will keep working for our dreams, and our dream is to qualify for the second round. We know it will be difficult against Portugal but we don’t come here expecting easy things</p>

  <p><b>[The case of Roddy Zambrano summed up the entire argument. The Ecuadorian declined to use VAR on two occasions when Argentina appeared to have a strong claim for a penalty in their semi-final against Brazil]</b> VAR is like a child. When we are children sometimes we fall and we pick ourselves up in order to learn how to walk. We have to support VAR because football’s credibility is at stake</p>

  <p><b>[Colombia manager Carlos Queiroz has said it was his decision to not call up <a href="james-rodriguez.html">James Rodriguez</a> for his side’s upcoming friendlies]</b> Some have said that James requested not to be called up, but that’s not the truth. I’ve never had a player ask that. The decision is natural, it’s my decision. The players who are here correspond to the objectives we have, wanting to maintain a base of 15 or 16 players. We can’t be upset if one player or another one isn’t here. We can’t just stick with the most important references of each team. There’s a need to look for the future. I hope to have the best players ready for when we’ll be competing for three points</p>

  <p><b>[Colombia boss Carlos Queiroz hails Rangers star <a href="alfredo-morelos.html">Alfredo Morelos</a> ahead of Peru clash]</b> It’s everyone’s responsibility in my team to score goals - not just the strikers. All the attacking players in the squad are confident, especially <a href="alfredo-morelos.html">Alfredo Morelos</a> who has already scored more than 20 goals this season. He is playing really well and I am confident he will show the form he has shown for his club for us</p>

  <p><b>[Colombia coach Carlos Queiroz says <a href="james-rodriguez.html">James Rodriguez</a>’s difficult situation at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is a concern]</b> All I can say is that we, at the FCF (Colombian Football Federation), take care to look after all of our players. James’s situation is worrying for us. We know that he is in a difficult situation at this moment in time, it’s a situation which technically and professionally isn’t the best. But then there are other players who are playing even less. James’s case is very strange, it’s been a strange season for him but all of the coaching staff and I personally are doing what we can to help James, whose situation is a little more complicated<br /><br />No one is disputing the quality James has, or <b>[<a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> defender Santiago]</b> Arias and <b>[Atalanta forward Luis]</b> Muriel, who are also both in a difficult situation. That’s why I am doing everything possible so that the players are in the best possible condition. My obligation is to ensure that all of them are fit to play<br /><br /><b>[coach Queiroz is looking forward to being co-hosts of the Copa America]</b> We love the pressure, it is the feeling which gives us motivation to perform better and be successful</p>
