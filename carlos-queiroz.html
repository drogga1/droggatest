  <p><b>[Carlos Queiroz - Qatar coaching staff lack ethics]</b> Two staff insulted me in Spanish, I can’t understand it. People don’t have the right to spend the game insulting and offending other people. I have never seen this in my life before.<br /><br />One thing I am sure, the coaching staff is not at the level of the Qatar national team. The Qatar national team deserves much better.</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Queiroz speaks about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>]</b> I’ve always said that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is an extraordinary player. He’s out of this world. If he were human, he wouldn’t have had that magical moment in that match <b>[Argentina beat Iran in the group phase with a late <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> goal]</b>. I don’t usually like losing, but I didn’t come away from that defeat with a negative feeling. It’s when something magical like that happens that you know that football is alive and kicking, and that’s why it’s one of the best sports in the world to watch. And it’s even more of a special moment when it comes from a player who shouldn’t be allowed to play by <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> until it’s proven that he’s actually human!</p>

  <p><b>[Iran coach Carlos Queiroz revealed himself to be a big fan of VAR technology despite the replays having ruled out Ezatolahi’s strike because of a marginal offside]</b> For me VAR has come in 10 years too late. If we had six more months (without it) maybe we would have had a point - but it is good for the credibility of football. We showed tremendous fighting spirit against a favourite to win the World Cup. There is no doubt Spain play wonderful, stylish football but I thought we deserved a better result. We came to this World Cup and nobody gave us a chance but we can still qualify for the second round and I think that is something we should applaud. We can guarantee that we will keep working for our dreams, and our dream is to qualify for the second round. We know it will be difficult against Portugal but we don’t come here expecting easy things</p>

  <p><b>[Iran and Portugal face a do-or-die World Cup encounter in Group B]</b> If Morocco and Spain were difficult <b>[games]</b>, Portugal is even more difficult. We knew this, we didn’t come here to play easy teams. Not even in their dreams did my players imagine they would one day play against Cristiano, and all of Portugal’s other great players so they are very excited. We will try to do our best, concentrate and fight from the first minute. We have nothing to lose, they have everything to lose, we have everything to gain. We also hope we have that bit of luck that is always necessary.</p>

  <p><b>[Coach Carlos Queiroz is still finding Monday’s loss to Portugal hard to accept]</b> The reality is you stop the game for VAR and there is an elbow. An elbow is a red card in the rules. The rules don’t say if it is Messi or Ronaldo it’s a little bit. It is a red card. I am not in a good mood, as you can see. There could have been at least one more penalty against Portugal, at least one. Five guys sitting upstairs and they don’t see an elbow. Give me a break.</p>

  <p><b>[Queiroz questions Real Madrid’s ‘Galactico’ policy]</b> When I was told about the project and offered the job, I didn’t feel deceived or lied to. I knew exactly what the job entailed from what <b>[Jorge]</b> Valdano had explained to me. ‘We need a coach to lead this project and you are the man we are looking for’. When you receive an offer from Real Madrid, the first thing you do is accept - you think about it later. During the years I was at Real Madrid, it was a selling club - not a buying club, as it had a target to reach, lowering the deficit to zero, which the president had promised club members. The policy was basically: six Galacticos - all of whom were in midfield to attack and the ‘Pavones’ in defence. But in that squad, there was also <b>[Claude]</b> Makelele and <b>[Fernando]</b> Morientes and both of them left.<br /><br />With Morientes, immediately after the Super Cup, I had a couple of words with him and said: ‘See you on Tuesday’ and he replied: ‘Tuesday? Haven’t you heard? I’ve been loaned out to Monaco’. I had no idea.<br /><br />At least, I thought, I still had Makelele and I could drop <b>[Ivan]</b> Helguera back into central defence, where he did well. But shortly after that Makelele left to join Chelsea because he wasn’t selling shirts and so that Beckham could play in the middle. Beckham’s position was right wing but when I joined Real Madrid, that position was already filled by Figo.<br /><br />There were more problems. Madrid had signed Gabriel Milito to replace captain Fernando Hierro who had been released just two days after winning the league. We’d lost Hierro. I needed a centre-back so I brought in Milito. He signed the contract after passing his medical but by the afternoon it had all fallen through, he had been rejected. I recommended signing Luisao, who was at Benfica and Pepe, who was with Maritimo - we could have signed Pepe for 1.5 million euros then years, years later, Madrid paid 30 million for him.<br /><br />There were three mortal sins committed when I was at Madrid - the three ‘M’s: Milito, Makelele and Morientes. Those three mistakes cost the jobs of the three or four coaches after me and many millions of euros in rebuilding for Madrid. Those three sins changed everything and was the reason why it all went bad.<br /><br />I don’t regret my time at Real Madrid. I’d say yes and do it all over again. You know, the idea wasn’t bad - mixing top players with young, developing players. Nowadays, young players have to be good - not players who Spanish clubs wouldn’t even take on loan</p>

  <p><b>[On Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> I was once in my office at Carrington and saw something moving in the trees far away. Maybe it was a spy. I called security and asked him. He came back to me and said: ‘It’s Cristiano Ronaldo. He’s training alone’. He was unique. It was very rare to see in a young player so much talent and such a strong personality, purpose and commitment. I read about Arnold Schwarzenegger learning to dance the tango. He was obsessed to be a perfectionist. Cristiano is the same.<br /><br />When I renewed my <b>[Real Madrid]</b> contract I said I’d still be playing when I’m 41 - it was meant half jokingly and half seriously. If I feel good, without any injuries and I am still motivated, I’ll play until I’m 35, 41 or 45. I don’t know</p>

  <p><b>[Colombia have appointed Carlos Queiroz as the head coach of the national team]</b> It’s an honour for me, a feeling of great happiness, for the trust and hope that the federation have placed in my work. I come here with a lot of humility and I will try to do my best to take good care of the heritage that Colombia has developed as well as its prestige and reputation throughout the world. It all starts with the players, they are the most important part of a project. Now the priority is selecting the best players, but we will also look at the players of the future. The players who are the heart and soul of Colombia, it’s sensible to start with those who are so important in the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Queiroz on Colombia win 1-0 against Qatar]</b> It’s always like this when you have a team with the obligation to win and another which is very organised and that plays very tight on defence, not giving up spaces. If you don’t score early, you are going to suffer. We won because Colombia played the way I like Colombia to play, fully focused during the 90 minutes</p>

I’ve never had a player ask that. The decision is natural, it’s my decision. The players who are here correspond to the objectives we have, wanting to maintain a base of 15 or 16 players. We can’t be upset if one player or another one isn’t here. We can’t just stick with the most important references of each team. There’s a need to look for the future. I hope to have the best players ready for when we’ll be competing for three points</p>

James’s situation is worrying for us. We know that he is in a difficult situation at this moment in time, it’s a situation which technically and professionally isn’t the best. But then there are other players who are playing even less. James’s case is very strange, it’s been a strange season for him but all of the coaching staff and I personally are doing what we can to help James, whose situation is a little more complicated<br /><br />No one is disputing the quality James has, or <b>[<a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> defender Santiago]</b> Arias and <b>[Atalanta forward Luis]</b> Muriel, who are also both in a difficult situation.
