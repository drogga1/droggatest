This result is a source of great pride for the fans and the team, particularly because we were playing with ten men. It tasted like a victory. I watched the game from the Curva and it was wonderful. I want to compliment the lads: they are not inferior to the Nerazzurri</p>

  <p><b>[Elkann has urged the stuttering <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> to rediscover their fighting spirit]</b> The last two games have been bloodcurdling.

The players are not honouring this history and are not giving their best. This is unacceptable. I would like for them to take a cold shower in the locker room. I would like to see a combative and determined side. It’s unacceptable to carry on like this</p>

The plan presented is ambitious and aims to see the club at the top of the sporting world, where it’s been throughout history, and above all where it will be in the future.

We feel ready to sustain this route.<br /><br />Elkann went on to underline the importance of the club’s fans and made it clear that the <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> faithful will not be forgotten. They more than anyone are at the heart of the club’s future, they are an integral part. In this plan the involvement of our extraordinary fans will be greater. The stadium, the fantastic venue to be opened soon, will be a symbol of this union between the team and the fans. A union that must be stronger than ever</p>
