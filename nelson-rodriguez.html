  <p>[The New York Red Bulls have traded midfielder Dax McCarty to the Chicago Fire in exchange for $400,000 in general allocation money] Since the middle of 2016, we made acquiring Dax our No. 1 priority. In order to do so, we had to exchange worthy and appropriate compensation. We believe adding his character and leadership in the locker room, as well as his exceptional soccer abilities on the field, dramatically improves our team.</p>

  <p>[Bastian Schweinsteiger has signed a new contract with the Chicago Fire] It was a priority to re-sign Bastian and we’re pleased that he will remain with the club. He’s a proven winner who was an integral part of our success in 2017. Bastian’s talent combined with his character and qualities off the field are vital to our squad as we continue to build a championship program.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The Chicago Fire have acquired Serbian international Aleksandar Katai on loan from Deportivo Alaves] Aleksandar should make our attack more diversified. He has the ability to turn a game on a single play whether it be off the dribble, with a pass or cross or even on set pieces. His desire to triumph should also fit well in our locker room.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The Chicago Fire have acquired midfielder Tony Tchani from the Vancouver Whitecaps in exchange for $150,000 in targeted allocation money] Tony is a proven player and winner within MLS. His skill-set will be complementary to our current squad and we are pleased to add his talents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Bastian Schweinsteiger will spend another season in the United States after agreeing to a new deal for a third season with the Chicago Fire] In a lot of ways Basti has come to embody our club, the prototypical Fire player and the spirit of Chicago: industrious, intelligent, enthusiastic, talented and world-class. His return demonstrates our continuing effort to build a championship program, both on and off the field.</p>
