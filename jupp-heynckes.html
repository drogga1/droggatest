You see the transfer window and how crazy it has become, and how difficult it is even for well-established clubs to keep up their momentum. Clubs like Celtic and others like Anderlecht can’t keep up. But I would never make the mistake of under-estimating Celtic.<br /><br />Celtic are a physical, aggressive team. They have a lot of experience and they have won the Scottish Premiership six times in a row. They also have a great coach in Brendan Rodgers and have a great history in Europe but we want to qualify for the next round.</p>

The best players must play, no matter if they are young or old.<br /><br />A club like Bayern should buy an absolute star who costs a lot every now and then</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich star Thomas Muller has hailed Jupp Heynckes for bringing the Bundesliga giants together after a difficult start to the season]</b> A jolt went through the team. I don’t know if Jupp Heynckes performed magic, but with the change of the coach responsibility was pushed onto the team. We made individual mistakes, where even the best tactics in the world would not have helped. Jupp Heynckes managed, with his experience and his instincts, to make sure we were always united. We won 1-0 three times in a row without dominating the opponents. So, there is clearly space to improve. In the big games we have to reach our best.<br /><br />What does dominant mean? In Paris we lost 3-0 and it was blown up into a major issue. Then we won 3-1 and it was blown up into a major issue again. It’s a pity football is only about the result and the coverage became extreme in both directions. I can tell you a story about this. In one case two articles were put online by mistake after the Under-21 final we won: one completely a farewell to the German youth and one gushing praise!<br /><br />That’s a joke. So, you see that the content which is presented to the fan is often far away from the football reality. For sure, we know the result is what counts in the end. But I cannot understand why the details of the game are often completely ignored</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich manager Jupp Heynckes is confident Real Madrid will recover from their recent malaise]</b> That Madrid is going through a low in the league at the moment is, in my opinion, quite normal, especially if you have won the Champions League twice and been Spanish champions too. In addition, Real have given away three very good players in the summer with Alvaro Morata, Pepe and James Rodriguez, perhaps to save salaries. They have not bought big and thought that with the young players they can compensate for that. You need a really good mix between young and old, between experienced and hungry players. Nevertheless, you must not write off Real in the Champions League. They have much more experience than Paris Saint-Germain. Much more! I believe they will win the tie. They have a good team for playing in European competition. When we first won the Champions League again in 1998, we finished fourth in the league. I know from personal experience Madrid should never be underestimated.<br /><br />We want to become Bundesliga champions, we are not yet. We also want to be successful in the German Cup and in the Champions League. In the Champions League, it will certainly be very difficult, because there are top teams, who - in part, with huge costs - have greatly improved their squads in the transfer market. It will be increasingly difficult for the Bundesliga and also for Bayern Munich to be as successful internationally as Bayern have been before in their history. There are always cycles in football. Recently, Real Madrid have been incredibly successful, before that it was Barcelona in a certain period of time. Bayern Munich were in 2013 and also in previous years. So there are always snapshots. Right now it is said that the English Premier League is the best and at the moment it might be like that. But the English teams have to prove that now in the knockout phase of the Champions League</p>

He knows exactly who is in our sights and which players he would like to have. He has high quality players in mind.<br /><br />Robert turns 30 in the summer, he has a contract until 2021. Football is short-lived and unreasonable things happen. <b>[The Dembele and Aubameyang situation]</b> would not happen at Bayern because here it is clear from the outset that Bayern don’t do things like that.

  <p><b>[Former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> manager Jupp Heynckes says Overpriced <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> is not an ‘absolute top player’]</b> For me, he has not yet made a breakthrough to being an absolute top player. I think this is a player at a crossroads. Will he keep working hard on himself, or will he remain just as an exceptional talent? He has to be ready to make the next big step. Because there is no use in flashing the talent from time to time. I also honestly tell you that I don’t consider the price justifiable<br /><br /><b>[Heynckes thinks the club made the correct decision to appoint <a href="hansi-flick.html">Flick</a>]</b> Hansi is a good person with a great character. I already said months ago that he is the ideal coach for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> because of his human nature and football competence. He is authentic and empathetic. You can’t imagine a better coach for FC Bayern<br /><br /><b>[Former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> legend <a href="oliver-kahn.html">Oliver Kahn</a> will step up to be <a href="karl-heinz-rummenigge.html">Karl-Heinz Rummenigge</a>’s replacement]</b> <b>[Kahn]</b> is a win for <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a>. Because everything he exemplified as a player, the will to win, the absolute professionalism, he now brings it back to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. He has so much experience and has played at the highest level. I think he is the right man</p>

For me, he is the ideal coach because he has already had a lot of experience in various positions in football in the past<br /><br />His qualities are professional competence, leadership in all areas, seriousness, solidity and an excellent public demeanour. I wish him and <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> the greatest success in all three competitions</p>
