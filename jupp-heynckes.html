Since experiencing the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> up close in the 1970s, I have never seen such a player. That’s why I can’t get it into my head that Philipp has never been voted Footballer of the Year by journalists.

I thought that was it. Critics say I’ve been out the game for four years but football’s not been re-invented. I’ve followed very closely. Age is a number and nothing more. Some feel old at 45 but I’ve not changed. I still love music and sport. I feel young</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich are keeping a close eye on Bordeaux star Malcom]</b> I do not know the player enough. But he’s certainly in the focus of our scouting department, like many other players as well. <b>[Sporting director]</b> Hasan Salihamidzic has very clear ideas and is driving forward the plans for next season. He knows exactly who is in our sights and which players he would like to have. He has high quality players in mind.<br /><br />Robert turns 30 in the summer, he has a contract until 2021. Football is short-lived and unreasonable things happen. <b>[The Dembele and Aubameyang situation]</b> would not happen at Bayern because here it is clear from the outset that Bayern don’t do things like that. This is an absolute top club, incredibly well run and with a good atmosphere. I cannot imagine a case of Aubameyang or Dembele at Bayern</p>

  <p><b>[Jupp Heynckes was far from pleased by his players’ performances in Seville]</b> We lost the ball too often and lacked structure in midfield, which allowed Sevilla to create chances.

But if we want to win the Champions League, we need to improve.</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo has been taunted by Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness]</b> You never know if it <b>[Madrid’s extra preparation time]</b> is something important. The most important thing at the moment is the psychology. It is key that everyone is already fixed on the Madrid game, that we only think and focus about that. The truth is that it was very important to win before playing the Champions League, it always is. We are used to playing every three days for a long time, the important thing is that the players want to play always and be prepared. It is vital that they want to be on the pitch to show me that they want to play.</p>

  <p><b>[Jupp Heynckes on Football]</b> I adore football and, if I do a job, I do it 100 per cent. These are the games you work for and lots of coaches never get the chance to play one of these in their lives. I came back at a very old age and now I have the privilege of being successful again, reaching a semi-final and possibly going through to the final. I am confident<br /><br />Football has changed but my style of leadership, my approach, hasn’t. The game has progressed but in the end they are still people out on the pitch, people with different personalities and feelings<br /><br /><b>[Jupp Heynckes on <a href="james-rodriguez.html">James Rodríguez</a>]</b> He was a bit down, not in good physical shape either, but I have talked to him a lot and bit by bit his confidence came back. He is more free now and our fans love seeing him play: he has fantastic vision, he’s integrated into the team, happy in Munich. The team that wins the Champions League is the one that is most united<br /><br /><b>[For all Heynckes’s confidence, for all that he responded to questions about how he could stop <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> by replying]</b> I might ask you how they can stop Robert Lewandowski<br /><br /><b>[Jupp Heynckes on <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> personality]</b> I have played against great players and coaches: <a href="arrigo-sacchi.html">Sacchi</a>, <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>, <a href="marcello-lippi.html">Lippi</a>, Happel and I have always been a great admirer of <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> as a player and a coach. I love how <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> play and his calmness on the touchline, not making a big fuss, not playing to the gallery or the TV cameras. For 90 minutes he follows what is happening on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[Jupp Heynckes critisises <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>]</b> A team has to respect itself, have human qualities.

  <p><b>[Jupp Heynckes has helped James Rodriguez after a complicated start to the season under Ancelotti]</b> He was a little depressed. I took care of him, I had lots of talks with him, and step by step he found confidence. He is more relaxed within the team. Our fans here, when they see him play football, they enjoy it. Above all he is a player who has fantasy, he has an overview. He is more open-minded and gives the impression he feels well and has settled in Munich. I think that is the most fundamental <b>[thing]</b>.</p>

Today we may have an even better squad. In such big games, there are really great players who have leadership skills and are leading the way.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> manager Jupp Heynckes says Overpriced <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> is not an ‘absolute top player’]</b> For me, he has not yet made a breakthrough to being an absolute top player. I think this is a player at a crossroads. Will he keep working hard on himself, or will he remain just as an exceptional talent? He has to be ready to make the next big step. Because there is no use in flashing the talent from time to time. I also honestly tell you that I don’t consider the price justifiable<br /><br /><b>[Heynckes thinks the club made the correct decision to appoint <a href="hansi-flick.html">Flick</a>]</b> Hansi is a good person with a great character.
