<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Luis Silva knew he departed Real Salt Lake with unfinished business]</b> In the back of my head, I think I always knew I was going to come back to RSL. I just didn’t know it was going to be this soon.<br /><br />When I came in the middle of the season, I don’t think I was able to express myself the way I should have. I’m just hungrier. I’m hungrier to succeed, to score, to assist, to win. I just want to get out there and play and show everyone that I am a good player and that I could compete in this league<br /><br />If you look at their roster, the 11 players that are starting are national team players. It’s a tough group to break into. I honestly felt like I never got the opportunity to play, to show my skills. In training sessions they tell you you’re doing well, but they never put you in. That’s kind of hard for you to express yourself that way<br /><br />Let me tell you, it was tough. I think this past year was the toughest year mentally for me personally, and that’s made me stronger. Mentally I’m tougher now - and I can overcome anything</p>
