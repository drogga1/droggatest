<blockquote>
  <p>[Meet Guus Til] Football is actually a game of thought, I notice that they think a little faster than I do. They have noticed small things before I’ve seen them, except in football, they are not small things, they are very decisive. When I’m standing on the field and I look at the legs of Virgil or Memphis, I think: well, there’s something to think about, Guus. That’s an eye-opener. It makes me aware of what is needed to make the next step. There is still work to be done, that is clear. I am a late bloomer in many ways. I don’t have hair yet. I’m talking about a beard, to be clear. That has to do with testosterone. There is still a lot of growing for me to do, also physically. Not that I have to grow huge thighs and calves, that is not really necessary with my way of playing. For my type of game, I need a hefty body and I’m working on that<br /><br />It’s about money and status and I have nothing to do with that myself. It doesn’t not put me off, but sometimes I despise it. Sometimes I miss school life. Then you still have people around you who live in more normal circumstances, who don’t already make an absurd amount of money for their age. I see cars and watches pass by that you don’t usually get at this stage of your life. That is very far from how I was raised. I was brought up with the idea that you are in the world to help society. That not everyone has the same opportunities</p>
