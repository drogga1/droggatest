  <p><b>[CONCACAF Chief of Football thrilled with MLS competitiveness in new CCL format]</b> I think the gap is closing and I think with this new format obviously it’s tougher to just go into a knockout round right away rather than having a group stage to see how your team’s doing and see how the other teams in the competition are doing. Now you kind of go into things with, ‘Let’s see what happens.’ Obviously teams are going in full steam ahead as we see by the lineups. The teams are putting out their top teams, they’re not taking any chances. With the group stage, perhaps you had more chances to have a bad game and still recover. Here there’s no room for error. The Mexican teams still are taking it very seriously. You could just see from the media reaction in Mexico, humiliated by the fact that three teams had lost. It’s always good when you have that kind of reaction from the fans in general and the media because you want that, you want a healthy competitive balance and you want these rivalries, not just U.S-Mexico, I think we’re starting to see other participants stepping up<br /><br />I think now, based on the results we’re seeing, you could say that it’s working, but it’s too soon to say, ‘OK, we nailed it. It’s going to stay for 20 years.’ Obviously there’s going to have to be a lot of evaluation at the conclusion of the tournament. We know we’re locked in with this format for a couple of years, but like I said we’re always working to constantly prove and we take very seriously the feedback from the teams, the leagues, the federations and our partners to try to find the best format for the competition<br /><br />The league <b>[is]</b> helping the teams by not making them play, working around the schedule and respecting the fact hat there’s a lot of things that take a toll on the teams, traveling across the region and then you’ve got to come back and play another match in 48 hours and then get back on the road to have to play another match. It puts a lot of strain on the teams, and it makes for difficult decisions for the coaching staff and also the players<br /><br />I think MLS has done a great job finding new players, talent, players with experience on the international level for their rosters. The deeper that rosters get with MLS will allow them to be competitive in the league and in regional competition. I think that’s going to make a big difference going forward. We’re already seeing that things are going shift in how MLS has been bringing talent, maybe shifting away from players who are older, retiring players to younger talent that can definitely give you more hours on those legs during the season with the quick rotation between regional competition at the international level and home competition. I think going forward the league has definitely done a good job giving the opportunity to bring in players and I think it’s only going to get better and better and better</p>

  <p><b>[Concacaf pleased with early Nations League impressions]</b> I think we’re only seeing the beginning of the success we’re going to have. I think it’s a nice warm-up to the Gold Cup, a nice celebration giving a chance to teams who have earned the right on the pitch to play in our premier competition and then our momentum will continue on to the kickoff of Nations League just a few months after the kickoff of Gold Cup, so we have a lot of good things to look forward to.<br /><br />It was a very nice surprise to see a team like Montserrat kind of look very organized, very fit and look like a well-coached team. Of course, you can say that a lot of those players play abroad, but that’s the reality also of the region is that there’s a lot of talent, a lot of good players, who unfortunately have to go look elsewhere for a more stable and more continuous platform of playing club football. And a lot of them, given their ties to the UK and having passports, etc., have easier access to those leagues. That’s great, but at least now they’re playing in their motherland, or coming back for international play which wasn’t happening in the last four years.<br /><br />We don’t have any information from any of our members who have raised the flag saying, ‘I can’t.’ That’s not true and that’s not happening. Every team is already ready to play for the next round, and it’ll be leading to some great matchups in March because a lot will be determined on the last day, whether it’s League A or Gold Cup spots<br /><br />We went into this tournament, the Nations League qualifiers, focusing a lot on just delivering the matches and making sure we were able to get everything in during the FIFA windows, especially because it’s a qualifier for Gold Cup. So we changed a lot of things within our whole competition structure. We were very pleasantly surprised by the pick-up internationally</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico, SUM confident relationship can continue to prosper]</b> Everybody will be involved. The other six not involved right now, the teams from the Hexagonal who didn’t take part in the qualifying round, those teams will be in as of the September window. It’s a big calendar and it’s nice to have the qualifying, the Gold Cup and then go right into Nations League.</p>

  <p><b>[Concacaf makes rule changes to bring Gold Cup in line with other major tournaments]</b> The roster change was something that was tested over the last editions of the Gold Cup. We tried to maybe take a little pressure off the teams that come from a long season and maybe give them the opportunity to have more flexibility. but we realized after a thorough investigation with our technical study groups and also in discussions with coaches that it really was not helping the purpose of what the rule was intended to do and it wasn’t really in line with what major competitions around the globe are doing so we decided it was no longer going to be used for the Gold Cup.<br /><br />Again, we’ve done a thorough evaluation of all of our competitions from the youth to the Gold Cup and it was decided that in our top competitions we need to have overtime in these crucial knockout games to not leave anything to chance in a penalty shootout<br /><br />We don’t want to be experimental. We definitely want to follow the lead of what governing bodies want to do. We’re obviously open and are trying these new rules for the last two years. The fourth substitution in extra time, we’ve been trying that for the last few years and it’s worked really well. We tried the fact that you can show a yellow card or even a red card to any of the coaches and officials on the bench. We’ve been very, very in line with FIFA’s refereeing department, with IFAB and we’ve been trying to be a resource for them to try things on the field, but we don’t want to explore and get into a path where we’re trying different things other than what the world of football is doing across the confederation<br /><br />We are committed to bringing VAR into Concacaf. We know there’s obviously a lot to be done because VAR is not just the technology aspect, there’s a lot of the human aspect as well that goes into the training, the simulators. That’s where we’re committed to starting. Already we have a set of referees that’s familiar with it. At the World Cup, they’ve been exposed to VAR, they were actually VAR assistants at the World Cup in Russia, but we need to grow that pool of referees that then we can put in our major competitions to officiate using the technology. The technology is probably the easiest part. It’s more how to use that technology to make sure the right decisions are made</p>
