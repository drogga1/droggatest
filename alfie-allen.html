<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Allen’s interest in football first came through his love for former Gunner Ian Wright]</b> I supported a different team when I was younger. But when I realised that <a href="ian-wright.html">Ian Wright</a> didn’t play for the club I was supporting at the time, I changed my mind! We moved to Islington and I just started to support my local club and I’ve never looked back</p>
