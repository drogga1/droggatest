  <p><b>[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion donate food to homeless after games postponed due to coronavirus]</b> Brighton &amp; Hove Albion have donated food purchased for the hospitality lounges and retail kiosks for the match against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, originally scheduled for Saturday, to the city’s homeless community. The move comes after Brighton Pavilion MP Caroline Lucas called on communities not to forget food banks and homeless charities during the coronavirus crisis, instead of panic buying. The club has donated all surplus fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products and sandwiches to Sussex Homeless Support, and a team from the organisation will be collecting the food from the American Express Community Stadium on Friday. It will then be used to serve and provide food across various night shelters and soup kitchens in and around the Brighton &amp; Hove area. Sussex Homeless Support also supply food banks and provide a service to vulnerable people such as the elderly who may be isolated in their homes</p>
