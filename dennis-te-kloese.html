  <p><b>[Mexico director Te Kloese sees bright future for Jonathan Gonzalez after El Tri debut]</b> As our manager said he’s a young player with a very good present and, I think, an important future. He’s showing a lot of good things to be able to enter in an international match at his young age. He makes good decisions, for his age he’s very mature not only on the field but also off it. I’m really happy, most of all for him and his family.<br /><br />Obviously all the players, him and everyone else, will return to their clubs where they have to show important things to keep being in the manager and coaching staff’s plans. I think Jonathan has given signs that he wants to compete and despite his young age has things that can help the team and the feeling, like Osorio said, is positive<br /><br />As it’s here in the United States, we’re giving space to our partner SUM, letting them announce it and doing things as they should be done. When they announce it, we’ll talk about it formally. There are different options, and I think it will be solidified in the upcoming days</p>

  <p><b>[Dennis te Kloese says that El Tri has all the information needed to prepare for the group stage in Russia]</b> Honestly, as soon as we knew our draw from December… with all the technology on hand and with all the new programs we have, we have a sports science department where a lot of people are working with a lot of scouts. We traveled to see our opponents Germany, Korea and Sweden live. Obviously, we’ve had access on everything. In the end, these games are of such a high importance, such high value that it’s still obviously sometimes a difficult activity to analyze 100 percent of your opponents, but within our means and whatever we have, we do everything to keep track of everybody.<br /><br />First of all, there’s a lot of respect for Korea. Personally, I visited for the U-20 World Cup. I thought it was a very enriching experience. It was interesting to see that the coach we played against at the Olympics in Brazil. This time, we didn’t play against him but we saw the team play. I think he has a very clear view on which players work and where they can do damage and where they can have value. I think in his country he should very much be appreciated as a coach. I think it’s an opponent we need to respect. Obviously they’re very clear on every aspect and how we evaluate and how we scout them</p>

  <p><b>[LA Galaxy announce $6m buyout of Giovani dos Santos contract]</b> We have been working with the player this preseason to reach an agreement that is best for both sides. We have come to this decision and believe that it is best for the club and for Giovani. We will work with the player and his representatives to find an on-field solution for the player’s next step. We appreciate what he has contributed to our club and wish him the best in his future.</p>

  <p><b>[Galaxy general manager Dennis te Kloese says that, when it comes to <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>’s future, the club is willing to discuss extending his stay with his current club when the time is right]</b> The agreement is to discuss in an adult way how he feels and how the club is doing after the season. He has consciously signed for one year because he wants to say goodbye at a good professional level. At the moment he can easily come along</p>

  <p><b>[Galaxy general manager Dennis te Kloese expressed his delight at capturing the winger, and expects big things from Cristian Pavon once he settles into life in the United States]</b> Cristian is a young and dynamic attacking addition who has the talent to be one of the most effective offensive players in <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a>. He is a high-caliber player who will be a valuable piece to our roster moving forward. By providing him with a stable environment and a coach he knows well, we are confident that he can continue to grow and improve as a player within our club. We are extremely excited to add him to our squad and look forward to his contributions with the LA Galaxy</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="la-galaxy.html">LA Galaxy</a> general manager Dennis te Kloese says he expects to have talks with <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> in the coming days as reports continue to swirl surrounding the forward’s future]</b> My deal with him, and I have known him for a long time, is to sit down with him after things have calmed down postseason and evaluate what is good for him, his family, his fitness and for us as well<br /><br />You all already know <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a>. He is a topic all by himself, he is a unique character, with so many facets. And I think he helped us this year, basically and obviously, with the number of goals he scored, which was so impressive. And all of that we will be talking about, for sure, next week when he returns. He is a very mature athlete in that sense and so we will first and foremost be speaking like adults and after that we will determine what is the best for all parties involved</p>

  <p><b>[Galaxy GM Dennis te Kloese says it will be very challenging for <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to play a full season amid the coronavirus outbreak]</b> We’ve never really focused on when we’re returning. We focus on each day and making sure everybody’s finding the right ways, physically and mentally, to stay with it. I certainly understand that every time the date gets moved back, it’s a little bit more of a challenge. Even some of the most conscientious players, in certain moments, start to lose a little bit.<br /><br />We know that eventually we’ll be back together and the game will continue. But making sure that in the moment we all realize how important the job is to stay home and do everything to get past the virus, that’s first</p>

  <p><b>[The speedy, shifty Hernandez likely fits Schlelotto’s style even better than the hulking Ibrahimovic, and the Argentine coach worked aggressively behind the scenes to land Hernandez]</b> More than anybody, <a href="guillermo-barros-schelotto.html">Guillermo Barros Schelotto</a> was involved in making it happen. In the end, it had to do with Javier’s interest in being a part of this organization because he’s going to be in a team and with a coach who has a lot of trust in him</p>
