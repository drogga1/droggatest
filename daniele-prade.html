  <p><b>[Sergej Milinkovic-Savic was literally about to sign for <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> on July 25, 2015 when the Serbian broke down in tears at the Viola’s headquarters, confessing, ‘I’m sorry but I can’t. I really can’t.’. Viola sporting director Daniele Prade was as annoyed as he was astounded. He refused to try to change the Genk midfielder’s mind]</b> We don’t beg anyone to come here. Sergej asked us to hold off on doing the medical so that he could speak with his girlfriend and then decide. But, for us, that wasn’t on. If he has issues outside of football to resolve, then we’re going to take a step back and say, ‘Enough’</p>

  <p><b>[Fiorentina sporting director Daniele Prade says he would like to sign Franck Ribery]</b> We really like Ribery, but like all great players, they are experiencing a moment of reflection. We would like to have him with us, but he has very important financial offers and we cannot guarantee him tens of millions like the Arab or Russian teams. But if he wanted to continue playing at high levels, Florence and Fiorentina would wait for him with open arms. At this moment the deal is not close, there has been no progress. If he doesn’t come, we will buy another player</p>

  <p><b>[Fiorentina’s sporting director Daniele Prade has claimed that Sporting midfielder <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> is on his way to Real Madrid]</b> Raphinha must be off the market because <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> is off to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> for €70 million.</p>

  <p><b>[Sporting director Daniele Prade has confirmed Suso and Matteo Politano were among a host of players <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> attempted to sign on transfer deadline day]</b> I’m not disappointed by any of our negotiations. We tried until 8pm last night, but the clubs didn’t want to sell, so I’m sure I can’t do more. Sassuolo wouldn’t sell Domenico Berardi, and it was the same with Udinese and Rodrigo De Paul, Inter and Matteo Politano, and Milan and Suso. But we tried. Raphinha is the only one we let go because the costs were too high for us<br /><br /><b>[On De Paul]</b> I have an excellent relationship with <b>[Udinese owner]</b> Giampaolo Pozzo and we didn’t want to force it. I never talked to De Paul, because we never found the agreement with Udinese. Other claims are false<br /><br /><b>[Nainggolan left Inter for former employers <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a> on loan]</b> With <a href="radja-nainggolan.html">Radja Nainggolan</a>, we never got to talk to him. It is right that he went to <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a>. As for <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">Daniele De Rossi</a>, I knew from the beginning that he would never have played in Italy with another team. He made the best choice for his life</p>
