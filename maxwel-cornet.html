  <p><b>[Maxwel Cornet says Lyon are 100 per cent focused on Tuesday night’s Champions League encounter with Barcelona]</b> There is Messi, Suarez, Coutinho. It will be necessary to negotiate it well. We have to be ready for D-Day!<br /><br />Block Messi! I laugh about it but it’s what we will have to do. It will take a lot of defensive work at first, be all the time concentrated and take the few chances we could have going forward. We know that in this kind of match that you cannot waste chances, so it will be up to us to be effective in front of their goal<br /><br />Nabil won’t be here and everyone knows the importance of this player, whether to boost the guys before the match or make differences on the pitch after. But there is not much to say. He will not be here, we will have to do without him and we have the players for that<br /><br />For me, Anthony is one of the best goalkeepers in Europe at the moment. He is important in the locker room because of his experience. He is someone who also transmits his winning mentality and it is important. Houssem <b>[Aouar]</b> is subtlety, finesse and talent. When you play with two midfielders like that <b>[with Tanguy Ndombele]</b>, it’s easy. Tanguy has an exceptional technical quality, he breaks the lines and as an attacker it’s a great thing to play with him. The key can be there, in this area of play, but it will be above all about teamwork. We have the players. Whether it is Memphis <b>[Depay]</b>, Berto <b>[Traore]</b>, Martin <b>[Terrier]</b> or me, we have the players. Afterwards, you have to see what the coach will put in place. We are 100 per cent focused on Tuesday’s game and we will study everything closely</p>
