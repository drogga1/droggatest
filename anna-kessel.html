<blockquote>
  <p><b>[What are the next steps for women’s soccer to grow?]</b> I think when speaking to governing bodies or people in senior positions in the sport, they felt that there has already been so much progress, as if we made it. That’s kind of the attitude. And they forget about what’s going on in the ground – the kind of stories that Nadia shared. That went on when Nadia was small, but it’s still going on now<br /><br />I’ve got two daughters, one is 7 years old, and she goes to school and the boys are still saying ‘you can’t play football’. That is the status quo … and it’s not unique to her school, it’s really normal. Football is the national game in England, and yet not every single girl has had access to the game. That’s just fundamentally wrong<br /><br />I think it’s really disturbing. We’re researching, we’re fighting for equality for women and men and there remains this huge area in sport where it is still culturally acceptable to tell girls they can’t do a sport, and there’s no logical or rational reason why they can’t do it. For any person to come into this world and be told they can’t do something – at 4 years old – because they have a vagina is just crazy. Sport is such an important, powerful arena. It’s where money and politics and power all cross. We’ve seen our politicians use sport … and to deny women access to that is huge<br /><br />Yes, we’ve seen some progress and girls are starting to play football, and that’s great. But you can see the difference already from the boy that started playing at 2 or 3 and was told all along that this was natural and right for him … and the girl that maybe starts at 6 or 7 and is slower and … you’ve got to overcome and confidence issues and barriers and friendship issues and ‘is this the right thing for me to be doing as a girls or not’. How do they ever get to this point?<br /><br />There’s a lot of work to be done … and I think if we start there, then <b>[we’ll continue to see more progress]</b>.</p>
