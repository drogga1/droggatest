  <p><b>[Juventus have completed a €10 million deal to sign Riccardo Orsolini from Ascoli]</b> With strong technique, physicality, positional sense and dribbling ability all in his locker, the left-footed winger Orsolini has emerged as one of the revelations of this Serie B season. Born in Rotella, a village within the province of Ascoli Piceno, the 19-year-old has risen through Ascoli’s youth ranks to become an ever-present in the first team so far in 2016/17. Orsolini exploded onto the scene last season with Ascoli’s Primavera, netting 17 times in 21 league appearances, as well as bagging a further three in the Viareggio Cup and two in the Coppa Italia. Such form saw him instantly promoted to the first team for the second half of the 2015/16 campaign and he has taken his game to another level still this term scoring four goals and providing four assists from his wide forward position.</p>

  <p><b>[Riccardo Orsolini hoped he would grow as a player with the step up in class]</b> I’m a natural winger and I normally play on the right and cut in on my left foot to either shoot or set up a team-mate. I definitely need to improve defensively and that’s something that I’m already working on at Ascoli. I’m always looking to grow and I’m excited to take on whatever the future holds here. I will continue what I’ve started at Ascoli and look to meet the targets we set at the start of the season. And from June onwards, I will begin this new adventure here at Juventus and I hope it will be a successful one.</p>
