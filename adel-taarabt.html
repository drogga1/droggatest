  <p><b>[Adel Taarabt on <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a>]</b> Everyone told me he was amazing. I played with him and I can say he isn’t world class. He is an ordinary player, not a phenomenon. He is someone who has a strong shot, but he doesn’t play for the team. And if he does, he doesn’t score, as is the case right now at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. He’s had so many chances, from City to Milan, and he’s thrown them away</p>

I was listening to an interview where he said I was his idol at QPR. These days it would be <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> or <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>, but when he was a kid he watched me!<br /><br /><b>[The Morocco international admits he has some regrets about how his career has panned out given the potential he feels he had as a young player]</b> I don’t like to say this about myself, but I think if you talked to everyone who saw me when I was a young talent, many would have said I’d play for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> one day. Even <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a> said that to me once. But it didn’t happen. Not only because of others, but because of me.</p>
