  <p><b>[Deco on <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>]</b> <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> definitely deserves a Ballon d’Or. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> gets all the attention in the media because of his great performances, but all the players realise that <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> is absolutely amazing. If I had to compare him to someone, I would say <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>. Andres is phenomenal. The problem is that he has two animals ahead of him in <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. There’s no denying that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is a beast as well</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> had studied the game for a long time before, watching other teams, and the good thing was that everything we did in training happened in the game, which gave players confidence in the coach. When you have been prepared for each situation that could happen, it means you are more prepared than the other team</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> brought something different (to Porto); he brought the ambition, because at that time in Portugal it was difficult for a club to think it could win the Champions League. Of course, <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> had won it in the past but it was a different time. <b>[. . .]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> brought this confidence to us; we had a fantastic team and he gave us that final push to believe it was possible</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> As far as strategy goes <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is the best coach I have worked with. He convinces you that if you do what he tells you to do it will bring results and it does. Working with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> was incredible. I learned so much. It was a long time ago and some people say he has changed a lot, others that he hasn’t changed at all. He turned Madrid into a very effective team. They were different to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> aesthetically but in terms of efficiency they were very effective. For everything that they say about him, he put <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> at the same level as the best ever <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> side</p>

  <p><b>[Deco gave his views ahead of El Clásico]</b> I would sign <a href="luka-modric.html">Luca Modric</a> for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a> because his way of playing fits with the style that exists at the club. He is a footballer who looks like <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a> and <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> due to his way of playing, he has a similar style.

  <p><b>[Deco on <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>]</b> <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> was a natural with special ability. Whenever we gave the ball to him, the moves and goals were from a different world. He was far more gifted than Leo or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. When we did not know what to do, he would create that opportunity for you</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Deco talks about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>’s qualities]</b> What I can say is that, when you have a player like <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, be it any team in the world, you have a little advantage. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is not only a goalscorer, he creates, he defines the way the opponent defends their approach, their training. Coming up against <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, things aren’t going to be easy. They are going to be a lot different for the opposition, because he’s unpredictable in one-on-one duels, and also with his passes. And obviously, the other team ends up very reactive to what he does on the field</p>

<h4 id="2018-05-17-retrieve">2018 05 17 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Deco is not overly surprised to learn of talk of dressing room unrest at Manchester United]</b> What happens in the dressing room is that sometimes he wants to push the players. It’s complicated to manage a big club like Man United. In Portugal there was a lot of pressure because when he arrived we had been two, three years without a title. But I think he is the same. The players changed, the time has changed. Maybe today the reactions from the players are different. If Man United brings him to be a coach they knew he was like that. He puts pressure on the players, the club. He wants to win, that’s that<br /><br />It’s not normal in the Premier League, what Man City did. Man United had a good competition. Many times it’s not so good, but I think Man City did so well it would be difficult to repeat another season like that. Man United needs to stay in the right way, they have good players, maybe two or three new players for the next season. But I think they are doing well</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid were always going to struggle in the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> I do not discuss whether they <b>[Real]</b> are playing well or badly, but did people really think they would be the same without Cristiano? He is the best player in the history of Madrid and it is normal that the team suffers.<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether Barcelona would face similar transitional issues when Messi retires]</b> I do not know, but there is a difference: Cristiano’s was quite sudden, it was not completely natural, it did not end little by little and that’s why the club was not prepared</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Pep Guardiola was fortunate to inherit a Barcelona team made up of pioneers with a winning ethos]</b> I remember that when I arrived at Barca, people were crazy about winning a title, even if it was a Copa del Rey. We managed to reverse that trend, and then the club had the ability to continue winning. If not, today we would talk about the Champions of Paris as they once talked about Wembley ‘92. After us, Barca had the luck, which in reality is not luck but work, to combine three things: a young coach with new ideas, the best player in history and the best generation of Spanish football born precisely at Barca<br /><br />Yes, Barca today is very different from fifteen years ago. Today, Barca is accustomed to winning. The league no longer has the same sense as before. Now, if you win league and cup it is fine, but it’s not perfect. And that is the merit of this generation; Leo’s leadership in recent years and with Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets, Piqué, and company.<br /><br />We started, but they set the bar very high</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Barcelona and Chelsea midfielder Deco fondly recalls his time alongside Ronaldinho at Camp Nou]</b> From the outset, it is clear that Leo and Cristiano are the greatest. Especially because no one thought they could take so many years to this level, but the one that impressed me most despite not being so decisive was Ronnie. For me, he will always be the best<br /><br />We met in Barcelona and immediately connected with him, the moments I lived with him are difficult to compare to anything. It was magical</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona could still win the domestic double again this season]</b> I don’t know the future because <b>[at]</b> Barcelona there’s a lot of pressure. When the competition started, one of my favourites to win was Liverpool because I knew they were strong, stronger than last season. But they had problems in the beginning, the group phase, and then they got better <b>[later]</b> in the competition. Of course, after 3-0 in Camp Nou, no one would have expected that without two of their most important players - <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah and <b>[Roberto]</b> Firmino - that Liverpool could do that. It was difficult for Barcelona because it was a very tough defeat - a loss against Liverpool, 4-0, is not normal.<br /><br />I know in Barcelona there’s a lot of pressure, every year they need to win. I don’t know what’s happened. It’s difficult, not just for Valverde but every coach who would be there in that moment</p>

I had the opportunity to play with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> together at Chelsea<br /><br />I think, because he was a different type of player to all other types of English midfielder, <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> was the best player that I saw playing for an English midfield and one of the best players in the world.<br /><br />There are not so many players with this style because I think most of the players are box-to-box, not about controlling the game, keeping the balance of the team.<br /><br />Maybe it’s the generation, but I think this kind of player always exists.
