  <p><b>[Deco on <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>]</b> <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> definitely deserves a Ballon d’Or. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> gets all the attention in the media because of his great performances, but all the players realise that <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> is absolutely amazing. If I had to compare him to someone, I would say <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>. Andres is phenomenal. The problem is that he has two animals ahead of him in <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. There’s no denying that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is a beast as well</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> had studied the game for a long time before, watching other teams, and the good thing was that everything we did in training happened in the game, which gave players confidence in the coach. When you have been prepared for each situation that could happen, it means you are more prepared than the other team</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> brought something different (to Porto); he brought the ambition, because at that time in Portugal it was difficult for a club to think it could win the Champions League. Of course, Porto had won it in the past but it was a different time. <b>[. . .]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> brought this confidence to us; we had a fantastic team and he gave us that final push to believe it was possible</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>, he’s a winner. It’s difficult for him to accept results that don’t go his way. <b>[. . .]</b> sometimes when we lost a game - which if you can remember wasn’t all that often in our time! - he would find it difficult to accept</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> As far as strategy goes <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> is the best coach I have worked with. He convinces you that if you do what he tells you to do it will bring results and it does. Working with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> was incredible. I learned so much. It was a long time ago and some people say he has changed a lot, others that he hasn’t changed at all. He turned Madrid into a very effective team. They were different to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> aesthetically but in terms of efficiency they were very effective. For everything that they say about him, he put <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> at the same level as the best ever <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> side</p>

  <p><b>[Deco gave his views ahead of El Clásico]</b> I would sign <a href="luka-modric.html">Luca Modric</a> for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a> because his way of playing fits with the style that exists at the club. He is a footballer who looks like <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a> and <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> due to his way of playing, he has a similar style. The forwards <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Christiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href="karim-benzema.html">Karim Benzema</a> and Gareth Bale]&lt;/b&gt; would not have a place at Barça</p>

  <p><b>[Deco on Ronaldinho]</b> <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> was a natural with special ability. Whenever we gave the ball to him, the moves and goals were from a different world. He was far more gifted than Leo or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. When we did not know what to do, he would create that opportunity for you</p>

  <p><b>[Deco talks about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>’s qualities]</b> What I can say is that, when you have a player like <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, be it any team in the world, you have a little advantage. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is not only a goalscorer, he creates, he defines the way the opponent defends their approach, their training. Coming up against <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, things aren’t going to be easy. They are going to be a lot different for the opposition, because he’s unpredictable in one-on-one duels, and also with his passes. And obviously, the other team ends up very reactive to what he does on the field</p>

<a href="alexander-hleb.html">Alexander Hleb</a> says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> sold Ronaldinho and Deco to protect Lionel Messi because the pair would often turn up to training drunk</p>

  <p><b>[Former Portugal international Deco believes <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a> above <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> and <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>]</b> I played with and against so many fantastic players in midfield like <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>. I had the opportunity to play with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> together at Chelsea<br /><br />I think, because he was a different type of player to all other types of English midfielder, <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> was the best player that I saw playing for an English midfield and one of the best players in the world.<br /><br />There are not so many players with this style because I think most of the players are box-to-box, not about controlling the game, keeping the balance of the team.<br /><br />Maybe it’s the generation, but I think this kind of player always exists. England has a lot of fantastic players. What I say is that in midfield, with his style, <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a> could play at any club</p>
