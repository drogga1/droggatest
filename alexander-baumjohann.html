  <p><b>[Franck Ribery has been told to consider a move to Australia if he departs Bayern Munich this summer]</b> Actually, it’s exactly the other way around. If he wants his peace, he should come. In Australia, you can live your life as a footballer in peace. Of course, fans from time to time talk to you on the street, but this is not comparable to Europe or South America. I think even a Franck Ribery could eat his gold steak here in peace<br /><br />Especially in recent years, top stars like <b>[Fernando]</b> Torres or <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta have been associated with Australian clubs again and again, but I do not think the money is enough for such players. They are probably more oriented towards China or Japan, where more is paid. So it would be a huge surprise if Ribery came<br /><br /><b>[Baumjohann could also be treading a path to Asia in the near future]</b> I would definitely like to play in Asia again. Not necessarily in Saudi Arabia, but something like Japan or South Korea, I could definitely imagine very well. There, the level is even higher than here in Australia</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC sign ex-Wanderers playmaker Alexander Baumjohann to make derby statement]</b> I’m very excited and very happy to sign for such a big club like Sydney FC. I came to Australia last year not knowing a lot about Australian football. However, it didn’t take me long to see that Sydney FC is the biggest club in the country by far and in all aspects of the game. Sydney FC’s style of football fits well with my ability and I can see there are a lot of good quality players here as well. I believe we will continue with the same success as the club has had in recent years this season.</p>

  <p><b>[Alexander Baumjohann says Life under Van Gaal was ‘brutally difficult’]</b> I have been a professional since 2004 and have experienced so many ups and downs during this time. Picking out one thing is difficult, but if I had to commit myself, I would have had to be more patient at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. I was young, wanted to play more, but it was brutally difficult for me under <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a>. He didn’t know me at all. He didn’t bring me to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> either, that was <a href="jurgen-klinsmann.html">Jurgen Klinsmann</a>. When I introduced myself as Alex at the first training session, he just asked: ‘Alex, who?’ I then gave him my last name and he looked incredulous. I still don’t know whether it was his psycho games or whether he really didn’t know me, but I already knew that it would be a hot place for me if the trainer didn’t know my name. In preparation, Van Gaal told me that I would have to start in the second team. I actually wanted to leave immediately after the first few weeks. Even though I knew that I wouldn’t be a regular player, I didn’t want to play in the regional league<br /><br /><b>[He also recalled playing for former Fulham boss Magath at Schalke, where again they had a fraught relationship which saw the midfielder demoted to the reserve team]</b> I was banished to the Under-23s by Felix Magath. Then <a href="ralf-rangnick.html">Ralf Rangnick</a> came in and I went up again immediately. In retrospect, it would have been better for my career if I had first Magath as a coach and then <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. Because if you had Magath as a coach, nothing can really shock you anymore. On the other hand, I also learned a lot from him and I’m happy about this experience.<br /><br /><b>[The coach he most admires is <a href="jupp-heynckes.html">Heynckes</a>]</b> I have a special bond with <a href="jupp-heynckes.html">Jupp Heynckes</a>. He was a kind of father figure in football and I still call him coach. I previously discussed 90 percent of the decisions I made with him. He let me train with the professionals when I was 16 and offered me a professional contract after two sessions. That was a little unfortunate because he was fired after three months in my first year as a professional. It was similar in Mönchengladbach when he picked me up in 2007. He was gone a few weeks later. Perhaps I would have worked with him longer in Munich if I had stayed there because he was following Van Gaal.</p>
