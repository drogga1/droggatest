  <p><b>[Actor Matthew McConaughey joins <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> expansion team Austin FC as part owner]</b> Austin FC is more than a quality investment FOR Austin, it’s a quality investment IN Austin. The most diverse and borderless game in the world is now coming to one of the most multicultural, creative and diverse cities in the world. Austin FC is a healthy investment in our city’s culture and future<br /><br /><b>[McConaughey also added he considered this to be part of his legacy to the city]</b> This is about legacy for me. This is an investment in my children and our city’s future and our children’s future. It’s something I want to outlive me and outlive my children</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Precourt says Actor Matthew McConaughey joins <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> expansion team Austin FC as part owner]</b> It is my privilege to welcome my new partners to Austin FC.

  <p><b>[New Austin FC sporting director <a href="claudio-reyna.html">Claudio Reyna</a> jumps at another chance to build a roster from scratch]</b> Hiring someone with Claudio’s gravitas and experience as a player and executive with NYCFC, it’s a big day for our club, and it’s a big hire for us. Claudio obviously had a tremendous career as a player. He understands the Concacaf region with his national team duty, and then obviously he transitioned into a leadership role, and you know, there’s no better place to learn than City Football Group<br /><br />In terms of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> IQ. he just understands our league and the acquisition mechanisms really, really well. He also has a global perspective, playing in Germany and England and Scotland, and he just has a lot of relationships. His network of contacts across Europe in the United States are second-to-none. He’s got a real keen eye for talent</p>
