<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Luis Fabiano conveys his belief that Brazil should focus more on youth development]</b> In the past, our successes were attributed to our great youth talents base. We used to have a strong plan providing facilities and chances for youngsters. Even the kids from the poor families could be selected by a training centre or football school if they showed their talents. If we return to this policy, there will be plenty of youth talents coming up the ranks</p>
