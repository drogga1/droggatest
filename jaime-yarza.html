  <p><b>[FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017 - Kochi slammed on inspection for lack of preparedness]</b> I don’t want to go into specifics but when it comes to the general state, a lot is unfinished. All the areas have concerns. The media box, the fire system, the seats - lot remains to be done. The completion of the work that we requested in our last visit has not been done. There is a lot of concern so we set up a new deadline of 15th May. We really haven’t completed any of the work.<br /><br />As we said from the beginning we really need to close the stores as we cannot allow entry of unauthorized people during the matches. We cannot control the security if people come to these stores. We cannot accept the situation and still we have no solution. We really need to close that especially the stores which have fuel tanks which can lead to a grave security concern</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA Head of Tournaments, Jaime Yarza, was effusive in his praise of the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai after completing an inspection]</b> I said last year I was very happy with the stadium. I haven’t changed my mind. It’s a fantastic stadium. Most of the work that we have asked is completed. The rest is of temporary nature so we have no worries. The new dressing rooms are of a very high quality so we are very happy. The pitch will be prepared now that the cricket season is over. This will be one of the best, if not the best stadium in the country for hosting the World Cup matches<br /><br />Even though this is a boys tournament, I want girls to come out in large numbers, to see what football can do to their lives. We also want families to come to the tournament. And we will be doing everything to make this possible<br /><br /><b>[With the DY Patil set to host a Justin Bieber concert in May, Yarza did not see it as a negative and hailed it as an important test run]</b> One of the things we like to do in World Cup venues is to have test events. We will have 50,000 people there but the planning of laying grass is only after that. So it is a good opportunity. Timing wise it’s a good thing to see how facilities work. If this was one month before the tournament, then that would be a problem</p>

  <p><b>[Guwahati meets with FIFA’s approval]</b> The State Government is wonderful and their eagerness to be a great venue for the first FIFA tournament in the country is worth lauding. We know how passionate the supporters are in this part of the country and hence, we’re very happy to see the developments and preparations here in Guwahati. We want to give the fans all over north-east India, just like at other venues, a great World Cup.<br /><br />There are minor issues to sort out - like the development of a new hotel for teams but I believe we are well on schedule for the tournament</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017 hosts India will play their matches in the country’s capital New Delhi instead of Navi Mumbai]</b> Attendance, especially in the venue where the home team plays its matches, is one of the priorities of the FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017, crucial to achieving the purpose of better positioning football in the country, so the government’s commitment in this regard is highly appreciated.<br /><br />The presence of the Secretary of Sports at the meetings concerning the state of the works in the stadium and training sites sends a positive message and reflects the strong involvement of the authorities. We expect this involvement to extend into the area of pollution prevention, which has been an important topic discussed in relation to the tournament, in particular in Delhi. We are now expecting an action response plan to prevent pollution levels from affecting the tournament, which ideally should continue beyond the tournament</p>
