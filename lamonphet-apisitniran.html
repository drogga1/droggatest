  <p>The government also aims to raise per capita income to US$15,000 (467,384 baht), with average GDP growth of 5-6%. The plan further entails raising competitiveness so that Thailand can break into the global top 20 on that score. <br /><br />Thailand’s per capita income was close to $7,000 a year in 2018, and the country ranked 30th in the IMD World Competitiveness rankings, slipping from 27th in 2017<br /><br />The country’s national strategy comes with 23 master plans. Under those plans, there are 15 urgent flagship projects that must be implemented during 2019-23. The 15 projects are split into several groups: social and economic restructuring in an effort to increase Thai competitiveness; upgrading Thais’ skills; projects that can create a balance between social and economic growth; infrastructure projects that can drive long term economic growth; and projects that can generate income to create sustainable growth.<br /><br />The first five years (2019-23) of development are based on requirements set under the national strategy plan. Gross national income per capita is targeted to increase by an average of 70,000 baht a year to reach 360,000 baht in 2023, up from 290,000 baht in 2019. Growth in agriculture, industry and services/other is targeted at 3.8%, 4.6% and 5.4%, respectively, in the 12th national plan</p>
