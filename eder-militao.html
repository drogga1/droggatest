<blockquote>
  <p>[Real Madrid’s €50 million summer signing Eder Militao was forced to cut short his unveiling at Santiago Bernabeu after a bout of dizziness on Wednesday afternoon] It’s a very special day, I’m very happy. I have reached the highest point that can be reached, the best club in the world. When I heard the news, I was very happy that my work was doing well. When I received the news, I did not think twice. Immediately I said yes. I saw myself playing at the best club in the world. [If] a great team wants you to work for them and be part of the staff… I was very happy.<br /><br />[Militao also thanked the Porto staff for helping him make great strides forward last year] It was a very good season. Since I arrived, the entire staff received me in the best possible way. Everyone believed in me. The message I have for them is to thank them for everything I have learned. I’m very happy. Everything is going very fast. I did not dream but thank God, I managed to get there and I will do everything possible to stay<br /><br />[The versatile defender is ready to fight for a place in Zidane’s starting XI] It’s going to be a very good dispute. I’ve come to do my job, it’s not going to be simple, but I’m going to do my thing, and what the coach says. If you give me the opportunity, I’ll do a good job. I come to do my job. Ownership will be decided by Zidane. Whatever he decides, it will be great. With my feet on the ground, I’m going to do my job</p>
