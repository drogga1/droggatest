  <p><b>[Antonin Panenka on Lionel Messi’s ‘Panenka’ penalty versus <a href="getafe-fc.html">Getafe</a>]</b> I am happy that players attempt the ‘Panenka’ penalty, and that journalists talk about it and fans enjoy it. Players like <a href="francesco-totti.html">Francesco Totti</a> and <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> have also done it, but Messi’s was the most beautiful of all. Not too powerful, down the middle and looping - his technique is impressive and the goal is just further proof of his amazing talent</p>

  <p><b>[Czech legend Antonin Panenka says that he is proud of the penalty-kick technique that still bears his name to this day, adding that he wasn’t nervous at all when attempting the now-historic shot]</b> A few years ago some TV station from South America came to me and showed me about 50 Panenka penalties from players all around the world. And the best executor was from someone from the Paraguayan second league!<br /><br />I am proud of it, of course. It makes me happy to hear that all around the world it is called a Panenka<br /><br /><b>[All these years later, Panenka says that he was never nervous before attempting that famous kick while adding that he never really considered the consequences of what could go wrong]</b> In the final game against Germany I was not nervous at all, I knew that this way is the best chance to score. When it went in I was so happy, not because I scored last, but because we won this amazing trophy as such a small nation. It was the best chance to score. I missed it only once in my life before Belgrade 1976 in a friendly match in Southern Bohemia. I invented it like two years before. I guess I would have to go to work in a factory for the rest of my life if I failed it!<br /><br />I just figured that every keeper always jumps to one side, so it could be good to kick the ball down the middle. After every practice, I competed with our goalkeeper Zdenek Hruska in penalties. He was really good, so I was losing a lot of money, chocolates, etc. Then I started to use my little trick, and suddenly I was winning more often. The bad thing was that I was getting fatter because of all the chocolates I’d won!</p>
