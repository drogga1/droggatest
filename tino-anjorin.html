  <p><b>[Anjorin senior on his son Tino Anjorin]</b> When he was three-and-a-half, he went and joined in a training session with six-year-olds. He was dribbling better and shooting with more power than those older than him. It was like he had been beamed back down to earth as a complete player overnight! After that, he was always the standout player; people knew him before he even knew how to spell his name. He is a goalscoring midfielder in the <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> mould. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> was one of his idols, but so were <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>. He has a high level of technical ability, great finishing quality and a great passing range. We felt that the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> environment was perfect for Tino. It has really stretched him. The training has always been harder than the matches, he’s highly competitive and he just wants to get on the pitch and beat his opponent</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea youngster Tino Anjorin has signed a five-year contract extension]</b> It’s a brilliant feeling. I’ve been at the club since I was six years old so to get to this stage and then be offered another five-year contract on top of that is amazing. I had no hesitation but to take it straight away because to play for the club I always dreamed of playing for is really special for me<br /><br />It’s been a really crucial season for young players here. Frank, <a href="jody-morris.html">Jody Morris</a> and Joe Edwards have taken us on board and really committed themselves to bringing young players through. Hopefully I can try to carry on being a part of that as long as I keep working hard and impressing the coaches<br /><br />You feel like everyone is behind you. When I was about to come on, I remember just hearing this massive roar which was completely unexpected. I thought it would be quiet because nobody knew who I was but I think they knew I was from the Academy so the support was brilliant. It put a smile on my face for the rest of the day! Against <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, I’ll never forget the fans singing my name because it just felt so amazing. I was on the pitch playing and then I just heard them chanting ‘Tino, Tino, Tino’. It was unbelievable to hear that</p>
