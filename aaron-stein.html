<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Predator Drone Reportedly Sighted Circling Raqqa]</b> According to local activists, the drone has been circling over the city for three hours. If the reports are true, this would suggest that the air environment over Raqqa is permissive. Drones are visible on radar and easy to shoot down with air defense systems. The evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery - and possibly signals intelligence (SIGINT) - of Islamic State positions in the group’s most important stronghold. There is little doubt that this mission is intended to give US policymakers more information about IS positions in Raqqa. However, it does not necessarily signal the imminent use of force against IS positions in Syria.</p>

He was expounding on a more personal, deeply held grievance about Turkey’s global role<br /><br />Ankara is not leaving NATO, nor will it turn East. Instead, the current leadership rejects the current rules of the road and wants to change them. That may actually be worse for Washington</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[The United States’ ambiguous stance with Turkey on the Patriot missiles, on the other hand, seems more political than technical]</b> The United States tabled its Patriot offer before Ankara was officially removed from the F-35 consortium, but pulled it once the S-400 was delivered. Now, the agreement is premised on Ankara not using its S-400. The United States is trying to get leverage</p>
