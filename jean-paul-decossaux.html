  <p><b>[Danny Blind has been sacked as Netherlands head coach]</b> We have respect for what Danny did for us and for the team during his tenure. But because the sporting results are unfortunately disappointing, and because qualifying for the World Cup in Russia is now in difficulty, we unfortunately feel forced to relieve him.</p>

  <p><b>[Louis van Gaal could be set for a return to the Netherlands national team as the KNVB is open to working with him as an adviser]</b> For the profile we’re looking for we have a technical director, but we will also look for many other experts. We hope to come to an agreement with a new coach, but it will not be done in a week. Ahead of the games in June seems to be reasonable. That list should include all kinds of names - a foreign coach is an option. Ronald Koeman us undoubtedly capable, but I know he is under contract with a club. Tomorrow, Dutch football may move forward.</p>
