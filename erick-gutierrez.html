  <p>[Mexico midfielder Erick Gutierrez will join his international teammate and friend Hirving Lozano at PSV] I know, man. I’m going to give my best. I know it’s a great club, which is why you’re there and you’re there and are going to help me as well. I’m happy to be there. We’re going to enjoy another adventure together and now we have to take advantage of that.</p>

  <p>[Erick Gutierrez also scored as PSV thumped VVV Venlo, 4-0] I know that the players who are in my position are doing really well. All I can do is keep working hard, and my moment will come.</p>

  <p>[Erick Gutierrez like idea of Tata coaching El Tri] I honestly don’t know a lot about him, but he’s a great manager. It’s not my decision, and whoever comes will come because he’s capable of managing the national team - and we should welcome him and then work to catch his eye.<br /><br />It’s his decision, and if he decides that you have to respect it. Now, we’ve got to take advantage of him being here because he’s a manager who knows a lot</p>

  <p>[Mexico’s finishing still a work in progress in Chile defeat] They had chances. We did as well. I think we have to get better on that, we have to be more precise in what we have because that’s how they are. They’ve got a lot of skilled players. We have to do the same. It’s a friendly, and it hurts us (to lose), but we have to keep working a lot more.</p>

  <p>[PSV and Mexico star Hirving Lozano says he never could have imagined taking part in matches like Wednesday’s Champions League clash with Barcelona] I was playing in the Mexican league and I never expected to face [Messi] in a tournament like the Champions League. Maybe I hoped to face him with the national team, but not in the Champions League. At PSV, a dream come true for us to be able to play against a player that’s the best in the world. Sometimes you try not to see him like that on the field, but suddenly you see him again because he’s a really smart player. They’re moments that mark your career</p>

  <p>[Erick Gutierrez looking to take advantage of Mexico minutes after PSV inactivity] It’s really important. Like you said, I haven’t had the minutes I want in Europe but here the manager has given me an opportunity by selecting me, by giving me minutes today and I’m trying to take advantage of those minutes so I can draw his eye. I haven’t had the continuity I need in Holland. Here he has me up-close. I hope he knows he can count on me, and I’ll do things as well as I can.<br /><br />I think we’re all equal. It really doesn’t matter if you’re in Europe or you’re in Liga MX. That’s good because it generates a healthy competition. It’s demanding of everyone, everyone wants a place in the team. There’s only one national team and we’re all together here and that’s really important to be the best. If you’re on the bench you also have to support<br /><br />Working with Tata Martino is really good, honestly. He really makes you feel confident. He knows a lot, and while the training sessions are joyful they’re also intense. We’ve all got a lot of confidence and he really gives you a lot of different weapons to be able to be good on the field. That’s fundamental<br /><br />I think the interiors, you saw that they get into the attack a lot, they come and go. That’s fundamental in the position. That’s what he says, and we have to do it if we want to be included!</p>

  <p>[<a href="tata-martino.html">Tata Martino</a> won’t be able to call upon midfielder Erick Gutierrez. The 24-year-old left Mexico’s 3-1 win over Canada in the first half clutching at his hamstring] The directors of the national teams informs that after the injury suffered by Erick Gutierrez in the game against Canada, the pertinent studies were done on the player in Denver as well as in Charlotte. The result of those is that Erick Gutierrez has a muscle injury in his right hamstring with an approximate recovery time of two weeks</p>
