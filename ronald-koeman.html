  <p><b>[Ronald Koeman on current dutch national team]</b> They spoke about crisis. People were saying: ‘We need to change the system and we need to learn from Germany and we need to learn from Belgium’. But that’s football. We are people in Holland that are creative, also in football, and the technique of players is the base of our football. It’s about the quality, it’s not about defending, it’s not about Catenaccio - it’s play to win and that style we need to keep<br /><br /><b>[In September last year, the Dutch were beaten 2-1 by France, but <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> and De Ligt had done enough to convince Koeman he had one of the best central defensive partnerships in the world]</b> You always build the house from downstairs. You don’t start with the roof. When you look at Virgil now, this is a big, big personality on the pitch. He is strong, he has a great character and enjoys the responsibility<br /><br /><b>[Ronald Koeman on De Ligt]</b> If you watch him play, you do not see a player who is only 19. You see a player who plays with so much more experience than he actually has<br /><br /><b>[Ronald Koeman reviews his team]</b>The most important was the first match, away against France. We lost 2-1 in the end. But in that game, against the world champions, we got the feeling we can beat them. That we can play on this high level. The atmosphere around the national team has changed. That is down to the players and how we started in the Nations League<br /><br /><b>[Koeman is hoping to find more young stars to improve his senior side]</b> We have a good team, a good balance between young players and more experienced players. We have good defenders, enough good midfielders, the offensive side is a little bit minimum in our choices and we know that - hopefully the boys from the Under-17s come through the system<br /><br />I was 26 when I moved to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and now they move at 19 or even younger. We know in Holland it is difficult to keep them because the level of the competition is not the strongest and to be a better, stronger player you need to make a transfer<br /><br />When I speak to the boys in the national team and they ask ‘what is best for me?’ I tell them it is the best club but you need to play, you need regular game time, you need that to improve<br /><br /><b>[Ronald Koeman on <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>]</b> <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> said to me ‘sometimes you need to play in the middle yourself, because then they can see and learn from you’. He said if you are sometimes involved in sessions yourself you see much more, and you also hear more if they have good communications<br /><br />Everybody will say ‘Look, Holland is back on track’. We are proud because we had a bad time over the last four or five years with the national team. The goal now is to qualify for the Euros, and if you play in the Euros you like to win the Euros</p>

I think you need to win big titles to really become a star. Matthijs had a great season in the Champions League and will choose what is best for his future<br /><br />I spoke to Matthijs a week ago about his future and that’s secret.

We know we made big steps in one year in the campaign of the Nations League. Against Germany, France, England, Portugal - maybe four of the strongest five or six teams in Europe. To make the next step maybe we need more time, more offensive strength is really important. To create more chances, to have what we missed tonight.<br /><br />Portugal, as we expected, were very solid as a team. They are used to playing that way. They have had more time together than us.

We all think about it but, in the end, nobody ever acts on it. Everybody seems to avoid the subject instead of doing something about it.<br /><br /><b>[Koeman says not enough strong action is being taken by national authorities]</b> We are way too soft in the Netherlands. Everybody always says that we live in such a safe country. I don’t think we do</p>

And the nice thing is that it is also countries that we have not played against, other than Italy. But the other two countries are less well known, so that’s nice. We have never played against Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is also interesting. I know the striker they have, <b>[Edin]</b> <a href="edin-dzeko.html">Dzeko</a>, who has been playing at the highest level for a long time. But so much can still happen until we play the matches.

  <p><b>[Koeman: Hopefully I can coach <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> one day but timing hasn’t been right so far]</b> They called me and I said no because of the commitment I have with my national team<br /><br /><b>[He is eager to point out that he has not snubbed advances from the Liga giants for any other reason]</b> I don’t think it was a bad time. What happened is that I have my motives with the Netherlands. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> can always win big things, they have very good players, they have options to sign the best players… If I’d have been out of a job then sure, everyone likes <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>.

Playing against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> away from home <b>[in the Champions League]</b> is tough because they got lots of people behind the ball and it’s difficult to open them up and create chances.

  <p><b>[Koeman says he feels ‘very healthy’ after being hospitalised with heart problems]</b> That was quite a shock, last weekend. For me, but above that for my family and friends. Thankfully the doctors helped me swiftly and amazingly and I’m very grateful for that. You get very humble from an event like this. It was great to see how many people were moved. I’m thankful for all the sweet messages from people I know and from clubs, but also from people I have never met. That strengthened me and I’m very thankful for that. At this moment I feel very healthy. That means I will continue my work with full strength, as soon as the ball starts rolling again. Again: thanks for all the support. We’ll see each other soon</p>

  <p><b>[Ronald Koeman said everyone knows it’s my dream to coach <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> I had a phone call <b>[from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>]</b>, as I’ve explained many times. But I want to keep my word with the national team, I thought we’d have Euro 2020 this summer. I’m happy with how things are with the national team and for me, that’s the most important thing at the moment. None of us know what will happen in the future. In my contract, there is a clause that will let me leave the national team job after the Euros but now’s not the time to be thinking about that. Everyone knows it’s my dream to coach <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. Hopefully I might have the opportunity to do so in the future. But as always, that depends on your performance and successes as a coach - you need a lot of experience to coach a team like Barca<br /><br />It’s really difficult for me to say what I think about <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. Today’s <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> isn’t the same as <b>[Pep]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>, but it’s still a fantastic team. Because of <b>[Frenkie]</b> De Jong, I’ve been watching more of their games. I hope they go on to win <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>. As for the Champions League, they’ll need to improve to be in a chance of winning it<br /><br />I think De Jong is a player who can adapt to a new position in midfield, playing a little further forward. But I still think his best position is just in front of the back four - where <b>[Sergio]</b> <a href="sergio-busquets.html">Busquets</a> plays. That’s his best position- where he plays for the national team and where he played with <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. It’s not a bad thing to adapt to other positions. He’s still only young and you have to give young players time. In no time he will show his quality with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. He’s done that with <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and with the national team. I’m in no doubt that he’s the right player for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. He knows he can do more, but he’s taking it all with calm because he’s happy at Barca</p>
