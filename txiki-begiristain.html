  <p><b>[Man City director of football Txiki Begiristain hints at <a href="claudio-bravo.html">Claudio Bravo</a> plans]</b> We need a little time to confirm what we are seeing. We must remember that he’s been injured for a year and this is not seen in one or two months. After that time, we will make a joint decision, which depends on the two parties, because this is our decision and then his, but I want to make it clear that there is nothing settled. To this day, we are delighted with him. He’s preparing for the future. He could have gone to another club to play every game. Here he is taking all experience, collecting everything he has lived, especially in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and Manchester, to become a great manager</p>
