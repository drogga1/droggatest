<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Anita Asante urges football to think more about LGBT+ inclusion]</b> I think within clubs, <b>[that means]</b> not tolerating it if the player culture environment is one of bullying or belittling or undermining people because of their sexuality, and that’s related to coaches and backroom staff as well<br /><br />Football probably hasn’t done enough in those areas to try and make the environment secure <b>[for LGBT+ players]</b> and open to talking about acceptance, while recognising why they’re all there as athletes - because they’re good enough, they’re committed and they give 100 per cent<br /><br />What are the checks and balances within the culture, within clubs, within governing bodies, to really make sure that individuals are protected, related to this issue? If <b>[players]</b> come to you and say, ‘by the way, I can’t handle the language that often is masked in banter, it is affecting me as an individual’… and it sometimes affects those individuals’ performances as well, so it is a big issue.<br /><br />These are the things that inhibit people from being 100 per cent themselves, off the pitch, and on the pitch sometimes. I think that’s crucial for football to think about too. Because sometimes they might even see their own players within a pre-season doing really well, and then it comes to the matches and something significant has changed in their performance or in their behaviour. It could be related to the journeys that we talk about, when you’re going through your own sexual identity or gender identity questions. People should be free to have these discussions, to support players and understand. Actually, is it just performance and training that maybe is affecting this individual, or is it things outside that are also contributing to that?</p>
