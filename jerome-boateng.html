Messi simply cannot be stopped by yourself. Ronaldo is easier because he is more about athletic prowess. But Ronaldo has changed his game. He now focuses less on dribbling and more on the end product. That is more difficult to defend against because he has incredible timing.</p>

  <p><b>[Jerome Boateng describes the New England Patriots as incredible ahead of Super Bowl LII on Sunday]</b> It’s very interesting. Two very strong teams and I think a lot of fans don’t want the Patriots to win it again! Kind of boring … But you have to give them credit, what they are doing is incredible. You see every year different teams in the playoffs but they are there every year. They are focussed, they are on point.<br /><br /><b>[Boateng admits he could be tempted by a spell as an NFL kicker once his career is at an end]</b> If I am good enough, why not? I think it’s interesting to go in another sport. But I have to see if I am good enough if I can kick the ball far enough!<br /><br /><b>[On Colin Kaepernick in 2016]</b> Of course I follow it. It’s a very interesting thing to watch and for me it’s understandable. It’s a very big thing in the U.S. and I live in Europe it’s not that big here but of course we follow it and I support this<br /><br /><b>[Boateng has previously used his influence and fame to raise awareness for anti-racism and anti-slavery campaigns]</b> I think it’s very important. It’s very sad that we still have this these days so we have to step up and to find solutions</p>

  <p><b>[Jerome Boateng hails ‘brilliant’ Pep Guardiola and ‘beautiful’ Manchester City]</b> He’s brilliant. For me, tactically, he is the best. This season City bought a lot of good players. They have a lot of money. Now you see more that it’s his team. They play very good football. It’s beautiful to watch.<br /><br />Obviously, we want to go as far as we can. As a country, I think Germany can do better - much better - international wise. The last years before were better but now there are tough leagues. The English League, the Spanish, Italian, they have good teams but at the end of the day we have a very strong squad and we will try to win it. Of course it will not be easy.<br /><br />There were different players on the pitch but at home we play always better. In Paris, we didn’t play well. We didn’t follow the game plan too well that Mr Ancelotti gave us. But it’s a new situation now and we are very happy and positive at the moment. You see how comfortable the team is. He has great experience, he’s like a father figure for our team and everybody follows him. You see it in our games we play way better than before</p>

  <p><b>[The Golden State Warriors are again strong favourites for the NBA Championship]</b> For me, they play the best basketball. They move the ball very cleverly. They have a good vibe in the team I think. That’s what you see from the outside. Everybody respects each other, that’s a key point. They are a team and they are very close to each other; the coach makes a good impression. This is only what I can say from outside. When I met the guys, they were all very nice and cool.<br /><br /><b>[Warriors point guard Curry will captain a team in the upcoming All-Star Game against LeBron James’ squad]</b> I think it’s an interesting game for sure. It looks like Team LeBron is a little bit stronger but you never know<br /><br />I’ve been to a lot of games. I’ve been to the playoff Game 7 when Miami won against the Spurs <b>[in 2013]</b>. And I’ve been to Golden State, the Clippers<br /><br />I watch it for fun but I also watch it to see: ‘Oh this is a tactic’. And after the review sometimes you see: ‘That was interesting to see how that works in this sport’. I asked Kevin Durant how is his day looking, how is the training, what they have to do and stuff like this. They play every day nearly so it is different from our job<br /><br /><b>[Boateng is a stablemate of Durant at Jay Z’s sports agency Roc Nation Sports. Does he see a lot of the CEO?]</b> Sometimes, yeah. You know how busy he is. Not every week or every month but I just met him again recently. Of course, he’s an icon and it’s always great to see him and talk to him about whatever it is - music or sport.</p>

  <p><b>[Jerome Boateng has revealed that he has never watched back the 2014 World Cup final, which Germany won against Argentina]</b> I haven’t watched the final. I didn’t watch the World Cup because I want to enjoy it when I’m older and look back. I wanted to set new goals because if you say: ‘Oh I’m world champion’, you don’t grow and you don’t keep your level.<br /><br />Of course it’s the biggest thing that you can reach. For me personally I was super happy of course, it was very emotional but I put it very quick behind me. I didn’t think every day I’m world champion, I’m world champion, not at all</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo has been branded a machine]</b> We can only stop Cristiano Ronaldo as a team. In front of goal, he’s like a machine. You can’t shut him out completely, he always gets his chances in a game because of the lines he runs and his excellent timing. Real base their game around him and it’s important we give him as little room as possible.<br /><br />There is a no more complete striker than Ronaldo. Left foot, right foot, header - he is in perfect control of everything he does. I went through only once against him with Bayern, but twice we have gone out. He also has the best team-mates at Real. Shutting him out is only 50 per cent of it, the other players are simply too good for that at this level</p>

Everyone has to decide for himself whether he want to gain an experience like that again. I’m at a different age now than I was at Manchester City and at the point of thinking about it again. Of course it’s very difficult to move away from Bayern. That would not be a decision against Bayern, I’ve been feeling very well in Munich for years.</p>

The whole team was in charge of our destiny. We’ve not managed to play together at this World Cup. We have to blame ourselves.<br /><br />He’s an artist on the ball, not a fighter in the defence like me, so maybe he comes across badly. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to win or he does it on purpose. It was a difficult situation for him at the end<br /><br />Of course we’ve spoken. Like all of us, Mesut is extremely disappointed and sad that the World Cup came to an end, but I can hardly put myself in his shoes. We’ve all got to process it</p>

You also have to play consistently, you cannot think as a young player after one or two good games ‘Now I have the position permanently’. I’ve have been playing for years in the national team and for Bayern. I was consistent apart from a few phases in my career where it did not go that way.</p>

I am sad about this news because it has always been the greatest thing for me to represent my country. Nevertheless, I respect the new course and understand the decision of the national coach. I was young myself and reliant on older players to make room for me. Personally, I am convinced that I can continue to play at the highest level and will continue to do so in the future. I will always look back with great pleasure on the time spent in the DFB team. I have always been extremely proud to wear the jersey of the national team and I will never forget summer 2014 in particular. Of course, I would have wished for another farewell for us. Good luck of the team for the future!.</p>

He was not in good health. When a son calls his father, of course I will still go, no matter what time!<br /><br />For him I accept any punishment; after all, he is my son. I want to see the father who does not go in such a moment to be with his four-year-old son. If there is a punishment for it, then I respect it.

At the moment I feel good and can imagine that I will stay. My focus is totally on <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> and the current season. I need the trust of the coach and his coaching team. I have it again. Even before the time with <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a>, I trained well and hard, but I was not allowed to play and never had the chance to get into my rhythm. It is difficult for every player. <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a> told me right from the start that he was planning with me and appreciated my qualities. Now I’m really enjoying football again<br /><br />It depends on where the money goes. Generally, I think it is possible. I don’t think people should point their finger at professional footballers. Everyone should be a bit more humble during these times. A photo posted on social media doesn’t necessarily say anything about the player’s life. Just because a footballer spends money does not mean that he donates nothing, or that he is arrogant. For example, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> posts photos from private jets and he donates millions. Other players don’t post things like that, but they live similarly. Everyone has their own lifestyle and can decide for themselves. I think it’s important not to generalise here</p>

  <p><b>[Boateng calls for discrimination to become ‘integral’ part of school curriculums]</b> Everything begins with the education of children. That’s the most important thing. No child in this world is born a racist. It’s up to the parents and what they tell their children. The worst thing that could happen would be for my children to experience such things. It’s vital that we teach them that racism isn’t acceptable and that, should they see someone being abused, they should defend them and speak up. That has to start in school. It has to be an integral part of the curriculum. Only in that way can we make progress<br /><br />The images shock me. Some of the things on social media at the moment are brutal. And unfortunately, the protests are also taking on a difficult form. Nevertheless, the case of George Floyd shows us just how widespread racism against black people is in America, and the role racial profiling plays. I find it extremely upsetting because I’m often in America myself and I like the country and the culture a lot. But it’s nothing new; it’s something which is omnipresent. Racism is found everywhere, but it is extreme in the USA. I read a good quote recently: It’s as if racism is a dark room and, every now and then, someone turns the light on and everything is revealed. When you think how much Afro-Americans have done for the image and culture of the United States, I find it inexplicable. And I’m only thinking of sport, fashion and music. <a href="barack-obama.html">Barack Obama</a> as President was also a defining figure<br /><br />Not every white athlete who doesn’t speak out right now is a racist. Of course not. When I watch videos of demonstrations, I see people of all skin colours. But of course it would be desirable if they used their fame to support this cause. Many do, but I think there’s still a lot of room for improvement</p>
