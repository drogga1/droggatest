Moreover, the police are currently investigating another case of suspected personal injury to the detriment of the same victims<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> It is incomprehensible to us why the court is waiting so long with a decision on the indictment<br /><br /></p>

  <p><b>[Boateng open to Germany return: You never know in football]</b> I think that the national coach expressed very clearly that he wants to go to the European Championship with young players. You have to respect that, that’s his line. But you never know in football: If there’s a chance at some point, I’m not opposed<br /><br />I spoke to the national team coach. I absolutely appreciate him as a person and a coach. We had a lot of success in the national team and I developed as a player under him. That’s why everything is fine<br /><br />Toni is the defender at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, has developed very well and is getting stronger. I think he is a very important player for Jogi who can play this role</p>

  <p><b>[Boateng criticises ‘sad’ fine from <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> after breaking coronavirus lockdown to visit sick son]</b> I know that it was certainly a mistake not to inform the club about my trip, but in the moment I only had my son in mind. He was not in good health. When a son calls his father, of course I will still go, no matter what time!<br /><br />For him I accept any punishment; after all, he is my son. I want to see the father who does not go in such a moment to be with his four-year-old son. If there is a punishment for it, then I respect it. I find it sad<br /><br />In times like these it is important that we all help together. We footballers are often pushed into the role of role models, but role models for me these days are all those who go through their work in the difficult situation and make sure that life goes on as much as possible, like the volunteers at the tables</p>

  <p><b>[Jerome Boateng happy to stay at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> despite months of transfer speculation]</b> Before <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a>, I was already thinking about my future. At the moment I feel good and can imagine that I will stay. My focus is totally on Bayern and the current season. I need the trust of the coach and his coaching team. I have it again. Even before the time with <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a>, I trained well and hard, but I was not allowed to play and never had the chance to get into my rhythm. It is difficult for every player. <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a> told me right from the start that he was planning with me and appreciated my qualities. Now I’m really enjoying football again<br /><br />It depends on where the money goes. Generally, I think it is possible. I don’t think people should point their finger at professional footballers. Everyone should be a bit more humble during these times. A photo posted on social media doesn’t necessarily say anything about the player’s life. Just because a footballer spends money does not mean that he donates nothing, or that he is arrogant. For example, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> posts photos from private jets and he donates millions. Other players don’t post things like that, but they live similarly. Everyone has their own lifestyle and can decide for themselves. I think it’s important not to generalise here</p>

  <p><b>[Boateng calls for discrimination to become ‘integral’ part of school curriculums]</b> Everything begins with the education of children. That’s the most important thing. No child in this world is born a racist. It’s up to the parents and what they tell their children. The worst thing that could happen would be for my children to experience such things. It’s vital that we teach them that racism isn’t acceptable and that, should they see someone being abused, they should defend them and speak up. That has to start in school. It has to be an integral part of the curriculum. Only in that way can we make progress<br /><br />The images shock me. Some of the things on social media at the moment are brutal. And unfortunately, the protests are also taking on a difficult form. Nevertheless, the case of George Floyd shows us just how widespread racism against black people is in America, and the role racial profiling plays. I find it extremely upsetting because I’m often in America myself and I like the country and the culture a lot. But it’s nothing new; it’s something which is omnipresent. Racism is found everywhere, but it is extreme in the USA. I read a good quote recently: It’s as if racism is a dark room and, every now and then, someone turns the light on and everything is revealed. When you think how much Afro-Americans have done for the image and culture of the United States, I find it inexplicable. And I’m only thinking of sport, fashion and music. <a href="barack-obama.html">Barack Obama</a> as President was also a defining figure<br /><br />Not every white athlete who doesn’t speak out right now is a racist. Of course not. When I watch videos of demonstrations, I see people of all skin colours. But of course it would be desirable if they used their fame to support this cause. Many do, but I think there’s still a lot of room for improvement</p>

The fun and good mood are back. Hansi is very special, otherwise he would not be so successful with the team. He gives us a lot of trust, everyone. He wants to improve everyone and he does that. He gives us an incredible amount of self-confidence</p>
