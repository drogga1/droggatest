  <p><b>[Unai Emery is calling on his Arsenal side to summon up the spirit of tennis icon Rafael Nadal as they prepare to go in search of major silverware in the Europa League final]</b> I read his book and I know some things about his history and he is work, work, work. When he is also struggling sometimes in one match, playing for five hours in one game, tennis players have a lot of difficult moments. In the difficult moments you have to be strong in your mind to change the negative situation into a positive. Football is the same, only it’s in 90 minutes and you need your teammates because it is 11 players that are playing and you need one strong mentality, but each single player being together too.<br /><br />I saw him live in one match and I also like to play tennis too. When I am playing tennis, I am thinking in each moment during the match that I need to be very strong in my mind to battle my opposition player. If he’s better than me, with different strategies to play and fight against him too. Tennis is different from football because tennis is an individual game and an individual sport. Football is one team with 11 players and we need to do the combination and we need also where one player is not playing well another is playing well, the relation between them is very important.<br /><br />Tennis for me is a good sport because the mindset is very important. Because you need to be very strong in your mind and for the relationship with football I think it is the same. It’s the idea to transmit for the players, for each single player, to take this mindset to work strongly and to have a big individual mentality. After, if you can play with 11 players with a big mentality, for example like with Rafa Nadal, you can take the best performance and results for this sport.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal boss Unai Emery says stopping Eden Hazard will be vital if his side are to beat Chelsea and win the Europa League on May 29]</b> We know Chelsea well, a team with quality and a high physical level. Hazard is a player of moments, but decisive moments. It is what we have to avoid. Chelsea is capable of winning thanks to him, and that ability I have only seen in Lionel Messi, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, Neymar or <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>. For me, he is in the quintet of the best in the world. City, for example, has won its second Premier League but has done so more as a collective. It is a more complete team, like <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, despite the contribution of Harry Kane and Son.<br /><br /><b>[Emery says he was brought in to help the team compete at the elite level once again]</b> I did not promise titles, I promised to compete. What <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> did in this club was very big. He managed to give a touch of quality to make the game more fluid and colourful, but little by little he lost the competitive gene. That is what was transmitted to me and what I was hired for when I interviewed <a href="raul-sanllehi.html">Raul Sanllehi</a> and the owners. The economic potential of United, City or <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is greater than ours, but by history and structure, Arsenal is among the top 10 clubs in Europe, and we have to place there again</p>

We can use them if we, like a team, can feel strong in our mentality and being competitive and consistent each match</p>

  <p><b>[Emery says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were denied ‘clear penalty’ against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>]</b> We did not deserve to lose and we conceded a lot of corners in the first half and they scored in one action. Above all, we have to improve by not allowing balls like that. When we have our opportunities to attack, we created more chances than them but did not score today. We deserved more from the game but they have conceded the least goals in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and it was going to be difficult if they scored first. We tried in the second half, created three good chances to score. There were two key moments in the match - one was their goal, and the second was a very clear penalty for us for a foul on Sokratis. It was very clear<br /><br /><b>[Bukayo Saka was later cautioned for a perceived dive inside the box under pressure from Enda Stevens, five minutes after Mousset’s winning goal from close range]</b> Saka drives forward but I do not know if it was a penalty. It is a hard action for a yellow card. With VAR, the foul on Sokratis should have been reviewed. It was clear but we have to accept it. We did not deserve to lose and we will think about where we can improve. When we were losing 1-0, we controlled the game and defended well but they had a lot of players in their box so it was difficult to achieve attacks<br /><br /><b>[Arsenal are now winless in four league games away from home since the opening weekend]</b> We have challenges in each match. Tonight we had a big challenge to get the three points. We are playing some young players who are taking experience but the most important thing is to win.

  <p><b>[Unai Emery has accused his critics of having short memories amid the backlash that has come his way since <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s defeat at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> on Monday night]</b> Sometimes we forget the memory and we need to remember. When I arrived here, this team needed to improve being more competitive. This club, historically, was winning 1-0 and being very competitive, but it wasn’t enough. Then it was being competitive with improved creativity. When I arrived, the creativity was good, but being competitive was worse. It was not enough. I think last year I started to improve being competitive, with some very good matches playing with creativity. This year we are in a process, but we need patience because our strategy as a club is with some new players and some young players. We changed 10 players and are continuing being competitive. Creativity, maybe we lost a little, but I know we are going to recover that<br /><br /><b>[It’s the style of play which is the bone of contention with some supporters]</b> There are a lot of supporters with different opinions. Some want more creativity, some want maybe more intensity, more energy. I want both and my way is both. My idea is to be competitive, with creativity. Our creativity sometimes is good, sometimes very good and sometimes worse. We have time and we have very young players, who we are giving confidence, minutes in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to adapt to the rhythm we want. We are in one process. Here, the most important is the club, the strategy of the club, the team, the group. Our job is finding how we can improve and get better in our way, and one is creativity. We are winning at home, but I think we can win and we can also be more clear in our style, improving maybe that creativity<br /><br />We need to win, we need to achieve our targets. And then <b>[it’s about]</b> how we can play better and then how we can show and transmit to our supporters all they want to see in our team. Playing with energy, playing with a good combination, playing with a very big intensity. This is the way. We are in the process. And why we are in the process? Because we changed players and because we are taking young players and giving them chances. We are not saying to them ‘you can train with us but you are on the bench on Sunday’. No no no. They are playing. It is a process that needs patience sometimes.<br /><br />For example, <a href="bukayo-saka.html">Bukayo Saka</a> little by little is getting better. It’s amazing. It is the same with <b>[Joe]</b> <a href="joe-willock.html">Willock</a>, with <a href="reiss-nelson.html">Reiss Nelson</a>, with <a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Matteo Guendouzi</a>.

VAR is very important, above all for the referees because it’s very important to reduce their mistakes. VAR has come in and we’ve decided to have it for this reason.

OK, but we also need to check the important ones. For example, against Bournemouth the penalty on <b>[Nicolas]</b> Pepe. Last week, the penalty on Sokratis. They were very clear and in the match, it’s a penalty. Ok, they didn’t check because the referee didn’t watch it and decided he didn’t want to check it.<br /><br />This evening, maybe this week, they are starting to check more because they are thinking they need to check more actions because a lot of difficult decisions for the referee are coming, and they want to take more time to check that. Also, for me the penalty was perfect because they decided it was a penalty. It’s perfect because it helped the referee in this action. But our goal, the third goal, he is not fouled. That is not a foul. Who is the person who checked that? If the referee watched that action on the TV, I am sure he would not decide that it was a foul.

His response to me was positive<br /><br /><b>[Emery reassured <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Torreira</a> this week that he still has a ‘big future’ at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> - but called for greater consistency from the 23-year-old]</b> He needs to improve. This year he’s not being consistent. My challenge to him is to do better with some tactical issues on the pitch and above all take consistency into the next matches. We need a defensive midfielder <b>[to be]</b> offensive because the build-up for us is very important. To give Lucas that responsibility of building up and creating a lot of combinations with our team, he needs more time to learn or improve in that issue</p>

To take that confidence, we need to play better, control the game better and improve our game plan. We didn’t do that for 90 minutes. In the first half, we equalised but it wasn’t enough. We needed to impose and to show we were better on the pitch in 45 minutes. We didn’t do that. We changed in the second half and we achieved that in 20 or 25 minutes at the start of that second half, but then we were losing.<br /><br />We lost some confidence and we were frustrated on the pitch, but we tried to push. The supporters helped us and we drew at the end but it wasn’t enough. We are frustrated and we understand the supporters as well. We lost an opportunity to connect with our supporters because they helped us. We want, and we know, that here is the key. Here is the key to feel comfortable, to feel strong and take confidence. We didn’t do that.<br /><br />The first half, we were drawing but it wasn’t enough with how we were playing. The second half we started better, we changed. The best 20 minutes in all the season were in the second half, that moment. We created chances, we didn’t score, but I was happy with that moment. That was our moment. I wanted to look at our players in that moment. Then they scored when we were better and we took some risks after that to equalise but we conceded some chances to score the third. We drew at the last moment but it’s not enough. Really, we can be disappointed and the fans also, and me, with the result</p>

  <p><b>[Emery cites lack of ‘equilibrium’ for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> downfall]</b> For me, one of the determining things and something that I will be proud of is that, at home - and this is the difference between <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and the Europe League - in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> the team was not losing. My dismissal came after we lost against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, which was the only game we lost. We were at breaking point and that day it snapped.<br /><br />There was a frustration because we couldn’t get to the point we wanted to. I think we could have turned things around but I also understand that those at the top have to make decisions and take responsibility. The team had to play with energy, needed to be capable of being solid in defence and in attack, aggressive, with the ability to take the game to the opposition and, on that basis, begin to be effective at scoring and winning.<br /><br />As far as the defensive-offensive equilibrium needed to win is concerned, we played a game against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in the Capital One Cup where we drew 5-5 and I, as a coach, thoroughly enjoyed that game. Of course, what you want is to win. A game like this you want to win 5-0, not draw 5-5 or, even worse, get beaten 5-0. But in this game there were many examples of what we were doing; a team more than capable in an offensive situation but defensively feeble.<br /><br />This was the process we had to go through to become more competitive. Last year we occasionally managed to achieve that equilibrium. But we were unable to maintain this defensive strength and this is one of the points. A victory might possibly have arrested the situation but the team had to look for defensive and offensive adjustments in order to arrive as being that unit capable of bringing out our brand of imposing football. We managed to do it last year. This season we didn’t.</p>

  <p><b>[Unai Emery believes he missed out on the chance to become the world’s best coach during his time at <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> because there was no VAR]</b> In Paris, I missed the chance to become the best coach in the world. I won the league, four domestic cups and two Trophees des Champions. But the ultimate goal was the Champions League. The first year, in the round-of-16 against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, were played a really high-level first leg. In the return leg, we were knocked out because VAR didn’t yet exist. We were very clearly knocked out by refereeing decisions. The second year, against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, we bowed to a team who recorded an historic hat-trick and, again, in the first leg, we could find fault with the officiating.

I worked with him to make him accept this, but I didn’t succeed. This characteristic of <a href="thiago-silva.html">Thiago Silva</a>’s game reflected on the whole team, which, under pressure, had a natural tendency to drop deeper<br /><br />I always felt supported by president Nasser.
