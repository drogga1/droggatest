  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain will not take any risks over Angel Di Maria’s fitness in the crucial Champions League clash with Arsenal]</b> He wants to play, and he will if he does not feel any pain. We’ll see after training. If he doesn’t have any pain in his foot, he will be available. We will make a decision with the doctors, but we won’t be taking any risks.<br /><br /><b>[Emery is confident Thomas Meunier will prove an able deputy on the right side of PSG’s defence]</b> The club did as much as possible to get Serge here today with us. All the players wanted him to be here. The decision has been made and I think Meunier, who is the obvious choice to replace him, has already played in big games and is ready to step in.</p>

  <p><b>[Unai Emery says it was of great importance that Paris Saint-Germain moved top of their Champions League group following their 2-2 draw with Arsenal]</b> Getting out of here in first place is important. The team deserved a draw and deserved to be first. Today was a good test to see how we are as a team on the field. I’m happy about it.<br /><br />We did a good job putting pressure on a team that likes to have the ball. We must appreciate the work of <b>[Edinson]</b> Cavani, <b>[Blaise]</b> Matuidi and Lucas <b>[Moura]</b>. The result is just. It would have been nice to score one of our clear chances just after we made it 2-2, but the 2-2 is right result.</p>

The league here is really strong. I prepare all the games and I can tell you that Lyon is one of the very good teams, for example. They have a lot of quality players. <b>[Nabil]</b> Fekir play with France, <b>[Alexandre]</b> Lacazette scores a lot of goals and they can still qualify <b>[for the knockout phase]</b> in the Champions League.<br /><br />Monaco will be in the last 16, they are having a wonderful season. Ligue 1 is an important league and I think people have to see that. In Europe French clubs are showing that the league is good. Marco Verratti had a significant injury and the doctor said that he needs time to recover and to be at 100 per cent. His game at Arsenal was very good with a lot of intensity. Verratti is happy in Paris, he is playing in one of the most important club in the world and he is the future of PSG.</p>

It’s normal, he was one of the best player in the club history. I think we are learning to play without him.<br /><br />Edinson Cavani scores a lot, he plays good matches when he has confidence. The idea of the club is to grow, step by step. I have to work with the team and the club will work on the rest <b>[when it comes to transfers]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Unai Emery feels PSG are slowly making progress]</b> It was an important match to win, for the three points, for the table and because it was a home game. We put in a solid performance against a difficult team that was very compact in defence. Ligue 1 is very competitive, with PSG and other good teams like Lyon, Monaco and Saint-Etienne. This is a strong league. But I am mainly thinking about our own performances and it pays off if we do our job. I am satisfied with the two goals and we got some more chances. We are slowly making progression.</p>

He is very happy and full of confidence at the moment. He is humble enough to keep working in order to continue to make progress. He would like to be more efficient in front of goal and he is working on that. If he manages to beat Ibrahimovic’s record, it is down to his hard work.</p>

But we conceded a first goal just before the break and the second one just after. It’s hard for us. Montpellier were clinical and took advantage of our mistakes. At 2-0, we created a lot of chances to get back into it, but we weren’t clinical enough.<br /><br />We’re now going to think about the game on Tuesday, learn the lessons of this evening, have more motivation, more concentration, not make mistakes and not allow our opponents to get into the game as we did this evening.</p>

We will see if that is best for the last 16, but I think for the confidence it is important to finish first.<br /><br />It is clear that this was a bad game. It hurt the confidence of the team. We must forget that moment and think about the good things that the team did before this defeat. Think positively. Forgetting is important right now. If some players have been bad, it is in the context of a single game. Good things have been done before and I trust them to bounce back. They are two different competitions<br /><br /><b>[On team news]</b> Lavyin Kurzawa played on Saturday and finished in a good state physically. Javier Pastore and Adrien Rabiot are not ready for the match, Marco Verratti is suspended. We will see about Thiago Motta after training.</p>

The president always talks a lot with the staff, with the coach, with the sporting director and the players. He visited the training centre this week. But all the conversations we had were positive.<br /><br />I am the coach and I am the one who is responsible. I am working hard to improve things. But we also have to put things into perspective. We have done well in the group stages of the Champions League. And we have to look at the past when it comes to Ligue 1. Before last season, the club were in a similar situation. Two years ago, PSG were on 34 points at this stage and three years ago on 37 points. Things are not that bad. It is not easy. But Sunday is a good chance to get back on track. Our goal is clear, we want to win Ligue 1.</p>

His parents live here, he went to an academy here. We spoke of feeling, passion, desire - and what could be more beautiful than representing your city and being important. Obviously, I am biased, but that’s the feeling I had when I debuted for Real Sociedad. I don’t know if Real like him, or if Barcelona do or Tottenham or Arsenal do. But if he has to leave Monaco, I say: ‘What is better for him, for France, for PSG, that there be a union between the player and his city.

So, we signed Dani Alves, a very experienced player who has the spirit of a champion.<br /><br />I’ve spoken with him. He’s a quality player who can play in a very good team. But at PSG, some players, when they arrive, must be capable of crossing an additional step to adapt to the play of the team. It’s not the same as at other teams. So, it’s better he finds another team where the play is better suited to him<br /><br />We also want to sign a midfielder. It’s not easy to improve this team.

Afterwards, we will arrange internally for the penalties that are coming in, because I think both are able to score them, and I want the two to alternate in this exercise.

Thanks to the president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the sporting director Antero Henrique, the supporters and all the players for these two seasons.<br /><br />The first six months were hard. Ibrahimovic had just left and I was also trying to adapt. After that, the team improved but the elimination against Barcelona was difficult<br /><br />PSG have a solid project. Neymar wants to evolve and grow with the club<br /><br />When you play with the PSG jersey on your back, it’s important to maintain your desire and your performance level - especially for the fans. Every game is important. Until now, the players have responded well on the field since the elimination against Real Madrid.<br /><br />I’m concentrated on the end of the league and on the final of the Coupe de France. After that, we’ll see what the options are</p>

It’s all a process, and at PSG we have been integrating him into the group, where we want him to feel welcome.

We need two things: quality players, which we have, and then organisation. Together I think we can improve, to win in our way. I repeat: organised, then play.<br /><br />When we are thinking in an attacking moment, I want the goalkeeper thinking for that, he is the first. The same when we are thinking defensively, I want our strikers to be thinking: ‘We need to protect the goalkeepers’. I want those two moments to feel the same for all players. Each player has this quality, this characteristic to help the team as a collective.

When I was coaching in Spain there was the chance to play in the Champions League or the Europa League. The teams that have the possibility to win the Champions League are Real Madrid, Barcelona … by winning the Europa League, Atletico Madrid were able to take the next step and compete to win the Champions League, and indeed they played two finals. At Sevilla we didn’t have the chance to go on and compete to win the Champions League but we could compete to win the Europa League again. It’s about saying, ‘Where can we get to and perform as best we can? There. Let’s go then’.<br /><br />You have to focus exclusively and with great confidence on that possibility. Once you see that you can do it and you’re making progress, the team motivates itself because it’s a title and a European one at that. When you have the ability to compete in the Champions League - I had that in Spain with Valencia and then with Sevilla - but if you’re not a contender to win it or it’s more difficult to take that last step, the Europa League is always a place where you can express yourself and show what you can do.<br /><br />When I joined Arsenal, I joined an Arsenal team competing in the Europa League. That’s not the place the club wants to be, but it’s still an opportunity so we can’t sniff at it. We want to play in the Champions League because this club needs to play in the Champions League, but we need to understand that right now circumstances have meant that that’s more difficult for Arsenal. We want to get back there and that’s the requirement. The whole club and us internally need to be aware of that. That’s what we want, but to get there we need to get back to doing things that perhaps, that for whatever reasons, we weren’t doing in recent years.</p>

Maybe it is positive, maybe it is negative but <b>[it is a]</b> change’. This was the first idea I received and I do in my mind. At other teams I have coached, some criticism of me was that I changed usually very late. Here for example you are saying I change usually quickly.

It’s more noticeable with some players because they have the capacity to do so, and perhaps because they’ve also found new impetus. The players that play the most are the ones that seem to have the most scope for development, but I’m convinced that they all have the ability to develop. In the case of Xhaka, I knew him before. The first thing was to find his best position and characteristics, but he also wants to improve and that’s the first step - that the players want it.</p>

In other matches, when we changed for the second half we took the performance to go to win. Yesterday <b>[against Brighton]</b>, my intention was the same, it is tactically to change one player for another and with our analysis before that in other matches, in the second-half sessions is the reason I do that. But for me, it is only tactically and not <b>[down to the]</b> player, and for me, every player is the same. Sometimes I change Aubameyang, sometimes I change Lacazette and sometimes I change Matteo - it happens to every player and sometimes the result is good and the other times it doesn’t give us the result on the pitch.

The question of whether you win, lose or draw is very important, but there is always a respect towards football beyond just the result.

As a manager, you have to be careful because that friction can break a relationship. But I believe in always looking for more, both individually and collectively, with conversations which are comfortable but also with conversations which are less comfortable.<br /><br />In the end, the main thing with any footballer is that their qualities are used to benefit the team. As a manager, you have to get the maximum out of that player and at the same time make sure that he fits with the rest of the team so that everyone is better.<br /><br />I know when I am the main man at the heart of the group and when I am not. In every club you have to know the role you take and the role the rest of the group gives you. In my opinion is that at PSG the leader is called Neymar. Or more exactly, the leader will be called Neymar because he is in the process of becoming it. Neymar came to PSG to be the leader, to live the necessary process to become No.1 in the world. It is a process which still needs a bit of time to be achieved. At Manchester City, the boss is Pep <b>[Guardiola]</b>. At PSG, the boss has to be Neymar</p>

  <p><b>[Unai Emery believes there is no coach better than his long-time rival, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola]</b> I have analysed a lot of teams and coaches and I think it’s difficult to find one coach who is better than Guardiola. His career is a very big career. We started together. He started with the Barcelona second team, I started with Lorca and Almeria <b>[In Spain’s third and second tiers]</b>. I learned a lot looking at his team - it’s good to look at each other when we are coaches to learn different things between us. I think in his career he’s doing the best in all the coaches in the world.<br /><br />He has had the possibility to take the best players at Barcelona, in Bayern and in City, little by little. He is, every year, improving with great players and also paying a lot for some players. But he led them, at Barcelona, Bayern and City, one step more every place. This, for me, is the quality that makes me say he is the best.<br /><br />I remember three years ago, Liverpool were playing in the final of the Europa League <b>[against his Sevilla side]</b>, they were in the top four in the Premier League, and their progress is very, very good progress and now they are the favourites. Maybe Manchester City is a different example, because they bought a very important lot, with paying a lot and maybe we can’t do that now like that. But we can also do one way similar to Liverpool, similar to Tottenham , doing more with young players, using well players who can improve with us.

  <p><b>[Unai Emery has declared he will not sit back and defend against Pep Guardiola’s side]</b> Usually Manchester City, in every match they impose their style. You want to impose your style, you want to play with your personality, but sometimes you need adaptation - more or less, it depends on the opposition. It is very difficult to break their style and impose yours. When a lot of teams play with a very deep block it’s because they need to play like that and can also have chances to win. But usually you can play 10 matches against Manchester City - maybe Newcastle, maybe Crystal Palace, maybe us as well - you can lose 10 times playing the same, or maybe lose seven, draw two and win one. But this style can work for you like Newcastle and Crystal Palace won against them.<br /><br />The progress from Liverpool is very important progress and now they are the favourites because they have the lead. Maybe Manchester City is a different example because they bought a very important lot with paying a lot and maybe we can’t do that now like that, but our way is we can also do one way similar to Liverpool, similar to Tottenham.

  <p><b>[Arsenal boss Unai Emery says Aaron Ramsey and Mesut Ozil’s versatility has been key to their recent good form]</b> I think we are taking a good performance using a different system and different players. For example, we started the last two matches playing 3-4-1-2. But we finished it playing 3-4-3, with players helping us in the 90th minute with a different system and different positions. I think we need to continue doing that. Maybe we can start with one system, maybe during the match we can change and the best positive is for all the players to be ready to help us, with a good mentality for work like we need each time. At first I used information from last year or the last two years. Mesut can play like a No 10 player, or starting on the right or left, in a different system, and he has a good mentality. And also Aaron Ramsey can play in a system with two or three midfielders, getting more in the opposition box. I used this information with this player and I think this player’s mind is very open to help us, to play in different positions and give us a big performance. He has a very good attitude to do that.<br /><br /><b>[The Gunners boss insists he has never had an issue with Ozil’s attitude]</b> There’s no change. His quality, his performance, his consistency in each training <b>[session]</b> and each match is good for us. He is training, he is playing and he is being consistent, sometimes starting in the first XI, sometimes on the bench</p>

  <p><b>[When asked why Ozil hadn’t been starting away games]</b> It depends on each match. Sometimes it was because we needed something different, sometimes it was because he was injured.

Also sometimes 3-4-1-2. Sometimes he can also play on the right side or the left. For me, the most important thing is for him to be ready, to be available to us, to help or play and he is now in this way.<br /><br />He’s working very well, playing very well, he’s helping us.

  <p><b>[Europa League more important than ever for Emery after top-four failure]</b> I don’t think about ifs. It’s not a condition for me. I am coach who in my past and present is thinking about what to do. I’m positive and working towards our goal and objective. I am very demanding with myself and give my players this mentality that we want to do something important. It’s not thinking about or feeling pressure like a negative.

  <p><b>[Emery &amp; Arsenal fans told what to expect from summer transfer window]</b> We need to continue to look at our wage bill. We’ve got, and it’s well known, a large wage bill - that’s a good thing. That demonstrates the financial power and the financial muscle of Arsenal, which is important for us to be successful. But we need to make sure we are spending that money as efficiently as possible, and we are spending a lot of time focusing on that. Of course we need to be sensible and we need to be efficient in the transfer window. We need to sign excellent players, we need to make sure those players can make a real contribution. And if I look back to the last transfer window, with Bernd Leno, Matteo Guendouzi, Lucas Torreira, Papa Sokratis and others, we think we bring in players that can make a really big impact. And we believe that those players, and many more, can make a bigger impact next season. We need to be sure that when we are selling players we are maximising the funds that we can get when we sell players, because all of those funds just get reinvested back into the team<br /><br />I think we can improve first, by spending money to achieve players. In the past the club have done great work in watching players, finding and signing young players and developing our players in the academy. I have big respect for our work, for our players in the academy. I want to develop the players here - giving them progress to achieve something at a big club like we are. We can also achieve <b>[buy]</b> some players who are in other teams, who can come here and give us this performance - like <b>[Virgil]</b> Van Dijk with Liverpool</p>

When he is also struggling sometimes in one match, playing for five hours in one game, tennis players have a lot of difficult moments. In the difficult moments you have to be strong in your mind to change the negative situation into a positive. Football is the same, only it’s in 90 minutes and you need your teammates because it is 11 players that are playing and you need one strong mentality, but each single player being together too.<br /><br />I saw him live in one match and I also like to play tennis too. When I am playing tennis, I am thinking in each moment during the match that I need to be very strong in my mind to battle my opposition player. If he’s better than me, with different strategies to play and fight against him too. Tennis is different from football because tennis is an individual game and an individual sport. Football is one team with 11 players and we need to do the combination and we need also where one player is not playing well another is playing well, the relation between them is very important.<br /><br />Tennis for me is a good sport because the mindset is very important. Because you need to be very strong in your mind and for the relationship with football I think it is the same. It’s the idea to transmit for the players, for each single player, to take this mindset to work strongly and to have a big individual mentality. After, if you can play with 11 players with a big mentality, for example like with Rafa Nadal, you can take the best performance and results for this sport.</p>

When I arrived here, this team needed to improve being more competitive. This club, historically, was winning 1-0 and being very competitive, but it wasn’t enough. Then it was being competitive with improved creativity. When I arrived, the creativity was good, but being competitive was worse. It was not enough. I think last year I started to improve being competitive, with some very good matches playing with creativity. This year we are in a process, but we need patience because our strategy as a club is with some new players and some young players. We changed 10 players and are continuing being competitive. Creativity, maybe we lost a little, but I know we are going to recover that<br /><br /><b>[It’s the style of play which is the bone of contention with some supporters]</b> There are a lot of supporters with different opinions. Some want more creativity, some want maybe more intensity, more energy. I want both and my way is both. My idea is to be competitive, with creativity. Our creativity sometimes is good, sometimes very good and sometimes worse. We have time and we have very young players, who we are giving confidence, minutes in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to adapt to the rhythm we want. We are in one process. Here, the most important is the club, the strategy of the club, the team, the group. Our job is finding how we can improve and get better in our way, and one is creativity. We are winning at home, but I think we can win and we can also be more clear in our style, improving maybe that creativity<br /><br />We need to win, we need to achieve our targets. And then <b>[it’s about]</b> how we can play better and then how we can show and transmit to our supporters all they want to see in our team. Playing with energy, playing with a good combination, playing with a very big intensity. This is the way. We are in the process. And why we are in the process? Because we changed players and because we are taking young players and giving them chances. We are not saying to them ‘you can train with us but you are on the bench on Sunday’. No no no. They are playing. It is a process that needs patience sometimes.<br /><br />For example, <a href="bukayo-saka.html">Bukayo Saka</a> little by little is getting better. It’s amazing.

Ok, they didn’t check because the referee didn’t watch it and decided he didn’t want to check it.<br /><br />This evening, maybe this week, they are starting to check more because they are thinking they need to check more actions because a lot of difficult decisions for the referee are coming, and they want to take more time to check that. Also, for me the penalty was perfect because they decided it was a penalty. It’s perfect because it helped the referee in this action. But our goal, the third goal, he is not fouled. That is not a foul. Who is the person who checked that? If the referee watched that action on the TV, I am sure he would not decide that it was a foul.

We have had this morning a very good conversation, Mesut and me, and I said to him I haven’t changed my idea about him. He knows what I want from him because it’s the same as last season in the first day of pre-season training when we had a conversation. It’s the same as one month ago and in that way, some circumstances weren’t helping us in every moment to be consistent or available to play.<br /><br />But I will say I think the last weeks he has progressively been training well and adding his spirit to help us.

  <p><b>[Unai Emery has softened his stance on <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a> and could bring the midfielder back into the fold against <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> this weekend]</b> I don’t know if he’s going to play again. If he is available in his mind to continue helping us and continuing defending the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> shirt, I think time gives us that solution. The club knows my idea about that situation and the circumstances.<br /><br /><b>[The pair held talks at London Colney after <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> had reported back from international duty and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s head coach was impressed by the midfielder’s mindset]</b> He told me he is very convinced to help the team. Our first game is Saturday and I am going to decide if it is a good moment <b>[to bring him back]</b> or if we need more time to help him. At the moment it’s important how he feels. Now he is feeling better and he feels he can come back and help us and also come back and connecting with the team and with the supporters<br /><br /><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s head coach is aware that <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a>’s relationship with the fans will not be easily repaired]</b> Maybe, but it depends. If we can show good performance collectively and individually, we are going to do better. In this situation, it is better to do it with him on the pitch. But I am going to do it progressively, I am going to do it also giving him good feeling being with us. It could be at home, it could be away. For me the most important is to achieve the performance collectively<br /><br /><b>[Emery was also keen to highlight <a href="hector-bellerin.html">Hector Bellerin</a> as an example of a player who has managed to get the fans back on his side]</b> Hector told me he struggled here with the supporters sometimes when his performance was not the best. Sometimes playing at the Emirates or away. Also we have had some other players who have had that situation. They have come back and with <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> I want the same. The first question is don’t forget his mistake, but he can come back showing his commitment, his good behaviour and good performances, helping and defending the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team. That is the objective. He is a good guy, a good player and he loves and respects <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> a lot - but knows he made a mistake</p>

The best 20 minutes in all the season were in the second half, that moment. We created chances, we didn’t score, but I was happy with that moment. That was our moment. I wanted to look at our players in that moment. Then they scored when we were better and we took some risks after that to equalise but we conceded some chances to score the third. We drew at the last moment but it’s not enough. Really, we can be disappointed and the fans also, and me, with the result</p>

  <p><b>[Emery cites lack of ‘equilibrium’ for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> downfall]</b> For me, one of the determining things and something that I will be proud of is that, at home - and this is the difference between <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and the Europe League - in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> the team was not losing. My dismissal came after we lost against <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> in the Europa League, which was the only game we lost. We were at breaking point and that day it snapped.<br /><br />There was a frustration because we couldn’t get to the point we wanted to. I think we could have turned things around but I also understand that those at the top have to make decisions and take responsibility. The team had to play with energy, needed to be capable of being solid in defence and in attack, aggressive, with the ability to take the game to the opposition and, on that basis, begin to be effective at scoring and winning.<br /><br />As far as the defensive-offensive equilibrium needed to win is concerned, we played a game against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in the Capital One Cup where we drew 5-5 and I, as a coach, thoroughly enjoyed that game. Of course, what you want is to win. A game like this you want to win 5-0, not draw 5-5 or, even worse, get beaten 5-0. But in this game there were many examples of what we were doing; a team more than capable in an offensive situation but defensively feeble.<br /><br />This was the process we had to go through to become more competitive. Last year we occasionally managed to achieve that equilibrium. But we were unable to maintain this defensive strength and this is one of the points. A victory might possibly have arrested the situation but the team had to look for defensive and offensive adjustments in order to arrive as being that unit capable of bringing out our brand of imposing football. We managed to do it last year. This season we didn’t.</p>

Logically, I am the one who decides who will be the captain, but the players get to tell me who they perceive as captain. What made it difficult was that the four principal captains left and new people had to take on the responsibility. These things need a process of settling and adjusting to wearing the armband that is very important to me and very necessary for this transition to take place</p>

We were now looking to how we could develop together even to the point where they were looking to offer a renewed contract. Then I remember we had one month that the frustrations from bad results were beginning to make us worse for the following matches.<br /><br />We were losing confidence and a bit of stability. The game against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> was a bit of a turning point. In one month, everything got broken. We were incapable of winning a game in seven and the tension based on the question we were asking ‘what’s happening to us?’ was like a rolling ball that was just getting bigger and bigger.<br /><br />The truth is that the coach is the first person to come into the spotlight. I’ve had it at other clubs and managed to conquer it by getting the team back on track, but at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> that month was terrible. We had to win to regain our emotional equilibrium, to get rid of that frustration, and we couldn’t. I spoke to the players three or four weeks before the process began to tell them that things were not going well and that I couldn’t see the team I pictured on the field of play. We looked for solutions. At times defensively we had to be stronger, so we went with three central defenders. We were trying to find a way to tactically synergise <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Auba</a>, <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> and <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a> so that everyone could play the best possible in their position and the results still didn’t come<br /><br />Perhaps the efforts we made in the Europa League left us with too much to do. We were in the top four for the last games and effectively we lost it at home in two games against Brighton, which we drew, and against <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>, where we lost. But it’s true that I was very satisfied with how things went because I believe we learned how to become a team. A team that shone, a team that was effective and competitive - and a team that, in general, looked like one that showed why <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> signed me.<br /><br /><b>[We]</b> played in the final against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> where we had a great first half in a tactical sense, and where, in my opinion, we could have taken control of the game. However, in the second half <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> separated both sides and they won the match. And then, in the league, we swam right up to the shore and died on the beach</p>
