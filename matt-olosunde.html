<blockquote>
  <p>[Matt Olosunde’s budding soccer career has been built around a series of journeys in search of better competition] I just felt like getting to play for Manchester United was an opportunity of a lifetime. If I missed out on it I might not get the chance again so I had to jump at it and make the most of it<br /><br />[Olosunde said of his stint with the first team] That was a pretty amazing experience, an eye-opener really. It’s really good when you get to train with the first team and play with them, you see where you’re at and how you compare with them, and what you need to work on to improve and be better than them<br /><br />[At the age of 13, his family drove him an hour away to Newark, New Jersey, and a tryout with the Red Bulls academy, the best program in the state] I didn’t know what to expect, I wasn’t sure if I was going to make it and didn’t know how good the kids were I would be playing with. Once I got there I knew I could play at that level<br /><br />[Olosunde said of the residency program] It’s a shame that they’re getting rid of it. I really enjoyed it. I think I grew a lot as a player and a person being there. Working with Richie [Williams] was really good, he was really helpful to my development. I think they did a great job with us.<br /><br />Making my [first-team] debut is the goal. I feel like I’ve improved a lot, especially technically, and I just have to keep working hard so I can impress the coaches and earn that chance with the first team. It really motivates me to make it to that level as well. Seeing [Pulisic] do it makes me believe I can get there if I keep working at it.<br /><br />You could always tell that he was a level above. Obviously no one knows how things will turn out but I always thought he would be a big player</p>
