  <p><b>[Ronaldo doesn’t like the comfort zone!]</b> He’s a winner and his mental focus is great. You realise he does not like the comfort zone. He was in Madrid, he won; he was at Man United, he won; he’s at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and has also won things. Wherever he goes, he is going to win - individually and collectively. Of course, there is going to arrive a moment when he is not going to be able to produce the same style of football, but when you’re looking to win - concerning the goalscoring positions - he is one of the best.<br /><br />Nowadays, the effort <b>[for the team]</b> is to try and put him in the right place to score. His qualities now are more a finisher, being in the right place to finish. For me, as a Portuguese, and for all people who love football, we admire him. He’s a great player, a great athlete and a great team-mate in football.<br /><br /><b>[Ronaldo is now 35 but Xavier sees no let-up in his hunger for glory and says helping <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> defend their title will be at the forefront of his season aims]</b> I think that is his main goal. That is his main objective because he’s a winner. I know him from my time as a player when he was a young player who started to be integrated into the national team environment. I believe he is still intact, he is still a very strong-minded, focused person. And he wants to win titles. He wants to win titles individually, he wants to win them collectively<br /><br /><b>[Ronaldo was reported to have fallen out with <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> boss Maurizio Sarri]</b> They’ve been having a few problems recently. A moment arrives for a coach when it becomes hard because you need to manage egos, you need to be able to keep forming the players and putting in the correct identity for your style of play. The players need to accept that to be together. But, I don’t know if the administration will make a decision on that, concerning the coach. But the leadership of the players is very important and they still have the chances and opportunities to win two important titles - <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and the Champions League. Whatever is happening with the coaching position, they have these two main objectives to be focused on</p>

  <p><b>[Fernandes will become a <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> ‘legend’ like <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> and Ronaldo]</b> My view of Bruno is that he is going to be one of the major players for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> over the next years. The way he plays, the way he controls the moments of the game… I think from what I know about the fans, they will love him for many years like they loved many legends from the past like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>, <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a>, <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a>, <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> - all these legendary players. Bruno I think will end up in this gallery of players<br /><br /><a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is compatible with him because <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> is a clever player. He can adapt, he is flexible. I think he is a player who is very easy to manage for the coaches. Man United will be strong. We are not just talking about a great player but a player with a lot of personality. It is not easy to arrive to a different place like England, with a lot of history and a lot of comparisons in his position, and make a complete impact. He had a little profile. He was accepted, he made the difference. I think that Man United are building the team around him.</p>
