  <p><b>[Hayley Ladd: <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>’s Welsh midfielder pushing for a ticket to Tokyo with Team GB]</b> I have loved it. It has pushed me out of my comfort zone and it’s a place where I can learn and feel comfortable enough to be myself. I can’t wish for more really from the players and the staff<br /><br /><b>[It’s been under Neville’s former assistant, <a href="casey-stoney.html">Casey Stoney</a>, that the 26-year-old has thrived and Ladd couldn’t speak much higher of the former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> defender]</b> She gives so much time and respect to each of the players. She really makes you feel like you’re treated so well which is a real privilege. She trusts us as players, wants us to get on the ball and gives us that space to make errors. I think straight away when someone has been a former player you have that immediate respect. I think with that insight, she knows exactly what we’re thinking and feeling after every training session and game. I think that means she’s really in touch with us lot and you really feel like you get that attention to detail. She looks after the details very well.<br /><br />We probably don’t see that a lot as players, but after certain wins when she’s changed tactics slightly, I’ve been kind of blown away really at that change that she’s done. No matter however small, it’s made a difference and it’s meant that we’ve won the game. I’m really enjoying my time working under her. I wouldn’t say <b>[she’s a]</b> perfectionist, but she will look at every little way in which we can win that game. I think if someone is that thorough, I think for us we’re just really lucky to have her<br /><br /><b>[Under <a href="casey-stoney.html">Stoney</a>, Ladd has improved her game to go from a reliable WSL player]</b> I think she has high demands of everyone. While you feel - I don’t want to say comfortable - you feel well-respected, she’s going to push you and she’s going to make sure that you’re the best that you can possibly be. You never rest on your laurels. She’s always pushing you, whether it’s tactically, technically <b>[…]</b> We meet quite a lot as individuals with the staff and they’re always outlining ways in which we can give more to the team and be better individually<br /><br /><b>[For her country, the former Bristol City captain has played regularly as a centre-back too, both in a back three and a back four]</b> Yeah a little bit - I think more <b>[as a]</b> formality at this point. It’s nice that the Welsh girls have been considered and have been treated as equals and stuff. It’s positive meetings so far. Every game we approach <b>[with Man Utd]</b>, I just try to give my all for the team. Through that, if I get my name put forward for whatever and I’m doing well for Wales, then I am happy</p>
