I don’t know what will happen in the coming days. I’ve not been talking to anyone. Now that qualification is over we will wait and see. I’m not looking for anything. It’s a great place to be and they gave me an opportunity to show myself, so I’m very thankful for that<br /><br /><b>[The Dutchman apologised to fans after a tame loss to Malmo, with Celtic having led 2-0 just 10 minutes into the first leg]</b> We knew there was pressure before the game and we told each other to be calm, take your moments and just play our game because we are better than them but we didn’t show it. They got the belief after the first goal, which was a foul in my opinion. After that, we had trouble keeping the ball and simple things went wrong. I’m a winner. I want to win every game I play. But we were poor and there is no excuse</p>

Of course, I wanted to go one step up, but eventually Southampton did not want to let me go, but you’re a professional, so now I’ll give everything to the club. Halfway through the season, maybe we can see what’s possible<br /><br /><b>[In light of the negative backlash he has received, van Dijk told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that those words were taken out of context]</b> I once felt at Celtic that my words were completely twisted. It’s annoying if something is misinterpreted, because people get a wrong picture of you. I came across as a spoilt brat who was only busy looking at options to make a transfer in winter, but I’m not. It was not my words and I would never say that. My focus is entirely on Southampton, I work hard on training and competitions and have respect for the club after what happened last summer</p>

  <p><b>[When asked how Alisson had settled in on Merseyside]</b> Very good. We speak a lot. He’s very vocal and that helps. It helps me and everyone in the back line. I think his presence is very good as well. He has a lot of qualities on the ball that helps get us playing. We’ve worked on it the whole pre-season and we’ll keep practising. There’s still a lot to do.<br /><br />The most important thing is that we look at ourselves. We know that right now we have a great squad. We have a lot of quality players. Everyone who plays for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has a lot of quality. It’s all about being consistent. We want to challenge for any competition. But we must look at ourselves<br /><br />Of course we want to challenge. I do not feel any pressure in that case but we play every game to win, that’s how our mind-set is. Against <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> our focus was good and now we recover before focusing on Crystal Palace, which is going to be a very tough game. It’s just one game. We had a good pre-season with good results and games where we’ve played very well. It was a very good performance, almost complete. Good goals, maybe we should have scored a bit more. Clean sheet, we kept it tight. Something to build on. But we can do a lot better and it’s just the start. I think the key is we need to be very consistent and do it every game</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk has offered a reason as to why no opponent was able to dribble past him at Liverpool last season]</b> I have had the benefit of a lot of one-v-ones by playing a lot on the streets. I played in a lot of five-a-side games when I was younger and I loved to attack in those days as well, so you got a bit of a feeling how attackers might think in certain situations. Obviously that comes with experience in my professional career too, but I think if you want to progress as a defender or an attacker then just keep playing in the streets with your friends.<br /><br /><b>[Van Dijk is well on the way to becoming a Liverpool legend just 18 months into his career at Anfield]</b> The best advice I’ve got is to stay humble, keep working hard and enjoy every bit of the way because before you know it, it is all going to be over and you do not want to have any regrets. That is the most important thing I would tell young players now because that is the most important thing that is staying in my mind<br /><br /><b>[A man who netted six times in 2018-19 said of his game]</b> As a defender you always like to contribute with clean sheets, obviously that is the most important thing. But if you can contribute with a goal that is always a good thing. If you look at me personally, I am pretty tall and I should be dangerous on attacking corners and free-kicks and I am working on it. It is not always easy when you are marked by the strongest header of the opponents but I am trying my best and that is the only thing you can do</p>

We will give everything we’ve got and we have the quality as well. We’ll see where that leads us</p>

You have to just deal with it, but obviously you don’t want to have injuries in a game like this. You want to get fit, you want to get back to your best. Obviously everyone wants to win the game, but the most important thing is to get fit. Hopefully for Yasser it is not that bad<br /><br /><b>[A late Alejandro Pozo goal settled the game, with Divock Origi having earlier cancelled out Nolito’s opener, as Liverpool suffered their second defeat in the space of 48 hours]</b> Obviously it’s very hard.

Sunday’s Community Shield saw something that did not happen in the entirety of last year’s Premier League season.

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk has revealed that Jordan Henderson painted the picture of Liverpool which helped to convince him that a £75 million move to Anfield was his best choice]</b> He painted the picture for me and made it easy to join. That summer when I made the decision until I actually joined the club, I had so many Liverpool fans coming up to me wherever I went - everywhere - telling me how much they wanted me to sign for the club. That gave me a bit of a feeling of how big Liverpool is and how passionate the supporters are. When you look at the Barcelona game <b>[in last season’s Champions League semi-finals]</b>, the scenes from the parade in the city and you watch videos of them celebrating all over the world, it says everything. It’s unbelievable to be involved in something so special.<br /><br />I think the minimum you can do at such a beautiful and big club is to give everything you’ve got and have no regrets when you leave the pitch because you know you did everything in your power to win the game. The fans appreciate that. That’s the mentality we all have in the squad; we will work every yard of the pitch and work for each other: it’s our base. No one can blame us for not trying, for not having ambition because we give everything<br /><br />The progress since I’ve been here has surprised me a little, but at the same time, it hasn’t been surprising because if you look at the team, we have a fantastic squad on and off the pitch. It’s not just the talent we have: everyone gets along, we want to fight for each other, we want to develop together and that’s something that comes down from the manager and how he is with his staff. The senior players here are welcoming, set the tone in terms of how we treat each other and what we should demand from ourselves. We want to improve, we won’t get comfortable. That’s a big credit to the manager and everyone that works at Melwood: they always remind us there’s no time to feel like it’s all good. That we have to strive to be better than the last game, even if it was an incredible performance. There are always things we can still learn to perfect</p>

The price comes with pressure but it doesn’t change too much because you always have pressure at big clubs like Man United. But I wish him well<br /><br /><b>[Van Dijk has even offered Maguire some advice on dealing with the added scrutiny he will now face]</b> It is not easy to completely shut off all the pressure. Personally, I like to put things in perspective. Quite a lot of things are more important than playing football and what we do, we are blessed. We can do what we love to do and also to play for Liverpool - they are such a big club. You need to enjoy it but the pressure will always be there. Just focus on doing what you love to do and play your best game. Get your qualities out of the pitch, enjoy your game and don’t think about the other things</p>

I can’t tell you how great it is to hear my name being sung in the stadium. I have a good relationship with the fans and I see their comments on social media from time to time. For a club like Liverpool, you need to give your blood, sweat and tears on the pitch and if you do that then I think you will be adored because you’ve done everything possible to win the game</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk says Liverpool’s battling shootout win over Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup was incredibly important for the Reds]</b> It’s incredibly important. I do think it’s really important - for the progress of the team, for our development. Winning a trophy is important for your mentality. We did it the hard way<br /><br />I think before I joined, in my decision I set my goals, and these things were part of my goals - winning trophies was part of my decision. You take every opportunity you have to win a trophy. That is always the goal, and winning makes it a little bit easier the next time. We would have liked to have done it easier, we wanted to do it like we did better in the second half, but the winning is the important thing at the end. It is good to have that mentality</p>

It’s not easy, you need to look after yourself and with the life we live, it’s very important to leave a lot of things. For example, we play four games in the next 11 days, you’re travelling and staying in hotels and you need to watch what you eat, drink and make sure you recover well.<br /><br />I’m not complaining, not at all, but you need to look after yourself because at the end of the day, the people are coming to the stadium to watch you play and it doesn’t matter if you had a cold the day before, they want you to turn up on matchday.

It is not a nice feeling if you go into the international break having dropped points - especially at home - so we were very good and we had to be if we were going to get the three points.<br /><br />We all know and we all feel there are so many games left that so many things can happen between now and May. We are very happy with the position we are in, but we cannot take it for granted. We just have to keep going and take it game-by-game.

  <p><b>[Van Dijk explains why last season’s pain will help <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title bid]</b> We took a lot of experience last year. Good things, but also some things we should have done better. Hopefully we can only make sure we react better and do better. You need to have that bit of luck as well throughout the whole season so at the moment we are very happy in the situation. We drew one game and won the others and hopefully we can keep it going. Obviously, we are in a very good situation. That is something we can’t deny. But we all feel and we know the season is too long to proper celebrate that we are nine points ahead <b>[of City]</b> or something and we won’t. The mentality we have is we just have to carry on and keep doing better than we did. That is the mentality we should take into every game ahead of us.<br /><br />We did everything possible. We shouldn’t have any regrets from last year. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> were just outstanding. We kept pushing them and they kept pushing us and you have to respect that, and I certainly do. This year is a new chance for more teams, for both of us and the only focus is the game ahead of us. We have so many difficult periods of games with so many competitions, travelling and hopefully no injuries, no illness, so anything can happen<br /><br /><b>[Van Dijk also refused to rule out <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, both of whom have been in impressive form of late]</b> They have been doing very well and, even if you look at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, they are a very difficult team to beat. So I know, everyone here as well knows, how difficult this year will be. But we shouldn’t look too much at other teams, we should look at the teams we face and today it was the champions and we did the job. Hopefully we can keep that focus for the next games.</p>

Every game that we played, everyone expected us to win. And the way we played, most of the time we had 60 per cent ball possession, and we were just attacking all the time. That was something I’d never experienced in my previous career <br /><br /><b>[By 2015, it was time to move to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> - though again, the traditional ‘big boys’ were conspicuous by their absence.

My <b>[gut]</b> feeling is always the most important thing, and the feeling I got from <b>[Liverpool]</b> was very good from the first second I heard they were interested. The other clubs that were interested as well, I was definitely happy and flattered as well, but <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were the strongest in multiple factors, whether it was the coach, the players, the whole system we play, the fans, the culture of the club, the whole feeling that everyone has here, and the way we plan towards the future as well.

I knew it was done, and I was lying flat down on the ground. The actual moment of the final whistle is just, you know, tears in my eyes from so much joy. It’s all the hard work we all put in. There are a lot of players in the team that didn’t have the easy road. Some players have to work for what they are, for example <a href="andy-robertson.html">Robbo</a> <b>[Andy Robertson]</b>. Where he came from and where he is right now is amazing to see.

That feeling is the worst feeling you can have. I thought about it before the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> game that we have to do it, we have to get the trophy no matter what. To actually win it, it’s something you will never forget. Not a lot of players in their career win the Champions League, but we actually did it. I think we will always be remembered in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> history for that<br /><br />Proud, yeah! That’s the only thing I can say. I’m just very proud that with the qualities we have we can make so many people happy, maybe sometimes angry as well! It’s something I just enjoy. As players, the only thing we can do is give everything on the pitch, and that’s what the fans do for us as well<br /><br /><b>[What about <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>?]</b> I definitely have a special connection with him. And I will always be grateful for him making sure I was going to come here. He’s just a fantastic, complete manager with a clear plan. He has fantastic player-management skills. He does it just on instinct, and he always says the right things. It just clicks at the moment, the whole philosophy of the club, with the staff, with him, with the players, it’s all one. I think that’s very important at a football club, and hopefully we can achieve more things all together</p>

We’re feeling good and hopefully we can continue. Now is an opportunity to recover and be ready for <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>. It will be tough again and hopefully we will be at our best.

The whole experience from last year, doing well in the league, only losing one time, winning the Champions League, the whole experience has been helping us so far in our journey this season. We came very close, unfortunately, City were just a little bit better but that spurred us on to try even harder this year and so we have been winning games, grinding games out and playing good football at times. We enjoy the hard work too so that is very good. Hopefully, we can just keep going doing that and just be hungry for that as well.

We have a fantastic team, we don’t lack anything, we have all the tools necessary to go on winning: a coach that we identify with, a versatile squad, a style of play that breeds victories, a stadium and supporters that play their part. Yes, I would like to be one of those players that return to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> after retiring. I see club legends at games and I feel part of a really big family</p>

  <p><b>[Van Dijk billed as best defender in the world as <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> legend <a href="franco-baresi.html">Baresi</a> salutes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s ‘leader’]</b> Football has changed so much in the last 15 to 20 years, not just on the pitch but in how it’s seen, access to information and the role of social media and all that. I think the way in which defenders are seen has also changed over the years. Real football fans know how important defenders are and they appreciate them. If I had to name names, then the one who really stands out is Virgil van Dijk, who’s shown the quality, character and strength that a defender needs to have to be a successful leader of a team like Liverpool<br /><br />I’ve played with and against so many great players that it’s hard for me to choose. But given everything I’ve learned about football in my life, I’m going to choose two players from every generation who have really made their mark on the history of the game. <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> and <a href="eusebio.html">Eusebio</a> - who I remember watching on TV when I was young - <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Johan Cruyff</a> and <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Franz Beckenbauer</a>, then <a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a> and <a href="michel-platini.html">Michel Platini</a>, <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="marco-van-basten.html">Marco van Basten</a>, and finally <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. That ought to do it!</p>

  <p><b>[Van Dijk sounds ominous warning to rivals as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> star claims he can get even better]</b> There is always room for improvement; I know it and I just try to keep looking for it and keep working on it. With the help of all my team-mates and obviously the manager, and also the manager of the national team - <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Ronald Koeman</a> - that will definitely help me get better even now. So, I just keep doing that<br /><br />To be absolutely honest, in the first six months that I joined we had more training sessions. It was intense, there were a lot of different things that were going to be asked of me. And I enjoyed it, I enjoyed it a lot - the hard work, the discussions that I had with certain players about the way <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, the way we, play. The manager demands a lot from me and it all helped me become the player I am today. It’s a lot of tactical work, a lot of thinking. Obviously as a defender we try to keep a high line, try to put the opponent under pressure at all times. You leave a lot of space sometimes behind you so you had to deal with that as well. But it’s something I definitely enjoy and I knew before I joined the club this is something I had to work on in the beginning but it would definitely be something that I enjoy. And so far, so good</p>

  <p><b>[Coronavirus stoppage forces Van Dijk to reflect on future retirement]</b> It’s difficult to not be out there, to show our talents, to work hard, just the small things in the game. Also playing for so many fans, winning, the whole build-up to games, training sessions, just seeing the boys. We spend so much time together and all of a sudden now you’re not together for like two months, almost. It’s different, it’s crazy, and it’s something that you really haven’t felt before, and it makes you appreciate things a little bit more. It’s going to be strange, and obviously I don’t want to think about retirement or anything like that, but it’s going to be strange. It makes you think how difficult it’s going to be for players to make the decision to retire, because what are you going to do after? There’s going to be a period of uncertainty where you have no idea what to do, and that feeling is what we have sometimes at the moment as well, because we have no idea what might happen<br /><br />Obviously we try to keep in touch daily through our group chat. But obviously it’s strange, it’s a strange situation for all of us, for everyone in the world - in any profession that everyone is doing. We have to adapt, we have to do things differently. But the most important thing is definitely everyone’s health. I can only speak for my own private circle, if that’s alright then obviously that’s the most important thing. On the fitness part, I just try to stay as fit as possible, do all the sessions we’re planning to do with the team. And make sure I’m ready for when the league restarts. Then we’ll see what might happen</p>

  <p><b>[Van Dijk reveals he was nearly axed by his first academy]</b> I played in the academy of Willem II for 10 years. There was a period at Willem II when I was around 16 that I was on the verge of not going through to the next year of the academy. I was not good enough at all, I was on the bench a lot. In the summer I had a growth spurt and after that everything went really well. I had an injury in my groin because I was growing so much, but after that I made big steps<br /><br />It’s been a good road so far that I have taken to where I am today, everything happens for a reason. I have come from hard work and a lot of dedication and that is something I am very proud of. It’s something that should inspire a lot of young players that are out there that don’t have the attributes of those who have been playing at the highest level since they were 16. There is another way to winning the Champions League. I am very proud of my journey so far and it has not finished yet.</p>

  <p><b>[Van Dijk had ‘instant feeling’ about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and describes Reds transfer as ‘surreal’]</b> It was surreal for me to have to make a decision where to go to at the time. The instant feeling was there with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and they ticked most of my boxes. When I went to Celtic I didn’t realise how big they were at the time, but I had a feeling before I joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> how big <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> really were. You see all their games, I’d played there two times before I joined them, and over the course of time before I signed, I met so many people, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans, that would say, ‘I hope you sign for us’. It was special, and when things got finalised and you start playing, my debut against <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> was something I will never forget. How things went in the end; starting in the winter, reaching the Champions League final, the disappointment of losing it but then winning it the year after, coming very close to winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and obviously now we are in a very fortunate position to hopefully get it over the line when things start moving again. We are making big progress as a team and I have definitely made big progress myself<br /><br />Winning the Champions League was surreal. I slept only one hour after, then we went straight back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> after that and then we went on the parade. I couldn’t keep my eyes open; I was so tired, but it was an unbelievable night, something I will never forget. It was just incredible, from start to finish, it’s something we all want to experience again, whether it’s in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or next season in the Champions League. We will try and go again. Hopefully we can experience something similar in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Before making the move from St Marys to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, Van Dijk was subject to signifcant transfer interest from City]</b> Before I made the decision to choose <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I looked at all the aspects of the clubs; the way of playing, the team-mates, the future as well. The city, the fans everything has got to be a big part of joining a club. I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at that time when I made the decision was the right decision and obviously to reach the Champions League final in my first six months was obviously a big bonus and helped me a lot in my development</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk believes winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> could take some <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players to the next level]</b> We have not won the title yet. We have not won anything yet. But the aim is to start next season in the same fashion. We can be a team that can keep progressing. We have players who can progress and make big steps in their development. Winning the league would be a big experience that could take them to the next level. We can achieve that first and foremost this season and then we will see what can happen next season. If we win the title this season, we will try to retain it. That’s what we are aiming for but everyone knows how difficult it is to retain the title, especially in England and we are not there this season yet. We tried to retain our Champions League title and it wasn’t possible. It’s very difficult. We will try to focus on the nine games we have left but we hope to set the pace for the rest of next season with the title behind our name and defend the title as well<br /><br />I know how long our fans have been waiting for this. But unfortunately it’s something we all have to deal with that they won’t be able to be there if it happens. We’ve seen clubs winning cups already in other countries and everybody is getting on with it. For me, winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and lifting that trophy would be a dream come true. We were very close last year and we are very close this year, much closer than we were last year. We have nine games to go and we will try to win all of them. That’s our goal.<br /><br />The most important thing in life is health and we all had to deal with the suspension of the season and everyone had the feeling there would be a time when we finished the season.<br /><br />It was strange to stop so abruptly and being in the unknown. Not knowing when we will start again. Sometimes people were putting things in the media saying the league should be cancelled. You read these things because you have plenty of time to read when there is suddenly no football being played.<br /><br />I wasn’t worried but being left in the dark, not knowing what was going to happen, personally I hate that. You ask questions to certain people who know what is happening behind the scenes and it was pretty clear there was no option at all to cancel the league. So you try to make sure you stay fit, do all the right things and make sure you are even more ready than before when the league resumes</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk has declared that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> took their season to another level after claiming a long-awaited <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title]</b> It’s unbelievable, what a season. We’ve been incredible. To be part of this group of players and part of this journey is incredible and I am very proud to be able to call myself a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> winner. Of course, I watched the <b>[Man City/Chelsea]</b> game. I don’t watch too many games but the game felt like it was taking ages and never ended. When the free-kick went in from Kevin <b>[De Bruyne]</b> - what an incredible goal by the way - I was getting nervous, and I haven’t been nervous in a while. But after that it was just celebration time and we are all proud of each other. I can’t really describe the feeling to be honest. In the league this year we have taken it to another level. We have been so consistent and played so well</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Van Dijk refused to accept <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s title triumph as an excuse for their defeat at Arsenal]</b> We gave them goals as a present. We dominated and put pressure on them but gave them two goals and obviously then it’s difficult to come back. If you give goals away like we did today, including myself, you get what you deserve. The goals shouldn’t happen, but until then nothing was wrong. We pressed them and scored a fantastic goal. A moment of concentration <b>[cost us]</b> and that was unfortunately something we had to deal with twice. It’s so easy to blame us having won the title. I had a feeling we could win here comfortably, but if you give them goals you see what happens. I made a mistake, I take the blame for it, I take it as a man, and we move on.</p>
