They got the belief after the first goal, which was a foul in my opinion. After that, we had trouble keeping the ball and simple things went wrong. I’m a winner. I want to win every game I play. But we were poor and there is no excuse</p>

  <p><b>[Southampton centre-back Virgil van Dijk has confirmed he has handed in a transfer request]</b> It is with regret that I can confirm that I have today handed in a transfer request to leave Southampton Football Club. Unfortunately I feel I have no alternative after I was given notice of the club’s intention to impose a disciplinary sanction against me of a fine equivalent to two week’s wages. I will be appealing what I feel to be an unjustified sanction and their inability to follow the correct disciplinary protocol in due course.<br /><br />Over the past six months I have held numerous discussions with representatives of the board, the former manager Claude Puel as well as the new manager Mauricio Pellegrino to inform them all of my desire to leave the club in search of a new challenge.<br /><br />I am incredibly ambitious and want to achieve as much as I possibly can to fulfil my potential in what is a very short career as a professional footballer. I want to play European football again and challenge for major honours and as such I would like Southampton to consider the interest in me from top clubs should it still exist.<br /><br />I have been left frustrated by the club’s position that I am not for sale and am disappointed that enquiries from multiple top clubs have been consistently rebuffed.<br /><br />The period of time that I have just spent injured and unable to play has put a number of things into perspective and made me realise just how important it is to take major opportunities should they arise.<br /><br />I have consistently relayed my feelings to senior management at Southampton in what I believed to be private and personal conversations. Disappointingly, these conversations have regularly found their way into the media.<br /><br />I would also like to make clear that I have never once refused to train. I can confirm that I was asked about my frame of mind and for all of the reasons mentioned above I was open and honest in saying that I did not feel I was in a settled mindset given the circumstances.<br /><br />Following this conversation the manager explained that he only wanted players who he felt were 100% committed to Southampton and told me I would therefore have to train away from the first team.<br /><br />As a proud professional I am insulted by the suggestion that it was me who refused to train and so feel it is important to point out the true version of events.<br /><br />I had very much hoped to retain the good relationship I’ve always enjoyed with everyone at the club, especially the fans, but unfortunately in light of everything that’s happened this has now been seriously affected.<br /><br />I would like to make clear that I have nothing but gratitude to everyone at Southampton for giving me the opportunity to play in the Premier League.<br /><br />However, the time for me to move on is now and I hope to be able to work with the club to find the best resolution to suit all parties</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk has hit out at Harry Kane and Erik Lamela for diving after Tottenham snatched a draw at the death against Liverpool]</b> I think it is a dive. You see him <b>[Kane]</b> diving clearly and no-one is talking about that. But I think it is a dive. There is a lot of discussion about whether it is offside, yes or no, but I think it was offside as well. I thought it was a dive. You could just see him making that dive. That is my opinion and the referee thought it was no offside and no dive and he gave a pen. There were loads of things going on. I think the first goal was offside and then <b>[for the second one]</b> it is a decision the ref already made and the ref is closer than the linesman. Unlucky I think. I thought it was a bit harsh. I see him coming in the end and I try and hold my leg in, he just pulled his body in front of the ball and he goes down. The ref said play on and I was very disappointed that the linesman said otherwise. First of all it was offside and secondly he just put his body in front of me. I don’t think that is a penalty and the same with the first one. That is also clearly not a penalty.<br /><br />It was a very intense game. There were a lot of kicks not given and then the softest kick earns a penalty. I heard Lamela was offside as well and runs into Van Dijk. He was already on the way down. The referee was saying play on and the linesman decided otherwise. For the first penalty, Kane was offside. My defence put him offside, it was good defending. I am angry but obviously I cannot change it now. What is my job now? To create headlines? If I say what I think I would get the biggest fine in world football! In the 93rd minute you whistle a penalty when you are 100 per cent sure. If it is clear that the opposite side wants to go down, then cool down. We have to accept it. We cannot change it. The linesman was sure. I cannot blame Jon Moss. If someone tells you they are sure you believe them</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk is ignoring those quick to criticise him after a £75 million move to Liverpool]</b> I can’t do anything about that. Obviously, there are so many eyes on me but I am just keeping my head down and playing. Everybody can say what they want but I am working hard every day and I am getting back to where I need to be with the help of everyone here. I am just doing my thing. I have been out for eight months - last January until September really - and I didn’t play at Premier League level. It is not easy to come back, especially when I have made such a big step as now with all the eyes on me and they look at every small detail. Other people will talk and have their opinions. There is nothing I can do about that. You are always going to be judged but it is not like it is something really strange at the moment. I know because I made such a big step right now, for a lot of money, everything is going to be analysed. No-one is going to look at the good things that you do. Everybody is going to watch the bad things and that is how it is. But I will discuss it with the people who want to make me better, who can make me better, that is the manager and the players around me. If they think it is right that is good then that is the way forward<br /><br />That is pretty clear - the football we play, the pressing, the different options with players it is totally different. You need time to get used to everything but I am working on it every day together with the team. I am talking with the manager and everyone who can help me out. I want to improve and get the maximum out of myself and that is what I am going to do</p>

I made the decision, I have enjoyed every bit of it and I am very grateful for everything that Southampton did for me. I have moved on, they have moved on<br /><br />It is a strength of mine to not really bother too much when people have their opinions, especially negative opinions</p>

I needed to step up my game, especially in the beginning.<br /><br />People don’t know what really happened. I kept my head down and kept playing. I was out for eight months and was just happy to play again. I just switched on again after the transfer window in the summer. I didn’t think about anything until I got a phone call from the Southampton board<br /><br />I came here to achieve everything possible. I made the choice to come here base on everything. I love the fans, the atmosphere in the stadium and at away games. The quality we have in our team is unbelievable. I am proud and happy to be here. Klopp is very good and an amazing guy as well. A lot of the attributes he has makes us achieve good things in the future</p>

I don’t know. Obviously you come here with expectations and you want to play as soon as possible and as much as possible this season and be as fit as possible and quick as possible. Now, I’m getting better and better and the understanding with all of the players is getting much better. I’m just playing my game and trying to help my team<br /><br />What per cent am I now? That’s difficult. But I’m completely over the ankle problems, definitely. That was already the case when I started playing again at Southampton. It’s more than that, it’s also just condition-wise and the way Liverpool play you need to be spot on. That’s pretty clear right now<br /><br />Everybody knows that anyone we get is going to be very hard. Man City is a very good team, very hard to play against and we need to be 100% or even better to beat them over two games. We can prepare for that when the time comes</p>

There are ways to stop him but I’m not going to tell you because I don’t want our opponents to think about it.<br /><br />I think everyone in the dressing room are just normal guys. Nobody feels better than each other, everybody is working hard for each other to get the win. That’s a very good thing to have in a team. Everyone knows our team spirit and without all of us Mo wouldn’t have scored his goals. Everyone needs to be giving 100 per cent and I think we do that</p>

A draw is not good enough but there is no reason to panic. There is no need to stress.<br /><br />I don’t worry at all. They <b>[West Brom]</b> are fighting for their lives so in the end they are very direct, balls into the channel, work hard, trying to get fouls and free-kicks and we didn’t cope with that how we should have. To concede two goals from set-pieces as well, where we have always the same roles to do and we didn’t do that. So, it is disappointing, but I am not worried at all<br /><br /><b>[When asked about the potential danger of Roma’s set-plays]</b> They have set-pieces as well. They don’t play only set-pieces. Their boys play sometimes on the ground and then you can play football<br /><br />I have not played against Dzeko before but everyone knows the result against Barcelona. They are a very good team and we have to be ready. I don’t fear anyone. We play a different style to Roma. It will be a different game to this one.

There will be a day when we have downs as well, but then it is how we react - and I am not worried about anything.<br /><br />Everyone is excited, everyone is feeling good, everyone wanted to be part of this. We know the season is very long, we have four competitions to play in, but you know - we want to win everything, that is basically our mindset. Otherwise, you’d better stop.

We don’t need to take anything for granted, we have to keep working hard and stay humble. We were not in the <b>[Champions League]</b> final last year for no reason, I think we should already get that respect for what we did. But obviously this season is new, everyone starts over, every game. It started here <b>[against PSG]</b>, but then the weekend again with Southampton, the <b>[Carabao]</b> cup against Chelsea, we need to keep going, keep improving, but also enjoy it - you know it’s the highest stage and you want to play these games as a player. We can’t get ahead of ourselves, we have to stay both feet on the ground and keep working hard and be humble because look, Saturday a very tough game at Southampton, then midweek Chelsea, then Chelsea again, then Man City, then I have Germany and Belgium with Holland. So, keep on going, every week is a new preparation, every three days now. It is the only way forward</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk has aired his relief at being let off the hook by Riyad Mahrez’s penalty miss during Liverpool’s crunch clash with Manchester City]</b> I think to keep a clean sheet after a penalty in the last five minutes makes me a very happy man. It was not smart from me personally and hopefully it will never happen again. Eighty-five minutes, you obviously get a bit fatigued, and that moment goes by in a split second and I decided to dive in, which is not what I would normally do. It was a decision I made and hopefully it will be the last time I make that decision at that time. At the end we need to be happy - I need to be happy - that we didn’t lose it because of the penalty. They came as the champions and it was lucky they didn’t score but also unlucky we didn’t score either.<br /><br /><b>[Van Dijk said of the Blues’ tactics]</b> Obviously they were a bit cautious of the way we played and I think we have earned that respect but they still pressed and still tried to play their game. We made it difficult for them and they made it difficult for us at times but that’s how it is.<br /><br />I think it is not about these games, it is all about the other games, the difficult games which we have against mid-table and lower teams. We want to get as close as possible and do as well as we can but we know it is going to be hard. We’ve had a great start to the season and we want to keep it going</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk has hailed Liverpool’s ability to defend from front to back]</b> It’s credit to everyone. As defenders - and everyone in the team - we try to keep a clean sheet because we know if we do that we have a big chance to win the game. We always get opportunities, we’ll always be dangerous in front of goal and we’ll always create chances. So we know if we keep a clean sheet we have a big chance to win. How we defend all together, how we press together - it starts up front - we can make life difficult for everyone. It’s never easy to play through our front three; when you do, you come up against our midfielders, who are always putting pressure on you and never leave you alone. Then you come up against us at the back - and we have an outstanding goalkeeper as well, which helps a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk joined Jurgen Klopp in condemning Paris Saint-Germain’s theatrics]</b> Obviously they’re world-class players but I don’t think it’s needed in the game at times. Sometimes they get hit and they will go down and sometimes I think it’s too easy and I’m getting so frustrated. It’s important to keep your head cool but every time we made a foul they all came to the ref trying to get us a yellow card. We should do the same at times today and I think in the second half we did it better. It’s not my type of game that I like. We still respect them how they are as players because they’re world-class players but it’s not really necessary at times. But other than that, they scored two goals, we lost and that’s it.<br /><br />I think everyone in Europe respects us and I think we deserve that. But I think they are playing for the Champions League, that’s what their season is all about. They’re going to win the league, that’s something pretty obvious, so the only big thing for them is the Champions League. You see how much it meant after the game, how they celebrated<br /><br />I hate losing, like everyone else. When you’re 2-0 down after 30 minutes, then you know it’s going to be tough. I think after the penalty that we scored we had more belief than ever and I think second half we did much better and unfortunately we didn’t get the equaliser. We don’t need to forget that we played Napoli, one of the best teams in Europe; PSG, one of the favourites to win the Champions League; and obviously the game in Belgrade was not good enough. We don’t need to <b>[think]</b> we are a shit team, basically. It can happen. But the frustrating thing is how we conceded the goals and then it’s always difficult to come back. I don’t know if there’s any explanation for that right now because I can’t think of one - otherwise we should have used it already. But now we need to look forward and the only option for us to qualify is to win against Napoli, no matter what<br /><br />I’m very disappointed from tonight but we know that there’s only one chance left and we all want to take. We’re going to do everything that’s possible. We need everyone’s help, we need all the fans, we need everyone that comes to support us that night to make it a special evening for all of us. We know it’s going to be tough - Napoli is a fantastic team with great players, they have a great manager - but we need to keep believing in ourselves. We already do, I think, but at times today it wasn’t good enough and we need to be ready for that test</p>

If he’s trying to run at you, trying to get past you, you need to be ready for that as well. You don’t need to give any opportunities to those strikers because they will punish you and they will score.<br /><br />They have a lot of great players and Arjen <b>[Robben]</b> has been fantastic for years. I’ve seen him up close with the <b>[Dutch]</b> national team. He’s a fantastic professional. He’s been a bit unlucky with injuries, but he’s shown throughout his career how good he is and he still has a lot of quality. He is very dangerous. His left foot is something special and he’s been doing it for years - cutting in, looking for the top corner with his left foot. If he plays we need to be aware of that, but they have quality all over the pitch.<br /><br />Liverpool is such a massive club, I was very proud of the interest. In the end, when the deal got done, I was just very happy for me and my family. I was proud of myself and I was proud of the people close to me who helped me along the way. It’s been over a year now and we’ve come a long way. I’ve been progressing as a player and as a person. There’s still a lot to come, I think<br /><br /><b>[He added on the pressure of life at Anfield]</b> There’s always pressure at a big club. I’d rather play with pressure than without. I’m very proud to play for all these fans, for the manager, with these fantastic players and to wear the shirt every game. To play with pressure is always a good thing. I like to play with pressure</p>

  <p><b>[Virgil van Dijk has spoken of the challenge facing Liverpool ahead of their Champions League second leg clash with Bayern Munich]</b> It’s going to be an exciting tie. They played very well <b>[at Anfield]</b>, kept it tight - especially at the back - and they obviously showed us a lot of respect. They changed a bit the way they played I think, so we need to be up for a big fight because they are probably going to come all in, especially in the beginning. It is going to be tough and we need to do better than we did in the last away games in the Champions League. The group stage games were not as good as we wanted, but we got through to the knockout phase. Now we have a 0-0 and we want to do everything that is possible to get through. We know it is going to be a very hard and tough game.<br /><br />To keep a clean sheet in the first leg is always good for both teams but we know if we score they need to score two. That is how it is. We want to win the game and go through. There will be times when it is going to be very tough, we are going to be under a lot of pressure because they have a lot of quality and they showed that. But we will definitely have our own moments because of the quality we have as well. Everyone can see how tough it is already in the Champions League. The situation is we have a 0-0 to start with and hopefully we can get the job done</p>

At home they showed us a lot of respect with the way they played because that’s not the way they play. We knew they would attack a little bit more and we would have more spaces to play and we used it as well<br /><br />Very close.

For the first time in my life, football meant nothing to me. It was not important at all. This was all about trying to stay alive. My mother and I were both praying to God and, to be honest, we were discussing various scenarios. At one point, I had to sign these documents. It was a will. If I would die in hospital, part of my money would go to my mum. Nobody wanted to raise this issue, but it needed to be dealt with because there was a chance that I would die there and then. I remember lying in bed. All I could see were tubes and wires on my body. My body was broken. I was not capable of anything. The worst things went through my mind<br /><br />I put the TV on and a song came on - Viva la Vida by Coldplay, it was an emotional moment. If I hear it now I think of the tough moments and how good it is right now and how proud I can be. I couldn’t do anything for at least 10 days, I couldn’t walk. When I walked for the first time, I did 10 metres and was breathing like crazy. After a month, I started training with the physios to get my muscles back. After that I played a full season and went to Celtic</p>

We need to enjoy it when players are doing well for their teams and I’m feeling good at the moment. Obviously there are a lot of expectations when you come to a club for a record fee but you can’t change that. You just need to perform and show it on the pitch and gain respect through that. I’ve tried to do that since day one and it’s been going all right. There are plenty of good central defenders around and I enjoy watching them. If I watch big games like the Champions League on TV then I’m definitely watching what different centre-backs are doing in certain situations. When people are talking about you in a positive way, that’s always a good thing, but basically that’s it.<br /><br />I’m feeling positive. We are in a position right now where anything is still possible. You can’t prepare yourself for these situations - you just need to experience it and deal with it, and we have players who can handle everything that we’re going through right now. It’s the last month of the Premier League season now and we understand that we have to give even more than maybe we have done already and we’ll see if that’s enough. I’m not nervous, no. That’s something I definitely never am anymore. I do get angry at times at myself, and it’s just a reaction because we want to win games and we want to give everything because we work so hard together. On the pitch it is more excitement than nerves. You want to go out there and show the best of yourself to your fans and your family, to perform and do well</p>

When you look at the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> game <b>[in last season’s Champions League semi-finals]</b>, the scenes from the parade in the city and you watch videos of them celebrating all over the world, it says everything. It’s unbelievable to be involved in something so special.<br /><br />I think the minimum you can do at such a beautiful and big club is to give everything you’ve got and have no regrets when you leave the pitch because you know you did everything in your power to win the game. The fans appreciate that. That’s the mentality we all have in the squad; we will work every yard of the pitch and work for each other: it’s our base. No one can blame us for not trying, for not having ambition because we give everything<br /><br />The progress since I’ve been here has surprised me a little, but at the same time, it hasn’t been surprising because if you look at the team, we have a fantastic squad on and off the pitch. It’s not just the talent we have: everyone gets along, we want to fight for each other, we want to develop together and that’s something that comes down from the manager and how he is with his staff. The senior players here are welcoming, set the tone in terms of how we treat each other and what we should demand from ourselves. We want to improve, we won’t get comfortable. That’s a big credit to the manager and everyone that works at Melwood: they always remind us there’s no time to feel like it’s all good. That we have to strive to be better than the last game, even if it was an incredible performance. There are always things we can still learn to perfect</p>

  <p><b>[Van Dijk shrugs off <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> criticisms: We can’t always play the perfect game]</b> We did it for the fans! No, we could have done better. It was a game of two halves, maybe? First half we played so well, we were so comfortable at 3-0 but then we conceded a goal and they started believing. We knew before the game that they would never give up anyway, and they kept going, they had a lot of pace and pressing - a bit like how we play. But we should have done better, especially the first 20 minutes of the second half, all of us. That’s why we conceded the goals. But it’s maybe a good thing. We know we still have to improve, but we will<br /><br /><b>[Van Dijk railed at the suggestion <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> had been all over the place at times]</b> I don’t think all over the place is the right choice of words! But when we played football, we tried to break through them and if the last pass got intercepted, then they were very direct. When we have the ball, we are a little open. I think the problem was when we lost the ball, there was a lot of space for them to counter, and with the pace they have and the runners they have, that can be dangerous. Of course everyone wants to panic and stress and maybe look for all the negatives, but we shouldn’t! I’m not even looking at the negatives. We know we can do better, but we are human beings and we can’t always play the perfect game. We have to grind it out. We have the three points and that’s the most important thing. It’s good that we have played against them, we know what we can expect when we go over there. It will be tough there. We can analyse this, and we know we can do better<br /><br /><b>[Does that, Van Dijk was asked, indicate that teams are raising their game against the European champions?]</b> Well so far we are doing pretty well this season! We shouldn’t forget that after one night where we were a bit disorganised. There’s no reason for panic at all, we just need to relax, have a look at what can be better. There is plenty. We will analyse it, and we have another tough game against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> on Saturday. But we have to be confident and keep doing what we do</p>

In my point of view, we just have to go for it. The pressure gets bigger, but that comes from the media. They love to put more pressure on us and that’s something we have to deal with. I don’t mind because I’m not thinking about what other people say, I just want to win every game that is ahead of me.
<br />br&gt;We definitely need to enjoy it <b>[being top of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> and be full of confidence, especially with the way we’ve got these points, having not had the best games but still getting the wins. There are so many games left, you can’t really think about it <b>[winning the title]</b> - it’s not realistic. We shouldn’t and we don’t, but it’s the better situation to be in.<br /><br />I don’t watch <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>’s games but I have family and friends who text me or say something, especially after the <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> game <b>[when City lost 2-0]</b>. That’s just part of life but we’ve learnt from last year that we don’t have to look to the others until the end of the campaign. So far, we have been doing well but <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> are definitely not going away. The hunger <b>[to win trophies]</b> is even more than it was before <b>[winning the Champions League]</b>. Everyone wants to experience it again. It was such a fantastic evening with the whole build-up and everything that started with the game against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> at home. We all have dreams, we all have targets.

I’m thinking about <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> when we played away, how tough it was there and big credit to them, they pushed us right to the end, created dangerous moments.

  <p><b>[Van Dijk admits <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> situation is ‘not ideal’ as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> prepare for <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> trip]</b> For them, it is not the ideal situation to lose your first-choice goalkeeper, one of the best in the world, and one of their main midfielders. They will be disappointed but for us, we just want to focus on ourselves. They want to bounce back for all they’ve done this season and it’s not what they’ve wanted so far, but we want to go out there and extend our points tally and keep winning.<br /><br />They’re not in the best way, they’re not fully confident and they’re not in the situation they want to be in. But the good thing about football is you can bounce back in any game. They might think this is the best occasion to bounce back from it but we know that. We want to go out and fight for every metre on the pitch and try and take the three points back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It’s massive, but it’s more massive for the fans. I think all of the Champions League games are as big as this. The whole atmosphere and leading to the actual game is bigger than some other games but I don’t think it’s the biggest of the season. The big ones are the Champions League and the ones that are hopefully going to win us <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title<br /><br />I want to be involved in every game. They’re the most fun part of being a football player anyway, to go out there and show your talents to the world, try to win a game with a team you train with day in, day out. It’s not easy, you need to look after yourself and with the life we live, it’s very important to leave a lot of things. For example, we play four games in the next 11 days, you’re travelling and staying in hotels and you need to watch what you eat, drink and make sure you recover well.<br /><br />I’m not complaining, not at all, but you need to look after yourself because at the end of the day, the people are coming to the stadium to watch you play and it doesn’t matter if you had a cold the day before, they want you to turn up on matchday. That’s why it’s very important to look after yourself and a big part of that is staying fit. Luckily, so far, I’ve been doing that pretty well and hopefully I can keep doing it.<br /><br />My role is the same with or without the armband. I try to take responsibility because in my position, I have to and I want to as well. I tried to lead the boys from behind and most of the time, I have an overview of the whole pitch so I can try to shout to the front three, whether they hear it or not. Around me as well with the goalie, the full-backs, or the midfielders, I try to shout at them, whether it is nonsense or things that are necessary and need to be said. I think it is a very important thing in football to keep each other awake and alert. Sometimes they have to shout it to me as well and they will</p>

Fear is not something we feel at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. And after what we have done, we know that we have the quality to win any game. It will be a good challenge.

It is not a nice feeling if you go into the international break having dropped points - especially at home - so we were very good and we had to be if we were going to get the three points.<br /><br />We all know and we all feel there are so many games left that so many things can happen between now and May.

We are in a good situation points-wise but we know we can get maybe that extra 10 per cent. We try to do it every day, but it is not easy. The only thing we can do is try. Hopefully it will work out, but the most important thing is to win games.

We are in a very good situation. Close to what we all hope to achieve. Let’s just go for it, enjoy it. Tonight is a big blow but we were playing against a very good side. Let’s focus on ‘just’ <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, because it’s very small, huh?<br /><br />I think that’s stupid to say <b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> weren’t bothered about the cups]</b>, in my opinion. Every competition we participate in, we want to win. We showed it tonight with the line-up and the way we kept going, the energy we put in.<br /><br />We tried to do as much as possible to win the game. My reaction is that I don’t like losing. The way we lost at the weekend was totally deserved. It was a very tough day for all of us. Today we made some changes but everyone who came in did brilliantly.<br /><br />The first goal was a mistake that shouldn’t happen. But we had a massive four chances in one moment to equalise I think. And then it’s a different game. We wanted to keep winning every game that was ahead of us. But we deserved to lose at the weekend.<br /><br />We all knew it. We all discussed it. We got over it easily, I think, because we spoke with each other and accepted we have to improve. Tonight was a much better performance but you lose so you’re out of the cup. That’s the reality<br /><br />He’s been very good for us this season. Very important. And he is our captain. We appreciate everything he does for us. But we have quality players all over the pitch. Everyone who’s coming in, whether on the pitch or off it, has to contribute with being a leader. With being ready to come on, in training or when you’re on the bench to challenge the players who’s playing in your position. Obviously, we can’t deny that he’s been outstanding this year, that he’s been very important. But the reality is everyone else has to step up</p>

The thing is when you don’t get good results - we don’t get too many - we have had three in the last five, but the outside world can talk like we are in a relegation battle. It is what it is. We have to deal with that. We have to be grown men about it, take it on the chin and show the world why we deserve to be where we are and why we deserve to still be in the Champions League. But we know it is going to be unbelievably difficult<br /><br />We couldn’t give any chances away against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, either. Things can happen and they could be the better team but we all want to show why we want to go through with our qualities and deserve to be in the next round<br /><br />It will be very difficult, with all due respect to <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>, Atletico will be tough, they are a fantastic side.

Hopefully we can go through. We have some time to prepare and we have to be ready for a very difficult challenge. I think so far we have been sticking to our principles and whoever is on the pitch involved will give more than 100 per cent. Everyone is looking forward to this game and we all want to go through to the next round. We know it is a difficult game and we will try everything we have to beat them. We know how difficult it will be</p>

We were outstanding, I think. We dominated the game and had the intensity that they had to deal with. But they had an outstanding goalkeeper and he kept them alive. He pulled off some great saves. He saved them, plenty of times. Maybe three or four big, big saves that I can remember off the top of my head. We tried everything, that was the main thing.<br /><br />We played very well. I think no one can question that. You are obviously left with nothing at the end of the game, scored the first, second and in the end they scored at the end. That can happen when we are trying to go all out. We expected exactly the way they played tonight. I think everyone expected that if you look at them, it is their right to approach the game the way they did. I think we did everything we could to win the game. As I say, we were outstanding for 95 minutes. We were intense, we dominated, won the ball, won a lot of second balls and put in a lot of work and heart in the challenges.

Do the right things, wash your hands and do all the things the government is saying, which you have heard probably every second of the day - but do it because it helps everyone. It helps you but it helps everyone around you as well. The second thing is that we miss you guys as well, we miss being out there, we miss working hard every day and trying to get better and show our qualities to all of you. Just stay put, wait and see, that’s the only thing we can all do anyway. The most important thing is to stay safe and look after yourself, your family and the people that are close to you<br /><br />We try to get into that kind of rhythm. The fitness department tried to set up some sessions that we can all do together through video call and I think that’s a good idea, to stick together again and see each other - see all of each other again. Apart from that you just do your running and try to do at least something every day. Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday we do a harder session to give your body what it needs because it can go quickly if you don’t do anything for quite a while. You have to be smart and you have to do the right things to keep your body on a certain level that you can kick on when it starts again</p>

  <p><b>[Van Dijk reveals the only game he’s watched back during lockdown]</b> I don’t watch too much football, to be fair. Especially from this season I didn’t watch any particular game back, if I’m honest. I don’t know why, it’s just how it is. I saw only one game back of me when I played one of my first games in Holland, that was on TV, when I played at right-back. I couldn’t believe what I was doing at that time! I watched that game back because I was 18 or 19 at the time and I didn’t watch that game back since that time. It was on TV and I watched it back. I miss watching football and obviously playing football but it’s a bit of a difficult one I think. I didn’t watch any of the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> games this year, I have seen a couple on social media, some highlights - it’s nice to see and a good feeling to get.

I think the way in which defenders are seen has also changed over the years. Real football fans know how important defenders are and they appreciate them.

The manager demands a lot from me and it all helped me become the player I am today. It’s a lot of tactical work, a lot of thinking. Obviously as a defender we try to keep a high line, try to put the opponent under pressure at all times. You leave a lot of space sometimes behind you so you had to deal with that as well. But it’s something I definitely enjoy and I knew before I joined the club this is something I had to work on in the beginning but it would definitely be something that I enjoy.

We have players who can progress and make big steps in their development. Winning the league would be a big experience that could take them to the next level.

We were very close last year and we are very close this year, much closer than we were last year. We have nine games to go and we will try to win all of them.

Not knowing when we will start again. Sometimes people were putting things in the media saying the league should be cancelled. You read these things because you have plenty of time to read when there is suddenly no football being played.<br /><br />I wasn’t worried but being left in the dark, not knowing what was going to happen, personally I hate that. You ask questions to certain people who know what is happening behind the scenes and it was pretty clear there was no option at all to cancel the league.
