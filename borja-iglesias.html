<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Real Madrid have not lost their attacking threat since Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure]</b> Cristiano Ronaldo has shown that he can score goals. I don’t think Real Madrid have lost that. That’s the truth. There are others who do that very well and who are capable of doing what he does. They can be beaten. Any team can be beaten. However, it obviously requires a lot to take a match like this and we are aware of that. But, why can’t we beat Real Madrid?.<br /><br />For me, it was relatively simple. When this option was proposed to me, with the style of play here and the project at the club, it all motivated me a lot. This was a place where it seemed like it had what I needed at this time. It was very simple<br /><br />I think that for somebody who competes, it is important to have this mentality and to see that you have a chance and to believe you can grab your chances. I believe that being ambitious is good, as long as you are also respectful. Bravery and boldness are adjectives that describe this Espanyol team and I think that’ll also be true when we play against Real Madrid</p>
