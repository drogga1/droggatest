  <p>[Groningen’s Lars Veldwijk in trouble after exposing genitals on camera] I can be very clear about this, I think it’s absolutely ridiculous how Lars ended up in the newspapers this week. It’s so annoying and unnecessary that this happens.<br /><br />Especially around that guy, you just want everything to be quiet. Professional players should be an example for other people, so this really doesn’t help. Maybe I’m a bit old fashioned, but I don’t understand anything about vlogging. It’s very unwise of him to show himself like that in those vlogs. We already spoke to him about it and we told him how irritating this is to us. And, even though we understand that he did this in his private time, we still want our players to be professionals off the pitch</p>

  <p>[Groningen director Hans Nijland says it would be a dream for Robben to return home] He played here from the age of 11 and made his first steps on the field here. He even also opened our stadium. Arjen keeps warm ties with us - and vice versa. Obviously, we have talked a lot about him returning. We’ve seen it now with Dirk Kuyt and Feyenoord. It would be an absolute dream. If Arjen would be willing to return, he is more than welcome. If someone like Robben can add to your club, then you must take the next step. There is a beginning and an end somewhere in his career. We’d all love it if he were to do something for the club</p>

  <p>[Barcelona have wrapped up a deal for Groningen’s teenage midfielder Ludovit Reis] In 23 years I have been able to do business on behalf of FC Groningen with large clubs at home and abroad, but this transfer with one of the largest clubs in the world is a wonderful agreement</p>
