  <p><b>[USA national team goalkeeper Tim Howard has criticized former coach Jurgen Klinsmann over his use of foreign-born players]</b> Jurgen Klinsmann had a project to unearth talent around the world that had American roots. But having American roots doesn’t mean you are passionate about playing for that country. I know there were players that came in that it didn’t matter as much to. If you get enough of those players, one or two can get found out, but if you get enough of those players you lose sight of what you are all about. While it was a good idea in theory, it had its flaws. <b>[new coach]</b> Bruce <b>[Arena]</b> will 100 percent get that back.<br /><br />I think that internationally coaches should probably get a four-year reign. It is not club <b>[soccer]</b> where you get to spend $150 million on players, you essentially have the same core of players. You can trim the fat and bring some rookie in or a guy from college or someone who had a good season. But you can’t revamp it too much. What you need is fresh ideas, fresh voices</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Howard has clarified his apparent criticism of dual nationals under Jurgen Klinsmann]</b> Some of them are <b>[dual nationals]</b>, but I think others are players who have their roots here in America too. It’s not exclusive to them because some of our dual nationals have been brilliant. Jermaine Jones has been a rock for our national team. He’s been one of the heartbeats. Fabian Johnson has been brilliant for us. So, no, that wasn’t aimed at any one person in particular.<br /><br />I think any time you have a team that’s disconnected - no matter what the issue is that brings that disconnect - when you have that, there’s no way you can all be pulling in the same direction. I’m an old man and I’ve seen a lot of things, and what it seemed like to me was there was a lack of passion and desire by certain players to run through a wall</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Howard looks strong in return from four-month injury layoff]</b> I felt good, I felt sharp. Ticked a lot of boxes. It’s not like I’ve just come off the couch. I’ve been training at least a month now. I would have liked to have gotten some games in preseason, but that’s not the case here, and my hands were tied a little bit in terms of trying to get reserve games. We made it work, and I felt, certainly going into it, that I was sharp.<br /><br />I prefer not to let Bradley in in that type of scenario, but it was a good ‘welcome back’ moment. At least I made the save.<br /><br />Yesterday, when it snowed, it wasn’t ideal, and I knew how cold it would be today. I would have preferred a game in Orlando or Houston, but I felt healthy so I just figured I’d go with it and get myself as warm as possible<br /><br />I want to be healthy, and I want to be playing well. I’ll wait and see. I still wait for the emails. Obviously that’s a question for Bruce. Hopefully I’ll do enough to get an opportunity if I’m healthy<br /><br />I’m 38, I’m not sure I’ll ever be 100 percent again, but I feel like I can get the job done.

  <p><b>[The MLS Players Association has criticized the league for its handling of Colorado Rapids goalkeeper Tim Howard after an altercation with fans that lead to his three-game suspension]</b> We are disappointed with the league’s handling of the situation involving the Kansas City fans and Tim Howard. Following the incidents, which involved a verbal exchange with a fan, as well as an altercation after the game, Tim acknowledged his culpability and responsibility for his role. However, he is the only one involved to do so.<br /><br />Although the Players Union and Tim acknowledge that his conduct was inappropriate, there is further context that should not be lost. MLS has a detailed Fan Code of Conduct in place under which fans are expected to be respectful to each other and to players, and are prohibited from engaging in disorderly behavior, including obscene or abusive language. The fans involved repeatedly, routinely and openly violated that Code of Conduct, without any repercussions. It is thus not surprising that there was a reaction from the player<br /><br />The security provided by the league and Sporting Kansas City was wholly inadequate to protect players and fans. As Tim was attempting to leave the field, a fan with alcohol in hand was able to come within two feet of him on field level and aggressively scream obscenities in his face. That is unacceptable behavior anywhere and is not something that players, or anyone, should be subjected to in their workplace. Tim takes responsibility for his actions, but MLS needs to do the same, and send a clear message that it is committed to creating a safe experience not only for its fans, but for its players too</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Howard has spoken out about the incident that led to his suspension earlier this month]</b> I want to begin by saying I am genuinely sorry for my behavior in Kansas City and I want to apologize to my fans. I let myself get too worked up after being provoked and said some things I shouldn’t have. I am at fault and certainly not a victim in this incident.<br /><br />It is not ok for an apparently drunk fan to get inches away from an athlete’s face and yell obscenities at them. While I should have controlled my reaction, I want to make it clear that I have never been put into a situation like that until Kansas City. I’m not a security expert, so don’t know the details of how a fan could get so close, but it was not the norm and not right<br /><br />I am not saying I want censorship of fans or security policing against passion, but we all deserve a fan-friendly and safe environment. I don’t mind - and even enjoy - a bit of verbal jousting with fans but I don’t want to be taunted for my race or my disability <b>[Tourette Syndrome]</b>, which didn’t happen specifically in Kansas City but happens very often. I want security to keep fans at enough of a distance that a physical confrontation is impossible</p>

I feel good about where I’m at, and how I feel physically obviously that’s the most important thing. The soccer is the soccer, and the goalkeeping is natural for me now at my age.<br /><br />I’ve only ever had one game. That’s as far as you can look. You can’t look to next week or the week after or two months from now. The next game is what matters to me. If I have the honor of representing my country - and I say it all the time, it probably sounds like lip service but outside of my kids it’s the greatest thing I’ve ever done in my life - so it means the world to make it on the field, and put that shirt on and try to lead this team and perform well</p>

I think we’re past the experimentation phase. These are all guys who the manager believes in wholeheartedly. They’re not here for anything other than to play minutes and to play important minutes.<br /><br />We need to win our home game against Trinidad. That’s vital.

He’s not afraid, and that’s huge for us. Because you look at him, he’s not the biggest and he doesn’t look the strongest. Teams are always going to come in and try and get stuck into him.

Getting to the final doesn’t matter if we don’t take care of business on Wednesday.<br /><br />I wouldn’t say <b>[we’re favorites]</b>. There are some good teams. Obviously we always have Mexico fighting with us. There are other good teams like Costa Rica and Panama. Panama played us tough in the first round.

  <p><b>[USA goalkeeper Tim Howard still chasing greatness at 38]</b> Day to day it’s hard as hell. I feel good where I am physically come match day, but to get to that point is - at this stage - is very difficult. I have to commit every day to making sure that all my treatments and my rehab and all of my rest is geared toward match day. That’s what happens when you get to be older. You can’t leave anything on the training ground. Where before I would train every day and go for hours and hours, now you just can’t, because if I did I wouldn’t be prepared for match day.<br /><br />My dream would be this offseason maybe go over to Juventus and watch Buffon and kind of see what he does. Obviously that’s something I would love to do. I haven’t quite figured out logistically how it would work. I want to see what I’m doing right, and what I can incorporate, and how he does it. That’s a different level. Match day, then Champions League, then playing for his national team<br /><br />It’s hard really to put into words what he means to the team and what he brings to the table. His communication with the defenders is the best that I’ve ever seen. There’s moments in the game when the ball goes up the field and you think you’re done with the play, but he keeps you locked in<br /><br />It’s a love affair. I’ve fallen in love with competing. It’s like a drug. You want more of it. You want to push the boundaries of what is possible for yourself, what people have done before you. Winning and competing is enticing to me. It still gets my juices flowing. I wouldn’t have thought it would be this long when I was younger, but I’ve been lucky. I’ve been lucky with injuries, I’ve been lucky to have some good coaches, and some teams I’ve had good fortune<br /><br /><b>[Howard recalled of his move to Manchester United]</b> I think I was scared to death. I’ve always had this fear of failure, and I still have it today. It drives me, but the difference with me is, at the end of the day, there’s success and there’s failure and ultimately it’s whether you believe in yourself or not. I would always rather try and fail than not try at all<br /><br />I was a goalkeeper who needed to develop and learn, but when you get thrown in at the deep end you figure it out. I think for who I was as a goalkeeper I thought I did pretty well. I was 23 years old, I knew nothing about goalkeeping at the time. Compared to what I know now, I knew nothing. At the time what I do remember consciously thinking was ‘I’ll just try to use the tools that I have,’ which was raw athletic talent. Fly around, make some saves and hope for the best<br /><br /><b>[When asked if the 2018 World Cup would mark the end of his national team career]</b> I would imagine so. It’s hard. It’s day by day with me, it’s game by game. I take things in segments. The goal for everybody is to get to and through that World Cup. Outside of that I have no idea. That’s my target. I have another two seasons after this on my contract <b>[with the Colorado Rapids so we’ll see<br /><br />Some people get tired of it and then move on and you don’t remember their names.

I think his head’s in the right place<br /><br />Clearly the foundation that’s been built in Germany is a tough one, is steely, and it’s probably what you’d expect of a player that’s kind of had his schooling in the Bundesliga. It certainly pays dividends for us<br /><br /><b>[One suggestion made after Friday’s match was to have U.S. players serve as enforcers who retaliate against those players fouling Pulisic]</b> It’s a big problem with our sport. I wish we could <b>[retaliate]</b>. I’m envious of hockey players and baseball players, but we can’t. I don’t think there’s anything we can do. I wish we could, because I think we’d lay it all on the line to project him.<br /><br />You try your best to do what you can, but the onus is on the individual player in soccer to have enough wherewithal about him, both mentally and physically, and not fly off the handle and ride tackles and play the game. He’s done a good job with that</p>

  <p><b>[Colorado Rapids goalkeeper Tim Howard believes Wayne Rooney will make DC United a better team]</b> The idea isn’t whether a player is of a certain age; it’s whether they are motivated and whether they are driven to come here and perform, help a team and ultimately buy into it. Not, ‘I’m coming here for vacation, I like the weather,’ but really roll their sleeves up and become a part of the team. That is all that matters. The age thing means nothing, but people hang on it. Know the man, understand how he operates, and when you strip back those layers, you’ll start to realize there is a top player there.<br /><br />Wayne will be fine. When a player starts to get older, you want to utilize him in the right positions to get the most out of them. So that will be up to Benny Olsen to figure out where he bests suits the team. But make no mistake: Having Wayne Rooney makes you a better team<br /><br /><b>[Howard also dismissed the idea that MLS players will be overawed by a Premier League veteran who has had Rooney’s track record of club success]</b> He will be challenged. This is a tough league. People won’t care what his name is. There will be a lot of respect, but they are going to try to make it difficult for him. That, I think, will bring the best out of Wayne.</p>

I think his talents will lend themselves very well to the way Chelsea play football.<br /><br />It is a massive club, but he’s played for a massive club already. Dortmund is no slouch, and he went there under Jurgen Klopp and he’s grown up there and learned a lot of his trade in the Bundesliga.<br /><br />He’s played a big part for the USA national team, so as much as the price tag is massive, which it is, he’s ready to perform</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Howard says that he believes that American goalkeepers have an early advantage due to the multitude of American sports that require hand-eye coordination]</b> Overall, the position of goalkeeper is about being athletic, dexterous and having good hand-to-eye coordination. When we grow up in America and play sports as American athletes, as kids, everything about what we do as we grow up playing every sport is our hand-to-eye coordination, whether it’s playing tennis, golf, basketball, American football and baseball. A lot of us grow up playing basketball, especially. So, right away, since a young age, we have a little bit of leg up in terms of starting out at the age of four, five and six, playing with our hands. When you go to Europe, they immediately put the ball at your feet!

But the goalkeepers better not get too far away from saving the ball first. Ultimately, that’s the bread and butter if you’re a goalkeeper. I watch a bunch of goalkeepers now who everyone says are elite, high-level goalkeepers with their feet, but they struggle to save the ball and keep it away from the net. Ultimately, the ability to make saves will always and forever be the most important skill from a goalkeeping aspect<br /><br /><b>[The goalkeeper now moves into the next phase of his life, ownership, as he owns a stake in both Dagenham &amp; Redbridge and Memphis 901 FC]</b> <b>[I]</b> Feel good.
