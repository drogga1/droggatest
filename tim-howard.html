If no one has a slip up, then City wins<br /><br /><b>[Howard, who played alongside <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> for four years before both men left the club at the end of the 2006/07 season, is in no doubt as to his former colleague’s credentials]</b> So football’s funny. Pundits and fans are funny. He’s the right man for the job. Hopefully they will spend some money and they’ll get his players in and it’s no problem. It’s funny, right? Football: He comes in and wins every game for three months and he’s the second coming of Jesus Christ and everyone loves him and then they tear him down and are ready to throw him off the ledge<br /><br /><b>[Looking forward, he is confident that <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> will return his former club to its past glories]</b> I think for any of those teams in that pack of six or eight teams, I think the idea is to finish in the top four. And if you catch good form and lightning in a bottle, and you’re in a title race then it’s all to play for. But right now, I think the idea is for them to get back in the Champions League for sure<br /><br /><b>[In January, the 39-year-old Howard, who played 121 games for the US men’s national team, announced that he would retire at end of the 2019 <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> season]</b> There will be plenty of time for sentiment later.

  <p><b>[Through longevity and moments of brilliance, retiring Tim Howard has become the standard-bearer for American GKs]</b> I will remember my career with joy and appreciation. It encompassed everything I thought it would be. It brought heartbreak, joy, pain, love, it was everything. I think of that 2009-10 Confederations Cup team and the World Cup team, we could’ve went even farther and I’d roll up my sleeves and go to war with them every day. I take those memories with me<br /><br /><b>[It’s about clashes with Mexico and the 2009 Confederations Cup. It’s about becoming just the fourth goalkeeper to score a goal in the Premier League]</b> I never set out to be the greatest ever. I just wanted to follow in the footsteps of Tony Meola, Kasey Keller and <a href="brad-friedel.html">Brad Friedel</a> - the three biggest goaltenders of my generation. I looked up to those guys, I wanted a shirt, I just wanted to wear one. And once I got it, I wanted more. And I think successful people get a taste and they just want more. One thing is true of every single one of my 700-plus games, I just wanted more</p>

A few that stand out to me are my first game, which was against Ecuador, then the win against Spain in 2009 at the semi-final of the Confederations Cup and the loss to Brazil in the final.

  <p><b>[Tim Howard says that he believes that American goalkeepers have an early advantage due to the multitude of American sports that require hand-eye coordination]</b> Overall, the position of goalkeeper is about being athletic, dexterous and having good hand-to-eye coordination. When we grow up in America and play sports as American athletes, as kids, everything about what we do as we grow up playing every sport is our hand-to-eye coordination, whether it’s playing tennis, golf, basketball, American football and baseball. A lot of us grow up playing basketball, especially. So, right away, since a young age, we have a little bit of leg up in terms of starting out at the age of four, five and six, playing with our hands. When you go to Europe, they immediately put the ball at your feet! It’s something that helps American goalkeepers as we grow<br /><br /><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> star <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a> is widely seen as a prime example, as <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> has asked his goalkeeper to show comfort with the ball at his feet]</b> There are probably five teams around the world where a goalkeeper can afford to play like an outfield player. But the goalkeepers better not get too far away from saving the ball first. Ultimately, that’s the bread and butter if you’re a goalkeeper. I watch a bunch of goalkeepers now who everyone says are elite, high-level goalkeepers with their feet, but they struggle to save the ball and keep it away from the net. Ultimately, the ability to make saves will always and forever be the most important skill from a goalkeeping aspect<br /><br /><b>[The goalkeeper now moves into the next phase of his life, ownership, as he owns a stake in both Dagenham &amp; Redbridge and Memphis 901 FC]</b> <b>[I]</b> Feel good. Feel lucky and very fortunate to have played 21 years professionally around the world and the clubs I’ve played for. I’m also excited to figure out what’s next. I continue to do my broadcasting. I have an ownership stake in a couple football teams to help run and operate those. From that aspect, I’m excited to see what the future holds</p>

  <p><b>[The retiring Tim Howard writes a final goodbye letter to his fans]</b> Football has taught me a lot about life. And who I am as a person. Out of all the games I played, I’ll bet almost half ended with the media or the fans criticizing me. It’s only natural that self-doubt creeps in. You wonder if you can actually do this. If I could go back to 2003 and that nervous, naive 24-year-old kid on a plane flying to England to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, about to sign with the biggest football club in the world, I’d tell him to buckle up tight. It’s going to be one hell of a ride. There will be good days and bad. You’re going to go to some dark places. You’re going to wonder if you should give up.

He was the toughest son of a b*tch I ever met. Nothing short of brilliant. As a coach, he taught me about resilience. And never giving up on myself. I took so much of what I learned from being around him and used it over the rest of my career, trying to pass it along to the next generation<br /><br /><b>[Looking back on his career, the American recalled the good times at Goodison Park and highlighted one particularly fiery incident involving coach David Moyes]</b> There are so many other good things I will forever take with me. The day I wore the captain’s band for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> when we played at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Or the day <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> taught me what the term spitting mad truly meant.

  <p><b>[Former <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and USMNT goalkeeper Tim Howard says ex-team-mate Sylvain Distin told him he wasn’t planning on going into management due to the lack of black coaches in the Premier League]</b> My best friend at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> was a black guy from Paris, and we were the best of friends for over a decade and we still are. Afterwards, I said, ‘Come on, like why aren’t you coaching?’ and he looked at me like I had three heads. He said, ‘Coaching, how many black people do you see coaching?’ I was like, ‘Yeah’. So you’re talking about a guy that has played more <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games than any foreign player in history and he doesn’t think he can get a job coaching in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It’s crazy.<br /><br /><b>[Howard says it is important that the message continues and that those protests inspire actual change that prevents them from being needed again]</b> Simply put, its too lenient. It’s too lenient. The next step for all of us is the reason why you protest, the reason why you shout, is so you can get people’s attention<br /><br />Now that we have people’s attention, the next step is to make sure that they’re putting language in that allows us to peacefully protest, but we’re not peacefully protesting for the sake of taking a knee because we feel like resting. It’s to engage conversation and change the narrative</p>
