  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> right-back Kyle Walker-Peters has said that the challenge he faced during last week’s draw with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> was the toughest he has faced in his career]</b> Honestly, I’d put that down as the hardest game I’ve ever played. I’ve never been under relentless pressure like that … never.<br /><br />It’s a big season for him this year, he’s had a big couple of games already in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> this season and now, no bigger test than playing <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> away and being up against Sterling, but he handled it exceptionally well. I thought he was fantastic on Saturday and playing in the Under-18s with him, going all this way and continuing the journey in the first team, it’s been even more special to see him doing so well, so I’m really pleased for him<br /><br />Physically he’s still working hard but with his whole defensive reading of the game and making big, important tackles and blocks, he’s been excellent and really worked hard on everything. On the ball he has an amazing quality and he’s shown that in every game he’s played, so to go away to City and to perform as he did, it’s a big statement from him</p>
