Aberdeen fans looked on in disbelief as Kieran Tierney sprinted up the Hampden steps at around 5pm, still fully kitted out - boots and all - after being rushed to hospital barely 90 minutes earlier following an ugly clash that left him with blood pouring from his mouth and a serious facial injury. That was not, however, sufficient to stop the defender, still under the influence of painkillers, racing back to the ground in time to join the celebrations as <a href="celtic-fc.html">the Hoops</a> lifted the Scottish Cup after a last-gasp Tom Rogic strike</p>

Transfer consultant Ian McGarry claimed Kieran Tierney’s chat with Scotland colleague Andrew Robertson has convinced the 22-year-old he should pursue a move south of the border. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> defender Andrew Robertson has dismissed claims he urged Scotland team-mate Kieran Tierney to quit <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> for the sake of his career</p>

  <p><b>[Kieran Tierney’s Agent Allan Preston says Kieran Tierney could well be on his way out of <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> this summer]</b> Tierney won’t be leaving until one of the projected buyers meets <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>’s valuation, thought to be £25 million. It is all down to <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. If they get a price that they believe is the correct value for Kieran Tierney he could possibly be on his way. No one has hit that price yet.<br /><br /><b>[Preston doesn’t think that the rumours will be affecting him, as a lifelong <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> fan committed to the club and happy in green and white]</b> He is such an unassuming young man. He is wealthy at the moment but he doesn’t possess a watch, he isn’t into material things like this. He still hangs about his pals from when he was a youngster, he sponsors his local pub team where his pals play and he’s not into his designer gear or anything like that. As the guys say he loves <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>, he absolutely loves <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. Will there be a time for Kieran Tierney to go? I think that there will be.<br /><br />If it’s just now it will be up to the clubs involved - <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> or whoever - to then put the money on the table and make <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> think about this. If there is a time for Kieran to go it will be up to <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>, <a href="peter-lawwell.html">Peter Lawwell</a> and the board. They have signed a left-back but they do need one because Emilio Izaguirre is away</p>

I was actually down the park with my friends training. They play with their local team so I was down watching them and I got a phone call that I needed to go. I got to the airport and the flight was delayed two-and-a-half hours, with another hour’s drive for a hotel and I probably got zero sleep, so I was back up at half five today<br /><br /><b>[Tierney is unavailable as he continues to recover from double-hernia surgery]</b> I’m just getting back fit now, I’m just getting back involved with a ball and back running.

I don’t have to explain my love for <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>, everyone knows it’s my club and the club I’ve supported all my life. But this was a chance to move to a massive club in England. Everyone told me it was a great move, it’s a chance to come here and play against some of the best players in the world. And every day I am training with some of the best players in the world too. It was an opportunity to better myself. Sometimes you have to look at your career as well as what your heart is telling you to do and it was the toughest decision of my life. It kept me up at nights thinking about it. People who are around me know how hard it was.<br /><br /><b>[Tierney appreciates that many of those who once idolised him may never find it in their hearts to forgive him]</b> I don’t know if it will pass, some people probably won’t ever forgive me. Everyone has their choice, some people will support me and others won’t. I gave <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> 15 years, I put my body through a lot playing through injuries and gave everything. I am not saying ‘I’m brilliant’ or anything but I gave everything I could every single day. Hopefully they will continue to support me but if not I just have to deal with that.

He knows what’s going to happen in a game and how it’s going to happen and what you should do, where you’re going to get pressed from and where your options should be.

There are times for a laugh and a joke - Mikel loves that as well - but when we’re working, we’re working. It’s a lot of tactical stuff as well, and that’s going to help us all get an understanding of how he wants us to play. I’ve said before, something like that is not going to just work straight away, it’s going to be a process, but there is light at the end of the tunnel and we need to stay focused on that. There are going to be bad results and bad games, but as a team we need to keep the confidence, stick together and kick on again. All the players are hurting, it’s a tough time for everyone at the club, but there are going to be better days ahead. The last two results haven’t been ideal, but the work-rate is still at 100 per cent every day in training. We’re working so hard and we’re working to the gameplan that the manager wants. We all believe in it and we’re all buying into it.</p>
