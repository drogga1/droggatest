  <p><b>[Andre Onana take direct aim at the decision makers]</b> That this happens is not only the fault of the manager, because I know the media will spread negativity about him. Overmars and Van der Sar are equally responsible for making us play shit. It’s the fault of everyone at Ajax, not just that of Ten Hag. I can stay and try to be champion next season, but if something better comes I’ll be away. I think it’s important to look at my own career, I’m ready for my next step with a new challenge.</p>

We dominated the game, we had chances, but it’s difficult to beat Real Madrid with the players they have. The result is unfair, but we will go to the Bernabeu and give everything.

  <p><b>[<a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> goalkeeper Andre Onana is looking to learn from the best in the business]</b> The goalkeeping position has developed significantly in Europe in recent years.

They are keepers at the highest level. I have had a chance to talk to them and face them before, and I always try to watch them and try to follow their path to learn from them and develop more in my football career<br /><br /><b>[And with more teams than ever competing in this year’s competition, he and his teammates will know there is no excuse for them to be complacent]</b> This tournament is going to be very tough. There are many strong teams. For the first time, the tournament is held with 24 teams participating, which means more opportunities and more good players. You can see stars like <a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Riyad Mahrez</a>, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, <a href="naby-keita.html">Naby Keita</a>, <a href="victor-wanyama.html">Victor Wanyama</a>, and of course from <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> there is <a href="hakim-ziyech.html">Hakim Ziyech</a> and Noussair Mazraoui, and others. We have to show our strength from the beginning and send a message to everyone that we are here to defend our title - with respect to all competitors, of course. Cameroon is a great team with a great history, always well represented in the African Championships. We must follow the steps of previous generations and provide our country with the best</p>

  <p><b>[Onana opens door for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> return as goalkeeper admits to <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> uncertainty]</b> I don’t know what will happen next year, if I will stay or not. I never imagined I would play in a Europa League final or Champions League semi-finals. When I left <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, my idea was to be the third goalkeeper of a top-level team and then have the opportunity to get into a professional team, to learn from the biggest, and <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> gave me that opportunity. I want to be the best goalkeeper in the world. It’s the dream I have and, as they say, dreaming is not forbidden. <b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> have always been my club. They gave me everything. It was the road to get into Europe and I’m very grateful. If they loved me again, I’d be delighted, but you never know<br /><br />We had a very tough game against a great rival and the truth is we achieved the unthinkable in knocking them out in their own stadium. But now we have another great opportunity to play against <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>. It’s much harder for us to play now because everyone knows us. It’s another great game for me and it’s not easy to play as the away side on a pitch like that, especially against one of the greats in the Champions League, but our mentality is to go to win</p>

  <p><b>[Cameroonian goalkeeper admits that he has never been involved in a match like the one on Tuesday night with spectacular 4-4 draw at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> Never. I think we are disappointed but, when you see the bigger picture, it is good to leave with a point here. It was not easy. It is not easy at all. We fought to the end. We didn’t lose. It was really important for us not to lose. We did it and I am really proud of the guys. I think the way we fought together, it is not easy to run up and down with nine men. My team-mates were hard workers.<br /><br />Even if we are playing with seven men then we will try and play our football because if we play their game, then it will be easier for them because they are more physical and stronger than us. So for us, it is more important to keep possession and to try to play but with nine it is not easy. On the field, I was really angry because I thought ‘what is going on?’. I always say that the referees, they can make mistakes. We just have to respect them. Sometimes they will be right or not. They just try to do what’s best but it was not the best of games.<br /><br />I think <b>[Frank]</b> <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> is doing really well <b>[at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b>. I am not really surprised <b>[about their comeback]</b>. I think for us, the important thing is us and we just tried to look at ourselves. We tried to stay patient with the ball and the space will come. The space will open up and we try to score one more ourselves</p>
