  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and former England goalkeeper Rob Green has announced his retirement from football at the age of 39]</b> Following an incredible evening in Baku on Wednesday and after a 23-year career spanning three decades, I’ve decided that now is the right time to announce my retirement from professional football. Being part of the group and celebrations with such a special squad of players after winning the Europa League seems a fitting way to end what’s been an amazing journey for me in the game. I’ve loved every moment and feel privileged to have enjoyed the career I have. I’ve played with, and against, some of the best players in the world and have experienced so much that professional football has to offer. I’ve had the joy of representing some fantastic clubs, all of whom have helped to shape me in their own varying way. Thank you to all of the fans and everybody connected with <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich City</a>, <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, QPR, <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a>, <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield Town</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.<br /><br />Representing my country will always be one of my proudest achievements and I feel honoured to have played for England. Thank you to all of the managers, coaches and staff I’ve worked with and thank you to all of the team-mates that I’ve shared a dressing room with over the years. Collectively we’ve shared some amazing times and I leave the game with memories that I’ll always treasure</p>

He was going out in training and tearing some of the best defenders in the world apart. He was consistently the best in training. It was to the point where some of the best players in the world were standing there applauding what he was doing.<br /><br /><b>[Green believes that <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Hudson-Odoi</a> is now destined to reach the very top of the game]</b> He has got such a brilliant mind and he is so confident. When he goes out there he will try things and he will try it on the biggest stage. He will do something and you will ask him: ‘When have you done that? Why did you do that?’. He would say ‘because I’ve never done it before and I thought I’d try it’. You knew from the way he spoke and the way he is around the lads, the way he holds himself and obviously his ability, he is going to be at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for as long as he wants to be and then, maybe, on to greater things</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> goalkeeper Rob Green says he earned praise from his team-mates after calling out <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> for having no plan B during his reign at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>]</b> The lads put their hands up and said, ‘We care a lot’ but they spoke without saying very much. I was thinking to myself: ‘I can’t have this’.<br /><br />I turned to <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> and said: ‘Look, you are in a really difficult position and I understand that because there is stuff going on at this club that I can see, you can see and no one on the outside can see, so I get you,’ but all the while I was thinking, ‘I’m going to give him both barrels in a minute’.<br /><br />I just spelled it out. I told him: ‘You have no plan B. You’re a transactional kind of manager. The players in the group are not the kind to speak to you like this - they care very much but are scared to say something to you, like I am. I don’t care because what are you going to do - drop me!?’<br /><br />I spoke for 15 minutes. A lot of players said afterwards that they enjoyed me saying that: ‘You said what I wanted to say but I couldn’t say it’. Obviously, if they had, it could have affected their place in the team or their future at the club.<br /><br />Two of the assistant coaches, <a href="gianfranco-zola.html">Gianfranco Zola</a> and <a href="carlo-cudicini.html">Carlo Cudicini</a>, said something along the lines of: ‘That was brilliant. We’ve been trying but we are in a compromised position as well in that it is a very hierarchical style and there isn’t a lot of feedback coming in return.’</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Green says <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> will have something to prove should he return to <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>]</b> It would be an interesting choice to bring <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> back - a bit like <a href="nigel-pearson.html">Nigel Pearson</a> <b>[at <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>]</b> - he has something to prove. He has had a number of positions where it didn’t go so well. He might come into it with a newfound resolution or a new lease of life. Maybe it will be a short-term appointment to the end of the season where if he does keep them up you say: ‘Here’s a big bonus and see you later’<br /><br /><b>[Green thinks some big names would be interested in managing the club]</b> I am sure if you say to the <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> fans we need someone to see us through to keep us in the division, it’s a tough call. There are big names out there. <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> is a shout, <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafa Benitez</a> has said he is not coming back from China.

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> goalkeeper Robert Green admits <a href="kepa-arrizabalaga.html">Kepa Arrizabalaga</a> has an arrogant side]</b> It’s been a funny season for him, hasn’t it? I think when you’re playing so many games as a keeper, the fluctuations are going to be there. What he’s got <b>[in his favour]</b> … he’s got fantastic feet, a lot of power. He has big thighs, a lot of muscle and that gives him a big spring. He is very fast as well, comes with a lot of speed<br /><br />As a person he’s a really nice lad, and he’s got a fantastic attitude. He does have this side of him which is arrogant, or certainly very confident in his own ability. It’s that fine line and he has that. He carries the fact that he is the most expensive keeper in the world with him. There is that edge to him in training. We used to have these races. I was the slowest by a long, long way. He was so much quicker than all the keepers, but he still had to cheat (and get a head start). He would have won anyway, but he still had to cheat. I would cheat just to keep up<br /><br />Another thing he’d do in training is suddenly he will stop and say, ‘We’ve done all that. OK. Now I want this particular drill. This is what I need. It was fair enough. He is the one out on the pitch. But it shows a strength of character to speak up like that</p>

  <p><b>[Robert Green says <a href="kepa-arrizabalaga.html">Kepa Arrizabalaga</a> knows he cannot outlast <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> We’re saying <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a> is one for the future, he’s 23, Kepa is 25, it’s not like he’s a million miles away. But because of that price tag, you’re expecting that bit more. That’s the immediate assumption, he’s not the finished article, that was never the case with Kepa. It was going to happen at some point. You walk off the plane on a Friday afternoon from Belarus or somewhere and you’ve got to play again on the Sunday lunchtime. It’s so draining, it’s so hard and it’s the first time he’s done that. This year, it’s the Champions League and the pressure is even greater. Maybe the more open style they’re playing is dragging into that and they haven’t been at tight as last season. It’s funny at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It’s not the most transparent in terms of the signings it’s making. The manager doesn’t always make the decisions. I don’t think <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> knew who I was when I signed, let alone approve the signature. You look at that but who is making the decisions? Maybe with <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a>, the communications might be better. You talk about timing, those couple of games he had coming back, he got man of the match against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup. If he hadn’t have come back with those games, I think this might have been something where you say ‘yeah this is a real possibility’. Who Frank is speaking to is another big thing and what their opinion is. They are going to stick with Frank and there is a lot of players with long-term contracts who say ‘I’m going to outlast the manager’ - I don’t think any of the players will be thinking that about Frank.</p>

He was absolutely destroyed at the start and now it’s one of the best things that’s happened to him in the last decade<br /><br />Kepa’s brilliant with his feet. It’s one of those ones where he was always going to have a little downturn in form because he played so many games (54) last season. But he had that little spell out of the team this season and then came back in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and got man of the match against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, which might have done him a favour, just mentally. I think because of the price tag the expectation has been far greater. Everyone’s been waxing lyrical about <b>[Dean]</b> Henderson at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, Kepa’s not that much older than him <b>[23]</b>. But because there’s this huge price tag on his shoulders, you’re thinking that he’s the finished article. I wasn’t the finished article at 25 as a goalkeeper and I don’t think Kepa is either</p>
