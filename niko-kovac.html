Also, since we don’t have strong economy, sport is the way to make money, even to find your happiness abroad. That gives young athletes an inner drive <b>[to succeed]</b>.<br /><br />The structure here cannot be compared to somewhere like Germany. But sport in school is very important in Croatia. There are football, basketball and handball pitches at every playground, in every schoolyard<br /><br />We are a very passionate, emotional people, with very strong patriotic feelings. When you put on a national team jersey, it gives you extra strength. And to see how happy, united and proud people are back home gives you incredible strength and motivation. Playing in a big game for your club doesn’t compare to playing for Croatia<br /><br />In Croatia, as in Latin America, you still have kids playing in the street, where you want to make fun of your opponent, dribble, create something spectacular. You do not see that in Germany</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern boss Kovac calls for tougher refereeing after Rafinha &amp; Corentin Tolisso injuries]</b> I’ve always been someone who said that football is a contact sport. It’s part of it, but you also have to watch out for the health of the players. When it comes down to the bones or joints, you have to find sanctions much earlier - be it yellow cards or more, it cannot be that we’re losing players all the time. I’m talking about Bayern Munich, but there are other clubs, too, of course. There really has to be consideration for the players.<br /><br />Of course I am very sad, disappointed and sad. Tolisso will be out for a long time, Rafinha returns a little faster. We have a very small squad and now two players are seriously injured and Rafinha is injured as well. Now we have to complete the upcoming games with a reduced number of players. This is annoying, of course. But we must not complain now, because we have the quality to do it nevertheless</p>

  <p><b>[Niko Kovac is ready to embrace the pressure of guiding Bayern Munich into the Champions League]</b> First, I’m looking forward to it, because the Champions League is the highest level. Every single player, every single club and every single coach wants to be there. Now we are there, I am also there. The expectation in Munich is always high, this expectation I have towards myself personally and to my players. I was aware of that when I signed with Bayern<br /><br />I also have to say that the group we’ve been drawn into is very attractive but not easy. Many say Bayern Munich are the favourites and we are the favourites, definitely in theory, but you never know what happens in reality. It is interesting. We will go to Lisbon now, where Benfica, like Bayern, are their country’s record champions. Ajax I would also say are record champions. AEK Athens aren’t Greece’s record champions, because that’s Olympiakos. These are very interesting opponents and it is very difficult to play against them. That’s why we have to be on guard and cannot afford to lose concentration there. The first game in the group stage is important, as with any World Cup or European Championship. The first game takes the pressure away or gives the pressure. That is why we want to put in a good performance in Lisbon and get a good result in order to make sure there is not as much pressure on the remaining five games<br /><br />I am glad that the core of the squad stayed together. There have been three departures, with Rudy, Vidal and Bernat, but the majority of the team has been playing together for several years, Franck Ribery has been here for 10 years and Arjen Robben has been here for quite some time. That’s an advantage. The structure stands, the processes stand. This, for a coach like I am - many say that I am a young coach, even though I have coached for 10 years now - is beneficial, when you come to such a big club and have pretty good resources, which you can then use. The way it is, it is good. We will certainly step by step - as the club always does - try to improve and strengthen, with younger players and of course, bring the necessary quality. The quality, as Otto Rehhagel said, is on the pitch and it is ‘only about being good or bad and not about being young or old.’ I agree with him</p>

  <p><b>[What Ronaldo and Real Madrid have achieved is unique]</b> Yes, Real Madrid have won the title three times in a row which is unique. I do not know if that will happen again in the near future. Real Madrid without Cristiano Ronaldo are of course not what they were with Ronaldo, but they’re still a very good team. It’s great to win the Champions League three times but you also have to remember that they only won La Liga once during those three years. Barcelona won the title twice, so you can’t have everything. To perform well in all three competitions is very difficult. But I am convinced that Real Madrid will play a big role again.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on who he considers to be the finest performers on the planet]</b> Everyone has their own taste and you can argue about taste. Of course, the attacking players get the attention because they score the goals, score nice goals and those are the moments that remain in memory. But I wish that other players who are not in the foreground, who still perform well for their club or association, get more recognition. I have to say that for me Lionel Messi is the best in the world, that was already a few years ago and it will continue to be so in the future. Ronaldo is also a world-class player. With him, I am impressed by the way the man stands. This is not innate…but also trained. A lot of players are naturally talented, but you also have to work to improve yourself. That’s what Ronaldo did in a fantastic way. Mohamed Salah was really good last year, Luka Modric has done very well, but plays in a very different position. But the further you go backwards in terms of position, the less you get into the limelight. There is <b>[Kylian]</b> Mbappe and many others that I probably forget now, but you can name a lot here. Football has developed very well. Individual class ultimately also decides the games</p>

We will not question everything and turn everything. We need that little bit of luck. The mood is positive. We also want and have to be positive. The passion is there.

We must now continue with our planning and reflect about how we want to set ourselves up for the new season. We must not lie to ourselves. It’s not by accident that three German clubs are eliminated by three English clubs. For the top stars, it’s just more appealing to go to the Premier League than to Bundesliga.<br /><br />If we want to make up for this, we must identify young and talented players early on.

And yet, they didn’t manage to control the game to the end like they should. The way it is in <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and all other leagues, too.<br /><br />I’m satisfied with the morale the team has shown, with one player down, to come back and go up 4-2, and win it 5-4 in the end. That shows we have a lot of quality. But one thing is for sure and I said it time and again, including at half-time, before the game, during the game, we have to be more compact. Being compact is the very basis for being able to play forward.<br /><br />But when you concede four goals, I can’t remember someone winning 5-4 in recent history, somebody should check the history books. So, I’m saying, you cannot concede four goals, with all due respect to Heidenheim, that can’t happen.<br /><br />No matter if it’s the second league, third league, fifth league or first league. That can’t happen. That’s what upsets me, but we won’t play two games like this one within a week. You can be sure of that.</p>

If you look at the games from the last few weeks, it’s always close games where we only are one goal in front at the end. It’s not so easy to get out of the game in a relaxed way. We can still improve, we have to improve. We have to do the little things better. We shouldn’t have to make so many mistakes in the construction and acceptance of the ball. We have to make better decisions at the end of the goal and at the lead with the ball. We can do that even better. That’s why I’m happy, but not absolutely happy</p>
