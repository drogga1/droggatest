  <p><b>[Coach Niko Kovac was also frustrated with the defending on show from Bayern despite his side showing character to fight back with 10 men]</b> I’m very upset, because we have many international players, many players who have achieved so much, who play on a very high level in international competitions. And yet, they didn’t manage to control the game to the end like they should. The way it is in <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and all other leagues, too.<br /><br />I’m satisfied with the morale the team has shown, with one player down, to come back and go up 4-2, and win it 5-4 in the end. That shows we have a lot of quality. But one thing is for sure and I said it time and again, including at half-time, before the game, during the game, we have to be more compact. Being compact is the very basis for being able to play forward.<br /><br />But when you concede four goals, I can’t remember someone winning 5-4 in recent history, somebody should check the history books. So, I’m saying, you cannot concede four goals, with all due respect to Heidenheim, that can’t happen.<br /><br />No matter if it’s the second league, third league, fifth league or first league. That can’t happen. That’s what upsets me, but we won’t play two games like this one within a week. You can be sure of that.</p>

  <p><b>[Kovac backs Bayern to claim title against his former club]</b> I have always said that I am a friend of VAR. As it turned out, it was probably a very slight offside. For me, the only question in these situations is: when is the stop button pressed? If I do it too late, then it can be offside and if I press too early, then it is not offside.<br /><br />I think you have to hit this point to one hundredth of a second exactly and I don’t know if that’s possible. But it was offside, and I don’t want to discuss that at all<br /><br />We have the chance to become champions next week with a point or a victory. Life writes the best stories. I can play against my old club and can try to win the championship. Although, I know Frankfurt have goals in them and they also want to enter European competition, not only in the Europa League but also in the Champions League. It won’t be easy</p>

Niklas Sule did a great job, he is a starter of the <b>[Germany]</b> national team and with Lucas we bought a player that we want to play centre-back. That doesn’t mean anything. Competition means the best player will play. In that case, Mats wanted to avoid that. We accept that and the result is that he plays for BVB now</p>
