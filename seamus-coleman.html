  <p><b>[Seamus Coleman says that the focus now turns to winning the next game after the Republic of Ireland secured six points from six against Gibraltar and Georgia in Euro 2016 qualifying Group D]</b> We’re going to win our next game and win the game after that, that’s what we’re looking at. All I want to do is win the next game and go from there. It has been a great week. How tight the group is, it just turned around in our favour. Scotland didnt have the best week and we had a great week and we’re delighted with the turn of fortune. There’s a great buzz <b>[in the dressing room]</b>. There was a great buzz on Friday night too <b>[after the Gibraltar win]</b>. We’re happy with how the week went. We wanted six points this week and we go into the next games <b>[against Poland and Germany]</b> fully focused, fully concentrate. We’ve done nothing yet.<br /><br /><b>[On Jonathan Walters]</b> Jonny <b>[Walters]</b> is different class. He’s someone you’d want in your team every week. You can see the attitude he has and we’re happy to have him.</p>

  <p><b>[Seamus Coleman believes the Republic of Ireland let themselves down after they lost out on an automatic qualifying spot for Euro 2016 to Poland]</b> We are all disappointed after doing brilliantly against Germany in the last match. We let ourselves down. We had the confidence and expected to win.<br /><br />We have a big month now in November and we have to get going again. For periods of the group we would have snatched your hand off for a play-off place</p>

  <p><b>[Everton defender Seamus Coleman has sought to distance himself from the latest round of rumours suggesting that he is a transfer target for Manchester United]</b> It is that time of year. I haven’t heard about the story. I am preparing for a game on Wednesday and that is all I am concentrating on.<br /><br />We have been playing well recently. We got off to a decent start - then it was a tricky spell - when the top six pulled away in that period. We have been left to play catch-up on them. We want to stay in touch. As a player, as a team, you want to look up, rather than down. The top six are difficult to compete with, because of the money they have, the number of talented players within their squads, but we have to try and hold onto their tails. We are five points off. We have to believe<br /><br /><b>[On Darron Gibson]</b> Darron is a very talented footballer. His passing range is right up there with the very best. If he is getting plenty of games and regular football, I wouldn’t be surprised at all</p>

  <p><b>[Seamus Coleman compared Bale’s position in Chris Coleman’s side to Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s for Sweden at the European]</b> He is a player from I really enjoy watching and you want to see him do well, but not this week. You can’t get too bogged down with one player. We had the same experience in the summer with Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Wales have a lot of good players. We can’t just focus on Gareth Bale. As professionals we can’t look at it like that</p>

  <p><b>[Ireland Prime Minister Enda Kenny has slammed the horrific tackle from Neil Taylor that left Seamus Coleman with a broken leg]</b> I thought it was a horrific tackle, a compound fracture, of the Irish captain. It’s a very, very bad blow for Seamus Coleman. I hope the surgeons can mend that in a way that he can continue to play again, which is obviously a great challenge for him. It’s not usual to find that level of ferocity in tackles in the beautiful game these days, so good luck to Seamus in his recovery.</p>

  <p><b>[On Seamus Coleman’s injury. Martin O’Neill said]</b> Seamus suffered a serious leg injury and has undergone surgery. He has had an exceptional season with both club and country, and he will be a big loss. But Seamus is so mentally strong that when he has fully recovered he will be as brilliant as before.</p>

  <p><b>[Seamus Coleman has been handed a boost in his rehabilitation from a broken leg by signing a new five-year contract at Everton]</b> I’m delighted to get this signed. I’ve been here for a long time and it’s a special club that means a lot to me. Everything had been agreed and I was due to sign it after the international break but unfortunately I got the injury. The chairman messaged me the night of my injury and said, ‘Don’t worry about it because when you come back this contract is still waiting for you’. That sums up what the chairman and this club is all about.<br /><br />Farhad Moshiri also sent me cards and said the support was always going to be there. I’m delighted with how the club has handled the situation. Knowing that I was going to come back and sign it has definitely helped things. It’s a massive boost and gives me something to fight for. I want to prove my worth when I come back and show the club were right for rewarding me with this long-term contract<br /><br />It’s a case of not doing too much too soon - it’s just baby steps at the moment - but I am getting on well so far. I’m starting to put more weight through the leg and I have got no pain. I’m back doing a good bit in the gym and in the pool. I’m doing exercise every day, so the recovery has well and truly started. I’m really looking forward to putting on that blue shirt again</p>

  <p><b>[Seamus Coleman has lauded <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a>’s influence in the first week of his tenure as <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> manager]</b> He’s a manager who, when he speaks, you listen. When he walks into a room, you perk up. He’s made a few tweaks and I think our performance today deserved the three points. Me, as a player, I listen and learn from every manager and respect them wholeheartedly, but a manager with his track record, what he’s done in the game…as a club we should be very proud. We should embrace it as players, soak it all up and learn from the best. And hopefully this can really kick us on<br /><br /><b>[<a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> made a tactical tweak in his first game in charge, using Coleman as a right-sided centre-back in a fluid back three]</b> I enjoyed it. It was something the manager worked on during the week - when we have the ball to drop into a back three. I was happy to do it. We did it for a few days in training and I really enjoyed it actually<br /><br /><b>[Coleman was also keen to praise <a href="duncan-ferguson.html">Duncan Ferguson</a> for his work as interim manager]</b> The atmosphere was great today and I think we have to thank Duncan for that as well. He got the spirit back a little bit after a disappointing start to the season. He lifted the place, lifted the crowd and then, obviously, when the crowd are feeling good and they see <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> coming out today it’s a massive boost and it was set up for us to win today. But we still had to go out and do it and <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> are a good side and doing well for themselves. But I think momentum’s been building from the few games that Duncan had, so we’ll rest up, get ready to go again and hopefully it will be another three points <b>[at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> on Saturday]</b> and we can keep climbing that table</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> captain Seamus Coleman reveals extent of safety precautions as <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs resume training]</b> Even getting the kit ready on Tuesday night, you are excited to get back to work. It’s probably the longest I’ve been away from Finch Farm. Driving through the gates was a great feeling but it’s definitely a little bit different. The club has taken all the precautions needed. We were in in small groups and it felt very safe. They told us that would be the case but when you got there, you could see the work that has been put in to make it as safe as possible. It is serious, we have to do things properly. We are in there together and it is important we are living our lives right outside the place to make sure you do not endanger anyone. The ideal scenario is we get back playing <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football and to do that, as players, we need to make sure we are doing everything right. The club made sure of that by telling us the rules and regulations. We couldn’t wait to get on the training pitch and it was nice to see some of the lads again and get back out there training. It is up to us as players now to stick to the rules at the club and do what is asked of us. There are measurements to tell us how far to stay apart and a one-way system around the building, so you are not crossing paths with people. It feels as safe as it possibly can and, hopefully, we can move to phase two as quickly and safely as possible<br /><br />I was with Bainesy (Leighton Baines), Yerry <b>[Mina]</b> and Michael <b>[Keane]</b> and one of the other groups also had four defenders. It wasn’t a very, very hard session, more easing us back in to make sure there were no injuries. There were passing drills and strides and dribbling circuits and we finished with playing out from the back. We had the manager, Davide <b>[<a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a>]</b> and Duncan <b>[Ferguson]</b> for the football element. You can still get the work in, it was a very good session and we were in and out as quickly as possible. It was enjoyable and I was happy to get a ball at my feet again. We all have to go back to work and we are happy to do that, but I am sure there are people with nerves as well. It’s such a strange time in the world, I don’t think anyone could have predicted something like this. Your first concern is your family</p>

  <p><b>[Seamus Coleman blasts <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s desire, commitment and attitude]</b> It was shocking, really, really bad. No hiding places. They were better all over the pitch. We need to ask some serious questions of ourselves. We can all play bad, misplace passes but when the attitude isn’t there and the desire isn’t there. We got beaten by the better team.<br /><br />Maybe we’re not where we think are - we’re 11th in the table for a reason. As individuals and as a club we expect better. We need to dig in - myself included - as that won’t be good enough for this manager. And is most certainly not good enough for this football club with the way I’ve been brought up through this football club<br /><br />Quality-wise we’ve got good players but the attitude and desire wasn’t there today. We need to have more commitment on daily basis and really come together. That won’t be good enough for this manager. If we’re not giving our all then that will be that, see you later. He’s not going to put up with performances like this. As a team we need to be better. And ask ourselves if we’re good enough to play for this football club. He’s a top manager. We can’t keep hiding behind managers. We’ve hid behind managers for long enough</p>
