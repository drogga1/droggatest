  <p><b>[Seamus Coleman has lauded <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a>’s influence in the first week of his tenure as <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> manager]</b> He’s a manager who, when he speaks, you listen. When he walks into a room, you perk up. He’s made a few tweaks and I think our performance today deserved the three points. Me, as a player, I listen and learn from every manager and respect them wholeheartedly, but a manager with his track record, what he’s done in the game…as a club we should be very proud. We should embrace it as players, soak it all up and learn from the best. And hopefully this can really kick us on<br /><br /><b>[Ancelotti made a tactical tweak in his first game in charge, using Coleman as a right-sided centre-back in a fluid back three]</b> I enjoyed it. It was something the manager worked on during the week - when we have the ball to drop into a back three. I was happy to do it. We did it for a few days in training and I really enjoyed it actually<br /><br /><b>[Coleman was also keen to praise <a href="duncan-ferguson.html">Duncan Ferguson</a> for his work as interim manager]</b> The atmosphere was great today and I think we have to thank Duncan for that as well. He got the spirit back a little bit after a disappointing start to the season. He lifted the place, lifted the crowd and then, obviously, when the crowd are feeling good and they see <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> coming out today it’s a massive boost and it was set up for us to win today. But we still had to go out and do it and <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> are a good side and doing well for themselves. But I think momentum’s been building from the few games that Duncan had, so we’ll rest up, get ready to go again and hopefully it will be another three points <b>[at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> on Saturday]</b> and we can keep climbing that table</p>

  <p><b>[Everton captain Seamus Coleman reveals extent of safety precautions as <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs resume training]</b> Even getting the kit ready on Tuesday night, you are excited to get back to work. It’s probably the longest I’ve been away from Finch Farm. Driving through the gates was a great feeling but it’s definitely a little bit different. The club has taken all the precautions needed. We were in in small groups and it felt very safe. They told us that would be the case but when you got there, you could see the work that has been put in to make it as safe as possible. It is serious, we have to do things properly. We are in there together and it is important we are living our lives right outside the place to make sure you do not endanger anyone. The ideal scenario is we get back playing <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> football and to do that, as players, we need to make sure we are doing everything right. The club made sure of that by telling us the rules and regulations. We couldn’t wait to get on the training pitch and it was nice to see some of the lads again and get back out there training. It is up to us as players now to stick to the rules at the club and do what is asked of us. There are measurements to tell us how far to stay apart and a one-way system around the building, so you are not crossing paths with people. It feels as safe as it possibly can and, hopefully, we can move to phase two as quickly and safely as possible<br /><br />I was with Bainesy (Leighton Baines), Yerry <b>[Mina]</b> and Michael <b>[Keane]</b> and one of the other groups also had four defenders. It wasn’t a very, very hard session, more easing us back in to make sure there were no injuries. There were passing drills and strides and dribbling circuits and we finished with playing out from the back. We had the manager, Davide <b>[Ancelotti]</b> and Duncan <b>[Ferguson]</b> for the football element. You can still get the work in, it was a very good session and we were in and out as quickly as possible. It was enjoyable and I was happy to get a ball at my feet again. We all have to go back to work and we are happy to do that, but I am sure there are people with nerves as well. It’s such a strange time in the world, I don’t think anyone could have predicted something like this. Your first concern is your family</p>

  <p><b>[Seamus Coleman blasts <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s desire, commitment and attitude]</b> It was shocking, really, really bad. No hiding places. They were better all over the pitch. We need to ask some serious questions of ourselves. We can all play bad, misplace passes but when the attitude isn’t there and the desire isn’t there. We got beaten by the better team.<br /><br />Maybe we’re not where we think are - we’re 11th in the table for a reason. As individuals and as a club we expect better. We need to dig in - myself included - as that won’t be good enough for this manager. And is most certainly not good enough for this football club with the way I’ve been brought up through this football club<br /><br />Quality-wise we’ve got good players but the attitude and desire wasn’t there today. We need to have more commitment on daily basis and really come together. That won’t be good enough for this manager. If we’re not giving our all then that will be that, see you later. He’s not going to put up with performances like this. As a team we need to be better. And ask ourselves if we’re good enough to play for this football club. He’s a top manager. We can’t keep hiding behind managers. We’ve hid behind managers for long enough</p>
