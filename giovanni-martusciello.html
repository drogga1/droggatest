  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> (1) vs (0) <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a>. Giovanni Martusciello said <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> was very happy with Saturday’s win over <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> after speaking to the absent head coach before, during and after the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> opener]</b> We spoke to <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> many times in the morning. Clearly for him it’s quite difficult to stay away from the team and therefore he wanted to know whatever was happening, the conditions of the lads, how they were living the beginning of the league. And we also spoke to him before the game, during the break and at the end of the game. He was very happy for the result, but a bit angry as well because he is a perfectionist. When something doesn’t go in the direction he wants, clearly he gets a bit angry. He was happy of what the lads did in the first half and above all he was super happy of how the team dealt with the moment of suffering in the game. I mean that when <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> played more aggressively, and we were struggling physically, the team resisted among the difficulties and that’s not a trait of many teams<br /><br /><b>[<a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> played 83 minutes, while <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> was an unused substitute]</b> Let’s say that we made a clear consideration: to avoid putting players - in this context, first game against a very well organised team like <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> - to put players where they were used to playing, in their usual roles. The choice about <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> and <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> goes in that direction. He’s a player that is born as a central striker, and so we went in that direction. That doesn’t mean that in the future <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> won’t be the central striker. Here we have to deal with many top players, we have to make choices and those choices are part of the coach’s job and we have to put 11 on the pitch. But today’s choice was only inspired by a ‘solidity of habits’</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> will miss out when his new side <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> host his former employers <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> on Saturday]</b> He is good. <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> has always been present at the club even without directing training. We have the final training session in the afternoon and then we will see if he is able to make it tomorrow<br /><br /><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> were linked with Paolo <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> as part of a deal that would have taken <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> to <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a>, but the two clubs were unable to agree a deal. Martusciello admitted Paolo <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> was frustrated by his omission but insisted his attitude is not in question]</b> <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> is an extraordinary player. He is focused despite all the talk. He is very motivated and a level-headed person. Not playing from the beginning upset him but it is part of the rules to be respected: you play with 11 and we have a squad of 27. They are all of an equal level except for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, so you have to make specific choices. We are happy to have selection problems</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> (4) vs (3) <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> assistant Giovanni Martusciello said the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> champions never give up after Saturday’s stunning 4-3 win over Scudetto rivals <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>]</b> We saw a physical dip after the hour mark and it was tough against a side like <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> who pass it so well, but we also got distracted and should’ve made more of the situation when 3-0 up. You can concede goals, but not three in 16 minutes. Perhaps we felt sated by going 3-0 up and allowed <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> to bite back. When there are errors of positioning and then reaction, you’re going to concede goals against players of this quality. I want to focus on the very positive performance in the first hour, but some fear set in after they got back into it. I’ve been here for around a month and even in the pre-season friendlies I was amazed by the way this squad does not give up. They gave their all and kept going to achieve something from the game and it is a remarkable trait<br /><br /><b>[De Ligt was an unused substitute in <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>’s opener. He, though, was not completely convincing]</b> De Ligt is still a little bit behind in terms of learning the movements and being part of the defensive unit. He has arrived in a difficult league like <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> from a very different team, but he has a great deal of quality, is very intelligent and will learn quickly. He had a very good hour too, so he’s getting there. We had hoped for more time to get him settled, but unfortunately <a href="giorgio-chiellini.html">Giorgio Chiellini</a> had that serious injury and changed the plans</p>
