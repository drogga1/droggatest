  <p><b>[Delhi Dynamos sign Brazilian midfielder Paulinho Dias]</b> I’m very excited to welcome Paulinho to the club! This is a player, coach Portugal immediately identified when he came aboard and I’m sure he can be a defensive anchor in our midfield. He will make his mark in the ISL like the other Atletico Paranaense players who came before him!.</p>

  <p><b>[Delhi Dynamos FC sign Venezuelan defender Gabriel Alejandro Cichero]</b> Gabriel is a player who will bring a lot of experience and leadership to the Delhi Dynamos this year. He has represented Venezuela numerous times and has played in extremely high profile tournaments. This shows the quality of player Gabriel is and his ability to go up against some of the world’s best. Gabriel is going to be a tenacious defender for the Lions this year and I can’t wait to see the havoc he will inflict on opposing teams.</p>

  <p><b>[Delhi Dynamos sign Nigerian forward Kalu Uche]</b> I am happy to welcome Kalu to the Delhi Dynamos squad this year. Kalu brings a lot of experience to the team having played for Nigerian national team, has had over 175 appearances for Almeria, as well as having played in the ISL in 2015. He will bring toughness both mentally and physically to the team and I look forward to seeing him make a mark on the ISL this year.</p>

  <p><b>[Delhi Dynamos sign Spanish full-back Edu Moya and Dutch forward Guyon Fernandez]</b> Guyon Fernandez is going to be a crucial part of our attack this season. He was high on our list during the offseason and I’m happy to have him help lead our attack for this season. Edu Moya meanwhile is an extremely versatile and fit player who can play multiple positions. He is someone who Coach Portugal really liked and believes that he can be a good role model for our younger defenders.</p>

  <p><b>[Delhi Dynamos sign Dutch winger Jeroen Lumu from Turkish side Samsunspor]</b> I can’t express my excitement enough to have Jeroen Lumu be a part of our club this year. He is someone we deeply coveted for a long time and I’m glad we managed to sign him. Lumu has so much potential and has played at a high level in the past. He is going to fit in well with the pace of the team and can be a crucial cog in our side this year.</p>
