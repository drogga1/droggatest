  <p><b>[Why <a href="claudio-lotito.html">Lotito</a> and <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> are even more desperate than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to finish season]</b> Sometimes being a fan also affects scientists and gets to their heads. They are experts who would be much more useful if, instead of concerning themselves with issues like football, found a way to effectively deal with the virus. Scientists are scientists, not fans. It would be really welcome if, instead of fuelling football controversy that isn’t needed, they devoted all their energy to finding a cure or vaccine that can stop the infection<br /><br />There is an anti-Lazio conformity based on prejudice against our club, which forces me to be the voice that stands out from the crowd. All the media move in unison to criticise <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> and club president (Claudio) <a href="claudio-lotito.html">Lotito</a>. Whatever the <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> fans do, they are called nasty and horrible. The prejudice is totally unjustified and I’ve been battling against it for some time. It’s true that I am <a href="claudio-lotito.html">Lotito</a>’s spokesman, but I also express my own views and those of the club as a whole. <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> as a club is 120 years old and deserves more respect<br /><br /><b>[Italian Football Federation (FIGC) <a href="gabriele-gravina.html">Gabriele Gravina</a> has repeatedly insisted that the season will resume but that didn’t stop <a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> spokesperson Diaconale from threatening legal action if its voided]</b> If this campaign does not come to a natural conclusion, the next will be ruined as well, because the matter would end up in the courts and tribunals. I hope the pitch decides who wins, who loses, who goes to heaven and who into hell</p>
