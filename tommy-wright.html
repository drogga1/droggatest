  <p><b>[St Johnstone vs Rangers]</b> I know the idea of revenge is used a lot in football but if we need revenge as motivation then we need to take a look at ourselves. Our focus is all on getting three points and to do that we’re going to have to learn from the game back in September. We created chances which was obviously positive but we were too open and we were punished for it. We’re keen to finish this year strongly before the break so we want to pick up another three points on Sunday and that’s our main focus.</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic vs St Johnstone]</b> It was probably the worst performance in a while. Not a lot come out with credit. To win any game of football you’ve got to compete, we were lacklustre and were dominated for large parts of the game. We got what we deserved. If you can’t do the basics well and pass from A to B you’re not going to win football matches.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Rangers vs St Johnstone]</b> Celtic had every player on it, and we lose because we don’t start the game well. We’ll learn from it, the key thing is that we don’t let three defeats from Celtic in a short space of time affect our season</p>
