<blockquote>
  <p>[Former Prime Minister Tony Blair says he had a dream of merging Scottish and English football to create a British league] I know it sounds a bit strange but I was for a time quite obsessed with the idea that, for example, for football we should be opening up the English league and the Scottish league and having them together. I always thought we should be looking at ways of making sure that people felt a connection. I was looking for ways of making sure that as we in a sense diverged around devolution, that there were elements of convergence and I still think in the future it is important we look for that.<br /><br />Nobody knows as we don’t have a crystal ball, but there is a willingness to embrace the concept of cross-border football. There is an appetite for further cross-border competition including at league level across Europe and we are well positioned, having had this competition up and running. I’d like to think any future cross-border competition would equally enhance and benefit the game for all across the British Isles. We have to be open-minded about where the future takes us</p>
