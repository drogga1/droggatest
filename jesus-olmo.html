  <p><b>[<a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> is the greatest athlete former <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> medical chief Jesus Olmo has seen]</b> Possibly the best athlete I’ve seen is <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>. He’s a natural athlete capable of excelling at practically any sport. He has unusual genetics and athletic ability, and I would say technical ability as well. He’s the one who impressed me most in all aspects, although there is then performance, which comes about from different circumstances<br /><br /><b>[Olmo has suggested that Madrid fans have not seen the best of the star because he has played through injuries]</b> All athletes have their handicaps. People only see when a player is injured, but there are footballers who play when they’ve got physical problems. A good medical team ensure that you have the minimum possible chronic problems, but the only way to overcoming them is by working hard and very well in a target way. That requires effort and depends a lot on the player. Nothing detracts from a high-level athlete’s performance more than chronic pain. Solving a small tendon problem is the best thing you can do for a footballer<br /><br /><b>[Olmo had a reputation of being a fiery character and he admits that he once clashed with <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a>]</b> With Sergio, I had a unique relationship because we had a very great confrontation. He’s a person, like me, who says things to your face. I did things he didn’t consider appropriate, and although I explained them to him, he defended his position with the utmost respect. I didn’t place myself at his command. My judgement must be my own. We had our differences, but from there our professional relationship was very good. We respect each other a lot and he always trusted my judgement with his injuries and did what I told him. I still have a very good relationship with him and he works with professionals very close to me. When I have to give him a hand, I’ll give it to him.</p>
