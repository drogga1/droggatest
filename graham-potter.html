Despite avoiding relegation, Brighton enter the 2019-20 Premier League season with a new manager, having parted ways with Chris Hughton. Former Swansea City boss Graham Potter will take charge of the Seagulls in what is his first Premier League gig and the aim will to be to improve on a 17th-place finish</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton confirm £15m Leandro Trossard signing]</b> We are delighted to welcome Leandro to the club and excited about the impact he can have for us. He’s an attack-minded player who had a very impressive season last year in helping Genk win the league title. He was influential in the side’s success last term and scored a lot of goals, as well as creating chances for others. At 24 he also brings good experience, having captained the side and also featured many times in the Europa League</p>

  <p><b>[Graham Potter, who is preparing for his first season as a coach in the Premier League, added]</b> Adam Webster is a player the club has been aware of for some time, and someone we came up against last season at Swansea City. He is a quality defender, comfortable on the ball, fits the profile of the type of player we want to bring to the club, and he was very keen to join us. He is still relatively young, but has good experience from the number of games he has played. Predominately a centre-half, he can also play at right-back, and he will bring additional competition alongside our existing defensive options</p>

  <p><b>[Graham Potter on Neal Maupay’s signing]</b> Neal is a talented striker, with good strength and pace, and he is a goalscorer. He will add an extra dimension to our existing forward options, and we are delighted to have completed the transfer. The club has been monitoring Neal and has been aware of his ability for some time. Separately I was also aware of his obvious ability at Swansea and came up against him in the Championship last season. His record in the Championship has been exceptional, with 41 goals across the last two seasons, and now his challenge is to transfer that to the Premier League</p>

We had a setback very early in the game which was not what you want but they carried on with great resilience. Congratulations to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> for winning the game and congratulations to our team for doing exactly what we asked them</p>

We know we have to stand up to a good and organised side with threats going forward and good experience all over the pitch. We have to play well, but this group have shown me a competitive nature in all the games so far and I have no concerns about that</p>

I came across him last season and was really impressed. He’s got so much experience and his career speaks for itself, he has the potential to be a top manager. He’s both articulate and intelligent after being at the highest level. He’s come into a challenging situation at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for a number of reasons, but he’s done really well, and from afar, I have a lot of respect for him. He’s been in the game long enough and will know about both the group and the team. I have no doubt they’ll continue to do well</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton boss Graham Potter had no complaints with the result, conceding that his side were simply outplayed]</b> They deserved to win the game, if you make any mistake they can turn defence into attack so quickly. The players gave their best, but sometimes you have to accept you are playing against a better team. We had a decent period in the league and now we need to get ready for another tough match. I’m delighted for him (James), probably this time last year he wasn’t playing this regularly for <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a>. But he’s a great lad, his sprinting ability is sensational, he’s so brave and he’ll get better and better with his final ball and execution</p>

He’s on loan now at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> and having a positive experience, and we’re delighted with that. But we’re looking forward to having him back at the right time and we’ll go from there. He’s our player, he’s contracted with us.<br /><br />He’s having a good time at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, so we’ll assess at the end of the season to see what the best thing is going forward. Unless there is a real push for it we won’t call him back. He’s having a positive time at <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> and we are well covered in that position. So, we’ll carry on with that process I think.<br /><br />As a coaching team we were aware of him when I was at <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a>, we were one of the clubs who would have tried to get him on loan if I was still there. So I know his quality. He had a loan spell at Newport and we tracked his progress for quite some time. He’s a player we like. If you see the way he plays, he’s a player who fits our way. We want to see him playing for Brighton in future.</p>

It’ll be a good atmosphere, a hostile atmosphere, something we’re going to have to deal with. We’re going to look forward to it.</p>

Ultimately, Glenn decides really in that respect but hopefully he wants to stay here and be a part of what we are doing. He has been great for us</p>

He has to focus on that, focus on carrying on playing football and I have to carry on helping him. Whatever happens in May happens.<br /><br />I’ll not have the sole decision because I wouldn’t like it that way but certainly as a coach you say, ‘This player has done well’ or ‘That player has not’. In consultation with everybody else I will have an opinion at the end of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Graham Potter says late win against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> shows importance of whole Brighton squad in relegation battle]</b> Everybody wants to start the game, but often - especially if you look at the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> game - for us the guys who finish the game are so important and they have to be ready whether it’s for 30 minutes or whether it for three minutes. You saw the contribution <b>[Aaron Connolly]</b> makes. He’s not on the pitch very long but he makes a key pass and we get the winning goal. The players know that and they know the situation we’re in. They’ve been really professional and they’re ready to help the team. It’s not about the best 11 players starting every game because that can be impossible, it’s just making sure that you’re ready to play and help - however long that is.<br /><br /><b>[I hope Ole doesn’t enjoy first Amex visit too much]</b> We don’t think about it in that regard, you can go a little bit crazy thinking about how many points you may or may not need and then you forget about the fact that you’ve got to play football. We’re playing against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, one of the form teams if not the form team in the competition. We have to focus on the next game, which is them, and do everything we can to pick up points - that’s what we will try to do until the end of the season.<br /><br /><b>[Manchester United have never won at the Amex Stadium before, but Potter says that will count for nothing when it comes to this week’s game]</b> History is fine but it doesn’t necessarily do too much for present. We can’t just turn around and say to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> ‘You haven’t won here so therefore we can take the three points thank you very much’. If only it was that simple! It’s a shame that he didn’t get to see it with the Amex crowd because I think they can be very vocal, especially in those types of games where you’re quite noticeably the underdog. It’s a shame that he will miss that but again we know why that is. Hopefully he doesn’t enjoy it too much!</p>

Over the course of the game, we gave a really good account of ourselves, especially going 2-0 down in the manner that we did. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> smelt blood, if you like, because we gifted them a couple of goals so we showed great personality to drag ourselves back into the game<br /><br />We created some chances before we scored a really good goal so we put a lot into that game and there’s a lot of positives for us.

  <p><b>[Graham Potter: Brighton can learn from mistakes made against Liverpool]</b> I can understand his points. It’s not the first time I’ve heard that. The challenge is for us to be better at recognising situations. You look at the opposition we are playing against and however you play against them they’ve got a solution. The evidence is with the points they’ve got this year, the points they got last year. Maybe you can kick it long for 20, 30, 40, 50 minutes and eventually start to play but there’s no solution there either because I’m sure teams have tried that as well. We want to try and improve that aspect of our performance and sometimes how you do that is by making mistakes, by testing yourself against the very best and that’s what we did. But clearly we have to improve as well</p>

And then the quality of the opposition - the three best teams in the country - so of course they are going to test you psychologically and I think it’s just about perspective all the time for us. We still need points, from my perspective. We’re still fighting for those. We’ve got seven points post-lockdown and we have to try to focus on getting as many as we can from the remaining three</p>
