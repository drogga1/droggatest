It is a club that I am very grateful to and this shows my happiness here. I will work much harder to repay the belief shown in me. This is a fantastic club, one of the biggest clubs in the world - and we should be there amongst the other big clubs. This is a football club with great players and great technical staff. It has everything to achieve great things in future. Since we <b>[his family]</b> arrived here we were welcomed with open arms by everyone. We feel at home in this city, we feel a part of this city. It is a very important day for me, my wife and my daughter. I am happy - and everyone is happy at home!<br /><br /><b>[When asked about his targets over the course of his new deal]</b> Titles, I think that is very important. When I say titles, I mean leagues - and this is one of the best leagues in the world - but also the Champions League and fighting with the best teams in Europe. That is my aim - it is the aim of everyone at this football club to be up there. Every player, every staff member at this club. This is what we are searching for</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho has insisted he is not interested in joining Barcelona]</b> I believe in finding somewhere you can express yourself, play without fear, play with everything you have. When you find that place, stay. This club, Liverpool, it has a plan: to be back on the top, and that’s what I believe in. I want to be part of that. From the owner, the manager, my team-mates. There is nothing that stops us competing with the big clubs. Clubs in England. Clubs in Europe. Yes, clubs like Barcelona. Why not? This is a great club. I remember how helpful everyone was when I first came to England, like a family. They made me welcome, comfortable. They removed any obstacles, they allowed me to think first about football and second about football. I remember that. For certain, I am comfortable here, my family is comfortable here. No doubts<br /><br />There are two parts to this decision <b>[to sign]</b>: first the ambition of the club and then my family. They are with me. Every player here is treated well. The club supports us and allows us to focus on the football. Not just me, everyone. Nothing special for me. There is a structure to help. When a new player comes, especially from abroad, they have a team to support the wife, the family. When I go to play, I can concentrate and play. It is professional, professional like a big club<br /><br />No need to wait. I know. I live this every day, I can smell it. I see the ambition of the club, my team-mates, the manager. I am living it, seeing it. Wait to sign? No. No. Now is the right time. I understand what Liverpool means. We can say Dalglish, Rush, Hansen, Souness, Suarez, Gerrard. I’ve been here quite a few years already, it’s not like I am new. I understand. To have signed a new contract at this club, my goal is to be thought of one day in the same way as these players. They are legends. You define the success of a player by his loyalty or his titles. Or both. In order to be part of this group, I have so much to do. I want to win titles. Five years is my new contract… it gives me that opportunity</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho has stressed that his penning of fresh terms at Liverpool was due to a confidence in the future under Jurgen Klopp]</b> I signed a new contract and there was a message. I am happy to sign, and I would like to say it is not about one week, no matter how bad that is, it is about the future with this squad. The club is very ambitious, the players and the manager are all focused. Everyone believes in that, and everyone wants to bounce back at this moment. It has been a bad week, but we are looking beyond that. Of course we believe we can win titles under this manager - we are confident that will happen. Like I said before, I have signed because the manager is a winner, and everyone believes in him. I believe in what he does, and everyone inside the dressing room believes he will take this team to titles - that is why I signed a new contract, and that is what we want to do.</p>

As a team, we played very well and we managed to get to two finals. Unfortunately, we did not win the finals, we lost. That was a very difficult time for us to deal with the defeat <b>[to Sevilla]</b> but this certainly made the group stronger. We started the season very well, at a high level. We all played very well, so, of course, 2016 was a good year. In the end I got injured, I missed a few games at the end of the year, but it was a positive year</p>

It is important for Liverpool to play in these competitions, fighting with the other great teams, and of course we have not given up anything. We expect to give great performances and to accomplish our goals.<br /><br /><b>[We can learn]</b> that we have to be focused from the first minute. We were not 100 per cent focused in the Hull game. I do not know why, sometimes it happens. In the second half, we came back better but, of course, in the Premier League if a team plays a first or second half badly, it becomes complicated. What we have to try to do is the same as we did in the game with Tottenham. That game should serve as an example - <b>[we have to]</b> play well from the first minute</p>

After being knocked out of the Champions League they will be even more focused on the Premier League, so we have to be ready. For us, this match is like a final because we have to beat them to move ahead of them in the table. That’s our aim.<br /><br />The players here are very ambitious and at the start of the season our dream was to win the title. But results have changed things. We are a long way from the top in the league and we are out of the FA Cup too. But our challenge now is to finish second in the table and to make sure we are back in the Champions League next year. We think we have really serious chances to do that. So we know how important this match is. We know what we can do. This is a club which should be in the Champions League and we want to get there</p>

When you’re fighting for these positions in the league, it is fantastic - much better than being at the bottom or middle of the table and fighting not to go down even further. It is a very healthy pressure. All of us see this as a great opportunity for us, so this ends up giving us a feeling of positive pressure. We are all well aware of the work we need to do. As everyone knows, everything is in our hands now, so we need to search for the three points in each of our last three games<br /><br />Liverpool is a huge, great club and it needs to be playing in these competitions. Liverpool deserves a steady place in the Champions League, so we are trying to improve this situation and keep ourselves there, make ourselves a regular in this competition again - and that’s what we’re aiming for<br /><br />Our target is something we wanted from the beginning of the season, we always believed we could be in the top four to play in the Champions League next season. It is a great opportunity for us, but the last three games will be like three finals for our team where we need to win all of them to confirm our position in the league.

At the moment, I am feeling very well - the first couple of days were the most painful. Of course, when you have to come out of such an important game like this one, and when you leave that early, it frustrates you, but thanks to God it was nothing major - just a strong tackle.</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho believes that Liverpool were the architects of their own downfall in their 4-1 thrashing at Tottenham]</b> The goals were goals that could have been prevented. It started out wide and we end up conceding one of those goals the manager speaks about. He speaks a lot about this - we’ve conceded a lot of goals like this. And obviously in attack we were unable to score the goals necessary to draw or turn around the game. We were in the game during the first half then the goal we conceded made everything worse.<br /><br /><b>[Defender Dejan Lovren was substituted after half an hour, with many pinning the blame for Spurs’ first two goals on the Croatian]</b> The first goal started in a wide position where everyone is involved in defending, not just the players right at the back. We have to improve this as quickly as possible in order to win games and fight more. With difficult games like this one, we know it’s these things that decide them. So we need to concentrate more to deal with balls like this.<br /><br />The first goal was scored after four minutes and the second one after 12 or 13. It’s difficult to play away from home against a strong team when you start like that. We have to work hard. Those passages of play, those set pieces from wide positions. We have to concentrate more to deal with them</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho’s personal and professional evolution at Liverpool has been, as per his own estimation, immense]</b> I have become stronger here in every way. When I first came to England, there was so much to adapt to and learn. It was a completely different experience for me, but also a challenging, exciting one. Every year, I’ve felt like I’ve taken more on and become better, more complete and mentally prepared - not only with football but life in general.<br /><br />I have never wanted to settle, because I know that improvement is something that doesn’t stop. There are always new things you can pick up and many ways to develop. I’m happy with how much I’ve grown, but I’m not finished yet.<br /><br />When I arrived, I had only been seen or thought of as a playmaker. But I’ve had the opportunity to work with top professionals, real quality players, and under good managers, which has helped me understand the responsibilities of different positions and what each one requires. I am used to and confident now in many areas of the pitch and it has made me more rounded - I don’t just attack better, I defend better too.<br /><br />It is so hard to break into the Brazil side because there is never a shortage of good players to choose from. No player owns their shirt - you have to continuously work for it. You have to make sure your performances at club level and every time you are called up are always at 100 per cent because the pressure never leaves to keep your spot. I’m representing my country regularly now, which I am very, very proud of and I will do everything to keep my shirt<br /><br />To be honest, I have never stopped to think about the player I wanted to become. I have idols and an idea of success, yes, but I never had a picture in my head of how it should look for me. I guess it’s because I believe there’s always ways to improve myself so there can’t really be a complete picture - it’s always a work in progress. I just aim to be the best version of myself in every aspect, every day</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho is enjoying life in a deep playmaking post at Liverpool]</b> I think playing there is a position where you get to play the ball a great deal. You become more involved in the game. It’s a position that I feel that I’ve adapted to and I like it. Of course, I’m always trying to improve and be able to score goals and set off moves because my position demands that. Last season there were a number of goals and it was the highest that I’ve ever managed. But with each year I try and develop and I hope to improve that. I’d always like to score more goals.<br /><br /><b>[On Jurgen Klopp]</b> He’s helped me a lot. I think the way he’s helped me to play when we don’t have the ball when the team is under pressure is really different. We’ve changed how we play. We’ve tried to switch to a different style and I think that bit by bit I’m getting better with that and hopefully that can continue</p>

But it was hard for them. As they were old, it was difficult for them to learn the language or adapt to a new culture and ways of doing things like I could. Aine had to change her entire routine, my dad had to quit his job which was painful because he loves to be busy.

It is his dream and I am now convinced there is nothing left at our disposal to change his mind. Philippe has made a fantastic contribution to this club over his five years of service and as disappointed as we are he doesn’t want to extend that, the relationship we have for him means with a heavy heart we wish him well. The player remained dedicated and committed to helping us win matches, producing good performances and training hard each day at Melwood after the summer window had closed, despite failing to convince us to allow him to leave during that period and that level of professionalism reflects positively on him.</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho has said Barcelona must be aware of the threat offered by Manchester United’s Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku]</b> It’s complicated to describe what you have to do to win against this team. For a start, Manchester United have a great goalkeeper and huge players in attack. Pogba and Lukaku are capable of hurting any defence and Pogba, in ­particular, is a great player. We will have to be very careful to stop him because he can generate a lot of problems for us and I think the duel with <b>[Gerard]</b> Pique will be important in both matches.<br /><br />United have had some inconsistent results recently, but it’s clear they have improved in every area under <b>[Ole Gunnar]</b> <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>.

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho has revealed his former manager <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> fully supported his summer move to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>]</b> He sent me a message and wished me good luck. He told me that <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> is a big club and the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> is a great competition. He said he is very happy to see me there<br /><br /><b>[He remains a big admirer of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> saying]</b> He is simply an amazing coach, one of the best in the world. He is a true leader. I learned so much from him, especially on a psychological level. He always finds the right words, both before the game and during the game, and he always manages to get you back on track with the next opponent. He changed <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and made them really strong again. It was a big honour to work with him</p>

  <p><b>[Coutinho happy to play with <a href="thomas-muller.html">Muller</a> as Brazilian seeks to replay <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>’s faith]</b> I’ve always said I can play with Thomas. He’s a great player and someone who’s very important for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. He’s got everything, talent and experience, which makes him an essential part of the team. I’ve got my strengths and he’s got his - the only thing that matters is combining them together for Bayern<br /><br />I tried to repay his faith in me. At the moment the team is doing really well at implementing what the coach wants. Pressing without the ball is very important to him. We close the opposition down early and in a structured way, which causes them a lot of problems. We didn’t expect it to be so successful so quickly.<br /><br />The changes <a href="hansi-flick.html">Flick</a> has made are mainly tactical. He places a lot of emphasis on compact, coordinated and, at times, high pressing so that the opposition can’t get into their game at all. Obviously it’s up to us players to execute that on the pitch, but from the very start, we understood what he wants from us and how he ticks, both on the pitch and in the changing room. That’s why things are going well and we’re all happy<br /><br /><b>[Coutinho has also paid homage to prolific <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> striker <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a>, with the Pole having taken his goal tally for 2019-20 to 23]</b> The form he is in right now is incredible. At some point, a game had to come along in which he didn’t score - but reducing his performance to goals wouldn’t do him justice. I’m of the opinion that Lewy was incredibly important for our victory in Dusseldorf. He locks down the opposing lines of defence, runs as the first player back on defence and penetrates deep, which in possession immediately creates space for others</p>

  <p><b>[Coutinho offered a modest reflection on his hat-trick, with the Brazilian claiming that he was fortunate to see fortune favour him on the day]</b> I always try to do my best.

  <p><b>[Coutinho insists he has no regrets over <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> departure]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is flying, and it doesn’t surprise me. We’ve seen it already last year when they won the Champions League, but I’m also not surprised because of their fantastic squad and manager. I am so happy for them, because I have so many friends there, former team-mates, so I’m just so happy for them, but that’s all. I don’t look back. I took another path, and now I am on another journey, much like everyone else. I’m focused entirely - just like them - on reaching my dreams. I’m happy with what I did in the past, and now I can only look forward<br /><br /><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> are now top of the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. Coutinho is confident they can win the treble this season]</b> Of course, we believe we can win it all. We work so hard for it. Just like you work for success at what you do, we equally work so hard. These are the best teams in the world after all, and the Champions League is very hard, but if you work hard, then anything can happen</p>

  <p><b>[Coutinho is presently on the sidelines with an ankle injury, with his expected return slated for the beginning of June]</b> I do not like to say, of course, that there is a lot of speculation. I’m concentrating on this season and will see what happens afterwards. I am very grateful to Leverkusen and I don’t want to mess it up in any way.<br /><br />We’re happy about the win. We put it on ourselves to win here and we did that. We had to really give everything today and I think we deserved to win in the end</p>
