The truth is he is an unpredictable player, he always does new things.<br /><br />Making my Champions League debut was a unique feeling. I was very anxious before the game. Last year I couldn’t play in this competition and I hope that as time goes by I can improve and help the team<br /><br />I hope we can fight for all of the titles and lots of big things. Everything has just begun but we have big objectives and hope to win important things. I hope to help the team every way I can. The fans and all the players really want to win.

  <p><b>[Barcelona star Philippe Coutinho says he and Luis Suarez will only be inspired to play better]</b> If they boo myself and Luis Suarez, then that’s normal at Old Trafford then that’s normal because of the team we used to play for. But it won’t make any difference to me. Even more than that, it is an incentive to play better and be even more focused. I know that games against Manchester United are special, I learned that during my time at Liverpool when we lived it so intensely with the fans. I have that nailed in my memory and, even though this is a different stage, if Barcelona knock United out of Europe if will be a double personal satisfaction for me<br /><br />I know that Liverpool supporters will be with us at United. But they know that later we could see them at Anfield and then, of course, I will be there with Barcelona wanting to win. It would be a dream to play at Anfield again, an explosion of different feelings, I’m sure. But I have to be honest and say I would have preferred to meet Liverpool only in the final itself</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho has said Barcelona must be aware of the threat offered by Manchester United’s Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku]</b> It’s complicated to describe what you have to do to win against this team. For a start, Manchester United have a great goalkeeper and huge players in attack. Pogba and Lukaku are capable of hurting any defence and Pogba, in ­particular, is a great player. We will have to be very careful to stop him because he can generate a lot of problems for us and I think the duel with <b>[Gerard]</b> Pique will be important in both matches.<br /><br />United have had some inconsistent results recently, but it’s clear they have improved in every area under <b>[Ole Gunnar]</b> <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>. For me, the key for both sides is going to be in attack. Whoever wins that battle will be in the semi-final - and I’m ­confident it will be Barca. If we play with our usual character and style, then we can win at Old Trafford<br /><br />Let’s see, I hope it happens, but we have a big game first at Old Trafford. What I can say is that I’m glad that Liverpool are doing well this year and, if the draw had been different, I would have liked to play the Champions League final against them. Klopp is a great coach and it was only a matter of time before he got the team performing the way they are. They are having an incredible season, but so are we - and I am focused first on Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho insists he is happy at Barcelona]</b> My head is exclusively in Barcelona. Returning to England now does not fit into my plans. This is my second season here. I have won titles but I am always an ambitious and demanding player. So, I want more and more. But I’m happy. I wanted to play in Spain and I’m at the best club in Spain.<br /><br /><b>[Barca could still win the treble this term with a Copa del Rey final against Valencia]</b> The tie is tough. They have already shown what they can do by knocking out PSG and I think most people would say the tie is 50-50. Playing at Old Trafford is one of the best feelings a footballer can have. The atmosphere and the history are ­incredible and if, on top of that, you get a positive result, then it’s very special. I don’t have any particular advice for my team-mates because Barcelona are used to playing these big games and to having the second leg at home. Everyone wants to win this tie, not just me. In almost five seasons with Liverpool I had both good and bad results there <b>[Old Trafford]</b>, so I’m not really thinking about the past. I only think about the present and ­knocking United out</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho has revealed his former manager <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> fully supported his summer move to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>]</b> He sent me a message and wished me good luck. He told me that <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> is a big club and the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> is a great competition. He said he is very happy to see me there<br /><br /><b>[He remains a big admirer of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> saying]</b> He is simply an amazing coach, one of the best in the world. He is a true leader. I learned so much from him, especially on a psychological level. He always finds the right words, both before the game and during the game, and he always manages to get you back on track with the next opponent. He changed <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and made them really strong again. It was a big honour to work with him</p>

  <p><b>[Coutinho happy to play with <a href="thomas-muller.html">Muller</a> as Brazilian seeks to replay <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>’s faith]</b> I’ve always said I can play with Thomas. He’s a great player and someone who’s very important for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>. He’s got everything, talent and experience, which makes him an essential part of the team. I’ve got my strengths and he’s got his - the only thing that matters is combining them together for Bayern<br /><br />I tried to repay his faith in me. At the moment the team is doing really well at implementing what the coach wants. Pressing without the ball is very important to him. We close the opposition down early and in a structured way, which causes them a lot of problems. We didn’t expect it to be so successful so quickly.<br /><br />The changes <a href="hansi-flick.html">Flick</a> has made are mainly tactical. He places a lot of emphasis on compact, coordinated and, at times, high pressing so that the opposition can’t get into their game at all. Obviously it’s up to us players to execute that on the pitch, but from the very start, we understood what he wants from us and how he ticks, both on the pitch and in the changing room. That’s why things are going well and we’re all happy<br /><br /><b>[Coutinho has also paid homage to prolific <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> striker <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a>, with the Pole having taken his goal tally for 2019-20 to 23]</b> The form he is in right now is incredible. At some point, a game had to come along in which he didn’t score - but reducing his performance to goals wouldn’t do him justice. I’m of the opinion that Lewy was incredibly important for our victory in Dusseldorf. He locks down the opposing lines of defence, runs as the first player back on defence and penetrates deep, which in possession immediately creates space for others</p>

  <p><b>[Coutinho offered a modest reflection on his hat-trick, with the Brazilian claiming that he was fortunate to see fortune favour him on the day]</b> I always try to do my best.

  <p><b>[Coutinho insists he has no regrets over <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> departure]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is flying, and it doesn’t surprise me. We’ve seen it already last year when they won the Champions League, but I’m also not surprised because of their fantastic squad and manager. I am so happy for them, because I have so many friends there, former team-mates, so I’m just so happy for them, but that’s all. I don’t look back. I took another path, and now I am on another journey, much like everyone else. I’m focused entirely - just like them - on reaching my dreams. I’m happy with what I did in the past, and now I can only look forward<br /><br /><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> are now top of the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. Coutinho is confident they can win the treble this season]</b> Of course, we believe we can win it all. We work so hard for it. Just like you work for success at what you do, we equally work so hard. These are the best teams in the world after all, and the Champions League is very hard, but if you work hard, then anything can happen</p>

  <p><b>[Coutinho is presently on the sidelines with an ankle injury, with his expected return slated for the beginning of June]</b> I do not like to say, of course, that there is a lot of speculation. I’m concentrating on this season and will see what happens afterwards. I am very grateful to Leverkusen and I don’t want to mess it up in any way.<br /><br />We’re happy about the win. We put it on ourselves to win here and we did that. We had to really give everything today and I think we deserved to win in the end</p>
