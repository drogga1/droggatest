Philippe Coutinho’s agent Kia Joorabchian says that the Barcelona midfielder will remain with the Spanish champions</p>

<p>: 2019 07 13
Barcelona must come clean with Philippe Coutinho over his future, according to his agent Kia Joorabchian, who claims the club have promised the Brazilian will remain at Camp Nou while secretly trying to include him in a deal for Neymar.</p>

<p>: 2019 07 15
Philippe Coutinho’s agent, Kia Joorabchian, has said the Barcelona attacker would not consider a move to any Premier League side other than Liverpool.</p>

PSG to demand €222m+ for Neymar &amp; not interested in Philippe Coutinho or Ousmane Dembele swap deal</p>

<p>: 2019 08 07
Barcelona are asking for between €20 million and €30m from Tottenham to allow Philippe Coutinho to leave on a season-long loan deal.</p>

<p>: 2019 08 07b
Barcelona seek Neymar loan deal with option to buy - but must offload Philippe Coutinho to Tottenham first. Sources have told Goal that Paris Saint-Germain are open to loaning Neymar to the Catalan side with an obligation to purchase outright next season</p>

<p>: 2019 08 08
President Florentino Perez is willing to enter negotiations with the Ligue 1 champions PSG and table an opening bid in excess of €100m, while Neymar would be offered a five-year contract with an annual salary of €25m per season. A possible return to Barcelona now looks to have collapsed, with Philippe Coutinho having rejected the opportunity to make a loan move to Tottenham</p>

  <p><b>[Coutinho happy to play with <a href="thomas-muller.html">Muller</a> as Brazilian seeks to replay Bayern’s faith]</b> I’ve always said I can play with Thomas. He’s a great player and someone who’s very important for Bayern. He’s got everything, talent and experience, which makes him an essential part of the team. I’ve got my strengths and he’s got his – the only thing that matters is combining them together for Bayern<br /><br />I tried to repay his faith in me. At the moment the team is doing really well at implementing what the coach wants. Pressing without the ball is very important to him. We close the opposition down early and in a structured way, which causes them a lot of problems. We didn’t expect it to be so successful so quickly.<br /><br />The changes <a href="hansi-flick.html">Flick</a> has made are mainly tactical. He places a lot of emphasis on compact, coordinated and, at times, high pressing so that the opposition can’t get into their game at all. Obviously it’s up to us players to execute that on the pitch, but from the very start, we understood what he wants from us and how he ticks, both on the pitch and in the changing room. That’s why things are going well and we’re all happy<br /><br /><b>[Coutinho has also paid homage to prolific Bayern striker <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a>, with the Pole having taken his goal tally for 2019-20 to 23]</b> The form he is in right now is incredible. At some point, a game had to come along in which he didn’t score - but reducing his performance to goals wouldn’t do him justice. I’m of the opinion that Lewy was incredibly important for our victory in Dusseldorf. He locks down the opposing lines of defence, runs as the first player back on defence and penetrates deep, which in possession immediately creates space for others</p>

I am so happy for them, because I have so many friends there, former team-mates, so I’m just so happy for them, but that’s all. I don’t look back. I took another path, and now I am on another journey, much like everyone else. I’m focused entirely – just like them – on reaching my dreams. I’m happy with what I did in the past, and now I can only look forward<br /><br /><b>[Bayern are now top of the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>.
