  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> goalkeeper <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a> helping Ellie Roebuck become England’s No.1]</b> I can only focus on myself. I’ve done that even when I’m in competition with <a href="karen-bardsley.html">Karen Bardsley</a>, obviously. The aim for me is to be England’s number one. That’s obviously a really difficult task because there’s other top quality goalkeepers in England. But I just focus on myself. I can only control what I can control and if I keep performing week in and week out then hopefully it gets noticed and puts me in the best position<br /><br />Their goalkeeper coach Xabi is always coming across and contributing, giving us ideas. It’s a really good working relationship and that reflects well on the club in general. I’ve grown up playing outfield and it comes a bit more naturally to me to play with my feet. I think it’s the philosophy throughout the club and I’ve been here since I was 15 so for the past four years, it’s really been embedded in me. It obviously helps and I’ve got great players around me to help that. We see them train and we walk around. It’s just the environment itself, it’s more just natural. But I think that’s what’s really special about the club.<br /><br /><b>[Newly-promoted United were the better side in the first half and Roebuck admits her team-mates were not happy with the opening 45 minutes]</b> We knew the first half wasn’t good enough. So myself, I was happy I could give that moment for the team. Second half, we came out and kind of turned the screw and picked up the tempo, which we should have known from the first half, but it just didn’t happen and credit to Man United because they put a great performance in</p>
