  <p><b>[Jimenez, Peralta rescue overconfident Mexico coach Osorio in narrow win]</b> It was a big blow for the team to be losing in the first half. The team wanted to be winning from the start. But we know that in this tournament, every team is tough. They good a good job in the first half. That’s why they were winning 1-0 but we stayed positive, strong and united to move forward in the match and score the two goals.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico winger Javier Aquino not taking World Cup spot for granted]</b> I don’t feel safe until I’m with the team in Russia. Even though I’ve been a regular, anything can happen, everything can change. I’m happy and have the desire to get to work. We’re going to give all our effort to stay on the list of 23. We know it’s coach Osorio’s decision, but we’ll do everything possible to be there.<br /><br />I’m in the best form of my career because I’m more mature, and I want to have an important role in the World Cup. I’m a more experienced player</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico had 17 shots, eight on target and no goals]</b> The team came in working these last two weeks of preparation we had, and I think today it played a good game, despite the fact that we all got together as a whole squad only a few days before the game. I think we played a good match. We looked to do what the manager asked us, though we did lack something in the attacking portion, in our finishing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mexico players eager for new manager to be named]</b> For the players with more experience it was a semester in which you didn’t know where things were going, where there’s no manager, but for the younger players it’s something different because an opportunity opened for them. But you miss a plan, a manager and to see where we’re going, who’s going to continue, who won’t, but we have to take everything as well as we can. After the World Cup it’s been really complicated not having a manager, and we haven’t had good results. We need to keep getting better and take the positives.</p>
