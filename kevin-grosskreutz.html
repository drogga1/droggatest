<blockquote>
  <p>[Grosskreutz urges Klopp reunion for struggling Dortmund star] I’m very sorry for Mario Gotze at the moment, because stuff is written about him - and only him - every day. In Bruges, for example, the whole team didn’t play well. Maybe it would be good for him to go abroad in the winter to find a bit more peace and bring his career back on track. Klopp knows him quite well, he would be a good fit for Liverpool.<br /><br />Of course he has to deliver performances on the pitch. His head is not completely free at the moment. I never expected his career to experience such a phase<br /><br />His form, which he had before the 2014 World Cup and included his winning goal in the final, is behind him. For him, you would have to invent a system at Borussia Dortmund that does not exist right now</p>
