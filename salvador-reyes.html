<blockquote>
  <p><b>[After five weeks of the new season, a Santos Laguna forward is atop the scoring charts again. Jonathan Rodriguez has scored four, including two in Sunday’s win, while Julio Furch has a three goals and three assists this season]</b> It’s my dream debut. But I have the fortune to come into this group, to be able to coach them and to realize why the team is the champion. These are wins that aren’t my wins, but rather the whole institution’s.<br /><br />Everything is owed to the group of the players, who have been really professional. When there’s a really well-built structure, like there is here in Santos and where everyone is a participant in the project it’s easier to build on what you already have. I take these victories with a lot of humility and without believing that this is the work of one person. I happen to be in front of the team, but the structure is very firm</p>
