<blockquote>
  <p><a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> boasted again and again what would happen when <a href="jose-aldo.html">Jose Aldo</a> stood across from him in the octagon. But even the 27-year-old Irishman never went so far as to predict that Aldo, undefeated in 18 bouts going back to 2005, would be knocked out cold in 13 seconds<br /><br />It was, to be dramatic, the most <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> moment yet. And that’s saying something because during the Dubliner’s UFC career, now totalling seven fights since 2013, the ‘Notorious One’ has produced many worth remembering<br /><br />A keen observer of movement and body mechanics, of numbers and sequences, <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> has separated himself from the pack by going about things his own way. Leading up to the fight, he spoke of the 29 year-old Aldo, now 25-2 as a professional mixed martial artist, as just another opponent. This, according to the men who faced Aldo and lost, was preposterous. The Brazilian is athletically gifted. A speedy and hard puncher. A monster kicker. A black belt jiu-jitsu grappler. Again, though, it was <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> who was proved correct. Ridiculously so<br /><br />Aldo, bleeding from a cut on the bridge of his nose, slumped in his corner. This is a landmark moment not only for <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> but for Zuffa, which promotes the UFC. After years of searching, the Las Vegas-based promotion finally has its first European superstar – one they can expect to sell out stadiums and produce mega-rich bouts for years to come<br /><br />The wild result capped a tremendous UFC 194 card in Las Vegas, which thanks to <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>’s presence produced a $10.1m gate</p>
