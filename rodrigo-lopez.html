  <p><b>[Rodrigo Lopez thriving at Toluca after journey through USL to Liga MX]</b> I ended a season with the LA Blues in 2013 and I wasn’t sure if I wanted to play anymore. My son was born that year. Economically, the USL isn’t the best, and I needed to figure out a way to raise my family and take care of my family.<br /><br />I was working construction for my offseason, which is kind of hard to believe, but I was working construction and it opened my eyes. I wanted to take care of my family first. I was thinking of leaving soccer, but then Graham Smith from Sacramento called me and said there’s a good opportunity for you in Sacramento<br /><br />Preki had let me go from Chivas USA and I thought about it twice, but I told myself I’d prove him wrong and change the perception he had of me. I worked extra hard that offseason and I went to Sacramento with the goal to have a standout year and obviously to help my team get as far as we can. We won the USL championship that year<br /><br />At my age, I didn’t feel that being back in Mexico would be an option. But then Celaya happened and I set myself goals to play and be a constant starter, to get people talking about me<br /><br />I got a call this last offseason saying there are a couple teams interested in Liga MX but I had heard that before and I was kind of trying to keep it out of my head. The draft came and I got a call from Celaya saying, ‘Hey there’s a chance you might go to Toluca, are you interested?’ I didn’t think about it twice<br /><br />Now I’m here, I’m at a great club and I’m grateful to be at such a big club. I could’ve been at any other club, but to me Toluca is one of the biggest clubs in Mexico with a lot of tradition, a lot of championships and a great fan base which is special to play in front of<br /><br />In Sacramento I had more of an offensive role. I was playing a little bit wide, but more in an attacking role and Preki gave me a lot of freedom to attack and be free in the attacking half. I go to Liga Ascenso with Celaya and I become more of a mixed center midfield with some attacking and now I’m here with Toluca and I feel like I have more of a defensive role. It’s something that early in my career I needed to work on but as the years went by I got better and more disciplined on my defensive side of the field. Now I think that hard work is what’s giving me the chance to work with Cristante<br /><br />Now that I’m with Toluca I just want to be a constant starter and play and be seen throughout the country. Obviously I’ve always wanted to be a national team player and play at a World Cup. I’m hoping to one day get a call-up, which is my next goal in my career<br /><br />It’s been a rough and tough road to get here but it just makes it a lot more satisfying and enjoyable once it happened. I’ve knocked on a lot of doors, I’ve hustled, I’ve asked for opportunities and I’ve been turned down a lot. But I kept on fighting and obviously I’ve always dreamed of playing in Liga MX, so I didn’t stop until that happened</p>
