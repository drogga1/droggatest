<blockquote>
  <p>[Arsenal have completed the signing of centre-back Konstantinos Mavropanos from PAS Giannina for a fee in the region of £1.8 million] This is a historic day for PAS Giannina because a footballer of our team has managed to sign for a club as big as Arsenal. We are grateful to have seen a player graduate from our group. We wish both the footballer and Arsenal the best. Personally, I would like to thank the agent, Konstantinos Farra, who has been behind this effort all these months and he has helped significantly to have a good ending in his transfer to Arsenal. We wish this start to continue in the future both for our team and for the other teams in our country. I wish other footballers reach this level.</p>

  <p>[Arsenal’s new head of recruitment Sven Mislintat told the president of Greek side PAS Giannina that Konstantinos Mavropanos would be his first signing for the Gunners] Everything was done under extreme secrecy, and that was Arsenal’s command. Sven Mislintat, who would take up his new role in Arsenal on January 1 and knew the player from his time at Dortmund, informed us just before Christmas that Konstantinos would be his first signing when he got a job in the team. In fact, he had to finalise the deal earlier, since there was another suggestion on the table from an overseas team who was pushing to sign him. So he was forced to speed up proceedings and complete the deal. The pressure of Udinese forced us to finish the deal quickly. The Italian team was pushing and Konstantinos wanted to know which team he would go to. We told him that until December 31 he would have to be patient and afterwards he would know the next stage in his career. On the 30th of December we got the call from Arsenal and we finished the deal in three days.<br /><br />It was Mislintat’s clear choice [to sign Mavropanos]. Indeed, Wenger had stated that the player would go loan, but saw him in the training where Konstantinos impressed and decided to keep him at the club</p>
