  <p><b>[The Champions League can lead me to Russia]</b> We spoke quickly at the end of the game. We won and we ended up with an unbeaten record of more than 30 games. Pep came to praise our performance and congratulated me personally, and I also made a point of praising his team. It was nothing more, it was all very brief. Everything else about my possible transfer to City, I only know what I’ve read in the media. I try not to worry about it<br /><br />I was delighted to be called back into the Brazil squad. I think it was one of the most exciting moments of my life, just because of everything I had been through and it feeling like a had been given a second chance. It was a sign that I was back and had recovered my form on the pitch. It was pleasing to see that being recognised by Tite and his staff. To be able to come back for the final qualifiers was really great. The World Cup squad is not yet final and I will do everything in my power to make it to Russia<br /><br /><b>[Wednesday night’s clash also pits him against current Brazil No.1 Alisson, who will be keeping goal for Roma]</b> It has everything to be a great match. We are in good form, but we face a strong team with great tradition and with quality players, such as Alisson. We know how difficult it will be, but we are prepared. And when we play well for our clubs, especially in important competitions like the Champions League, we stand out. My future with the Selecao depends on how well I do my job here, and that’s all I’m trying to do<br /><br />The team is very good, the quality is extremely high, and the mood is the best possible, all thanks to Tite, who has created a comfortable environment. He is a great coach who demands a lot, but also knows how to communicate with his players and is always there to guide everyone in the right direction. Brazil have had a great qualification process and have all the ingredients to have a fantastic World Cup, even though it’s a short tournament anything can happen in that month. The fans are behind the team again and that has given great confidence to the players. Brazil are definitely one of the favourites<br /><br />I have always been an extremely professional guy with everything. I would never do anything that would harm me, and I am totally against using any kind of resource, illicitly, to benefit myself in any way<br /><br /><b>[Fred has since hired his own personal biochemist to ensure there will never be another positive test, and retains the physical trainer who helped him through his period away from the game]</b> They were both a huge source of motivation for me</p>

Maybe I’ll decide better after the World Cup. My head is entirely with the World Cup.<br /><br />There’s been some advanced talks since January, when I almost went to Man City. United talked to my staff and Shakhtar<br /><br />It’s an honour to grab the attention of great coaches in Europe, from Manchester and from our own national team. I think I am strong on the field, I am versatile, I can play in several midfield positions. Some coaches like that, it grabs their attention, it is a big deal for me. Versatility, quality, good passing … I think all that catches coaches’ eyes</p>

But he has a lot of respect for Manchester United, who are obviously a big club here in England. He praised the club a lot and, after he was granted the opportunity to speak to Jose Mourinho and other senior figures at United, we made the decision together for me to come here. We decided it would be a good move for me. Gilberto is a top guy and his advice means a lot to me. He played in the same position as I do and he won the Premier League, so I look to him for inspiration, I listen to what he has to say and I take on board what he tells me.</p>

On the contrary, it’s everyone trying to help each other. And it’s normal, we lose a game, people will hit us because it’s a great team, it’s a giant here in Europe.

It has always been really strong. I used to watch United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal, when Gilberto Silva used to play there. I have many idols like Gilberto, Thierry Henry, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes - many great players that have been here as well.<br /><br />I managed to do some classes in Ukraine but people there didn’t really speak English. They spoke Russian so that’s what I learned there. I didn’t get to practice much English but now I’m here and I’m going to classes. I want to learn as quickly as possible because I know it will help me to integrate and adapt here. I already know a lot of sentences, many words - ‘How are you?’ - I know how to communicate. I’m studying, so hopefully I will be better in no time.<br /><br />My wife talks a lot with Fernandinho and Ederson’s wives. For the players, the fixtures and training schedules are very different so we end up not having time.<br /><br />I hang out more with the United squad - Andreas Pereira and the players who speak Spanish. Even those who speak English. We meet after work to play video games and have dinner. It is important for the team. Paul Pogba, Andreas, Eric Bailly… we are close friends</p>

They were trying to convince me to join them, but in the end it didn’t happen. Then it was the summer and, as I said, there were other offers, including from United. I quickly decided that was the right move for me. Mourinho is a top, top professional and every player likes to work with such a winner. I’m learning things from him, that’s for sure. He can be quite strict, but that’s part of his job. He’s also friendly and funny off the pitch, and jokes with us in the dressing room.

  <p><b>[Manchester United star Fred has admitted that life at Old Trafford has begun in a frustrating manner]</b> I’ve played very little at United, so it’s normal for Professor Tite not to be able to evaluate me, even though I’ve worked hard with him before. Of course, I was annoyed, but I have to know how to deal with the sadness to be able to help me take a step forward. The coach has chosen not to put me in the team. That’s his choice. I still do my job and I can’t let it affect my mindset, I cannot let that shake me. I have to be patient<br /><br />It’s been a bit of a difficult start for me at United because I have not been playing so much. I had a lot of games in Shakhtar, but it’s a little bit different here. It’s normal, of course, a process of adaptation to a different league. Although I’ve been to Europe before, now I am in a different country and I have to go through a new process of settling in. But today I see myself much better and I hope that my football will be 100 per cent soon. I think I had a great performance against Young Boys in the Champions League. We had the opportunity to score a few times before we scored the goal at the end, but I was very happy to have returned to the field and I hope to continue playing more</p>
