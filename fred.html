  <p><b>[Fred admits to Man Utd flop after £52m move but expects collective improvement at Old Trafford]</b> Last season, my first one here, was difficult, but I think I ended the season off okay, and I hope next season will be really good for me and a lot better for Manchester United, and I am excited to be a part of that. The English league is difficult and has lots of big clubs but I think the derbies are the best games to play so, when we see the fixture list, we look at those games first. It’s hard to pick out a single team, because there are so many big games here in the Premier League, obviously there are the top teams like Liverpool, City, Chelsea, I think those big games, the ‘big six’ are always good. We always look forward to them, we all want to be on the pitch and to win them.<br /><br /><b>[Fred confident that the Red Devils will be more competitive as a collective]</b> We have a few things to improve; we were not happy with how last season finished. Unfortunately we couldn’t go a little further in the Champions League and in the other cups, and we didn’t do as well as we wanted in the league, so I think there are things we need to improve. As a team, we will discuss what went wrong so that we can have a better season and challenge for trophies. That’s what we all, and the fans, want the most<br /><br />I want to say that next season we will be better. We will be looking to challenge for trophies. We are Manchester United and we have to be ready to battle for every trophy, and I’m sure that we will have a successful season with the fans’ fantastic support</p>

  <p><b>[Fred has boldly declared that both he and the Red Devils as a collective will be better than last season]</b> My first season was a bit difficult. The first year is always a little bit difficult, a year of adaptation, and, moreover, we had a season that wasn’t too strong in terms of the Premier League. But now I’m more used to the league and I’ve been working hard. I’ve talked to the manager and backroom staff, and this season is going to be better than last season. I’m sure it is going to be very successful<br /><br /><b>[He figured prominently in United’s pre-season preparations, but only after being granted leave in order to get married]</b> I’m really happy to have got married and, thanks to Manchester United, I was able to get my whole family together with my wife on the day. That was a really important day for me, for all of us, and I’m very happy. I had a chat with Mr Ole and he was cool for being so understanding. He was really attentive to my needs and I was allowed to come out of training to go on and get married. I did end up joining the team a bit late <b>[on tour]</b>, but I was already training beforehand, so I’m in shape</p>

With that, I can try to get better<br /><br /><b>[Fred is fully aware of the size of the challenge he faces]</b> I do understand it. Every day when I arrive at the training ground, when I see those big letters with the name of the club, I pinch myself. So I know this club is gigantic. I like to read about its history, best players and historical moments. It hasn’t been great times for us, our rivals are winning titles and we’re not even in the Champions League. It makes our fans sad and I feel sad as well. This club deserves silverware and we’re going to fight to get better. We have to put United back in the place it should never have left<br /><br /><b>[He is also looking for patience to be shown with Solskjaer]</b> It’s the beginning of his work, even <b>[Sir Alex]</b> Ferguson had difficult times in his first years.

But I believe I’m adapting.<br /><br />I’m learning day by day. I feel like I’m getting better. I have a big heart. I will play better. I like Manchester. My family are here and they like it too. They are speaking English. I’m having English classes, too, but it’s not possible all the time because we travel a lot but we speak lots of languages here.

It was a really good game for us. We’re unhappy with having conceded the goal but in general we were very happy with the performance and now we need to focus to consistently produce this type of performance and get back to winning ways. The game really lifted us again and it was what we needed. Tactically we got things right and we really need to make the most of that - it was an absolutely incredible intensity we played with. There are many positive points we can take into the game against <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>. There were some negative points as well so we need to correct those on the pitch in our day-to-day preparation, but we need to take the positive points to <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>, have a great game and go for the win<br /><br />I’m really happy to have had a run in the team. I’m not so happy about the way we’ve been playing at times but the game against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> feels like a real turning point and I hope I can have a run of form and the team can have a run of form, play great games and get the victories.

Whatever game we’re playing in, we go on the pitch to do our best and, of course, we’re always looking at the league table. We’re <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, we want to be around the top of the table, we want to be fighting for a Champions League place.

We saw this in the last game against Bournemouth, it was a very difficult game for us. Against Brighton, it’ll be no different, it’ll be a tough game, but we’re <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. We always play to win, to leave with three points. They’re a difficult team to play against. When I arrived here, I played against Brighton <b>[in the 3-2 defeat at the Amex Stadium in August 2018]</b>. They are a team with a lot of strength. It’ll be a tough game but we need to play the ball on the floor. They’ve also been playing well so it’ll be a good game and I hope we come away with the win</p>

I just want to continue doing what I’m doing, playing well and starting the games - but I want to score, too. I came close <b>[against Brighton]</b> and hit the bar but I’ll keep working until this happens. I’m very happy, firstly because we won but also because we’re getting some rhythm and we’re doing well in the cups. But we needed to do better in the league. We just have to carry on fighting so that we reach the Champions League. I’m feeling better than I’ve ever felt since moving to England. All I ever wanted was to play regularly and now that I’m doing that, there’s no doubt my confidence is higher and that helps any player</p>

We do some one-on-one training, so he’s someone who influences me a lot at the club<br /><br />I want to be a big player and be part of the history of Man United. I already am, but I want to make history here at the club and to win some trophies, so that is my goal at Man United. I came here because it’s a big club, so, as I said, I want to win trophies, continue to work hard here and make my name at Man United</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd star Fred ‘very grateful’ to <a href="michael-carrick.html">Carrick</a> for helping him through testing ‘adaptation’ at Old Trafford]</b> He has helped me a lot in this process of adaptation and transition. He’s a guy who was an idol at the club and was a great player in the same position that I play. On a daily basis, he helps me a lot, always talking to me. After training we always do a little work to complement it, sometimes finishing, sometimes passing. He’s a guy who understands the game, who lived it, and it’s impossible for there to be anyone better than him to help me. He knows about the difficulties, the shortcuts, and he tries to show me everything there is in training and in games. He’s a guy who has been of huge importance for me at United and I’m very grateful to him.<br /><br />There is always that adaptation process, right? Last season was very difficult, it changed a lot not only in my career, but also in my personal life. My wife was pregnant when I arrived in England, we were in a different condition. I arrived at a club of a gigantic dimension, a championship that is the most disputed, the best in the world, so it ends up being difficult to adapt. This season I managed to put my football into practice, I had a good sequence of games, which I didn’t have last season. I am very happy to be playing well, to be doing a great championship and I hope that when I return, I can improve more and more.</p>

  <p><b>[Fred names James Garner as the best young player at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> ahead of <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> and Williams]</b> They are all great players. The club has an important role in using many academy players, it has this history of using the kids that come up from the academy, who turn professional and make history at the club. This process is important. They are great players, with a lot of potential for the future. All are very good, they are not in this profession for nothing, but the player who impresses me most is Jimmy Garner. Not just because he is in the same position as me, but because he is a player who has an impressive vision of the game, and he has a huge future for United. In addition to his impressive game vision, he always plays with his head up, has an impressive shot and is an incredible passer. He is a player that I admire a lot<br /><br />Ole is a great coach. He’s still a young guy, he’s going to grow a lot in football as a coach. He was a player, he understands how the player feels, and this is important for us in the squad. He added a lot, had a lot of experience as a player and is now starting to have that experience as a coach. He always helps us on the pitch, talking, he’s a very good guy, and I’m happy to be following his transition at United. I’m sure he will grow a lot, get a lot of experience and that he will become one of the great coaches (in the world)</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United midfielder Fred has explained how Bruno Fernandes’ arrival at Old Trafford can help him score more goals for the club]</b> I hope so as it’s always important to score goals. I’ve been working on it and, with Bruno’s arrival, we’ve got someone who gives us more freedom, given his quality with the ball at his feet. So I hope to attack and score more goals and work hard on my finishing to score more goals in a season. I’m certain that, with Bruno’s arrival, more goals will come.<br /><br />My favourite role is where I’ve been playing. As a second central midfielder, defending solidly but also getting forward and looking to score goals. I think it’s important that a central midfielder has good approach play and finishing skills. The way I’ve been playing is the way I like to play and I feel really good in this position</p>

  <p><b>[Fred admits first season at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> was ‘awful’]</b> I believe the first season was very difficult for me. There was the process of settling down here, but also other personal things that were happening in my life, such as the birth of my son. So I believe it was a mix of reasons that made me have an awful first season. I’m definitely settled in every aspect now. I’ve been enjoying some good performances and the chance of playing a great sequence of games. That was also helpful. I’m delighted with this season. I’m now playing well and hopefully I can keep the momentum if the league returns. I just want to give my best for this club, trying to be a key part of the team.<br /><br />It’s doubtful. We honestly don’t know. There’s a lot of speculation. People say we might play in neutral venues and players will be confined until the end of the league. There are a lot of suggestions, but that’s it, speculation. We will probably return to training without knowing what will happen. I want to play the league, and hopefully everything will go that way. Hopefully we can beat this virus and every family return to normal life. I mean, it will never be the same ‘normal’ as before, but hopefully we resume somehow from the point we stopped</p>

  <p><b>[Red Devils team-mate Fred says is hoping that a <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> can be kept at Old Trafford]</b> <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is a great player. The people who are here on a daily basis with him know that. Everyone who watched the World Cup and watched his football knows that he’s a great player. And for sure we want him to stay. Because he will add a lot to us. He’s a guy who has an immense quality, he’s a strong player for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He knows how to play <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. So I’m sure I want him to stay because I’m sure he will help us a lot. We’re in the same position, but the more quality players on the team, the better. You will not build a team with 11 players. You need a strong squad. So I really hope that he stays, and if he stays, I’m sure he will be a very strong reinforcement for us next season</p>
