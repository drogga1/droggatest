<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Jordan Henderson has captained <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to the title]</b> He actually got a bit of stick for that kind of thing when he was a youngster. But it was always obvious that he just had so much belief in himself<br /><br /><b>[Henderson has been doubted and disparaged like few others]</b> Going to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, wow, I have to admit that even I was sceptical. Honestly, I was very surprised that he got that move for that amount of money<br /><br />Turning all the sceptics around has been an unbelievable feat. He was walking into a dressing room with a lot of big characters - <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Jamie Carragher</a>, <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>, <a href="craig-bellamy.html">Craig Bellamy</a> - but he held his own and it has been brilliant to see him develop in the way he has. He is just totally determined. You can see it in his eyes.<br /><br />You could see from an early age that he was very professional. He was always staying late at training, practising free kicks or other things he needed to work on. He was so focused, and he’s the same now. Just listening to him after games, he is never thinking about the league, he is only ever thinking about the next game</p>
