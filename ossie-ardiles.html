  <p><b>[Club legend Ossie Ardiles warns Tottenham that trying to keep Christian Eriksen is futile]</b> It looks to me like he has put his mind on a move – that he wants to go somewhere else. And if that is the case it’s futile for the club to try and keep a player when he wants to leave. I won’t say he’s not happy with us, because he is, but his mind is trying to play somewhere else, and the best thing is to part company<br /><br /><b>[Ardiles feels focus is shifting to the future, with Tottenham looking to bring in more players with potential]</b> People were speculating about who Mauricio was going to buy, but no one has the slightest clue except for Mauricio. But you can see right now the way he does things; he likes to buy young players and put a lot of his influence on them, and take it from there. People like Dele Alli for example</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino has been backed by <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> legend Ossie Ardiles to remain at the club for a long, long time]</b> Pochettino is an absolutely wonderful manager so we cannot be in better hands to be perfectly honest. He works extremely hard, he’s a very, very honest guy, an honest manager, very good tactically. When you go there, there’s a family atmosphere which he has created, so we cannot be in better hands. He’ll stay for a long, long time<br /><br /><b>[Spurs did stumble out of the blocks, scraping past <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> and losing to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, but have taken points off <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and Crystal Palace and are considered to be heading in the right direction]</b> It’s been]&lt;/b&gt; very positive. I believe that there are two teams to beat - <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> - but I think we are one of the teams that can beat them and we are going to try and fight with them all the way. We have a very, very strong squad. That showed last season and in the Champions League as well. We do have a very strong squad but we have to be a little bit better and I hope we will do it this year</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham legend Ossie Ardiles has urged <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> to allow <a href="giovani-lo-celso.html">Giovani Lo Celso</a> more freedom to express himself on the pitch]</b> The first thing I’d like to say about Giovani is that I’m very proud of him. Suddenly, when he came here to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, he had one of the worst things that can happen to you as a footballer when you first arrive in a new club – he got injured. So, he arrived at a new club in <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, wanted to play, wanted to do well but he couldn’t because of that injury, so it wasn’t the most auspicious of starts. However, he started to play more regularly and, immediately, he made an impact. He’s a very sensible player, he knows what he’s doing all the time, he’s clever and so on. Little by little, I have to say, he’s adapted to the pace of the game here extremely well. Right now, it doesn’t look like he has any problems with that at all<br /><br />He can play in a number of positions in midfield, sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left, he uses his left foot more but he’s very comfortable on the right as well. So basically, he can play in any position in midfield. In fact, he can play the holding, defensive midfield position as well, he already has done this season.<br /><br />If he has space, he’ll attack it immediately and that produces space for other players. He’s very skilful… look, everyone is skilful, but what makes you different is what is in your head. And even though he’s very young, I don’t want to say he has an older head, but he has a more experienced head on his shoulders. He’s a very, very good player and he can go from strength to strength</p>

  <p><b>[Ossie Ardiles says <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> has good offer from <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> &amp; wants to stay in England]</b> Mauricio is fine in England. He is linked with <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> and when he spoke directly to that club there were many first-rate people involved who made him a good offer. Mauricio had a relationship with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, but last Tuesday his situation was unlocked and he is free to coach. In this way, he will hear offers again, but <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> is a firm possibility to work again. He will take his time to think and wait a little for all this to happen.<br /><br />Mauricio is an absolutely top-level technician. He is one of the three best technicians in the world. He can manage wherever he wants. Here, or in Spain, in France or Italy. But he really likes managing in England. There are a few very large teams that can appoint him - and one of them is going to be chosen<br /><br />For now <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> is not going to manage in Argentina. He had an approach, there was talk at the time of the national team, but he was very happy at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. I don’t see it happening now. Maybe later in his career, yes, but not now. I would recommend Mauricio for any job in the world. He is an excellent person</p>
