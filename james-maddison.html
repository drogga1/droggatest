  <p><b>[Leicester City midfielder James Maddison has lauded former team-mate Harry Maguire for his conduct this summer, despite seeking a move to Manchester United]</b> The way he conducted himself over the summer was fantastic and it’s the perfect example for anyone going through that situation. He came into training every day, trained as well as he could, was excellent in pre-season games and his focus was on Leicester. When it came to the time to sign for Manchester United then so be it, but he conducted himself brilliantly<br /><br /><b>[Maddison himself was linked with a move to United earlier this summer]</b> I don’t want to set long-term targets but I want to have a successful season, build on my output last year and I want the team to finish as high as we can. I never hide that it’s my dream to play for England but it’s about playing for Leicester, playing as well as I can for the gaffer and the lads and hopefully the rest will take care of itself<br /><br /><b>[That type of quality in the Leicester ranks means Ben Chilwell believes the Midlands club can better their ninth-place finish last season and challenge for a top-six place this time around]</b> It’s not something that has been spoken about but it is at the back of everyone’s minds and is an achievable goal. It’s something that everyone at the club wants to happen this season. When you look at this season compared to last season it seems more competitive. We have bought players and certain positions might be a bit more crowded, but that shows the quality we have and the gaffer has said that people that train the best will play at the weekend, which has made training more intense</p>

  <p><b>[James Maddison has confessed that he wants to play at the highest level after being strongly linked with a move to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> over the summer]</b> I want to play at the highest level my ability will allow me to. I like to think I’ve my head screwed on with the transfers I’ve made. I’ve played League One, in Scotland, the Championship and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I worked my way up</p>

  <p><b>[Maddison made to wait for England debut as illness forces <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> star out of <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a>’s squad]</b> James Maddison has withdrawn from the England squad through illness. There will be no replacement called up for the <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> City player and a 23-man squad will travel to Prague on Thursday ahead of the Three Lions’ <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> EURO 2020 qualifiers against Czech Republic and Bulgaria</p>

  <p><b>[James Maddison says that it’s too early to consider his <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> team as <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> contenders, despite a 2-0 win over <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> that saw them move to second in the table]</b> Let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves. They’re two top teams and I’ll be watching on my sofa, so we’ll see how that goes, but we’ll just keep plugging away and getting good results<br /><br />It was a proper <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> game with two quality sides. There’s been a lot of talk about <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in recent weeks but we knew they have big threats with their front players so it was a game we definitely didn’t take lightly. I thought we were excellent today and that’s how we’ve been all season. We sent a real statement out today. It was an even game and one that I thought we dominated for large parts. 9-0, 2-0, 1-0, you only get three points so we’ll keep going<br /><br /><b>[Maddison’s goal was set up by <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a>, who leads the Golden Boot race with 11 goals]</b> <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a>, for someone who’s scored so many goals, he’s a really unselfish player. Top strikers score loads because they shoot all the time but Vards realised I was in a better position so it was just about concentrating and getting a good strike and thankfully it went flying in</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City stars James Maddison have expressed their support of LGBT football]</b> We’ve got a very accepting changing room, and I think if one of our team-mates was to come out and say they were gay, nothing changes. That’s how it is with us, and hopefully going forward that can be the same for everyone</p>

  <p><b>[James Maddison has suggested that he will continue to ignore talk of an imminent move to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> being made]</b> If I think back four years ago, I was on loan at Aberdeen from <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> and now I’m playing every week in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and that’s all I always wanted to do. Sometimes stuff like this can make you really reflect and be proud of myself that I’ve got to this level and obviously look forward now. It’s not ideal, but this will give us time to reflect on what’s happened, whereas normally you can only think about what’s forward because it’s the next game … where are the next points coming from? It’s been a whirlwind two years and I’ve loved every second of it. I feel right at home at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. I feel like part of the furniture already and I love it here. I love the lads, I love the fans, <b>[we’ve got]</b> a great manager, so I’m very, very happy<br /><br />I’m doing all good, as well as I can. Obviously it’s tough and strange times for everyone at the minute, but it is what it is. You’ve just got to get on with it and stay at home, obviously, and follow the guidelines and stuff. I’m just cracking on with stuff at home really. It’s important that we keep fit, so we’ve obviously been getting sent the individual programmes off the sports science and the conditioning team at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>. For the first time in my life, I’m actually trying to do more exercise than what I actually need to do because there’s nothing else to do. I’m trying to fill time slots</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City star James Maddison has dropped a further hint that he’ll snub interest from Manchester United]</b> Of course I am. It was one of the best decisions I’ve made, coming here. I love it.<br /><br />I’m just isolating, the same as everyone else. It’s tough at the minute because we have to stay inside but kind of keep fit as well because we don’t know when the season is going to resume. We’re just doing individual stuff at home. <b>[Leicester manager]</b> <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> sorted out his staff to send us stuff to do at home so we’re still keeping fit, we’re not sitting at home on the beers and the cakes, don’t worry about that!<br /><br /><b>[Maddison confessed that pausing the season last month due to the Covid-19 outbreak was difficult]</b> This situation is not ideal because we were doing so well and we were in the Champions League spaces. We just want to finish and try to secure one of those spaces because Champions League football is something I’ve always wanted to <b>[play]</b>.<br /><br />The current squad gets compared to the title-winning squad and they’re completely different squads. There’s not many survivors, I think <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a>, <a href="kasper-schmeichel.html">Kasper Schmeichel</a> are the mainstays in the side. <br /><br />I think anybody that had anything to do with football became a <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> fan in the run-in. Everybody likes to see the underdog win and I just couldn’t believe it. Every week I remember thinking… <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> are going to slip now, they must. That’s just what everyone was thinking… but they just kept going</p>

  <p><b>[James Maddison says Free agent <a href="adam-lallana.html">Lallana</a> can be special with Maddison]</b> Personally, I could see <a href="adam-lallana.html">Adam Lallana</a> fitting into any team. He is one hell of a player. He’s one of the best, if not the best I have played with. Both footed, technically brilliant. Do <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> need him? Obviously, that’s another question because you’ve got James Maddison; Harvey Barnes can play in that position. Would he benefit the <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> team? Would he improve it? Yes, probably. He’s a really good player. I could imagine, if you could get him and Maddison both into the team playing together it would be pretty special. He would be a great signing, whether he comes or not I don’t know, I haven’t asked him</p>

  <p><b>[James Maddison has offered hope to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in their ongoing pursuit of more creative talent]</b> It has only really come in the last year or two, but my biggest goal now is to win trophies. In my house I have a trophy cabinet and there are not many in there. There are individual awards but no trophies. I want trophies. When we lost over two legs to <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> in the Carabao Cup semi-finals, it is a feeling I have never had before and that’s when I knew something has to change. It was heartbreaking. Fingers crossed I can now make that next step. We have <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup quarter-finals and hopefully we get to play that. My mouth gets wet when I walk around the <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> training ground and the stadium and see the pictures of them winning the league and hear the players talk about it.<br /><br />When I was coming through and watching <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, he was the one that really helped me as I started to understand the game properly. He was like me in a way because he was smaller and a bit weaker and a bit late in development but the way he caressed a ball and received it was amazing. I cannot think of anyone with a better weight of pass in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. The first time I played at the Etihad with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> I had to beg the kit man to get me his shirt. I studied him and to share a field with him was brilliant</p>
