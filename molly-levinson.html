  <p><b>[This structure, while necessary for years, was not what USWNT players wanted when they signed their most recent collective bargaining agreement in 2017]</b> The fact is the women’s team requested the same compensation structure as the men have, so they would be paid equally for equal performance. USSF refused, ordering lower compensation in every category for the women’s team in a pay for performance structure. That is patently unequal pay</p>

  <p><b>[Trial appears likely after mediation talks between U.S. Soccer and USWNT break down]</b> Today we must conclude these meetings sorely disappointed in the federation’s determination to perpetuate fundamentally discriminatory workplace conditions and behavior. It is clear that USSF, including its board of directors and President Carlos Cordeiro, fully intend to continue to compensate women players less than men. They will not succeed<br /><br /><b>[The suit charges that U.S. Soccer]</b> paid only lip service to gender equality and continues to practice gender-based discrimination against its champion female employees on the WNT in comparison to its less successful male employees on the MNT</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Cordeiro leaves U.S. Soccer in disarray as federation is left to pick up the pieces of latest mess]</b> While it is gratifying that there has been such a deafening outcry against USSF’s blatant misogyny, the sexist culture and policies overseen by <a href="carlos-cordeiro.html">Carlos Cordeiro</a> have been approved for years by the board of directors of USSF. This institution must change</p>
