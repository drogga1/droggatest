  <p><b>[Heimer Hallgrimsson says his Iceland team are the closest thing the country has to an army]</b> I think <b>[the Cod Wars]</b> is the only time we went to war. We have too few people, and we’d lose immediately if we went to war. These guys are the Icelandic Army! We’ve said previously that this game is a win-win game. The players have already won the hearts of all of Iceland with their performances. If we beat England, their lives will change, and all of our lives with change significantly. Icelandic football will go up in reputation. If you want the best in life you must take the chances that are there for you, and Monday represents that for us.</p>
