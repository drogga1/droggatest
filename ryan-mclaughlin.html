  <p><b>[Ryan McLaughlin will never forget his first training session at Melwood]</b> Crazy! I was 16, and I think I’d been over in England for a month. The Under-18s were playing the first-team in a bounce game, so Mike asked me to help out by being linesman. Before we started, he told me to try and give us as many decisions as possible. He was my coach, so I was like ‘sure!’. Anyway, Nathan Eccleston was playing up front for the 18s and he goes through one-on-one against big Sebastian Coates. Coates takes him down and I flag for a penalty. <a href="craig-bellamy.html">Bellamy</a> has sprinted over to me and honestly, he called me every swearword under the sun! There’s me, just out of school, and he’s in my face giving me all sorts.<br /><br /><b>[Belfast-born McLaughlin had been spotted by the Reds as a schoolboy playing for Northern Ireland against England in the Victory Shield]</b> <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> had played that night. He was a year younger than everyone else - he was 14 but he looked about 12! It was 0-0 when he came on and absolutely rinsed us. England won 2-0, but I must have caught the eye. I remember coming home from school a few days later and my dad said <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> had been on the phone<br /><br /><b>[He would join <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s talented team]</b> <b>[…]</b> <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> was special, even then. It doesn’t surprise me at all what he’s gone on to achieve. The difference with him and any other player I played with in youth football is simple; he was so smart on the pitch. We’d all be getting taught about which run to make and when to make it, but he’d already know. He’d make 10 of those runs a game, those curving runs from the left wing in behind the defence, timed to perfection. He still does them now. He was always through one-on-one with the keeper. People talked about his dribbling, which was frightening, but it was his movement off the ball which made him so special for me. You see it now, how many times is he there in front of goal to score? It looks easy, but it comes from that movement, and he’s had that since he was 16.<br /><br /><b>[…Sterling would feature, most notably when clashing with Rodgers in a training session]</b> I just don’t understand why the club threw him under the bus with that. For a young kid, that could knock you completely. He was 17, and it made him out to be something he wasn’t. I look back and think ‘imagine that had been me’. Your family is watching it, you’d be devastated. Those things should have been kept behind-closed-doors. Rodgers calling him out, I’ve no problem with that. He’s the manager. But to air it? I felt that was wrong. It was poorly managed. It’s probably something that stuck with Raheem for a long time afterwards, which was unfair. He’s had that tag, when in reality anyone who spent time around him would tell you what a nice lad he is<br /><br /><b>[Sterling was not the only star McLaughlin would rub shoulders with up at Melwood]</b> The level was insane. Those first few times when you get called to go up from Kirkby, the nerves are something else. <a href="alex-inglethorpe.html">Alex Inglethorpe</a> used to say to us ‘you earn the first-team players’ respect in the boxes’, you know the little rondos? So on the way up you’d be thinking ‘don’t f<em>ck up the rondos, don’t f</em>ck up the rondos’<br /><br /><b>[on Luis Suarez]</b> <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> was a joke. He’d do the maddest things, stuff you’d never even think of, let alone try. He’d be on the byline with no room and he’d end up flicking it over somebody’s head and running round him. It was insane. <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> used to make <a href="conor-coady.html">Conor Coady</a> mark him. He was trying to develop Conor’s game, and when you see where he is now that’s probably helped him massively. He’ll never have faced anyone as good since, trust me!<br /><br /><b>[As for McLaughlin, he would never quite make it at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, enjoying loan spells at Barnsley and Aberdeen before leaving permanently for Oldham Athletic in 2016]</b> I’ve been so lucky. I had Mike Marsh, <a href="steve-cooper.html">Steve Cooper</a> who is now the <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> manager, Rodolfo Borrell who is assistant to <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> at City, <a href="michael-beale.html">Michael Beale</a> who is up at Rangers, <a href="alex-inglethorpe.html">Alex Inglethorpe</a>, <a href="pep-lijnders.html">Pep Lijnders</a>, <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a>. I thought Brendan was brilliant, and I felt he got a lot of unfair stick towards the end of his time. He lost Suarez who was the best striker in the world, and things went downhill, but he was an unbelievable coach. He was really good with young players. He was massive on the idea of not giving them too much, too soon. He’d come down to the academy and talk to us, he’d tell us we weren’t <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players yet, so don’t start acting like you are with the cars and the watches and all that. He wanted us to keep our hunger. You only need to see what he’s done since <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, at Celtic and now <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, to see what a good manager he is.<br /><br /><b>[As for himself, the hope is that he can enjoy a bit more luck than he has in recent seasons]</b> It’s like being stabbed with a knife every time you plant your foot. It tore on me four times. I ended up getting it sorted, but then the season stopped! I’m due a bit of luck I reckon. I still believe I can play at a high level. Now I’ve just got to stay fit and prove it</p>

  <p><b>[Luke Matheson: Rochdale wonderkid ready for his <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> arrival]</b> A big game, and he’s not fazed at all. He wants to stand out against big opposition, and he does. That tells you something about his mentality. He was unbelievable. It was on TV, and he was just flying forward, taking on experienced players over and over. He never stopped.<br /><br />It should really suit him. It’s an unbelievable move for him, and a great club for him to go to. He’s an attacking full-back with great energy and attitude. He’s got everything you need to make it in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I think</p>
