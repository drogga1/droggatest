  <p><b>[Equal pay for women: Australia’s national teams strike historic agreement]</b> Football is the game for everyone, and this new CBA is another huge step toward ensuring that we live the values of equality, inclusivity and opportunity. For the first time, player remuneration will be directly tied to the revenues generated by our National Teams - this will create a sustainable financial model that incentivises players and <a href="ffa.html">FFA</a> to collaborate and grow the commercial pie together. This is truly a unique agreement. Every national team, from the Socceroos and Matildas, down to the Youth National Teams as well as the Cerebral Palsy National Teams have been contemplated in this new CBA.<br /><br />With this CBA, the next generation of aspiring Australian kids can see a pathway that oﬀers a sustainable career, a chance to be an Olympian, and the lure of playing at a <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup - regardless of your gender. It means whether you are a male or female, the value football places on your jersey is no different. We are proud to break this new ground in Australian and world sport</p>
