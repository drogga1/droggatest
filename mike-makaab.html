<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mike Makaab dismissed suggestions that his client, Lorenzo Gordinho, hasn’t signed a new contract extension with Chiefs because he’s holding out for a move to Europe]</b> That <b>[Gordinho going to Aalborg]</b> is not the reason he hasn’t renewed his contract. We are still in talks with Chiefs and if he impresses Aalborg, Chiefs will benefit <b>[financially]</b> because the player is still contracted to them.<br /><br />Chiefs had every right to say no, because he is still their player, but they didn’t. Instead, they allowed him to go and try his luck. Our relationship with Chiefs management is very good and again, they understand everything that’s going on because they are the first to know when things like this happen. Gordinho has a bright future ahead of him, and as ProSport International, we will make sure that we help him grow as a player<br /><br />He is still happy at Chiefs and he won’t be joining another <b>[local]</b> team. He will only leave Chiefs for Europe</p>

  <p><b>[Lorenzo Gordinho in advanced talks with Kaizer Chiefs]</b> They <b>[talks]</b> are at an advanced stage.<br /><br />He is excited and has been well received by the players at Aalborg. He has performed well, but no decision has been made as yet</p>
