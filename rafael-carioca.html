  <p><b>[Rafael Carioca said plenty of his countryman were cheering him on back home in Sunday’s final and that the reputation of Tigres made it easier for him to leave his home country for Liga MX]</b> Everybody speaks well of Tigres in Brazil. They say it’s the best team in Mexico. I think we’ve been in four finals in the last seven years. It’s beautiful football, and everybody knows that. I have to say that I’m very thankful for how everyone has treated me here, Tuca, the other players, the fans, everybody.<br /><br />It was a little difficult. We knew they had a good team. They took the lead but we kept playing well. We hadn’t played well the whole Liguilla but we all played for each other and that’s how we did it<br /><br />There’s always more. Soccer players can’t be happy with winning a title. For me, the important thing is to keep playing, to win more titles and make my mark at Tigres</p>
