  <p><b>[Yoshiro Moriyama showed the true Japanese way of honest assessment and blatantly commented on their dim hopes of lifting the cup]</b> We are simply not on that level but the Japanese Football Association <b>[JFA]</b> has invested a lot into this lot of boys and they should be ready to go further than the quarterfinals <b>[the most Japan have advanced into this competition’s history - that too only twice]</b>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Yoshiro Moriyama was just as ebullient as Valladares was displeased]</b> I was disappointed by how we held the ball we need to fix the tempo otherwise it will get difficult after we progress to the knockouts but the early goal today helped. Didn’t expect so many goals though.<br /><br /><b>[On facing an equally in form France]</b> We have not seen their match yet and I don’t have a lot to say but for us, we need to dominate well and deliver the ball to the attacking area in our next match<br /><br /><b>[Nakamura’s ability had been highlighted earlier, but it was in this game that he really shone]</b> He is a right-footed player but today we saw his exploits with the left one. He creates and scores a lot and if he misses a chance, he has the ability to turn back and make amends<br /><br />We have learnt from last year <b>[AFC U16]</b>. Many of our players lost a considerable amount of weight in Goa but this time we have made sure that the players are well-rested and proper nutrition is given and they are alright physically now</p>
