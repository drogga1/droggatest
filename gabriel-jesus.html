When I’m not playing, I’m watching, or playing a video game, doing something linked to football, so I think this is very important that I’m the same as him, and I hope to learn.

  <p><b>[Gabriel Jesus surprised by Manchester City start]</b> I have to say it’s going much better than I expected. When I spoke to some players that had already played in the Premier League, they said it was going to be very difficult but I put in my head that by working hard, you can achieve your goals. That’s what I did and what I always do. I came, I worked hard every day and tried to make my day matter. That makes me really happy. I am a bit surprised about my beginning here, but for the work I have done that’s what I expected. Everything is going perfectly. The welcome of the club, the welcome of the fans… I can tell our fans are really cheerful, happy - always supporting us. That’s very important.<br /><br />When I took the decision to join City, Pep Guardiola’s call was very important. He called me, spoke to me about the project and explained that I was going to be an important part of it. He’s crazy about football, like me. Twenty-four hours a day! When I’m not training or playing, I’m watching football or watching something football related on my phone, or about our next rival. We have that thing in common. I play football video games too. He’s a good guy. For the short time I’ve been here I’ve realised he’s a really good guy. He deserves everything he has won in his career. He showed his interest in having me here - that I was going to come here to help; that he was counting on me. I was very happy and that was when I decided to join Manchester City</p>

Not muscle injury, but it’s the first time something happens that leaves me out of games. So it was not easy. But I saw that, of course, no one wants this to happen, but it could be worse.

We will fight for our place somehow<br /><br />I’m a little tired, that’s normal. I am sad that I didn’t play what I know, but with almost three months out, it’s normal. Let’s work hard this week to be better on the next game. I’ve never been out for so much time, but I’m happy to be back, doing what I love. Now I have to train and play, train and play to try to secure a place in the Champions League.<br /><br />Our preparation was good for Boro, and it’s been good for most of our games. I’d swing the hammer if I had to, if I thought there was a lack of motivation or lack of desire. That’s something we shouldn’t allow, but I really believe that’s not the case. Finish strongly now and we give ourselves something to look forward to next season, because you want to be in four competitions. Sometimes exceptional seasons are built on seasons like this</p>

When I left Palmeiras, it was sad, but happy as well, with a title.<br /><br />Everybody is helping me here, Fernandinho, Fernando, but the club as well. They help my family, my friends that are here with me. I’m missing my mum a little, she is in Brazil with my brothers and nephews. But, when she is happy, I am too.

I’m worried he’s not sure yet. Come on, shall we, Dani? <b>[laughs]</b>. Between Chelsea and City, it would take Pep Guardiola to make that difference.<br /><br /><b>[On Pep Guardiola]</b> He is a very nice guy, humble, a little tense, but a very good person. He is intense in football. It’s football all the time. You meet him and you discuss football. I live in the same building as him, he’s my neighbour<br /><br /><b>[Jesus also discussed Brazil team-mate Neymar]</b> I’m very fond of Neymar, not only for the quality that everyone knows about, but for the person he is. I met him at the Olympics, he treated everyone well, even though he was the star of the competition. He was a normal person. He took on the responsibility and made the whole group like each other. This guy for me today is a great friend and a brother. He has always treated me, my friends and my family well. He came to visit me in Barcelona when I went for an operation, he likes me. I really like him.</p>

The two seem to be the same on the field, asking tactical questions, transferring a lot of intensity to the team, thinking of shape, and how we are pressing.<br /><br />For many, it seems easy to adapt to England, but not for me. Thankfully everyone at the club helped me. Coming into the cold weather, without speaking the language, it was difficult. But I was happy with my start on the field for City and I will continue in that vein. Fernandinho and my family really helped me<br /><br />I’m very attached to my family. My mother is hard on me when she has to be and that makes a huge difference. Their support means I need concentrate only on playing. What has changed over the last year? Nothing. I’m still the same player with the same dream of making it to the World Cup. I will continue to sacrifice for Neymar, for Coutinho, for Willian - for the whole team. I have to hard without the ball to make it easier on everyone</p>

I’m really okay with that, I accept it. If I’m not playing well and deserve to be on the bench, that’s it, and it happens with any player here. Pep is doing a great work here, using a lot of players in the squad and every player is helping Manchester City, that’s the most important thing</p>

It’s great to score goals in the Brazil national team shirt, but I also love doing it in City colours, too. I am enjoying this great moment in my life. I had an injury last season but that didn’t stop me. My team and management really helped me, and they have been great for me in my time in England. I learn a lot from Sergio <b>[Aguero]</b> every day, but not just him - I learn from all the team. We learn with each other - I pass on my knowledge to them, and they give theirs to me, so it’s an exchange.<br /><br /><b>[On Kevin De Bruyne]</b> He is one of the best players in the world. He shows that he deserves to be part of this team. His quality is outstanding as an individual out on the pitch, but it’s the way that he makes that work for the whole team, and connects with the other players, that makes him special. Kevin deserves the love from the fans. We can’t decide who they show their affection to, but the important thing is that every players gives their all out on the pitch - we are scoring goals, making assists and winning games and that is the main thing</p>

  <p><b>[How Gabriel Jesus almost had his legs broken]</b> So at 13 years old, I started playing with grown men in the Várzea. O.K. - everybody in São Paulo knows what I’m talking about right now <b>[and they probably just started laughing]</b>. But for everybody else, I will explain … . The Várzea is kind of like street basketball in America, or like the semi-professional football leagues in Europe. The pitches are all dirt, and you’re playing against the marmanjo - the ‘hard men’. It’s known for being extremely physical. There was a lot of nasty stuff going down on the field.<br /><br />I’ll never forget one moment … We were playing a very important match against this big team. They’d always had one of the best teams in the Várzea, but they’d been out of the league for a few years for reasons that I don’t want to get into. There’s probably kids reading.<br /><br />This was their first year back in the league, and they were playing us in a game to qualify for a big tournament. I remember all their players were looking at me before the match like, ‘Who is this little-ass kid? Is this serious?’ It was serious.<br /><br />Four minutes into the match, I dribbled their best defender and scored a goal, and I remember them all looking at me like, O.K., kid. We’re going to make your life hell.<br /><br />So they started beating me up every time I touched the ball. They got pretty crazy - like they were really coming after me to hurt me. This one short midfielder on their team was known to be a bully, and he kept saying, ‘I’m going to break your legs if you try to dribble me again.’<br /><br />So I got the ball … and I dribbled him again. It was like the NBA. I broke his ankles. I made him fall right on his ass. Now they were looking at me like they were going to actually kill me<br /><br />But … what can I say? When I have the ball at my feet, I’m in different world. So I got the ball again, and I did a no-look dummy pass to my teammate for a goal. The crowd was going crazy.<br /><br />The game ended up finishing 2-2, and we won on penalty kicks. They were so pissed. At the whistle, the bully turned to me and said, ‘I told you I was going to break your legs, kid. I’ll see you in the parking lot.’<br /><br />He was serious. It was pretty intense. I remember thinking, ‘Wow … I might not get out of here’. Luckily, though, my teammates protected me. They all gathered around me and got me to the parking lot without any trouble, and I made it home safe<br /><br />But that’s not even the end of the story. Last Christmas, I went home to see my family, and I had to go to the bank to do some paperwork. So I pull my car into the parking lot, and the guy taking the tickets in the little booth … This guy looks familiar. And he’s giving me this look, like he knows me. He hands me my ticket. But he’s still looking at me. And then he says, ‘Hey - little kid! Little kid!’ I’m looking back at him like, huh?<br /><br />He says, ‘Remember me? The Várzea, bro! I was going to break your legs!’ I’m like, Oh my god. I didn’t know what he was going to do. And then he says, ‘Man, I was really going to break your legs. Can you believe that?’. And I was trying to play it cool, like, ‘Come on, bro. No you weren’t. I know you were kidding’. And he says, ‘No, bro. No. I was really going to break your legs. And now you play for my favorite team, man! I love you, bro! I can’t believe it! Can you imagine if I had broken your legs?’ We laughed, and I took a picture with him</p>

Of course, no one plays the same way, but I think the defensive skills and the way that we try to help the team are the same.

Pep opted for Sergio and myself, just like he has done last season and I think there was only one match where we didn’t so well - but usually when we both play together we do a great job. We can indeed play together! Sergio and I have the spirit of scoring goals and always try to finish well. I’ve started this season with the aim to get better with my finishes, to keep helping the team. Pep is super intelligent and he knows what the team needs and when and of course, I’ll be always at his disposal whenever I’m called upon. I’ll always keep the same spirit. Our season started really well against Arsenal last week, especially as it was away which obviously made it even harder. We wanted to start strongly at home and our team did a great job against Huddersfield - we did what we’ve been practising and were asked to do, and the result is there.<br /><br />We don’t play to leave a message to anyone, just like last season. We play because we love doing it, we’re at a great club and we want to keep writing history for Manchester City. So we must carry on, repeat what we’ve been doing and see where it takes us.

I played eight or nine games and I didn’t score and I missed chances so I’m not happy with that. When this happens of course I cannot be happy. Sometimes football is like that. You have to keep working hard and try to score, try to help the team and work and that’s what I have done. Always I think: ‘Wow I have to score’ because I’m playing for a big club in big competitions with big players. I think it happens with other players.

I think: ‘Oh my god I have to score, I have to score, I have to score’. When I have the chance sometimes I miss because I think too much and put too much pressure on myself. I try. I’m getting better. I’m working to score and don’t think about the pressure<br /><br />I’m a blessed guy. I try all the time to do my best and sometimes I cannot do it and that’s the way. It’s important for me to score goals and keep scoring goals because I have to. I’m at a big club and play with big players. I’m in a single competition with Sergio - a friendly competition. I hope that when he plays he scores. I always want him to help the team and his team-mates. When I play he does the same, which is amazing. I have to learn from him because he’s scored a lot for the club and throughout his career. And I’m happy with 101 goals in my career</p>

  <p><b>[Gabriel Jesus not frightened of penalties despite <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> striker’s run of misses]</b> In the training sessions I take them and I score more than I miss.

When you miss three in a row you go to the next one under pressure to score. So that’s the challenge. I have in my mind that I have to train more and improve more of course.

  <p><b>[Gabriel Jesus shut down by coronavirus outbreak]</b> I think I have had a good streak, good minutes on the pitch, I started in some important matches, such as against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> in the Champions League.

Having my family and friends close also helped me a lot at the time, and then I started to live a very positive sequence that lasts until today.<br /><br /><b>[Jesus says he is happy to fit in with whatever the City boss demands]</b> I always played as a side striker who enters the area a lot, since Palmeiras I’ve been like that and I feel very good and comfortable acting like that. Of course I also play as a reference in the attack, more tucked inside the area, without any problem and I’m also used to it. But my position was always acting from the side<br /><br /><b>[Jesus says they don’t feel any extra pressure when they play in Europe]</b> I think it’s hard to talk about pressure for a team that has won as many titles as ours in recent years. We won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> twice, we won the Carabao Cup, FA Cup - so I don’t see we have the pressure to win a competition.

  <p><b>[Gabriel Jesus won’t obsess over <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> No.9 battle]</b> I don’t have a preference, but most of my life I played as a winger or a second striker, never as a main striker.

Against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> I played on the wing. Usually, when I start as a striker, I naturally tend to go for the flanks. Sometimes I get scolded, but I keep doing that!

  <p><b>[Gabriel Jesus backs Black Lives Matter movement]</b> Racism isn’t a problem that only started in recent days and it isn’t normal, so people do feel that they have had enough, and they have exploded. I’m against violence or any sort of violent protest. I’m all in favour of peaceful protests in order to say ‘no to racism’ and whenever we say ‘Black Lives Matter’, we should also read it correctly and understand the meaning behind it. We aren’t saying that other lives don’t matter, but we are saying that the lives of black people who feel racism matter. We can’t generalise it. Not everyone is racist, the majority aren’t, but lots of people are and it’s like they haven’t got brains. So, when we use that sentence it’s because we know what it is to be a victim of racism. It is painful to feel it.<br /><br />I have suffered a couple of times. I’ve managed to elevate myself <b>[above it]</b>. I’m black and I’m from a favela. I was able to learn from those experiences, but everyone reacts and feels differently and I’ve got my way. This is a very important movement, because like I said, there is a time that people do wake up and these actions <b>[police brutality]</b> that we’ve seen lately aren’t normal and they shouldn’t happen. Therefore there is a moment that we have to say ‘enough, time to stop’ and it is important to show your position on this matter and this sentence <b>[Black Lives Matter]</b> is very clear on how tired people have been exhausted for a while, tired of injustice. Social media is very important these days, but the problem is that sometimes we don’t respect each other’s opinions or views and that can create a bigger problem or hate.
