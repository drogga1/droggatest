<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former Rams cornerback Janoris Jenkins told that he was always discouraged from speaking to Kroenke and admitted that it influenced his decision to leave for the New York Giants]</b> It was always the coaches - not the owners - coming around to see the players. It was always, ‘Don’t speak to Stan Kroenke’ when I was in St. Louis. But here, in New York, everybody is everybody, everybody is treated the same. The owner just walks around and communicates with you and gives you a reason to play football. You know that you’re playing for someone that is always around and always cares, someone that you can communicate with.<br /><br />At the Rams, I felt I was just playing for my team-mates and my coaches. They said, ‘If you ever see Stan come around the facility, don’t speak to him’. Once I heard that during my rookie year, I just knew I wasn’t going to be comfortable because when he came around it was like everybody better be straightforward, nobody better look at him! It was kind of crazy</p>
