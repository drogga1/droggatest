<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp used to dream of managing of Manchester United before an opportunity at Liverpool presented itself]</b> It would be his dream to go to England one day and his favourite club would be <b>[Manchester]</b> United. That’s what he said. I said, ‘Jurgen Klopp, if he goes abroad, if he goes to England, his love would be Manchester United’.<br /><br />After three or four months not working, I knew that he wanted to be in action again … when the offer came from Liverpool <b>[that October]</b>, I knew he would not hesitate because he wanted to get into a top club in England<br /><br />The emotions in the stadium in Liverpool and the enthusiasm of the fans, the temperament there - that fits Klopp. I was not surprised that the spectators liked him right away. His emotions, the way he coaches the team, the way he jumps around, the way he shows his desire to win, that fits the club.<br /><br />The fans are little more different to Man Utd. Man Utd is more quiet, the fans love their team too but there is more emotion and more passion I think in Liverpool. And Kloppo I think is a passionate, very temperamental man. That club fits him.</p>

  <p><b>[Klopp’s predecessor at Mainz, Eckhard Krautzun, having revealed that Old Trafford had always been his favoured destination in England]</b> When it comes to his favourite club, however, Liverpool weren’t always number one. It would be his dream to go to England one day and his favourite club would be <b>[Manchester]</b> United. That’s what he said.</p>
