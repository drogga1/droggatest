  <p><b>[Neco Williams says <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a> has proven anything is possible]</b> It’s just kind of an eye-opener to prove to people that anything is possible with hard work and dedication. Trent was at the Academy from a young age and he’s gone up through the ranks. Now he’s obviously one of the best right-backs in the world and he’s playing unbelievably. So I think for all the Academy, it doesn’t matter what position, it’s just an eye-opener to prove to people that it is possible. When I’m training obviously I’m trying to focus on myself and my own game but at the same time, I’m watching Trent and trying to study how he plays also and try to take bits and parts of what he does into my game. I think that’s what I’ve been doing since I’ve been going up there <b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a>]</b>. That’s definitely improving me as a player<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he ever imagined being part of the senior squad at this stage of his career]</b> No, not at all. But obviously, with hard work and dedication, it can happen. I’m just taking it day by day, just grasping it all in. It’s unbelievable training and being with one of the best teams in the world. To train with them every day, gaining experience is improving me as a player. I’m just growing in confidence every time I train with them. It is still a bit surreal. Like when you go in training and see the players, you kind of pinch yourself and be like, ‘Am I really here?’ But as soon as you get on the grass, all your emotions go and you just focus on trying to do as best as you can<br /><br /><b>[The <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> starlet went on to credit <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>]</b> He’s been unbelievable, he’s unbelievable with all the youngsters that go up. Whenever we need help or support, he’s always there. He’ll have banter with us and treat us normally, like a normal player of his. Whoever it is - if we’re a youngster or one of his older, senior players - he treats us all the same. We all have the same banter and it’s good times up at Melwood</p>

  <p><b>[Neco Williams: How <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> unearthed another superb young right-back]</b> It’s all happened pretty fast to be honest. I’ve gone from being in the U18s side to winning <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Youth Cup to making my senior debut in the space of a few months - it’s been quite a big jump! He’s shown obviously that we have a second full-back coming. That helps us massively for the future<br /><br />I must have had a good game, because I stayed there! But playing full-back these days, it’s not the same as it was a few years back. It’s probably more attacking than defending, so to be honest I like it as much as I did playing as a winger<br /><br />Stevie was massive for me. When he came in, I got injured in pre-season. I had two little fractures in my back, and so I was out for basically six months. My first game back, my first 90 minutes, it was against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in the Youth Cup at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. That was my first ever time at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. He put his faith in me that night, and afterwards he came up to me and said I was magnificent and our best player. When you hear something like that, it makes you feel 10 feet tall</p>

  <p><b>[Neco Williams is targeting his <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> debut ahead of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s return to action]</b> I’d say that from when you’re a little kid you dream of making a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> debut so for me to make it this season would be another massive achievement. If I just keep showing the boss what I’m capable of doing and keep showing my ability in training, then hopefully he’ll give me the opportunity. I think now it’s a massive opportunity for us young lads to maybe get an opportunity, but obviously the boss knows best and if he thinks it’s the right game for us to play then for sure he’ll play us. He’ll have no hesitation in that<br /><br />The lads are looking fit and sharp now, it just feels amazing to get back into it. I think the main aim now is obviously to win the league and try to dominate every team that we play and try to get as many points as we can. For sure, all the boys are very excited for the first game and hopefully we’ll get the win. Training-wise, the boys have all been looking very sharp, we’ve got the rhythm back and we’re all looking very fit again. I think for all of us now this is the longest that we haven’t had any footy, so it just feels good to get back into it.</p>
