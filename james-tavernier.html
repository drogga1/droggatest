  <p><b>[Ibrox skipper James Tavernier has praised the club’s youngsters for the part they played as the 10-man Light Blues ground out victory]</b> You want the boys to learn off us all and learn off the coaches and make a claim for themselves. It’s their career, they’ve got everything in their hands to be very good players, so I was delighted for them and the way they’ve conducted themselves during this game. Nathan and Calvin, Rossco, who’s been on loan and he’s got his experience, and I thought Mayo was actually terrific, he was solid at the back. Really happy with them. I thought it was a good test for the boys and the majority of the game we dealt with it really well. We got ourselves in front, scored two good goals and could have scored more. Every man who came on and started the game were terrific. The young boys did a job for the team and the gaffer was really pleased with the performance</p>
