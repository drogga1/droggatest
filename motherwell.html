<blockquote>
  <p>[Celtic have confirmed that they will not be signing Motherwell teenager David Turnbull this summer after he failed a medical. Motherwell released a statement] An agreement was reached with the Glasgow club on June 12, subject to the player agreeing personal terms, which he did, and undergoing a medical. During that medical process, an issue was identified that will require David to have immediate preventative surgery and subsequent rehabilitation. Celtic were still keen to sign the player despite this matter arising. But having presented revised transfer terms to Motherwell, the clubs could not reach an agreement. David will now remain at Fir Park and will shortly have an operation, which will rule him out of any football for an extended period - the exact length to be determined following surgery. We will give David all the support he needs during this process. We wish him the best with his procedure and rehabilitation, and look forward to watching him play in claret and amber again in the near future.</p>
