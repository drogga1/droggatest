  <p><b>[Sky Sports News reporter Paul Gilmour ‘attended’ <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a>’s news conference this afternoon]</b> There was much to admire about the ‘new normal’ for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> press conferences, mainly because it eliminated the M25 journey, but it wasn’t without its teething problems. The club settings automatically switched off the mic and video meaning there was a scramble to fill the awkward silences, something <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> found increasingly amusing. <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> himself played the role of comedian at a family Zoom quiz, appearing with a virtual background. At times it threatened to overwhelm him depending on how much head movement there was but generally it held up and gave the sponsors that much needed exposure. ‘I cannot see anybody but I hope you’re all well. I miss you a lot,’ the Spaniard announced. By next week he’ll be able to see us as we strive for a personal best time in switching on the video<br /><br />We have missed him too as we were reminded of the calm, measured and impressive operator he is in front of the camera across a range of subjects. ‘It is our responsibility to make him feel this is the right next step,’ <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> said, thankfully referring to <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>’s future and not the future of the virtual press conference<br /><br />Thanks to the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> media team for adapting so well but let’s hope it’s a temporary measure. You can’t beat seeing managers and colleagues in person, not to mention the sound and picture quality is a world away from our output on Sky Sports News. Like a Zoom quiz during lockdown, the novelty will soon wear off!</p>
