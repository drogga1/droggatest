  <p><b>[Kyle Nix interview: Ex-Manchester United talent on open-heart surgery and coping with life after leaving the club of his dreams]</b> I could barely walk. When I got the phone call to say that it was a tumour, I just froze. Within 10 hours I was in hospital on nil by mouth being told I needed open-heart surgery. A 12-hour procedure. It was one of the rarest cases ever known. Even when the doctors spoke to five specialist in America, they were dumbfounded. They were baffled by it all. They took my heart out of my body, that is how intricate the surgery was. Straight away, your career is done<br /><br />Why did I get this tumour? What pressures were on me? What pressure was I putting on myself?<br /><br />I was just a bit different. I used to wear white boots when it was a bit more old school back then. I did tricks and played off the cuff. United wanted me to express myself. There was a lot of pressure on my shoulders. I remember going to meet agents with my dad every other day.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> had offered Nix a two-year scholarship followed by one year as a professional. But the lure of more money from <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, including a signing-on fee, was enough to persuade him to leave for <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Villa Park</a>. He signed terms on his 17th birthday]</b> You get advised. I had that many agents after me at the time. I went with an agent who advised me and my dad to leave. I was a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> fan and you just don’t know at that age. I was just a young kid. I had money thrown at me. These are the fine lines. It is something that I always think about<br /><br /><b>[<a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> was not the experience that he had hoped it would be]</b> It was not the same vibe at all. United felt like a family. This was a totally different environment. I had come in for big money and was being paid big money. It is different. I was probably not accepted at first looking back. Even by the coaches. I was this kid from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I had played on Sky for England. Who is this kid who thinks he’s big time? I don’t mean it in a bad way but it was knocked out of me. That changed everything. My confidence went. I just did not know how to deal with getting released by a club that had bought me. You just think that your natural progression is to go to the first team<br /><br />I refused because I felt I had already proved myself. I ended up at Mansfield<br /><br />By the mid-stage of my career, I already had massive regrets about leaving United. I was having those thoughts during my career about what might have been. I should have been buzzing but all I could think about was the fact that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> were playing there against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in the Champions League final later that month. I could have been playing in that game instead. It was hard to accept where they were at and where I had ended up. I should have been in my prime but I was full of regrets.</p>
