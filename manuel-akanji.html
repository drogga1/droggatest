  <p><b>[Man Utd target Manuel Akanji joins <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> in reported €22 million deal]</b> I felt very good in the talks with the <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> managers, so it was a decision of the heart and I’ve always liked the football played in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. I’m looking forward to the time here and will do my best</p>

  <p><b>[Akanji airs <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> ambition as he chases future transfer]</b> Many know that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> has been my favourite club since childhood. It would be nice to play there, but that’s not an issue right now. I am very satisfied in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. I want to win titles with <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a> and compete in many more big tournaments with the Swiss national team. That is likely to force <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> to look elsewhere, with any move for a Swiss star having to be put on hold as he chases down other targets in Germany. I always want to go higher, as far as possible. But planning the future is difficult. You never know what will happen. The most important thing is to stay healthy. The short-term goal for the club is to consolidate in the Champions League and to continue playing well in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. There will be setbacks along the way. Life does not always go upwards, but also downwards, not just in football. I will try to be a good person on and off the field</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund defender Manuel Akanji has revealed that new <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> signing Joelinton was his toughest opponent last season]</b> Last season, Joelinton when he was at Hoffenheim was very good. He’s now moved to <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> but he was technically good and he was fast and physically strong. He played really well against us and also scored a goal<br /><br /><b>[When asked about his best <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> team-mate]</b> <a href="marco-reus.html">Marco Reus</a>. He has incredible qualities; he’s very smart and always looking forwards. He knows that he’s not the strongest but he makes up for it with his technique and his understanding of the game. There are so many players with special qualities. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>, for example, is only 19 years old and plays with a care-free attitude that is rare. Raphael Guerreiro has incredible technique and I’m always happy when he’s in my team in training. I could list even more players though</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund defender Manuel Akanji has revealed that Raul and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> were two of his childhood idols and that he supported <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> as a boy]</b> In my childhood I had football in my head. My role models were related to my respective positions. My first role model was Raul. At the time I was still playing as an attacking player and was a fan of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. Aside from Real, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> were my favourite club. So at some point it <b>[his idol]</b> was <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. He impressed me with his performances. I only became a defender at the age of about 17. Of course there were a lot of good defenders at that time, but I didn’t have a clear role model then. <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> would be the most likely to come to mind <br /><br /><b>[The Switzerland international also revealed that now, at 24, he looks to other sports to find inspiration, believing he can learn from the mentality of other athletes]</b> As a footballer, I don’t really have any role models anymore. But there are athletes who fascinate me in terms of their attitude. For example, it’s incredible what Roger Federer has done in his career. I also watch basketball often. Russell Westbrook is my favourite player, his mentality is impressive. He gives more than 100 percent in every game, always fighting until the end. I see these types of athletes as role models today.</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund and Switzerland defender Manuel Akanji has expressed his anger and frustration at receiving online racial abuse]</b> Yes. Less in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. But on social media, I’m often racially abused. It is unbelievable how some people pour out their aggression over us. Anonymous and without consequences. I’m sure they would not dare to say it in your face. I tried to defend myself with words <br /><br /><b>[The 24-year-old also spoke on the racial abuse directed towards Inter’s <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> earlier this season]</b> I have no explanation or understanding for that. Otherwise I would do something about it. I just think it’s sad. But there are many things in the world that are thought-provoking<br /><br /><b>[Akanji also looked ahead to the upcoming Euro 2020 fixtures next summer]</b> This is a very good group and Italy will be favourites after 10 wins in qualifying. But we have very good chances to progress, which is our clear aspiration. It is certainly not optimal. But it does not matter to me, we have to play the games and win. Whether in Baku or in London<br /><br /><b>[Back home in Germany, Akanji’s <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> side moved up to third in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> after a 5-0 victory over Fortuna Dusseldorf on Saturday]</b> From my point of view, the season so far has been OK. Of course, the start could have been better. But you know how it was last season. Since we had nine points ahead of Bayern and did not bring anything afterwards. If we do it the other way round and turn it up in the second half, nobody will mind. And I remain optimistic that this will happen and we will give everything until the end</p>

  <p><b>[DFL fine <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> star for breaking coronavirus lockdown to get a haircut]</b> The DFL fines <a href="manuel-akanji.html">Manuel Akanji</a> and <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>. The <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> players had apparently violated general hygiene and infection protection standards at home hairdressing appointments, and in particular the medical and organisational concept of the DFL task force ‘Sports Medicine / Special Game Operations.<br /><br />There is no question that professional footballers have to have their hair cut. However, this currently has to be done in accordance with the medical-organisational concept. In specific cases, the club had also provided its players with a corresponding opportunity.<br /><br />In principle, the DFL does not provide any information about the amount of a penalty in contractual penalty proceedings. Players have the right to lodge a complaint within five days. The penalties are expressly not directed against the club, for which no ‘organisational fault’ is recognisable.</p>
