  <p><b>[Benjamin Pavard’s reputation remains on the rise at Stuttgart]</b> Clubs like Barca, Real, Bayern or Dortmund, that’s something to dream about, but I do not ask myself the question yet. I am in Stuttgart, I have a contract. There is an end of season to manage, the best position to secure, the national team too. We’ll see what happens in the future.<br /><br /><b>[on that decision being vindicated over the course of two productive years]</b> That’s for sure, but we can only say it was a good choice with hindsight. People thought I was going to crash. Finally we won the title. I was good and I only made progress. I play games in the Bundesliga and everything is going very well. When you look at the Bundesliga you often only see Bayern or Dortmund. Stuttgart, of course, it’s less of a dream. But for me, it’s a very good club. The stadium is full every week. It is 60,000 fans. In the second division, it was 55,000. For me, and I also think for my team-mates, that is great<br /><br />Whether I play right, left or as a centre-back, for me it’s a little bit the same. A defender must first defend well. Of course, as a left or right back, I have to attack more, but for me, it’s the same. I can play well in all these positions. For me it is not a problem. Before, there was Lilian Thuram who also played as a centre-back for his club and as a right back with the national team. I feel good as a centre-back, and I also enjoy to play on the right. So why not do the same as him?<br /><br />For me, it’s crazy. A few months ago, I did not really expect my first selection. Today, I am called again. I am really happy, it proves the confidence of the coach and I will do everything to repay him</p>

  <p><b>[France’s Benjamin Pavard reveals what was going through his head for Argentina wondergoal]</b> The ball bounced up as it came to me. I didn’t even think about it. I just tried to get over it and keep it down. I was trying to hit it in the direction it came from, which is what the strikers always tell me. I didn’t think it over, and when it went in I just felt so happy. In German, we say ‘Tor’. To hit a shot like that - I can’t describe it. I’m still feeling emotional.<br /><br />My first instinct was just to run to the dugout. For me it’s the team that wins, the 23 players and the coaching staff too. I slid on my knees and everyone came up to me. I’m not used to scoring, so I don’t have any special goal celebration<br /><br />It was for my girlfriend, who was in the stands. I called my parents after the match too, because if they hadn’t done all those kilometres for me I wouldn’t be here today. They were the ones who taught me positive determination, to give it my all, especially my father. They’ve been supporting me for a long time and this goal is a reward for them too</p>

So why not do the same career as him?.</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Pavard has stated he believes he will join the best club in the world when he signs for Bayern Munich]</b> I had a key moment, when I stood with Stuttgart in the Allianz Arena tunnel last season. I saw the Bayern players sitting next to me and felt the atmosphere, I knew: ‘I want to play there someday’<br /><br />The change was not a question of money for me. I love Germany, the mentality, the Bundesliga. That’s why I really wanted to stay here. When FC Bayern’s offer came, I did not have to think for a second. Bayern is for me the best club in the world. I want to continue the history of this club, win many titles there. Bayern can definitely win the Champions League<br /><br />I like to play as a centre-back, but if the coach sees me right behind or six, that will not be a problem for me, I’ll adapt<br /><br />I have always been honest with Stuttgart, I have not played any games, I will sacrifice myself for VfB until the last day so we can stay in the Bundesliga</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Pavard has urged his France international team-mate Lucas Hernandez to join him at Bayern Munich]</b> We are very good friends and I think it would be fantastic if Lucas also came to Bayern.

  <p><b>[France star Pavard reveals he ‘could not refuse’ Bavarians]</b> Some fans do not understand because Bayern is an enemy club. They were angry at me, but deep down, they know it’s the best opportunity. Bayern, I could not refuse them. For me, it’s the best club in the Bundesliga, one of the best clubs in the world, if not the best. I’ve always believed in myself, I have confidence in my qualities. There are people who doubt me, but not me. I want to show that I do not doubt myself.<br /><br /><b>[On Lucas Hernandez]</b> I hope he’s coming because he’s a very good friend and a footballer with a lot of potential. He showed it in club and at the World Cup. I’ve sent him some messages, because it would be a very good thing for Munich<br /><br /><b>[On Didier Deschamps squad]</b> I am at the disposal of the coach. If he puts me in central defence, I will give myself thoroughly. If he puts me on the right, the same. I will do everything to be in the list in March</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Pavard says <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> fans can expect a successful season]</b> We were strong, we defended very well, attacked very well. We scored three goals. We conceded a goal, which is annoying, but it does not matter. We just must remember the fact we won. We feel better and better. Of course, it’s a very big club, which has a habit of winning a lot of titles. We know that if we lose one or two matches in the season, it’s a kind of a little crisis. But I don’t worry: we really have a very good squad and a great atmosphere. It will be okay. I have a lot of confidence. There is a very good atmosphere. On the pitch, we can see that everyone takes pleasure. We are making every effort together.</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Pavard says <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> will make the difference for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> once he is fully up to speed]</b> A little wizard! He is very discreet and really personable. First of all, a really fine guy. And of course a very good footballer. It’s very hard to get him off the ball. He’s not 100 per cent yet - he probably needs some more games because he joined the team very late. But I’m sure, in a few weeks, we will see the world-class footballer <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>. Of course <b>[he can make the difference]</b>. I now know him from a few training sessions and I have no doubt about that. He has incredible quality and will show it to everyone</p>

He tells me that everything is fine. After, what happens between <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> and the France team, it’s not my problem.

All of a sudden, a lot more people knew my name after the World Cup and since I started playing at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, it has increased again. I am under closer scrutiny, but that doesn’t bother me. I’ve always dreamed of winning titles. I won the World Cup, the biggest title ever - but I don’t rest on that.<br /><br />When I’m on the pitch, I’m happy - whether as a right-back or a centre-back. Apart from that, I prefer to play in central defense. Overall, I see myself as a defensive player who can be used flexibly. I think it’s very important and helpful for a coach that I can play in all four positions in defense<br /><br /><b>[Pavard admits it would be strange to lift a league title without supporters around to celebrate]</b> We would rather win the title in front of our fans, after all we play for them to make them happy. In addition, the fans are our 12th man and incredibly important to us. But it is also important that football continues. We are all competitors who want to win titles in the end. So we’ll do everything we can to get as many titles as possible, even if it wouldn’t be the same in front of empty stands</p>
