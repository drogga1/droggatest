  <p><b>[Benjamin Pavard says Bayern Munich fans can expect a successful season]</b> We were strong, we defended very well, attacked very well. We scored three goals. We conceded a goal, which is annoying, but it does not matter. We just must remember the fact we won. We feel better and better. Of course, it’s a very big club, which has a habit of winning a lot of titles. We know that if we lose one or two matches in the season, it’s a kind of a little crisis. But I don’t worry: we really have a very good squad and a great atmosphere. It will be okay. I have a lot of confidence. There is a very good atmosphere. On the pitch, we can see that everyone takes pleasure. We are making every effort together.</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Pavard says <a href="lucas-hernandez.html">Lucas Hernandez</a> would only link up with France’s national team if he was fully fit]</b> If he’s here, it means that he’s fit. Bayern didn’t want to take any chances. He tells me that everything is fine. After, what happens between Bayern and the France team, it’s not my problem. When he goes on X-rays, I don’t know what Lucas has on his knees! He said he could play on one leg. It’s Lucas, we all know he’s a warrior. If he’s here, he can play</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Pavard relishes the opportunity his impending move to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> provides]</b> Some fans do not understand because Bayern is an enemy club. They were angry at me, but deep down, they know it’s the best opportunity. Bayern, I could not refuse them. For me, it’s the best club in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, one of the best clubs in the world, if not the best. I’ve always believed in myself, I have confidence in my qualities</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Pavard says <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> will make the difference for <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> once he is fully up to speed]</b> A little wizard! He is very discreet and really personable. First of all, a really fine guy. And of course a very good footballer. It’s very hard to get him off the ball. He’s not 100 per cent yet - he probably needs some more games because he joined the team very late. But I’m sure, in a few weeks, we will see the world-class footballer <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a>. Of course <b>[he can make the difference]</b>. I now know him from a few training sessions and I have no doubt about that. He has incredible quality and will show it to everyone</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich right-back Benjamin Pavard has said that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> is the toughest opponent he’s faced in his career]</b> I won the World Cup title and play at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, one of the largest clubs in the world, because people pay more attention to you. All of a sudden, a lot more people knew my name after the World Cup and since I started playing at Bayern, it has increased again. I am under closer scrutiny, but that doesn’t bother me. I’ve always dreamed of winning titles. I won the World Cup, the biggest title ever - but I don’t rest on that.<br /><br />When I’m on the pitch, I’m happy - whether as a right-back or a centre-back. Apart from that, I prefer to play in central defense. Overall, I see myself as a defensive player who can be used flexibly. I think it’s very important and helpful for a coach that I can play in all four positions in defense<br /><br /><b>[Pavard admits it would be strange to lift a league title without supporters around to celebrate]</b> We would rather win the title in front of our fans, after all we play for them to make them happy. In addition, the fans are our 12th man and incredibly important to us. But it is also important that football continues. We are all competitors who want to win titles in the end. So we’ll do everything we can to get as many titles as possible, even if it wouldn’t be the same in front of empty stands</p>

  <p><b>[Benjamin Pavard says that <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> have set their sights on a historic treble this season]</b> We have a very good squad. We are performing well in the cup and in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. We must continue like this. Bayern must win the championship and the cup every year. The UCL, we dream of it and we want to make the treble<br /><br />I think that since I am at Bayern, I have progressed a lot defensively, but especially offensively. I have to keep scoring, that was my weak point before. But there I progressed. But my first role remains to defend well. There is no particular aim. The goal is to play as many matches as possible, to be in starting XI and win titles, to be as efficient as possible too<br /><br />I signed for five years at Bayern. I play my matches, I am performing and I will do everything to improve further. I want to win a lot of titles. I don’t know yet what the future holds, we know that in football it can go very quickly, but I don’t ask myself many questions</p>
