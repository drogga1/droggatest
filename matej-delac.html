  <p><b>[Former Blues goalkeeper Matej Delac believes that <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a> is the greatest goalkeeper to ever play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> Petr helped me a lot, especially the first two years when I arrived. Everything was new to me and it was not easy to adapt to English football when you come from the lower divisions in Croatia. So he helped me with advice and everything. He even found me a club <b>[to go on loan to]</b> in the Czech Republic. It was he who found me the club. Yes, he helped me a lot. I am still in contact with him. He is a very important guy in my career.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Blues goalkeeper Matej Delac used to test his penalty-saving skills against <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> in training and he sees similarities between the Belgian’s strategy and that of <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a>]</b> It was very difficult against <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>. At the last moment, he used to look at the goalkeeper. He waited for the goalkeeper before taking the last step. It was the same as <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> is doing now at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.<br /><br />Most goalkeepers will make a movement already ahead of his step. In that split-second, the penalty-taker will have the time he needs to choose the right side. This movement <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> makes looks funny but it stops him from missing. It is a good technique for him but it’s a difficult one to master. It is down to the pure quality of the player because not everybody has that calmness to take a penalty like that. He just chooses the side at the last second. I find it difficult to guess which he’s going to go.<br /><br />If you stay in the middle until the last moment, then he can easily put it in the corner because of the distance. You have that mental game with him. But there’s no doubt that he is now the man at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He is the best penalty-taker they have</p>
