  <p><b>[Delac, who has featured on a temporary basis in the Netherlands, Portugal, France, Belgium, Serbia and his native Bosnia since joining Chelsea]</b> Currently I am in London, and have been since July 1, training with another 15 players who are waiting for a loan or transfer. <b>[Mario]</b> Pasalic was also with us until recently but he has moved to the first team. It is true all of us players on loan are in a special Whatsapp group, where we regularly get information on who played best that matchday, who was especially good, who played how many minutes, who scored… everything. But mostly people from the club point out the guy who was the best that weekend<br /><br />My best experience in Chelsea? There were moments I will remember for life, such as my only appearance for Chelsea, 45 minutes vs Olimpija in Ljubljana. You know, I can’t get a work permit in England, that is why I can’t go on loan to an English club. We all dream of playing in the Premier League, but it is not possible without a work permit. I am 24 and I’ve been through a lot. Of course, at the age of 18 I was not ready for the biggest leagues. But I’ve learned a lot and have no regrets</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea goalkeeper Matej Delac has admitted he is looking for a way out of Stamford Bridge]</b> Yes, soon will come a time I’ll have to leave Chelsea. Many people ask me do I regret coming to Chelsea so young, and not joining some smaller club, but I feel no regret. Your career can always be better, but I am 25 and have been through so much, met many coaches, players, gained experience. The problem was not my quality, Chelsea believed in me, extended my contract several times, but the problem was always work permit<br /><br />Chelsea had a plan for my career, but you can not plan some things. As I arrived, aged 18, it seemed like some movie, I can’t describe that feeling. I will remember the greatness of Chelsea FC, they raised me and taught me human and football manners. And of course my first game, in Ljubljana vs Olimpija, when I played with Fabregas, Costa.<br /><br />Conte is great worker, professional, even when Chelsea is not doing well, I know it is just a phase and Conte will find a way out</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea’s longest-serving player, Matej Delac, leaves with no appearances and no regrets]</b> It is very interesting to write and read about it <b>[my career]</b>. Maybe it will be strange to not come back to Chelsea in the summer for pre-season, in between loans. In eight years, I think I had seven pre-seasons with the club. Just one where I was already out because I went on loan early. It will be a little bit strange, but it was the life I had. It was a good eight years, you can always say that things could have gone better or worse, but I will always say that I am happy with these eight years. Yes, I said goodbye to the guys in the loan WhatsApp group and they said ‘good luck’. That’s it! This is a great opportunity for me after my time at Chelsea. It was not an easy time, as I’ve not played for the past year. I had offers but I decided not to accept them because they were either not good for my career or my family. We have a baby now, so I also wanted to go to a good country with a good league. In Denmark, we have done it. Maybe some will think it might be a problem that I didn’t play for one year. However, I know that the manager and the goalkeeping coach believe in me and so I will have really big help from them.<br /><br />Petr really helped me a lot, especially the first two years when I arrived. Everything was new to me and it was not easy to adapt to English football when you come from a lesser league like in Croatia. So he helped me with advice and everything. He even found me a loan club in Czech Republic. It was he who found me the club. He helped me a lot. I am still in contact with him. He is a very important guy in my career. I worked most with Christophe Lollichon, he is the French goalkeeping coach who came with Petr Cech and I worked with him for eight years. He helped bring me into Chelsea so he was also one of the other most important people in my career. Nemanja <b>[Matic]</b>, I played with him on loan in Vitesse. Nemanja helped me a lot in my first year outside of Croatia. Uros Matic <b>[Nemanja’s brother at Copenhagen]</b> has text me to say welcome to Denmark, I look forward to playing him<br /><br />All the people working on the loan system are following every player closely and they also helped me. They are analysing and giving us feedback on the matches. They come to visit you at the club. Some people say, you are just going to Chelsea to be on loan, but to be part of Chelsea was a big thing. We are not all so perfect that we can play for Chelsea immediately, just 23 players are registered and everyone else is looking for his bit of luck. I think when Chelsea call you, it is difficult to say no. Chelsea have a really good plan for everyone, but it is not easy to come into the first team. This is the highest level of football so I think that they are doing really well with their loan system. It is getting better and better. Last season, we even had a pre-season with the loan group, we had friendly games so the players were ready to go away to somewhere else and play. Jamal Blackman, Mario Pasalic, Stipe Perica, and Milan Lalkovic. I made a lot of friends in my time at Chelsea<br /><br />My main ambition in my professional career was to come to England. Before Chelsea came along, I had already had some offers. England was my dream so I am hoping that Croatia will finally get these work permits and that I can come back to England, this is my dream. Even if I am not with Chelsea anymore, I will not stop dreaming about it <b>[playing in English football]</b>. I will now concentrate on Horsens, show myself, play and then you never know. Your football career can change very quickly<br /><br />Jamal Blackman is doing very, very well in Sheffield United this season. Maybe it won’t be this year <b>[that he debuts]</b> but Chelsea extended his contract so they believe him. He is an English guy and he has all the things that he needs. You never know, maybe one year more on loan at a better club and he will be ready for the first team. For a goalkeeper, it is different and only one can play. To be part of the team, to be number two, he can do it. He has all he needs to play</p>

  <p><b>[Former Blues goalkeeper Matej Delac used to test his penalty-saving skills against <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> in training and he sees similarities between the Belgian’s strategy and that of <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a>]</b> It was very difficult against <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>. At the last moment, he used to look at the goalkeeper. He waited for the goalkeeper before taking the last step. It was the same as <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> is doing now at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.<br /><br />Most goalkeepers will make a movement already ahead of his step. In that split-second, the penalty-taker will have the time he needs to choose the right side. This movement <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> makes looks funny but it stops him from missing. It is a good technique for him but it’s a difficult one to master. It is down to the pure quality of the player because not everybody has that calmness to take a penalty like that. He just chooses the side at the last second. I find it difficult to guess which he’s going to go.<br /><br />If you stay in the middle until the last moment, then he can easily put it in the corner because of the distance. You have that mental game with him. But there’s no doubt that he is now the man at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He is the best penalty-taker they have</p>
