  <p><b>[Intermilan captain Samir Handanovic fired a broadside that seemed to be aimed at unwanted stars Mauro Icardi and Radja Nainggolan when he called for players to respect their duties towards the club]</b> We are happy that Lele Oriali has returned as team manager, because he is the link between the club and squad, he sees everything. He is here because we want to get back to having the values that were lost over the years. Players have duties towards the club too, they can’t just think they are allowed to do anything because they are talented. With Oriali’s return and Conte in charge, we can improve a great deal<br /><br /><b>[The future remains unclear for Icardi and Nainggolan, but Handanovic indicated his support for the club’s decision to let both players leave]</b> The club has been clear in its position. I do not need to add anything more<br /><br /><b>[He went on to speak about his approach to captaining the team]</b> I feel great pride in wearing the captain’s armband. My attitude has not changed, though. A captain is someone who takes responsibility and speaks when he has to, trying always to be fair. It takes many captains in a team, as one is not enough</p>

  <p><b>[Samir Handanovic is desperate to win trophies with Intermilan because You cannot live off memories]</b> It was a great evening. It went well which is what mattered most. It was a tough moment. It was all in one night. It was all riding on that game. It was an exciting and great night. We enjoyed it. It is nice to look back at that game, of course. It’s nice to think about it, but you cannot live off memories.<br /><br />Joining Inter is a dream for every player. Every ambitious player aims for the top. Inter back then was the top club in Europe, in the world. It was an amazing joy, I was very proud. It was also a big personal challenge. It was like a dream<br /><br />Everyone is aware of what is going on. We’re following the rules, staying at home and doing what we’re being told to do. Obviously, there’s a bit of worry, but this is normal. It’s difficult to stay focused, but we’re training at home. We’re also watching old videos or matches on TV and staying in touch. As is also the case with many other teams, videos have been sent by the coaches so we can continue to train. Aside from this, I’m with my family and have been playing cards and chess. I’ve also been doing some reading and watching TV in the evening with my children</p>
