  <p><b>[Tottenham’s Dele Alli says the hurt the club suffered in Saturday’s Champions League final defeat to Liverpool will drive them forward next season]</b> It’s heart-breaking, no-one is really speaking. It’s time to reflect on what could have been. At the same time, and it’s difficult now, but we also have to look at how far we’ve come in reaching this final. It’s hard to take the positives right now but over time, players, staff and fans, when we look back at the journey together… This isn’t the end. We have to keep working, keep improving and take the feeling we have now of disappointment, that hurt, and use it to drive us on. It’s been an amazing journey and I’d just like to say thanks to the fans for all their support. I’m sorry we couldn’t get over the final hurdle, but it’s a great learning curve and as I said, we have to keep this feeling inside of us, this hurt and take it into next season.</p>

  <p><b>[Dele Alli believes he ‘improved’ during the 2018-19 campaign despite seeing fitness struggles impact his playing time and end product]</b> It’s been a great season for learning for me. It’s been the first when I’ve had muscle injuries, so that was difficult, but I’ve kept working hard. I haven’t scored as many goals or got as many assists but other parts of my game, defensively, in possession, not just getting on the end of things and finishing chances, I think I’ve improved on that. So next season, hopefully, it will all come together and I’ll get the goals, assists and keep the other parts of my game in the build-up play.<br /><br /><b>[Alli will need to rediscover his spark if he is to remain integral to the plans of <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> and Gareth Southgate]</b> Nobody can get too comfortable. We’ve got Ruben <b>[<a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Loftus-Cheek</a>]</b> and Cal <b>[Hudson-Odoi]</b> who have had some bad injuries but I’m sure they will come back stronger. They are great players. The squad, the starting 11 isn’t secure, everyone wants to keep working hard and that’s important to keep pushing on as a team. Every game you play you want to get into the starting 11 and into the team, but you know if you take your foot off the gas there’s players, even in the U21s who are doing well at the clubs, who are ready so you have to keep working hard<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on that injury]</b> Fabian Delph’s head broke my hand. They said I could have had an operation when it first happened, but I would have had to miss a few weeks. It’s not fully healed yet, but this was the last game they said I’d need the cast. I won’t need the op, it’s healing well. He went on to say of his plans from this point: ‘I have a schedule from the club and it’s important I keep ticking over. I’ll put my feet up for a week or so, then back to work and make sure I’m ready for pre-season’</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham Hotspur’s Dele Alli says he has set himself targets in terms of goals and assists as he looks to cement his place in the Spurs team]</b> I’m not one for setting targets for goals and assists but I want to bring them back into my game. So of course, I’ve set myself a little target. I want to perform in every game, not just the big games. I feel good. I haven’t had any problems during pre-season. I’m feeling strong, I’m feeling fit. So, yes, I’m excited<br /><br /><b>[Alli believes pressure on his place is part and parcel of being a big-name player at an elite club]</b> As top players we want to be challenging ourselves. We don’t want to stay still or think this is as good as we are going to get. We want to keep pushing on and having top competition. There are top players here and the players that are not in the starting 11 are training hard and working hard every day. Everyone is fighting to keep their places.<br /><br /><b>[Spurs reached the Champions League final last year, but Alli knows the team must strive to be better]</b> Last year the Champions League was a big achievement for us. We were disappointed we didn’t go all the way and win it but we are going to have to channel that hurt we felt in that game and keep improving. We are not the finished article. We know that. We’ve got things to improve on</p>

  <p><b>[Dele Alli is hoping to improve on his tally of 15 goals and assists from last season]</b> Obviously because of my first two seasons and the amount of goals and assists I managed to get, people expect that to be my game. But as a midfielder, I don’t think that’s just what it’s all about. We have defensive work as well, making space for other players and getting goals and assists as well. That’s what I judge my game on. I do more for the team defensively. Maybe not getting as many goals and assists, but that’s not important to me. I make sure I help the team and try to keep my place in the starting eleven. I’m learning every year as a player and I feel more complete<br /><br /><b>[While he shoulders more responsibility on the pitch than at the beginning of his Spurs career, he doesn’t think he is too different off it]</b> As a person, I haven’t changed. I’ve always been the same. I think I’m a more established player now, people know who I am a lot more but as a person, I’m as hungry as I always was when I first came here. I still want to achieve a lot more and that won’t stop. Every year I’ve learned so much with the players I’m playing with and the coaching staff. I feel like I’m in a great place to continue learning. I’m still young and excited to keep learning and improving as a player. It would be nice to get a few more goals and assists this season but that’s not what my whole game is based on</p>

  <p><b>[Dele Alli has revealed his excitement at the prospect of playing alongside new recruit Tanguy Ndombele]</b> He seems like a very nice guy. Obviously we haven’t spent too much time together yet. He’s settled in very well - and fast - which is always good. He seems like an attacking player, you know it’ll be a pleasure to play with him. He looks to go forward quick, he’s strong, physical and very good on the ball as well. So, I’m excited by him<br /><br /><b>[Though content to play anywhere in Spurs’s midfield, the England international is clearly hoping for more than the five league goals he managed last season]</b> I know it’s a bit of a cliche, but I think when you’re playing for a team like Tottenham with so many amazing players, you’re happy to be playing anywhere just to help the team. But you know I like getting goals and assists, playing higher up - if I’m needed. I enjoy that, but I think it varies depending on the game as well. Playing in different positions, sometimes you see the space in between the lines higher up, or sometimes it’s better to get the ball deeper. So I’m happy to play anywhere in the midfield row<br /><br /><b>[Having ended last season with defeat in the Champions League final to Liverpool, Alli admits the loss was extremely difficult to take]</b> It was difficult, obviously, losing the game after all the hard work it was <b>[to get there]</b>. It was a hard time, but we had international <b>[matches]</b> afterwards so we had to switch our focus as quickly as possible and try to prepare for that. But, obviously, it’s difficult with it being such a big competition - and to lose in the final was hard to take. But I think as a team and individually we have to remember the feelings we had after that game. It was a horrible feeling and we have to channel that in the right way, try to use it to our benefit in the future</p>

  <p><b>[When asked who his idols were when he was younger]</b> Ronaldinho. And then Steven Gerrard. I used to watch a lot of YouTube clips of Ronaldinho when I was in school. <b>[I liked]</b> the way he enjoyed playing, he always looked like he was having fun. And that was the way I wanted to play as well. I’ve grown up playing a lot of street football, it was always fun and enjoyable and it was all about tricks and things like that. So when I started playing professionally I didn’t want to fall out of love with the game. I wanted to do what made me happy and you could see that with Ronaldinho. In everything he’s done, he looked like he was enjoying it. And then Steven Gerrard. His attitude and his mentality - his winning mentality. He was captain for England and Liverpool and you could see how much he wanted to win every game, so I felt like I could relate to both players<br /><br /><b>[Alli made his professional debut for League One side MK Dons back in 2012 when he was just 16]</b> I think it was important when I was younger that I spent a lot of time playing against older players in League One. That prepared me for when I stepped into the Premier League and it built my character and made me stronger - I knew I had to fight for things, that was important. I knew it was a big league, the Premier League, and that it was a tough league with a lot of big players. So when I first came in it was important that I showed myself and that I couldn’t be bullied on the pitch - and I was ready for that</p>

Dele Alli calls on <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to show more maturity after <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> draw]</b> Being 2-0 up we have to be more relentless defensively and a little more mature in the way we played in the second half. We knew with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> getting the goal before half time they were going to come out and push for the second goal, which does create space for us to counter-attack. But at the same time we have to be cleverer with our defending and we’re obviously disappointed. I think the boys played very well in the first half. Obviously this isn’t an easy place to come, you just have to be a bit cleverer with the way you play. But we showed great character to not lose in the end because of the amount of possession they had. They are a talented team. Obviously we are disappointed but there are a few positives to take<br /><br /><b>[The England international came off the bench at the Emirates and was happy to be back in the fold after a lot of hard work behind the scenes]</b> It felt good to be back today and I’d been doing a lot of hard work in training to ensure I’d come back ready, we were disappointed with the result but it is nice to be back. I think we’ve had some tough games to start. A point away at City is a good one, if you look at today we should’ve left with three, but it’s only a good point if we win the next game</p>

I think it is great that people are using social media and different platforms to find ways to try and help any way they can<br /><br />Being stuck at home on your birthday isn’t the most ideal thing, but I made as much fun of it as I could. It was a little bit of fun, I tried to keep it light-hearted. We’ve been doing a Zoom session every morning at 11 o’clock, which is good because it keeps us in a routine. You have to get up early, eat well and do those sessions, which have been tough but also good as you get to see the boys every day.<br /><br />Everyone realises how much they are helping; we cannot thank them enough for their dedication and they deserve all the credit they are going to get. It’s a real eye-opener, not only for footballers but for everyone. We take everything for granted, even being able to leave the house, let alone going to training every day and doing something I love so much. I will always be grateful for it.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham star Dele Alli plays part in biggest-ever esports charity event]</b> Proud to join the Gamers Without Borders tournament. I feel a lot more nervous playing in this than I do in stadiums! I think because I’m more used to that as obviously I grew up playing football. It’s very tough. They’re very good but I’m trying!</p>

  <p><b>[Alli admits <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> have not been good enough in Premier League]</b> We are excited as it was an unexpected break having the season cut midway through. From a <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> point of view we were not doing well enough before the break and we know that but we’ve all come back to training hungry and we want to improve. Everyone is excited so we just need to dig in</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham midfielder <a href="dele-alli.html">Alli</a> banned for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> clash after mocking coronavirus in social media video]</b> <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> has been suspended for one match with immediate effect, fined £50,000 and must undertake an education course following a breach of FA Rule E3. The <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham Hotspur</a> player denied that a social media post breached FA Rule E3(1), as it was insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute, and constituted an ‘Aggravated Breach’, which is defined in FA Rule E3(2), as it included a reference, whether express or implied, to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin and/or nationality. However, it was subsequently found proven by an independent Regulatory Commission.<br /><br />It was not <a href="fa.html">the FA</a>’s case that <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> was a racist. The FA’s case was that ‘without sufficient thought’, the player shared a video that depicted an ‘unacceptable racist stereotype’ in a misguided attempt at humour<br /><br />He was selected, argued <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> for his appearance and not because there had been any coughing. That ‘targeting’ was said to be consistent with a racial stereotyping of persons of Asian appearance being connected with coronavirus</p>

  <p><b>[Dele Alli, 24, put a video on Snapchat in February in which he joked about the outbreak and appeared to mock an Asian man]</b> In response to <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> decision, I would like to apologise again for any offence caused by my behaviour. It was an extremely poorly judged joke about a virus that has now affected us more than we could ever have imagined. I’m grateful that <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> has confirmed that my actions were not racist because I despise racism of any kind. We all need to be mindful of the words and actions we use and how they can be perceived by others</p>
