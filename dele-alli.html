  <p><b>[Dele Alli has hit back at those to have branded him a cheat]</b> No one wants to be labelled as a cheat. They are just opinions and everyone’s is different. I get into the box and around the box a lot and I’m an attacking player so I get fouled a lot. That’s the beauty of football. It’s the beauty of football. It’s all about opinions, but the main ones that matters to me are my families and coaches. I’m confident in what I believe in, what they believe in and what the manager sees.<br /><br />There are some that look bad. But it’s different when you are in the action. The one at Crystal Palace, that’s the one I saw a lot of reaction to, I was running through and, at the time, all was going through my head was that I didn’t want to step on the keeper. But when you watch it back and people start saying stuff, it can look a lot different</p>

  <p><b>[Spurs striker Harry Kane backed by Dele Alli in goal claim row]</b> Harry is an unbelievable striker. To be honest he touched it so it’s his goal and every striker would and should claim it if it is their goal. He has just got to ignore what everyone else is saying, he knows how good he is and I am sure everyone else knows how good he is. Everyone is different, I don’t know how H is going to take it, but I think it gives some people a chance to put him down. But playing with him every day in training I can see how hard he works, he wants goals, he’s a striker, every striker wants goals, so he has just got to ignore it and focus on himself which I am sure he will do. He is an unbelievable player and he is a great person as well. If it was me and I touched the ball, I would try and claim it as well.<br /><br />I wouldn’t put it past him, we have seen what he has done before. Last year against <b>[Romelu]</b> Lukaku it was a tough competition and he finished the season really strongly with the amount of goals he scored. Salah is in great form. That can’t be H’s main focus, we are a team and we have got to play together and if he does it he does it and we will all be happy for him, but I don’t think we are going to focus too much on it</p>

  <p><b>[Alli pledges to be England World Cup role model]</b> I’ve made mistakes in the earlier part of my career - you have to make them in order to learn from them. But if you look at my record, I have definitely learned from my mistakes. I’ve got everything under control, that’s not what I’m worrying about. You have to stay concentrated, you can’t do stupid things. And if you do, you have to learn from your mistakes, that’s just the way it is. You don’t want to put yourself in a position where you could lose the game for your team when you’re on international duty. I want to play with passion, I want to play with hunger in every game.<br /><br />This is not a new position for me. For my whole time at MK Dons I was playing there. It wasn’t really until I signed for Tottenham that I started playing in the No. 10 role, a bit higher up the pitch. I enjoy playing there, but when you’ve got the Three Lions on your jersey, then you will play anywhere you’re needed. Yes, it’s a battleground and there’s a lot of different challenges. There are a lot of great players in the squad for Gareth to choose from. On the day of the games everyone will be ready, so you’re not just concentrating on one position. Wherever you’re needed, you have to be ready to step in.</p>

  <p><b>[Dele Alli has admitted he is not happy with his overall performance against Sweden]</b> When you look at it like that. It is great <b>[to be the youngest scorer since Owen]</b>, but the most important thing is the team today. As a player you want to score goals. As an attacking player, you do get frustrated but I knew it would come. I knew I would get a chance. When it comes, it was important that I took it. Yes, I think so. As a team we are playing well though. I don’t think that I personally played that great today, but I think the team was resilient, defended well and we dominated the game. Obviously, it is always nice to score but more important is the team. I think in the first half I wasn’t as sharp or as good on the ball as I should have been. As I say, you have those games, but thankfully the team was resilient and defended well. The players around me were good.<br /><br />To be so dominant, to create and be so patient shows maturity in our play. Sweden are a tough team to play against and they showed that in their other games but in the end it was a good night for us. I think it is important to want to achieve a lot more. I think that is a great thing to be hungry, it is a hungry squad. You want to achieve and keep improving together. We are not the finished article but we are in the semi-finals of the World Cup and we are excited<br /><br /><b>[A member of MK Dons’ squad just three years ago, Alli admits that at times his meteoric rise feels like a dream]</b> It is great. There are times when I think about how far I have come. I think is it real?. At the same time, I think every decision I have made, everything I have done until now shows I have been working for it. Every day I have been working to improve so I hope I can go further. It feels really good. It gives you the shivers when you think about the reaction back home. I think we owe them a lot of thanks for the way they are supporting us. We have seen the reaction to the squad and it has been unbelievable and we hopefully have many more great memories to come</p>

It’s a nice gesture from the chairman because I had a few years left on my old contract, but nothing changes, I’m still going to keep working as hard as I am and keep fighting and being a part of this team.<br /><br />I owe a lot of thanks to Poch for where I am at the minute in my career. Him and Jesus (Perez) and Miggy (Miguel D’Agostino) and Toni (Jimenez) are keen to keep it improving and heading in the right direction. I can’t think of a better place for a player of my age and where I am in my career, to have such amazing support and coaching staff to help me to keep improving<br /><br /><b>[Tottenham will visit north London rivals Arsenal in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals]</b> Another London derby.

  <p><b>[Dele Alli says Tottenham must use victory over Chelsea as a springboard ahead of a critical run of fixtures]</b> We have to keep that as our level. We can’t drop off, and we have to improve as well. We’ve got a busy month and some really tough fixtures, and it gives us confidence going into those games that we can beat anyone. Chelsea are a top side, they have some amazing players and they’ve been in great form as well. So to perform the way we did, to dominate the game so much, to have so many chances, we’ve got to keep that up. Like I said, we just need to keep this form up and improve, not drop off or take our foot off the pedal just because we got a good win. We just have to go into the next games, we know how important they are, just focus on the next game, take the positives from this game, and there are still things we need to improve on.<br /><br />I think working with Poch you know how good he is. He’s an amazing manager tactically. A lot of it was the work we did tactically: on the front foot, pushing up high. He’s managing the squad well, rotating when he needs to, picking the players that he feels are best on that day. That’s important for the team, to have players that are fresh and ready to go. Everyone knows their roles and responsibilities. He makes it very clear what you have to do. So going into the game, you know your role and what you have to do. You don’t have to worry about anything else, your football is natural, it’s what you’ve been doing for a long time. So as long as we’re clear on our roles and responsibilities, we can enjoy playing</p>

We definitely believe we can be the best in the world. Obviously, everyone will have their opinions but the work we’ve been putting in is to achieve that. We know there’s a long way to go, a lot of work to be done but we feel we are definitely heading in the right direction. The Nations League tournament has had some unbelievable teams in it. Look at our group (Spain and Croatia) and see how tough it was. It’s exciting for us to try to win another trophy. We’re looking forward to it, prepare properly, focus on the Euro 2020 games first and then obviously when the time comes, prepare as well as we can for the Nations League. But we’ve proved so far since Gareth <b>[Southgate]</b> came in that we can beat the top sides and everyone can see the direction we’re heading in which is exciting. We had a great World Cup but it was important to show with the results after that it was not just a one-off. We are a good team, I think we’ve shown that and we have beaten some good teams.

It’s been the first when I’ve had muscle injuries, so that was difficult, but I’ve kept working hard. I haven’t scored as many goals or got as many assists but other parts of my game, defensively, in possession, not just getting on the end of things and finishing chances, I think I’ve improved on that.

  <p><b>[Dele Alli has revealed his excitement at the prospect of playing alongside new recruit <a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Tanguy Ndombele</a>]</b> He seems like a very nice guy. Obviously we haven’t spent too much time together yet. He’s settled in very well - and fast - which is always good. He seems like an attacking player, you know it’ll be a pleasure to play with him. He looks to go forward quick, he’s strong, physical and very good on the ball as well. So, I’m excited by him<br /><br /><b>[Though content to play anywhere in <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>’s midfield, the England international is clearly hoping for more than the five league goals he managed last season]</b> I know it’s a bit of a cliche, but I think when you’re playing for a team like <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> with so many amazing players, you’re happy to be playing anywhere just to help the team. But you know I like getting goals and assists, playing higher up - if I’m needed. I enjoy that, but I think it varies depending on the game as well. Playing in different positions, sometimes you see the space in between the lines higher up, or sometimes it’s better to get the ball deeper. So I’m happy to play anywhere in the midfield row<br /><br /><b>[Having ended last season with defeat in the Champions League final to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, Alli admits the loss was extremely difficult to take]</b> It was difficult, obviously, losing the game after all the hard work it was <b>[to get there]</b>. It was a hard time, but we had international <b>[matches]</b> afterwards so we had to switch our focus as quickly as possible and try to prepare for that. But, obviously, it’s difficult with it being such a big competition - and to lose in the final was hard to take. But I think as a team and individually we have to remember the feelings we had after that game. It was a horrible feeling and we have to channel that in the right way, try to use it to our benefit in the future</p>

I knew it was a big league, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and that it was a tough league with a lot of big players. So when I first came in it was important that I showed myself and that I couldn’t be bullied on the pitch - and I was ready for that</p>

Dele Alli calls on <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to show more maturity after <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> draw]</b> Being 2-0 up we have to be more relentless defensively and a little more mature in the way we played in the second half. We knew with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> getting the goal before half time they were going to come out and push for the second goal, which does create space for us to counter-attack. But at the same time we have to be cleverer with our defending and we’re obviously disappointed. I think the boys played very well in the first half. Obviously this isn’t an easy place to come, you just have to be a bit cleverer with the way you play. But we showed great character to not lose in the end because of the amount of possession they had. They are a talented team. Obviously we are disappointed but there are a few positives to take<br /><br /><b>[The England international came off the bench at the Emirates and was happy to be back in the fold after a lot of hard work behind the scenes]</b> It felt good to be back today and I’d been doing a lot of hard work in training to ensure I’d come back ready, we were disappointed with the result but it is nice to be back. I think we’ve had some tough games to start. A point away at City is a good one, if you look at today we should’ve left with three, but it’s only a good point if we win the next game</p>

We know what we had to do. We had to match their energy. We lost the game not by them outplaying us - just attitude. We weren’t hungry enough and we were slow to every second ball, losing 50-50s. Maybe it was a little bit of arrogance and overconfidence. We’ve been playing well. You have to have confidence and arrogance in games like this but have to use it in the right way.
