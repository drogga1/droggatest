  <p><b>[Mason Bennett released his own statement along with Derby’s announcement, describing his shame at the incident]</b> On the night of Tuesday 24th September, I made huge mistakes after consuming alcohol. What I did was wrong. Being a footballer and someone who young fans look up to, I know the example I set is key. I am ashamed. At 23, I am old enough, and I was brought up, to know better. I understand that such actions have serious consequences. I take full responsibility for my actions and accept the punishment that the club has issued. I have to and will learn from these events and will strive to be a better person. There’s no excuse for what I’ve done. I’m sorry to my family, my friends, the club, all Derby supporters and to the wider football community, I let you all down</p>
