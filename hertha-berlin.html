  <p><b>[Intermilan have completed the signing of Valentino Lazaro from Hertha Berlin, with the Serie A club confirming the move Monday]</b> Lazaro knows how to win. He plays mostly on the right flank but is versatile and used to playing in different roles. Like many greats of the game, he developed at a young age by playing on the streets, giving him a great base in terms of skill and tactical selflessness</p>

  <p><b>[Kalou suspended by Hertha after ignoring coronavirus safety rules in video]</b> Salomon Kalou has given the impression in his video that the Hertha BSC players do not take the social distancing and hygiene rules seriously on the part of the health authorities<br /><br />Hertha BSC would like to state that this was the failure of a single player. The fact that other team members did not draw his attention to this misconduct and instead replied to the greeting by shaking hands shows that the regular references to the distance and hygiene rules must be even more intense.<br /><br />With his ‘Coronavirus singing’, Salomon Kalou gave the impression that he was not aware of the extent of the Corona pandemic.<br /><br />Salomon Kalou violated fundamental team internal rules and showed behaviour that is neither appropriate to the situation nor corresponds to the rules of conduct of the club. Hertha BSC has therefore decided to suspend it from training and game operations with immediate effect</p>
