  <p><b>[Christian Fuchs writes about his experience winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title]</b> Most of that night was a blur of emotion, but I remember one moment so clearly. I will never forget it. When I was leaving my house to go to the party, I turned to my wife in the kitchen and said. … I’m getting goosebumps just remembering it. I turned to my wife and said, ‘I’ll be coming home tonight as a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> champion’. I kept screaming for 20 more minutes. The boys were going crazy.

  <p><b>[Leicester City’s Christian Fuchs wants MLS move in his future]</b> I have one more year now in England and I’ve always said very openly that I want to move over here <b>[to the United States]</b>.

I’m 32 now. I don’t want to come here when I’m 36 or 37.<br /><br /><b>[He cut back significantly on his social media presence]</b> I got tired of it. It took over my life. I didn’t enjoy it after a certain point. It helped me a lot because I got to know how it all worked, but at some point it bothered me more than I enjoyed doing it. In the title-winning season I was always on top of it, but the season after I couldn’t be bothered to do it. It was no fun for me, and when I do something I want to have fun doing, not just for the sake of doing it. I’m getting back into it. I’ve overcome the social media burnout a little bit. I’m not putting pressure on myself to post all the time. When I post I have fun with it, I show people that I’m not just a football player</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Fuchs reveals reasons for <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> u-turn]</b> I’m very happy to be here for another year. I know I’ve expressed my wish to go to America several times, but you know what? Everything we have experienced in these last couple of years, with all the ups and downs … all the way up, all the way down, it just brings us together. Not only the players, but the staff, the coaching staff (and) the manager… we’re much closer together. I didn’t want to miss out on that yet!<br /><br />Also with Brendan coming in and expressing his satisfaction with me and saying that he wants to keep working with me obviously meant a lot to me as well. I can tell that, even though I’m already one of the older ones, I can still learn from him and that’s something that I don’t want to miss out (on).<br /><br />It’s special, very special. Not only the reaction after it was announced, but also before…the people were sending me letters, pushing me to sign for another year!<br /><br />It clearly wasn’t their decision, but it’s nice to see the support. Also with the goal of the season award that I got (from) the supporters…as a defender, it means a lot to see how appreciated I am.<br /><br />I’m not in the same position anymore, but I understand that Chilly (Chilwell) is playing a really good season, that he’s the future of <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>, and that’s also where I see my role<br /><br />That’s what Brendan expressed, that whenever there’s a need I’ll be there. I’ll be here to support the team as much as a I can and support Chilly in his development as well. I can’t tell you how happy that I am that I have another year here<br /><br /><b>[Winning the title]</b> has a lasting effect on the club because it is building step-by-step. Every year it’s getting better, and I think there’s a really good opportunity to challenge. The way we’ve played lately, the character that we’ve shown, and also the good football that we’ve played - against bigger teams as well - that shows there’s real potential. If we can nurture that and have a good pre-season now to the upcoming year, I think there’s a lot possible</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Fuchs says it was an easy decision to re-sign with Leicester for one more season]</b> It worked out in the best way. Brendan Rodgers right away spoke to me when he came in and he said he wants to keep working with me, so that means a lot, for the manager to want to work with you and have that trust and relationship. It was very convincing to me. He’s an amazing manager, great work from day one, and he gives the opportunity to, even at my age, learn some more. I want to keep playing, I definitely want to keep playing. It might be my last year over there, but you can never say never, especially in this sport, but as of right now, it’s going to be my last season in England and then I want to come to New York and be with my family.<br /><br /><b>[the death of club owner and chairman <a href="vichai-srivaddhanaprabha.html">Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha</a> in a tragic helicopter crash in October]</b> It was very tough, very tough. It was not easy for everyone as a group. We were grieving for a long time. I never thought that something like that would touch my heart so much. It was such a tough situation. It brought the group closer together, if you can put some sort of positive spin on it, and it helped, as crazy as it sounds, to have a greater spirit than was even there before<br /><br />Just before our last home game, Robert Huth was here to say hi. He was in the changing room just before the game. A lot of teams talk about how their club is very small, run like a family, but at this club former players are coming back all the time, in person, in private, before the games, and they’re always welcome. Older players from the 80s and 90s, they’re included in the structure of the club because the club knows what they did for the team, so they’re also involved. That’s very special. They look after players, not just current players, but former players as well, and that’s very special<br /><br /><b>[Fuchs says a transition into coaching youth has been a natural one]</b> It’s grown over the last few years, and for me it’s important to be hands on , and I want to give those young players a possibility of someday making it as a professional. You can’t rely on anything like that, but it’s my way. I was told that I wasn’t good enough when I was 11 or 12 years old, and I see a lot of players disappointed where they have the same issue and they’re told the same thing. I want to give them hope, give them good training, and maybe it works out for them. Maybe they can do something special</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Fuchs says that the game has changed since Leicester’s Premier League title win]</b> I hope they took it personally! That’s why they’re the big teams and they want to come back and fight back. I hope so. That’s why they’re top six. But our own gameplan changed since then too. The best example was when we played Arsenal a couple of weeks ago. We had 80 per cent possession against an Arsenal side, where in our Premier League-winning season we had an average of like 32 per cent all season. Our personal game changed a lot from being a counter-attack team, which we are still good at to be honest, to a team that is built on possession. The game has definitely changed. It has changed in a big way. With the amount of money being spent, with the good managers that have come in since then, it’s just all developing more and more.<br /><br />Like me, he didn’t start at the beginning of the Premier League-winning season because Claudio <b>[Ranieri]</b> thought he wasn’t good enough at the very beginning. Maybe he had to be patient coming in for the first time, but the second he played he was unstoppable, and you could tell. Leicester would hardly be able to hold him up after that campaign and that’s how it worked out. He’s such an amazing player. You have seen that he had that potential, but it’s not only down to him, but you need the team around you, but being in the Premier League and winning two titles in your first two years and being world champion with France, that’s not a bad record</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Fuchs compares current <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> side with title-winning team]</b> It’s the mentality Brendan gives us - we want to go in every day and work. No one is letting anyone down. Everyone is extremely happy. We want to be successful. It was very important he had a pre-season with us. You could see last season that our game improved a lot<br /><br />Where we are right now, our game is on a different level to when we won the Premier Leauge. It’s two different teams. This one is built on possession. When we won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I think we had 25 per cent possession. It’s crazy. Brendan is right up there as a manager. He wants us to understand why we are doing certain things on the field.<br /><br />You see the effects of the learning process. The way we are playing I think is impressive. Man management is a big thing. A modern manager should know how to deal with his players. My contract was over. He told me he wanted me in the squad. It’s a great feeling. It gives you confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Fuchs reveals x-factor common to 2019-20 Foxes and title heroes]</b> The run itself is very similar but it is early doors. There are so many more difficult games ahead. It feels very similar <b>[to 2015-16]</b> but it is a completely different set-up. I think what is very similar is the humbleness. We just take it game by game. That is always the secret. You don’t think ahead. That doesn’t help you anyway. We just take it game by game and try to do our best. I have no clue about what is in the media. We don’t read them. It doesn’t affect us<br /><br />The fans are allowed to dream. They give us great support, especially at the King Power Stadium. It is an amazing place to play our home games at but also away as well, they have been tremendous. They are always allowed to dream. They dreamed in 2015-16 when we went on that great run, but for us internally whatever happens outside the squad and the training ground doesn’t affect us at all</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> defender Christian Fuchs is expecting a much tougher task against <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> this time around]</b> They’re a good squad. My fellow Austrian (Hasenhuttl) is doing really well. It was simply a game that probably happens once in a decade. To go away and win 9-0, nobody ever expected that and nobody will expect that ever to be repeated any time soon<br /><br />There, we showed all the qualities that we have and that we continued to show in the games which followed. Everybody knows that it was a one-off. It doesn’t really reflect the quality of <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>. They’re a much better side than what the result shows and we’re aware of that. The second we rely on ‘okay we won there 9-0 and it’s going to be easy’ then we’ll be on the wrong path and obviously Brendan <b>[Rodgers]</b> will never let that happen</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Fuchs says <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season has to be finished]</b> Whatever the decision, it will be probably justified so there will be no questions asked and everyone will have to accept it. Of course, it would be great, having nine or 10 games left to play, to finish the season in some kind of way. Otherwise, I think football would then suffer next year and the year to follow because there’s a lot of work to be done to get this time back. You see the Euros is cancelled which is crazy and that has never happened before. So, it would be great at least to finish the season and give everyone a fair chance to get what they deserve whether it be winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the Champions League or fighting against relegation. I think it is necessary to finish the season no matter when it is. I do my home runs and home workout that’s nothing different from what we normally do during an international break. It is just a little longer, which is the weird thing about it. I have it in my mind that I could be called back at any time in the near future. That’s why you have to stay fit, do you work and be prepared for whenever the season starts again<br /><br />It is a very difficult situation and I am in talks with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> on how to deal with that. The time to restart the season is supposed to be April 30 but with all this development going on worldwide, I don’t think it will go ahead, we will see<br /><br />Since there has been no precise time for the season to continue for certain, you end up in a cloud of doubt. I am very sure <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> will do the right thing for any player in a similar situation to what I am. They will handle it the right way with me. I have been here for five years and we have gone through a lot of highs and lows. The past has shown me that <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> is not dropping any player just like that. They take care of their players who have been good servants to the club. It means a lot to me that <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> is keen on keeping me for another season and maybe even longer. He has given me a lot of game time which shows that he trusts me. The feedback has been good from the manager and coaches. I want to pay it back with good performances. I am pretty relaxed even if we can’t be too relaxed about this stressful period that everyone is going through at the moment.<br /><br />That’s kind of boring but there’s a lot of football going on over here with my academy. We are trying to keep the kids busy through online training, which includes Instagram lives for 30-40 minutes a time. Like myself, I think you can use the time to improve your weaknesses even in isolation. The academy started five years ago in New York with a one-week training summer camp from a gut feeling that I wasn’t happy with the training at all these other academies that I signed my son up for. My interests come most of the time from our kids. In eSports, we are hosting tournaments throughout the whole of April and May. However long it lasts, to simply also have people do something from home. We are doing online tournaments on Fifa and we are starting in other titles. We are doing our own FIifa tournament and this is ongoing on a weekly basis and we have tournaments in the US and UK with over 200 people signed up</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Fuchs has revealed that Raul is the only player to leave him starstruck]</b> I still show the players at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> videos of Raul from when I played with him. He was unbelievable. He was not only a good footballer, he was a gentleman and he was one of the nicest players that I lined up with. It was simply a dream come true because he was one of the players, that when I was growing up, <b>[I]</b> used to watch as one of the biggest stars. Suddenly, you have the opportunity to play with him, to serve the ball to him to score. I think that was the first and last time I was starstruck in football. This person you admired for years before and now you are in the same changing room as him. Give me a break, how much better can it get? So, of course, that was my first impression. You chat, deal with it better as the days and weeks go on. He was definitely one of the best players that I have played with so I am proud, honoured and happy to have had this experience<br /><br />In terms of skills, I would say there were two players that stood out and they were <a href="julian-draxler.html">Julian Draxler</a> and <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a>. They were back then teenagers and when I left, I remember it as it was yesterday. The last words I said to <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> was to keep working hard and in one or two years you will be at a top club. That’s literally what happened. He is still young and had injuries this season, but there is a lot more to come from him. With the quality he has, he will make his way<br /><br />Well my most difficult opponent was <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a>. He is horrible. He was the worst player to play against. The reason is everyone knows what he is doing but no one knows when he is doing it. The second he decides to get on his bike and cut inside, he is simply too quick over the first two or three yards and then you know what happens. He was definitely the most difficult to play against. The best opponent that I have faced in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> so far was probably <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>. He was very good. This season it has been hard to pick a similar player because we have been dominant in many matches. However, this season the best player that I have faced is Riyad Mahrez<br /><br />I don’t like it when players make a decision and go back on it right away. This is an example of that. I retired from the national team and then go back two weeks later. I couldn’t identify myself with a mentality like that. Everyone who knows me knows that if I say something, I stick to it and I keep my promise. Me retiring is a promise that I made and I will stick to it</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Fuchs believes that <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> team-mate <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a> is destined to become one of the best left-backs in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> He has definitely improved. He is still a young player who is playing at a very high level. He has a good amount of England caps already, which just shows his ability. At an early age like that, to play for the national team for that amount of games is really good. As a young player, I have been in that situation: you still find yourself learning a lot from games and facing other teams. So, he is in a good place and I think he will be one of the top left-backs in England for years to come. The good thing for him is that, at 23, he is still young, with a lot of potential to improve in the future<br /><br />I think it is just a question of a lack of confidence for him at the moment. The way I experience him in training, I know he can dribble past four or five players no problem. He can fall on the floor and still keep going. It is unbelievable. I think if he gets a self-confidence injection, then he would have a lot of potential moving forward<br /><br /><b>[Ahead of the stoppage in play caused by the Covid-19 outbreak, <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> were in third place in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> It is definitely something that we are capable of and where we want to be, 100 per cent. Our position in the league is down to the great work that we have done throughout the season. You already saw at the end of last season that something was developing with Brendan Rodgers’ appointment. We had a great pre-season and he was really able to talk to us, spend time with us and implement his philosophy. This is where we are right now. Unfortunately, this break happened but you have to accept it. It is not going to slow us down, though. You have to focus on when we come back together again. We will come back and we might even come back stronger. We are in a good position in third spot, it is a great achievement for the club already but it is definitely not something to just rest on and be happy with. We want to move on, get better and maybe even improve next season</p>

I could never have imagined that this could happen so quickly. From the beginning, all the players stood behind him and his ideas and this is due to his excellent man-management. He pays incredibly good attention to everyone’s needs</p>
