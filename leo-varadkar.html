  <p><b>[Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has this afternoon approved plans to move to Phase 1 of the roadmap to recovery]</b> I can confirm that it is safe to proceed with Phase 1 of our plan to ease the Covid-19 restrictions on Monday. This gives us reason to hope, but it is not a cause for celebration. We have a long way to go yet. There will be bumps in the road and we have to keep our guard up.<br /><br />As a country we have done a lot to suppress the spread of this virus. But extreme vigilance will be required until a vaccine, effective treatment or prophylaxis is found, and that might be some time away. The only thing that is inevitable is the spread of the virus unless we push it back every day. Coronavirus is a ‘fire in retreat’ but it is not defeated. We must extinguish every spark, quench every ember.<br /><br />If all goes well, we will enter a new phase of reopening our country every three weeks. The next review will take place on June 5th. To keep going forward, we need to keep following the guidelines. Everything is provisional and reversible, and our progress depends on us all continuing to do what we have been doing.<br /><br />As the restrictions ease and we come into contact with more people, the opportunity for the virus to spread increases. So, self-discipline and personal responsibility will become more important, not less.<br /><br />In three weeks’ time, on Friday 5 June, I fervently hope to be here to announce that we will move to Phase 2. A further relaxation of restrictions. This depends on the progress we make between now and then. Nothing is guaranteed. The only thing that is inevitable is the spread of the virus unless we push it back every day</p>
