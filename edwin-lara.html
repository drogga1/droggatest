  <p><b>[Former Mexico U-17 star Edwin Lara feels at home being back in USMNT youth setup]</b> I felt like it was something I wanted to do. I didn’t really appreciate what <b>[U.S. Soccer]</b> did for me when I was younger because I was just a kid then. When I was looking back I thought about it and they invested so much into me, the process, they really cared about me and all that stuff and I just turned my back on them. That was kind of a shady part for me, that was kind of shady. At that moment I thought I want to give it a try and be there.<br /><br />Back then my parents were still making decisions for me. I was still young, I didn’t know what was going on and how the world works. I was playing in Mexico so they thought why not play for Mexico and stay in Mexico so I don’t have to be moving from place to play. Now I can make decisions for myself and honestly I always liked the U.S. They always treated me well.<br /><br />Every player has moments like that. Sad moments, moments where they’re not that motivated. It happens to everyone. At this moment, just coming here <b>[to U.S. camp]</b> has given me a breath of fresh air. it’s given me motivation again to work hard.<br /><br />I feel like I’ve matured a lot more in the sense of reading the game, and knowing when to go and when to stay. Back <b>[with Mexico’s U-17s]</b> I was just that left back that would go, go, go. I didn’t worry about defending. Now I’ve learned that I’m a defender at the end of the day so I always have to run back. Knowing when to go and when to stay and basically have that timing so I can be at the right spot at the right time.<br /><br />I felt very happy. I feel proud. I feel motivation. I just want to show Tab, the coaches and everybody that I deserve a spot. They’re good guys, good players and I just feel like I’m at home<br /><br />They were just happy for me. I talked to them about it and they had my back 100 percent. I wasn’t that little kid that would just say yes to everything. Now I can say what I want and I feel a lot better<br /><br />Every player’s situation is different. Maybe some players don’t feel at home over there even if they’re Mexican. Maybe some players feel more at home over here. It’s a bunch of things that can make that decision. If you feel at home, and you feel comfortable with the U.S. team then just stay, don’t even think about it. Go wherever you feel at home</p>
