  <p>[Micky Quinn says <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> have become a laughing stock under <a href="mike-ashley.html">Mike Ashley</a>] I’m not surprised at all. As the days were ticking towards the end of Rafa’s four-year contract and not having anything sorted by this stage, I think it was inevitable he was going to leave. He is a world class manager, and this guy was the comfort blanket like a baby has to the fans. <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> put the pride back in the <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> shirt after the appointments, and we’ve had some bad ones, we’ve had under <a href="mike-ashley.html">Mike Ashley</a>. With Rafa leaving, it’s all up in the air again and the fans are devastated. The <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> fans were proud to say he was their manager and that respect was everything at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, after almost becoming a laughing stock under Ashley.<br /><br />It’s just a nightmare. I can’t believe a club of this stature can let a manager of that stature go. It’s embarrassing. It just doesn’t make sense, but it’s <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a>. I know for a fact he loves it up there and he wanted to take the club to the next level, but he’s had no investment compared to a lot of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs. The teams that went down - Fulham and <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> - and Brighton as well, they all outspent <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> last year. It’s an embarrassment and it’s the fans who miss out because the club’s credibility goes out the window.<br /><br />It’s just another farce in the <a href="mike-ashley.html">Mike Ashley</a> tenure. The footballing decisions have been diabolical. He isn’t good enough for <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, he doesn’t care about <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. All the fans want someone like Rafa, who got <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. Rafa wanted to invest in the youth development, and Ashley wouldn’t even do that - it’s just madness.</p>

  <p>[The ongoing ‘mess’ at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> has former frontman Micky Quinn baffled, with under-fire owner <a href="mike-ashley.html">Mike Ashley</a> asked ‘how many times can you kick fans in the Niagaras?’] How many times can you kick fans in the Niagaras? They are a loyal fan base and I think the hierarchy his taken the mick out of them. <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafa Benitez</a> was the only comfort blanket for them. The madness that has happened there - giving <a href="alan-pardew.html">Alan Pardew</a> a nine-year contract, Joe Kinnear taking over, <a href="dennis-wise.html">Dennis Wise</a> who signed ‘the Xisco kid’ and never kicked a ball for <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, <a href="kevin-keegan.html">Kevin Keegan</a> walking out and taking them to court - the footballing decisions have been madness. This, to not nail down Rafa’s future or give him some of the money he wanted when other clubs are out spending, it’s not right.<br /><br />It’s a mess going into the new season and I don’t know who they’re going to get. There has been very little aspiration since Ashley’s been in charge, that’s why Rafa gave the fans so much hope because he wanted to go to that next level. But this is the hierarchy that didn’t want to progress in the cups because they just wanted to stay in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, get the £350m every season, advertise Ashley’s businesses around the ground when they kick off, so on and so on. No ambition whatsoever!<br /><br />The <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> fans deserve more than that, they deserve to win a cup and deserve to get back into Europe. It seems an eternity from when <a href="bobby-robson.html">Sir Bobby Robson</a> was in charge, Sir John Hall, they had that ambition. They were playing Champions League football and had one of the best strikers in the world in <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a> and it just seems a million miles from what we’re watching now.</p>
