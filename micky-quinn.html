<blockquote>
  <p>[The ongoing ‘mess’ at Newcastle has former frontman Micky Quinn baffled, with under-fire owner Mike Ashley asked ‘how many times can you kick fans in the Niagaras?’] How many times can you kick fans in the Niagaras? They are a loyal fan base and I think the hierarchy his taken the mick out of them. Rafa Benitez was the only comfort blanket for them. The madness that has happened there – giving Alan Pardew a nine-year contract, Joe Kinnear taking over, Dennis Wise who signed ‘the Xisco kid’ and never kicked a ball for Newcastle, Kevin Keegan walking out and taking them to court – the footballing decisions have been madness. This, to not nail down Rafa’s future or give him some of the money he wanted when other clubs are out spending, it’s not right.<br /><br />It’s a mess going into the new season and I don’t know who they’re going to get. There has been very little aspiration since Ashley’s been in charge, that’s why Rafa gave the fans so much hope because he wanted to go to that next level. But this is the hierarchy that didn’t want to progress in the cups because they just wanted to stay in the Premier League, get the £350m every season, advertise Ashley’s businesses around the ground when they kick off, so on and so on. No ambition whatsoever!<br /><br />The Newcastle fans deserve more than that, they deserve to win a cup and deserve to get back into Europe. It seems an eternity from when Sir Bobby Robson was in charge, Sir John Hall, they had that ambition. They were playing Champions League football and had one of the best strikers in the world in Alan Shearer and it just seems a million miles from what we’re watching now.</p>
