  <p><b>[West Ham United midfielder Michail Antonio tells about his journey to getting called up to the England national team ahead of their <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup qualifier against Slovakia]</b> It’s one thing I’ve always believed is to never give up, always believe in yourself, always believe that you can achieve things because anything is possible in life. That’s one thing I’ve always, always believed in. Once I reached one target, I always searched for another. I went from non-league, I made the jump to Reading and then I kept on going out on loan. I went to Sheffield Wednesday and then from there to Nottingham Forest and then I managed to get to <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> to play where I always wanted to be, in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. As soon as I got to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I said to myself, ‘International’, and now I’ve done that, so I’ve got to set myself a new target now</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham forward Michail Antonio says deducting clubs points is the only way to curb the increase in racist abuse in football stadiums]</b> I feel <a href="fa.html">the FA</a>, the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> and all the governing bodies need to deal with it harder. Punishing the person themselves is never going to deal with things. The only way for this to stop is for the team to be punished<br /><br /><b>[With the financial might of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, he doesn’t believe a fine would be enough]</b> Then the people start to deal with it themselves. It’s at the stage where if you deduct points - <b>[not]</b> fines because clubs will pay fines, it’s not a problem, they’re making billions - then the fans standing next to the <b>[perpetrating]</b> fan are going to stop them from doing it. Now it’s affecting them. But them doing their monkey chants and them being racist now, it’s only affecting the person themselves. When it starts affecting the club everybody’s not going to do it<br /><br /><b>[Antonio was also keen to stress that instances of racist abuse reflect more on the person giving it out than the person it is directed at]</b> Racism doesn’t affect me. I’ve realised now that racism is down to the person doing it. It doesn’t affect my life. You calling me anything doesn’t affect my life. I’m still going to go home and give my Mrs a kiss, give my kids a cuddle. You come to me and punch me in my face I’m going to protect myself. Other than that, it’s nothing. I’ve had people shout in my face trying to irritate me. I go: ‘I’m not here to fight, I’m here to love</p>

  <p><b>[The man at the heart of the controversial moment, Michail Antonio, was delighted his team could shrug off yet more video assistant referee frustration]</b> I really dislike VAR, I really dislike it. This season so many things have not gone our way. But today it didn’t stop us, we just kept going, and we got the victory. It was hard, they play unbelievable football, and they kept pinning us in. It is a massive result. Man, there’s been so many games where we’ve been just so close, and today we had a goal taken away from us, we went 1-0 down, we drew level and then went down again - but managed to come back and win it. It shows the belief we’ve got, the grit we’ve got and that we’re not going to give up, we’ll fight until the end</p>
