  <p><b>[on <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a>]</b> In my opinion, <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a> is the greatest English centre-forward there has ever been without a shadow of a doubt; he’s a very, very special player. He makes average balls into great balls. He’s the scorer of every type of goal going. He plays the centre forward role in the hardest possible fashion where he generally has his back against where he wants to be going against men who are generally a lot bigger than him. He is not the biggest guy and people would be surprised if they met him in the street at the size of him</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool’s tendency to drop points against lesser lights has seen them mirror the Manchester United side of the 1980s]</b> Liverpool supporters will be mystified by their team. They play well against the big guys and slip up against the lesser lights. When I played for Liverpool, Manchester United were like Liverpool are now. Against the big clubs, they would turn up, but they would suffer daft defeats and draws against the also-rans. If you are going to win this league, that’s something you have to get right. We were constantly reminded of that at Liverpool when we were either European champions or defending league champions. They would say to us, ‘This might not be the biggest game of your season, but it is for the guy across the corridor.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United ‘had their trousers pulled down’ when re-signing midfielder Paul Pogba for a world-record fee of £89 million]</b> United have to pay a premium. For United, stick 25 per cent on the price. Because it’s Man United and they have the money. In my opinion, they had their trousers taken down paying £100 million. I’m yet to be convinced by that. He may be a player one day but right now as we sit here after one year in our football, I’m still waiting to be convinced.<br /><br /><b>[The Portuguese has pointed blame towards the sheer number of fixtures the club have played this season]</b> Man up.

  <p><b>[Liverpool have a far better chance of winning trophies with club captain Jordan Henderson in the side]</b> In the playing sense they’ve missed him greatly. You’re not always bossing the game - doesn’t matter what team you are, you’re not always in charge of the game - and he’s really good at making <b>[opponents]</b> go into areas and make passes they don’t want to. As well as that, I think he’s improved with his own technique - he can open the play up both short and long now, and he’s a major influence. Arguably, he might have been the first on the teamsheet when he was firing on all cylinders<br /><br />Being the captain of a club like Liverpool is an enormous responsibility; you’re forever being compared to people who have gone before you. He looks to be a really steady character, which will stand him in good stead when things don’t go well. We just have to start winning trophies now and, with him back, it gives us a far better chance</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United only appointed Jose Mourinho because they felt compelled to get a big name after seeing Pep Guardiola join Manchester City]</b> I didn’t think Mourinho was right for United and I said that from day one. Because Guardiola was coming in at Manchester City, the people making decisions at Old Trafford felt compelled to go and get a big name manager and they ended up with Jose. He has taken on a very difficult job at United and struggled to find his find his best eleven last season, if he ever found it.<br /><br />A big concern for me that their best player for most of last season was a 35-year-old in Zlatan Ibrahimovic, with 35-year-old Michael Carrick also one of the top performers. Mourinho is used to winning league titles and finishing where he did last season in the Premier League will not be acceptable, but it won’t be easy to put it right.<br /><br />We all thought it would be Guardiola v Mourinho doing battle at the top of the table last season, but City and United never even came close to getting into the title mix. Now they will be under pressure like never before because they are working for owners who expect to be challenging for the title. The record these two guys have confirms they are great managers, but they have probably taken on the biggest challenges of their career in these two jobs and they have to respond to the task</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool legend Graeme Souness admits to being an enormous fan of Southampton’s Virgil van Dijk]</b> A new centre-half, that would have been the main one for me. If I was manager of Liverpool at this time I would have pushed the boat out and done whatever you had to do to get the boy Van Dijk. It looks like Southampton are digging their heels in, but they do sell players, they have done consistently over the last few years. I’m an enormous fan of Van Dijk, I would love for him to go to Liverpool. When a player makes things look easy, that tells you they’re really good at what they do. Whoever gets him would improve them greatly, and it’ll be a shame if it’s not Liverpool. But, it may still happen, we don’t know<br /><br />Liverpool are still a bit off challenging for the title - I would have liked to have seen a bit more action. With the demands of the Champions League next year, if two or three players get knocks and aren’t playing all the time that could badly damage them. I don’t think they’ve got enough strength in depth to make a real impression in the two big trophies</p>

  <p><b>[Philippe Coutinho will find it difficult to turn down Barcelona and Liverpool will struggle to find a replacement]</b> I don’t think you can <b>[turn Barcelona down]</b>. It’s a team that would be suitable to his style of play and I don’t think he can say no to it. It’s hard for Liverpool to accept but if he wants to go, ultimately he will go. As much as the club won’t want him to go, and he’s under contract, I think ultimately if the big players want to go, they end up getting their way.<br /><br />The problem they have is they are going to have so much money for him, wherever they go next the selling club is going to want that money, they will have to pay a premium, Liverpool. Is there anyone out there who could make Liverpool better? Yeah, I’m sure there’s players who can influence the football as much as Coutinho. Would they come to Liverpool? Not so sure, but they’re going to have a big war chest to spend</p>

It’s that last little bit of imagination, the flair, to get in your team and neither of them have it other than Mooy of Huddersfield. You’ve got to stand back and admire the goal, I give you that</p>

Only he can answer that. I would have accepted an offer in excess of £100m for him.</p>

  <p><b>[Graeme Souness on Virgin van Dijk]</b> Virgil van Dijk is the best centre-back Liverpool have had since Alan Hansen, but the 26-year-old Holland international is better in the air than Alan was. He’s never extended, never seems to be running flat out in a race with somebody, never seems to be using all his strength when nudging somebody off the ball and never seems to be under pressure when making passes. He always plays within himself, which is a great sign. He has always got another yard or gear to find, and that’s why he reminds me of Alan <b>[Hansen]</b>.<br /><br />The ball is an enemy for Eliaquim Mangala. He’s in the wrong movie at Manchester City. They are always going to play out from the back and he doesn’t want the ball, so you would target him. That’s why they should have gone for Van Dijk. Good luck trying to get the ball off him and John Stones</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is far away from becoming a great player because he does not understand his role in Manchester United’s midfield]</b> Paul Pogba is capable of great things, but a country mile from being a great player. That distinction is due to his inability to grasp the responsibility that comes with being a central midfielder. He is 24 now and an £89m signing, yet he still doesn’t understand what is required to play that position properly. <b>[Mourinho is]</b> clearly not happy with aspects of Pogba’s game. Maybe that will make the message finally sink in, but I doubt it. Pogba simply cannot be one of two in central midfield. You cannot rely on him. Against the lesser teams you’ll get away with it, but against the better teams you’re not going to<br /><br />He played on the left of a three in midfield and was drifting wide to be the tallest left-winger in the world, powering past people, dropping a shoulder, wrong-footing defenders and whipping in crosses. For Mourinho and United, it’s about finding the right position for him, but he isn’t a playmaker. If you’re looking for a central midfielder who recognises danger, fills spaces and doesn’t drift out of position, he’s not going to do that for you. When he’s asked to do a job centrally, he’s forever straying towards the touchline trying to get on the ball. A central midfielder should never be in areas wider than the penalty box, unless they are out there to confront danger defensively. Pogba empties that central area far too readily. He will do something clever in the final third, but will be absent when his back four are under the cosh. He plays like a schoolboy running after the ball in the playground<br /><br />There’s lots I like about Pogba. He’s powerful and athletic with good technique, but I’ve not seen a different, improved Pogba since he walked back into Old Trafford in August 2016. Three goals from 22 club games this season isn’t good enough. Somebody with his athleticism and physique should be well into double figures every season. United need a better mix there to keep the ball better, make them a better watch and more threatening, with better quality into their strikers. They need a craftsman such as Christian Eriksen at Tottenham. Romelu Lukaku has faced some criticism, but he’s not been getting chances put on a plate. He could do with an Eriksen-type doing that for him. United are crying out for a clever passer. Juan Mata can do it, but he can’t get around the pitch the way that Eriksen does or the way that Mourinho wants his players to</p>

But from Alexis Sanchez to Paul Pogba, who’s really playing to their full potential? And that has to come down to the manager. The manager isn’t getting the best out of the group and that’s your job. It’s not happening for United right now.<br /><br />Manchester United coming into this game, their tails should have been firmly up. You think this is tailor-made for them, but they never got started. They never played at a tempo which was enough to cause this average Sevilla side a problem, never did until Sevilla scored basically. The major disappointment was they had no imagination, resorting to lumping it up to a big centre forward, looking for second bits off him</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp must start winning trophies with Liverpool]</b> They have to start winning trophies as that is what you are judged on ultimately and that is the only thing that is missing. You have to say that whoever is responsible for the players coming in there have done really well. There are some fabulous players and Naby Keita is coming in the summer <b>[from RB Leipzig]</b> and he might just give them that extra bit of quality that I think they need in midfield. I think they need someone in midfield who sees a different picture. The three that they have got in there today <b>[Jordan Henderson, James Milner and Georginio Wijnaldum]</b> - and I include Emre Can in that - are all very good players, all very workmanlike and do a great job for the cause. But none of them have got that real magic and maybe he <b>[Keita]</b> will give them that. And a goalkeeper and a Kevin De Bruyne and a David Silva.<br /><br />I think they are certainly on the right road, they just need to win a trophy. And if you win one, then it makes it so much easier going forward because you start to believe in yourself</p>

He would be going into a club that is on the back foot, that has been in turmoil for almost a decade now.<br /><br />It is not impossible to bridge that gap <b>[to Celtic]</b> with clever loans and smart buying, and although Celtic have an advantage, I don’t see it as being an insurmountable challenge</p>

  <p><b>[Graeme Souness has singled out midfield duo Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard as an example of why England are returning from the World Cup empty-handed]</b> I want to emphasise the midfield. You can’t win the big trophies, you can’t dominate football matches, you can’t put yourself in a position where you are not giving the ball away unless you’ve got good players in midfield who can keep the ball. I come back to Lingard and Dele Alli - two players who want to get on the end of things after there has been clever play by somebody else. They don’t want to get involved in keeping the ball and dominating possession. They want to be involved in scoring the goals and getting on the end of things.<br /><br />When they come up against a decent team, I think it’s inevitable that they were going to struggle tonight. Let me explain. They played the worst team in the tournament in Panama. They played, along with Saudi Arabia, probably the second worst team in the tournament, Tunisia. Put a line through the Belgium game, that doesn’t count. Then they play Colombia and in the second half, Colombia were much better than them. England came back in extra-time but only after a Colombia player hit the crossbar. They get through on penalties. Then they play a team in Sweden who were in awe of England. Both played a similar sort of game; long ball and feed off the bits. Tonight is the first time, other than the Belgium game, that they have come up against a team who wants to pop it around and keep possession - and they really, really were shown up for being a back-to-front team playing very basic football</p>

  <p><b>[There remains a question mark against Alisson despite Liverpool’s record-breaking deal]</b> A goalkeeper was clearly a priority and Liverpool have broken the world record for that position by signing Alisson from Roma for £67m. He played in Brazil and Portugal, then was initially kept out of the Roma team by Wojciech Szczesny, who found English football difficult at Arsenal. So he’s not coming with 300-400 games at the highest level under his belt and, despite the fee, there has to be a question mark against him.<br /><br />If their signings work out, if the goalkeeper is a proper one and the new midfielders are workaholics who can handle our football, Liverpool will push City all the way in the two big competitions this season - the Premier League and the Champions League. They are the team that City will fear most, unless somebody goes on a late summer spending spree. They must put Pep Guardiola’s side under pressure and see if they crack</p>

Perhaps we’re now seeing the selfish player Fergie didn’t fancy the first time round?<br /><br />I can’t see where the sea change of a happy dressing room and everyone pulling together is going to come from. The Fergie era is long gone for United and there is no quick fix.

He has the armband now and he has got to change his attitude - to football. I bet he is a really nice guy but I wonder if he treats football as a bit of a joke. I wonder if he trains properly every day, that is a stab at the dark at something that could improve. I don’t see him having improved at all since the day he arrived. He came in for €100 million and you factor in that Man United do pay a premium because they’re one of the biggest and richest football clubs in the world, and the riches of the Premier League, but I don’t see much difference in him from when he turned up.</p>

Paul Pogba. I don’t want to play against Milner. But, with Pogba, it’s all about him and his game. He’s not going to stop me, he lets you play, and that’s one of the criticisms. Having the ball is only half of the game. A big part of being a top player, as he aspires to be, is you have to stop the guy you’re up against. And that’s part of the captaincy. If I’m having a good day, that means I’m stopping the guy I’m against directly. It’s not just about I’ll play and I’ll play, there’s another side to the game. You can’t pick and choose when you want to be bang at it.<br /><br />I’m a bit like I’d imagine Mourinho is, where you see someone who’s got so much talent, but not making the most of it. There’s a player in there, but I don’t think he’s getting the most out of himself. It’s criminal. I think he has to change. The guy who works with him every day is not seeing eye-to-eye with him, so he’s happy with him. I imagine he’d see it exactly the same way that I would: you’ve got a young man who’s got the potential to be the very best of his type in the game, but right now it’s not happening for him.

I think that tells you how Jurgen sees their midfield. I look at Liverpool’s midfield and I bet they are three great lads, who work their socks off but they just haven’t got that little bit of quality in games like this to look one way and deliver a pass the other way. I think the very fact that Jurgen signed two and tried to get three shows you they are a bit short there. I think that showed at times today when they were dominant and had a lot of the ball. The danger is, when you try to go for more quality, you might not get someone who puts the same shift in. That’s the balancing act. Jurgen likes to call it ‘rock and roll football’ with high tempo and high intensity. Would you get that from someone who’s got a bit more class?</p>

As Joe Fagan would say - the great Joe Fagan would say - ‘we’ll tell you once we’ll tell you twice and if you don’t get it you won’t be here very long’ and it was as brutal as that. This boy has been blessed with the most wonderful athleticism, he’s six foot four, I’m sure he can leap like a stag and run like the wind. You’d think this was tailor made for him. You don’t have to be six foot four to prevent someone from getting a clear header at your goal. Someone my size could prevent Rudiger getting that header if you really wanted to. He’s got fabulous technique, he’s got fabulous athleticism, but for me he just doesn’t do the basics right. But there is a player there. I’m seen as his biggest critic but his manager is not happy with him. I’ve been a manager and I’m saying to myself, like Jose will be saying to himself, ‘what a player this boy could be if you would just listen and learn’. Even at 25 you never stop learning in this game. If this boy believes that he is the real deal at 25 then he won’t get any better. He should be turning up every day listening to the manager, listening to the senior players and wanting to improve. I’m not sure if that is the case but I’ll come back to it, this boy could be a top, top player.</p>

That’s the most I’ve ever seen him show in a game of football. You’re the captain, when you’re on the pitch show courage to get on the ball when you’re not dominating. Show real passion, maybe you’re not built for it but certainly make an attempt to make a few challenges and win the ball back for your team. He doesn’t do that. I’m sorry to harp on about him a bit but a man with that much talent should influence games like that.</p>

  <p><b>[Naby Keita and Fabinho have seen their value questioned]</b> It’s very hard to be critical of Liverpool’s form in the Premier League, but they’re not firing on all cylinders. I think a lot of the problems come from midfield. I think if you go back to the summer, he <b>[Klopp]</b> signed two midfield players and wanted a third one - Nabil Fekir from Lyon - and I’m not sure if Fabinho and Naby Keita are an upgrade on what he’s already got. Last year, the midfield of James Milner, Georginio Wijnaldum and Jordan Henderson were winning it early and getting forward early and the three strikers were off raiding and causing havoc. Now, it is a little bit more pedestrian, they’re winning it but there’s an extra touch or pass. I think they’ve got to get back to that front three as quick as they possibly can and if they can do that, then they’ll be firing on all cylinders. But right now, for me, they’re not where they were last year.<br /><br />Firmino is having a difficult moment, you can’t deny that. He is a fantastic talent and he will come through it but at the moment, the way that he plays and with what he did last year, it was so important and earlier this season too. The balance of Mohamed Salah playing up front - he’s so good he can play anywhere - but for me, when I watched Liverpool at their best last season, the three when Salah was wide just seemed to work better. In midfield, do they need that extra bit of quality? Andre Gomes bossed the game for Everton and I don’t think Liverpool did that well enough. I think going forward, there are still a few questions about how they play and how the formation works</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba may be enjoying a return to form at Manchester United]</b> The stats show that United are running more than they were previously, putting in the hard yards for the new manager in terms of closing down and sprinting back, all the stuff that they weren’t doing for Mourinho. I was critical of Paul Pogba, in particular, but was I wrong? Look at the difference in him between then and now, and let’s not get carried away either: he never got a kick against PSG, then showed his frustration by lunging at Dani Alves and being sent off. I find it disappointing that all of them, not just Pogba, downed tools under Mourinho. I’d have hated to be accused of that in my career, but it appears to be the reality in the modern game when players want a manager out. It was as if they were on an unofficial strike. What else could it be other than that, when you look at the transformation from where they were to where they are now? They have a different mindset now when they go out to play games.

If you have that much of the ball, where are you having the ball? You’ve having it on the half-way line in your own half. They’re playing like they’re a five-a-side team. The stats would bare our that they’re a five-a-side team. You take Hazard out, where is the threat coming from?<br /><br />If you insist on playing Jorginho, who is neat and tidy but has no goal threat, you must have goal threat either side of you.

It wasn’t a great pitch to play on, playing under a lot of pressure and I thought they were fabulous.

But the threat comes from so many places that they know, ‘keep a clean sheet, keep doing the things that have got us the results over the last nine months and it will come’ and that’s how they played. I think they’ve got over their nervy moments, they certainly had them against Spurs and a couple of games before that. I think they’ve dropped that now, I think they’re playing with a composure and a belief. They should be, they are a team without a weakness.

So, despite me saying <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are big favourites in this final, it doesn’t mean <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> can’t win on Saturday and one factor is in my mind when I say that.

They have lost all those games and yet they have come through against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in the Champions League when they were so close to losing and that shows they have got resilience.<br /><br />When one team has better players than the other, they will win nine times out of 10, but we have witnessed what can happen in cup finals before when the big team doesn’t turn up and they are shocked. The key to winning a massive game like this is making sure you don’t get caught up in the moment. You need to start well and don’t hand the initiative to the opposition. They preached that to us in every cup final we played, start well. When I joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I went to a team that were serial winners. I had only been at the club four months and I was playing in a European Cup final at Wembley. It wasn’t like we were sat in the dressing room feeling concerned.<br /><br />There was never a doubt we were going to win it, never any nervousness. You look around the dressing room at players who have done this the year before and that gives you great comfort. When you win it, you hope young players will look to you for that kind of inspiration. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> don’t have that experience of winning things and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> certainly don’t have that.

It’s not quite what you read or hear. Someone got a call at the football club … George Weah’s cousin or nephew was in England and looking to join a club. He wanted a trial. Matt <b>[<a href="matt-le-tissier.html">Le Tissier</a>]</b> will know at that time, we had such a small squad, and we had trialists in all the time. So this guy turns up, and anyone who’s been involved in football, you know in the first five minutes of a game - even if it’s a small five-a-side - if the boy can play or not. So, within the first five minutes on a Monday morning, we said he wasn’t for us. He was hopeless. But we didn’t have enough players to have an eight-a-side. So we kept him for a week, and as the week went on, we had more and more players that got injured. We were playing <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> on the Saturday, and Matt was our only fit forward. It’s all Matt’s fault because he only lasts for about 20 minutes!

He came in and said ‘I’ve got a player for you, he’s a real problem in France but he’s really talented and he’d be perfect for your club’. I said ‘look, Michel, I’m fighting fires here at the moment, I’m trying to get some people out of the door that are resisting, I’m fighting a dressing room here.

A lot of fuss is made of <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a>, but <a href="john-mcginn.html">McGinn</a> does a lot of the unseen work, the box-to-box aggression, whereas <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> attracts more attention because he spends more time running with the ball. If <a href="john-mcginn.html">McGinn</a> comes back and plays like he did at the start of the season it could help them survive, but they also may find it difficult to hold on to him when the transfer window opens<br /><br />From the outside, it is hard to know what Villa were going for last summer and didn’t get. Did they end up signing the second or third choices on their list? That is always dangerous. Sometimes you must hold your nerve and wait until the right players are available rather than signing people for the sake of it. Their defensive record is the worst in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. In 28 games, they have conceded 56 goals. That means, on average, they need to score three to win. It is a dangerous combination, if you are conceding too many goals and cannot score at the other end and neither Wesley, the big Brazilian, nor Mbwana Samatta, the Tanzanian striker, have really done it for them. Ultimately, it boils down to the most important things in football: management and recruitment. They remind me of Fulham last season. They came up, had a wealthy owner in <a href="shahid-khan.html">Shahid Khan</a> and splashed the cash but wasted most of it and sacked Slavisa Jokanovic and <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Claudio Ranieri</a> before turning to <a href="scott-parker.html">Scott Parker</a> when it was too late to survive.

Okay, there was the Club World Cup as well, but to have been so good and so consistent and yet only won two big trophies, I think the players have got to be a bit angry at themselves about that.

  <p><b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold: <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> right-back could play in midfield]</b> I think the boy could play anywhere in midfield. He started out as a central midfield player and then saw an opening at right-back. You would be reluctant to take him away from where he is because a large part of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s attacking play comes from him and <b>[Andrew]</b> Robertson. They have high energy levels, and when they get into the last third, they can deliver. Looking at it now, you’ve just won the league, you are the current European and world champions, so if it ain’t broken, why try to fix it? But the modern defender today, at the top clubs, has to be able to take the ball and play and deliver in the final third, so why not?<br /><br />If you were to ask him, he would be more than happy to play in midfield because that is, I would say, his natural position. He gets more space in the wide areas and then you see the passing range that he has. But that passing range has obviously been built up over the years playing in central midfield. His decision-making probably comes from having less time when he was in central midfield. He’s had to be aware of what’s going on around him. It’s a different game in there. You are dodging bullets and elbows are up.<br /><br />If he’s full-back, he knows nothing is coming <b>[to his right]</b> when he receives the ball. Full-back is a very different position and you get plenty of time there to have your first touch, get it out of your feet and get your head up. But he’s as good as anyone when he gets a chance to deliver.</p>

That is something that is not in his game right now. I’m not denying he has talent - but for me there’s a big question mark<br /><br />When I was a player, I wouldn’t want to be the most fouled player in the league.
