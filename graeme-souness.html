  <p><b>[on <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a>]</b> In my opinion, <a href="alan-shearer.html">Alan Shearer</a> is the greatest English centre-forward there has ever been without a shadow of a doubt; he’s a very, very special player. He makes average balls into great balls. He’s the scorer of every type of goal going. He plays the centre forward role in the hardest possible fashion where he generally has his back against where he wants to be going against men who are generally a lot bigger than him. He is not the biggest guy and people would be surprised if they met him in the street at the size of him</p>

  <p><b>[Graeme Souness has launched a withering attack on <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s ‘lightweight’ midfield ahead of their Europa League final against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in Baku on Wednesday]</b> I look at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s midfield and I could play against them. <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> is a five-a-side player, <a href="ross-barkley.html">Ross Barkley</a> is a five-a-side player, <a href="mateo-kovacic.html">Mateo Kovacic</a> is another five-a-side player. If the three of them were sat in front of me now and I asked them to describe themselves, they would tell me they are attacking midfield players. So you are an attacking midfield player. Does that mean you score goals? Oh no, I don’t score goals. That is what they should do, but they don’t do it. A successful team must share the goals around, but <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are lightweight in midfield. If <a href="n-golo-kante.html">N’Golo Kante</a> was playing and <a href="antonio-rudiger.html">Antonio Rudiger</a> was playing, I may lean towards <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, but those two are out injured and they are just too reliant on <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> to come up with a moment of magic in every game. He is arguably the best player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and, unless he delivers, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> don’t win.<br /><br /><b>[Souness went on to offer a damning critique of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> manager <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>]</b> How many jobs has <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> had in professional football? The answer is 19 and what has he won in professional football? Nothing. I also need someone to tell me what Sarri-ball is? Is it keeping the ball on the halfway line and the stats will say we have 70 per cent of possession? That isn’t helping anyone. I’m not sure this is the best time to get the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> job if the transfer ban is on them and <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> goes. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have so many players out on loan and, if they have a transfer ban, they may start having to using those players. It’s easy to criticise <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for changing their managers, but they have won more trophies than anyone over the last 15 years so that system of changing managers every season or two has worked<br /><br /><b>[Souness also joined the chorus of critics questioning <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s move to play the Europa League final in Azerbaijan]</b> Taking it to Baku, I just don’t think it’s correct. You are trying to spread the game throughout the world, but if you sat down and picked a more awkward place to get to you would struggle. If it was two Italian teams, two French teams, how difficult is it? Let’s make life difficult for supporters, but we should not be surprised. It’s never been any different. Go back a few years and <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> had the Champions League final at Wembley within a couple of years. Why? There are so many hospitality boxes there and <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> earn so much money out of it that they decided it was a good idea to have it there twice. This is all about finances and the fans are forgotten</p>

  <p><b>[Graeme Souness has backed <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to steamroller <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in Saturday’s Champions League final]</b> I expect <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to turn up and steamroller <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> this weekend, but part of me wonders whether there will be a twist in this tale. we said there would be a team in the Champions League final from England that lost 19 games in all competitions, you would never have believed it. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have done that and they are very lucky to be there and logic suggests their luck will run out on Saturday, but attaching logic to football is rarely productive. So, despite me saying <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are big favourites in this final, it doesn’t mean <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> can’t win on Saturday and one factor is in my mind when I say that. If I was in the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> dressing room, I’d be thinking is their name is on the trophy? They have lost all those games and yet they have come through against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in the Champions League when they were so close to losing and that shows they have got resilience.<br /><br />When one team has better players than the other, they will win nine times out of 10, but we have witnessed what can happen in cup finals before when the big team doesn’t turn up and they are shocked. The key to winning a massive game like this is making sure you don’t get caught up in the moment. You need to start well and don’t hand the initiative to the opposition. They preached that to us in every cup final we played, start well. When I joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I went to a team that were serial winners. I had only been at the club four months and I was playing in a European Cup final at Wembley. It wasn’t like we were sat in the dressing room feeling concerned.<br /><br />There was never a doubt we were going to win it, never any nervousness. You look around the dressing room at players who have done this the year before and that gives you great comfort. When you win it, you hope young players will look to you for that kind of inspiration. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> don’t have that experience of winning things and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> certainly don’t have that. Make sure you start well, concentrate on your own game, get your job done first.<br /><br /><b>[Souness argues just one <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> player would get into the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team]</b> When you put the two teams down on paper, not many <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> players would get into that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team. <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> would get in and possibly <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> at a push, but beyond that I’m struggling. That’s why I see <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> winning this Champions League final. This is a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> team that has no obvious weakness and no-one enjoys playing against them. That’s why they only lost one game in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> all season, but they have yet to win their first big trophy and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> knows he needs to get over that hurdle now. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> will be coming up with a plan of how to stop their opponents, yet <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will go out and play their game and for a majority of the time this season, that has been enough. I expect it will be good enough once again on Saturday</p>

Noble’s received the ball, now go and close him, put him under pressure, make him rush his pass. He’s got time to get his head up and a defender in that situation on the edge of the box is doing his job if he’s walking out and confronting the ball, it’s not enough to just be goalside. Yarmolenko’s shot can only go one way, it can only go to the goalkeeper’s right. I know he’s stretched but the goalkeeper has got to read the body language and where the shot is going to go. United today were passive. There was no energy, no snap in midfield, <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> is living on scraps, it’s a worrying time for them</p>

  <p><b>[Graeme Souness’s <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> flag incident: Manager’s infamous insult to Fenerbahce fans]</b> It was extremely hostile, to say the least, because the supporters - dress it up whatever way you want - don’t like each other very much. One of the vice-presidents of Fenerbahce had said, ‘what are <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> doing signing a cripple as a coach?’. He was referring to surgery I had a couple of years before, which was an open-heart surgery, and I thought that was a pretty unkind thing to say. So, nine months later we won the cup in their stadium. A great big <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> flag was handed over the barbed wire fence and the players all took a turn in waving it, then it was handed to me<br /><br />I waved it, then turned round to hand it to someone, but by that time all the players had run up to the half-way line to get the cup. So I jog up to the half-way line with this great big flag, looking into the emptying stands and in the directors’ box I can see the chap who, nine months previous, had said some pretty unkind things. In a moment of madness, I thought, ‘I’ll show you who’s a cripple’ and I went to the centre circle, tried to get <b>[the flag]</b> into the centre circle. It wouldn’t go in - the ground was so hard - but I managed to get it in at the second or third attempt<br /><br /><b>[Of course, the act of provocation had the desired effect, with Fenerbahce supporters, already reeling from their side’s loss to their rivals, left seething with rage. Indeed, Souness was quickly made to regret his actions as he became entangled with an opposition fan on his way to the dressing room]</b> I lifted my head and realised it wasn’t the smartest thing I’ve ever done. A lot of Fenerbahce supporters were now trying to climb the fence and get onto the pitch. I managed to get under the police shield and there was lots of stuff bouncing off it, but I got into the tunnel and thought I’d gotten away with it. But just as I got into the tunnel I got a thump on the side of the head. A supporter had gotten into the tunnel. So I had a bit of a tussle with him and eventually got back to the safety of the dressing rooms<br /><br />Once I got into the dressing room I thought, ‘once the directors come down, that’s it. I’m going to be sacked on the spot and on the first plane out of here tomorrow’. But it was the exact opposite. Some of them had tears in their eyes and I’ve never been hugged and kissed by so many men in such a short period of time. They were absolutely delighted, obviously, that we’d won the cup, but they seemed even more delighted that I’d planted the flag in the Fenerbahce stadium. And I get it. Turkish society is quite a macho society and I think they could relate to that. I think the Turkish people and the Scottish people are not quite so different. I think we’re quite similar! Slightly mad, emotional and capable of crazy things<br /><br /><b>[Graeme Souness <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> flag incident: The aftermath]</b> I’m not quite sure I’m at that level.

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> could have stopped <a href="eric-cantona.html">Cantona</a> becoming <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> icon but Souness passed on signing]</b> I was manager of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and we played Auxerre in the Cup Winners’ Cup and we lost 2-0 away, we came back and beat them 3-0. After the game, Terry Littlewood, who used to look after the players’ lounge and my lounge, security-wise, knocked on my door and said there’s a pal outside, he’s a good friend of yours and he wants to speak to you. I said ‘who is it?’ and he said ‘it’s Michel Platini’. Not a close pal of mine, the only time I had come in contact with him was when I played against him when I was in Italy. He came in and said ‘I’ve got a player for you, he’s a real problem in France but he’s really talented and he’d be perfect for your club’. I said ‘look, Michel, I’m fighting fires here at the moment, I’m trying to get some people out of the door that are resisting, I’m fighting a dressing room here. The last thing I need is another controversial figure’. Eric of course then came over on trial with <a href="sheffield-wednesday.html">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, then signed for <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> and the rest is history. When he went to United, it was a young team and young players need someone like that on the pitch to look up to. I think Eric was certainly one of them.</p>

These players are like a jigsaw, there’s always a part missing, but <a href="adama-traore.html">Traore</a> has improved and let’s hope he keeps improving because he gets you on the edge of your seat when in full flight. He is a motorcycle! It’s almost impossible <b>[to stop him]</b>.

I’ve said it now a couple of times and it is still true. He is now not only a winger anymore, he keeps the ball, holds the ball and sets up goals, obviously. That makes it so difficult, each ball you lose is 100 per cent a counter-attack and half a goal</p>

  <p><b>[Former Scotland midfielder Graeme Souness says <a href="john-mcginn.html">John McGinn</a> may be key to <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> survival hopes this season and not necessarily <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> transfer target <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a>]</b> There is no doubt they missed <a href="john-mcginn.html">John McGinn</a> after he fractured his ankle. A lot of fuss is made of <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a>, but <a href="john-mcginn.html">McGinn</a> does a lot of the unseen work, the box-to-box aggression, whereas <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> attracts more attention because he spends more time running with the ball. If <a href="john-mcginn.html">McGinn</a> comes back and plays like he did at the start of the season it could help them survive, but they also may find it difficult to hold on to him when the transfer window opens<br /><br />From the outside, it is hard to know what Villa were going for last summer and didn’t get. Did they end up signing the second or third choices on their list? That is always dangerous. Sometimes you must hold your nerve and wait until the right players are available rather than signing people for the sake of it. Their defensive record is the worst in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. In 28 games, they have conceded 56 goals. That means, on average, they need to score three to win. It is a dangerous combination, if you are conceding too many goals and cannot score at the other end and neither Wesley, the big Brazilian, nor Mbwana Samatta, the Tanzanian striker, have really done it for them. Ultimately, it boils down to the most important things in football: management and recruitment. They remind me of Fulham last season. They came up, had a wealthy owner in <a href="shahid-khan.html">Shahid Khan</a> and splashed the cash but wasted most of it and sacked Slavisa Jokanovic and <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Claudio Ranieri</a> before turning to <a href="scott-parker.html">Scott Parker</a> when it was too late to survive. It was a classic case of coming up with a feelgood factor, having achieved something together, and within a couple of months that business plan was torn up</p>

  <p><b>[Another ex-Liverpool star, Graeme Souness, agrees that there is little to choose between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> and Blues]</b> If you’re making a direct comparison between the two teams, they both have top goalkeepers, you’d rather have <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s back four and then City’s midfield, then toss a coin for the attackers. It’s a different type of football, both great to watch. But if you’re playing against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> you have to be prepared to go to war with them. They want to bully you, get in your face and be really aggressive. The three midfield players, you wouldn’t describe any of them as silky, they’re all warrior types. They want to run over you. If you’re playing against City they want to play triangles and pass you to death. So they are different but they’re very special. Who would I rather watch? <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> <b>[against Palace]</b> were fantastic and, against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, City were fantastic. We’re enjoying a purple patch. I think these are two special teams in the time of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. These teams could dominate European football as well</p>

  <p><b>[Graeme Souness says a star-studded squad will be ‘angry’ at having not won more when at the peak of their powers]</b> They won the Champions League last year and now they have won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title, but I still think <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> will look back at this period and feel they should have won more than two major trophies. Okay, there was the Club World Cup as well, but to have been so good and so consistent and yet only won two big trophies, I think the players have got to be a bit angry at themselves about that. The challenge for them now is to win the big trophies consistently and establish prolonged dominance like the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> teams of the past. In five years, if they have dominated <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, if they have dominated the Champions League, then they can be considered as good as any team <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has ever had. But to become a legendary team, you’ve got to become serial winners<br /><br />What I would say is that, given the ages of the players in that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> squad now, given where they are, given the manager they’ve got and the structure in place around the team, they have the potential to go on and become serial winners. These players, especially the goalkeeper and the defenders, could play together for another five years easily. That is a great place to be in, knowing you’ve got that foundation. The signings they have made have been off the charts and Jurgen deserves huge credit for the work he has done</p>

He’s one of three very special players. I love watching <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> play. A couple of years ago, I likened him to <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Kenny Dalglish</a>. He’s like a big cat walking through the jungle waiting for an opportunity to do damage. His radar is on all the time and he’s got a great football brain, whereas <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> and <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, they will catch your eye more because they are direct and they score more goals. They are a wonderful attacking unit, but it’s so important to have a really good defence because you can’t play super football in every single game you play<br /><br />When it’s not going well, you need to know that you won’t be conceding goals. Then, if you’re on the back foot but you don’t concede, you know that at some point in the 90 minutes, one of your special players is going to create something for someone else or score himself. That’s what we had with <a href="ian-rush.html">Ian Rush</a>. We would be under the cosh, we would clear our lines and a couple of passes later Rushy would be on the end of something, putting the ball in the net, and we would nick the game<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have that now with their attacking players and that’s what makes them so dangerous. Even when they are not at their very best, they defend well and they’re capable of nicking games. It’s so important to have those players, those goal-getters who can get you 25 in a season</p>

  <p><b>[How do <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> improve?

  <p><b>[Trent Alexander-Arnold: <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> right-back could play in midfield]</b> I think the boy could play anywhere in midfield. He started out as a central midfield player and then saw an opening at right-back. You would be reluctant to take him away from where he is because a large part of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s attacking play comes from him and <b>[Andrew]</b> Robertson. They have high energy levels, and when they get into the last third, they can deliver. Looking at it now, you’ve just won the league, you are the current European and world champions, so if it ain’t broken, why try to fix it? But the modern defender today, at the top clubs, has to be able to take the ball and play and deliver in the final third, so why not?<br /><br />If you were to ask him, he would be more than happy to play in midfield because that is, I would say, his natural position. He gets more space in the wide areas and then you see the passing range that he has. But that passing range has obviously been built up over the years playing in central midfield. His decision-making probably comes from having less time when he was in central midfield. He’s had to be aware of what’s going on around him. It’s a different game in there. You are dodging bullets and elbows are up.<br /><br />If he’s full-back, he knows nothing is coming <b>[to his right]</b> when he receives the ball. Full-back is a very different position and you get plenty of time there to have your first touch, get it out of your feet and get your head up. But he’s as good as anyone when he gets a chance to deliver.</p>

  <p><b>[Graeme Souness on Jack Grealish: Do top teams carry passengers that stand with their hands on their hips?]</b> He has got quality but do the top teams carry passengers when they don’t have the ball? No - they don’t have players that stand with their hands on their hips when they lose the ball. Everyone rolls their sleeves up to be the first, second or third one to press. That is something that is not in his game right now. I’m not denying he has talent - but for me there’s a big question mark<br /><br />When I was a player, I wouldn’t want to be the most fouled player in the league. That means I’m holding onto the ball too long. That means I’m not seeing the picture early enough, I’m taking extra touches when I don’t need to. He has ability and he’s easy on the eye, silky on the eye. But, I am yet to be convinced by him<br /><br />When I was being coached at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I was told that I had to make the striker’s mind up with my body movement. I’m making them run where I’m looking to kick the ball. I think someone that gets fouled that much isn’t seeing the picture quick enough. As an old midfield player, would I have liked to play against him? I would have loved to have played against him. He allows me to get close to him, get physical with him. I don’t want to play <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a>, <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> or <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a>.
