  <p><b>[Angel Gomes is relieved to be off the mark at senior level for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, with the 18-year-old having joined <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> and James Garner on the scoresheet in pre-season. He netted the winner in a 2-1 victory]</b> I can’t describe how it felt. As soon as it went in I just wanted to celebrate with the fans - that’s why I slipped! This is my second tour now, but it’s my first goal. When I got the chance to come on I wanted to stamp my authority and show what I can do<br /><br /><b>[Gomes had previously seen fellow youngsters Garner and <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> find the target in meetings with Perth Glory and Leeds United]</b> I got a bit of stick off the players because a few different Academy players had scored, so I had to make sure I scored too. It shows what the club are trying to do by bringing the youth products through and our stats are amazing <b>[in pre-season]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[Gomes believes <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s plans are shaping up nicely, with new arrivals Daniel James and <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> having slipped seamlessly into the fold]</b> We’ve had a great tour and the team has gelled well. The new signings have gelled well, everything the coaches have told us has come off and we’re just buzzing to get the season started</p>

  <p><b>[Angel Gomes is determined to impose himself at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> after breaking into <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s senior squad]</b> It’s something I have worked for my whole life. I really don’t want to just see myself as a young player coming up now. I want to impose myself and impose what I can do, and not just show the fans but show the club what I am here for really. It’s exciting times. Obviously, I grew up here, all my life, and just being here is amazing for me really. Being in the first team is something I’ve worked for and I’m slowly realising it<br /><br /><b>[He was pleased with his display in the European clash]</b> I thought I did okay <b>[against Astana]</b>. I tried to get into pockets and tried to go forward, when I could, to create chances. A personal aim is to create a few more chances and get a goal for myself or make a decisive pass that leads to a goal. It <b>[showing skill on the ball]</b> comes with confidence, and having more game time and, obviously, more opportunities to show yourself, so it’s something you can expect from the coming games<br /><br /><b>[Gomes was delighted to see his team-mate <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> net the winning goal]</b> I’ve played with Mason from the under-9s really so it was great to see him score as well. And it was obviously great to play with <a href="tahith-chong.html">Chongy</a> <b>[Tahith Chong]</b> as well because I’ve played with him from the start of the U18s. We all have that understanding and hunger to try and score. It has been a very long journey. Mason and I grew up playing in the U9s and in a lot of tournaments. There are a lot more pics I could have posted but I tried to get a few of the other lads in there too. You can see Dylan <b>[Levitt]</b> and Dion <b>[McGhee]</b>. So it was great for him to score his first professional goal. He deserves it. He works hard every day and hopefully a lot more of us can demonstrate that as well.</p>

  <p><b>[Angel Gomes waiting for chance amid <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> future questions of teenage winger]</b> It’s just getting the opportunity really and being able to take it with both hands. Whichever game that is, it’s being able to do my best to show what I can do<br /><br /><b>[If Gomes does figure against Tranmere, then he could line up alongside fellow academy graduates Brandon Willians, James Garner, <a href="tahith-chong.html">Tahith Chong</a> and <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a>]</b> We speak about it often, when we compare it to tournaments we went to when we were younger. Stuff like that. Growing up in the academy, we didn’t really think we’d all make it together into the first team and be there around it. That was always the goal but we were often told you don’t always make it through together with your team-mates. Luckily, we’ve had the chance to break through and to make it through together. Everyone is just encouraging towards us and each chance each of us gets is to try to show why we’re in the first team</p>

  <p><b>[Chong’s teammate Angel Gomes’ future is currently up in the air with the teenager’s contract ending in the summer]</b> I remember just warming up, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> was shouting at me and I was just daydreaming staring at the fans, stretching. It wasn’t until a steward was like ‘Angel’ and I looked back and he was like ‘the manager’ and I was like ‘oh, I’m actually gonna come on’. I just remember <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> walking off and I was just like ‘whoa’</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and Angel Gomes contract negotiations at a standstill]</b> I’ve seen it over the years, coming up from the academy and being at United my whole career. It’s what I want to go on to do - win trophies for the club<br /><br />The boys (Chong and Gomes) have got a great attitude. They’re absolutely top-class boys and we’re doing what we can to keep them because in a few years we can see them becoming very, very good players</p>

  <p><b>[Angel Gomes could still leave his mark at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> but time is running out]</b> I’ve still got massive hopes for him. He’s got a contract dispute at the minute, which all players have, and I don’t get involved in that. That’s what he does with his agent and the club. That’s personal. The boy trains every day and works hard. His work ethic, the way he approaches training every day, and the way he approaches games whether he’s playing for the reserve team, U19s, first team, is spot on. His talent is unbelievable. Angel has to get the right niche at the right time. If it all comes together then we’ve got one hell of a player on our hands</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> starlet Angel Gomes has sought to model his game on <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a>, with <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>, <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Carlos Tevez</a>, Robinho and <a href="nani.html">Nani</a> also providing inspiration for the promising winger]</b> In terms of who I model parts of my game on, I’d say <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>. He was always one of my idols. <b>[He was]</b> a big player I watched while growing up. <b>[He played]</b> in similar positions as me and I’ve always tried modelling my game on <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>. In terms of footballers when I was young it was always <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>, the Brazilian players, Robinho and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> at the time. I remember the Joga Bonito stuff with the freestyling and stuff like that. As a youngster, all you wanted to do was practise skills, so I’d say players like <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> <b>[were my inspiration]</b>. I had an uncle, we used to go to his house. We’d sit and watch videos and he was quite old-school, so he’d show me players like <b>[Diego]</b> <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> <b>[and Juan Roman]</b> <a href="juan-roman-riquelme.html">Riquelme</a>. I watched <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> growing up as well. Then obviously, when I was growing up at United, <a href="nani.html">Nani</a> had a big influence on me and when I was around eight years old, when I used to go and watch, it was that time when we had a great season and <b>[we had]</b> <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <b>[Carlos]</b> <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Tevez</a>. All those players inspired me when I was growing up.</p>

  <p><b>[Video shows <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> teenager Angel Gomes visiting prophet in Nigeria in attempt to heal his injury woes]</b> I play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> Football Club. And I’ve been struggling really with injuries. I’ve been having injuries around my hip and groin which have been affecting me playing. I also suffered an ankle injury not long ago which kept me out for a long time. These injuries would come at hard times for me, times when I was having a breakthrough or times when I had to go to a tournament or playing games, these injuries would happen quite frequently. I play for Man United, I also represent the England national team Under-17 level as captain. I’ve known about the Synagogue Church of Nations for a long time. As my family follows the prophet, my parents are big fans. So we thought it would be a good time for me to come and be touched by the prophet<br /><br />Regarding the video that has come out from 2016. I am from a Christian family and at the time my mum was a fan of the pastor, and she really wanted me to go. I was going through some issues. From the outside looking in it looks crazy, but I was just practising my faith. I didn’t really need to explain myself but a lot of people were asking me what the video was about. I was young at the time and if my parents thought something was best for me I would do it. There are far more important issues out there in the world we can tackle</p>
