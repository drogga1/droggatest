  <p><b>[Who is Angel Gomes? The Man Utd wonderkid with a big future]</b> Obviously, it’s a dream come true. I’ve been here since the age of six, working my way up and it’s what everyone dreams about. I just want to thank the manager for putting me on the bench and playing me today, and all the staff back at the club and everyone who has helped me. I’m from Manchester, Salford and it’s literally down the road. It’s just unbelievable.</p>

  <p><b>[Angel Gomes says he intends to remain level-headed after scoring in front of Jose Mourinho for the club’s under-23 side]</b> It’s a great club. Playing at Old Trafford is the dream. It’s the main aim. As long as I can carry on getting better and impressing, hopefully, in the future, I can get a chance. I’ve got to put that <b>[expectation]</b> to one side. The best players get to the top because they have stayed level-headed. I’ve got to carry on working hard and keep putting everything in to training and games.<br /><br />It was a great experience. Just being around the first team, seeing how they train and being able to pick up little things, it’s positive. Going on tour was an added bonus for the younger players. Even if you don’t get as many minutes, you’re in the manager’s eyesight and he can see how you train, how you prepare and he can compare you to the first team players. Going to the US was about trying to progress and show him what you’re capable of</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s Angel Gomes says he was temporarily deafened by the crowd at Old Trafford]</b> Yes, it’s always nice to come on, especially when you are a young lad, following in the footsteps of the other players who are progressing and doing well. To come on and hear the crowd cheering you on was a great feeling for me. My ears actually blocked! I couldn’t really hear, but, as soon as I got on, I felt at ease. The players helped me, they spoke to me and gave me instructions and I was fine from then on. It is just the start, it was good. Me and <b>[fellow youth star]</b> Jimmy <b>[Garner]</b> travelled for the last game as well so to travel again was an added bonus and to get some minutes was great and I think United’s about bringing youth through and I think with the new manager and how things are going it is there for the taking really<br /><br />He told me to enjoy myself, get on the pitch, come inside, get on the ball and get as many touches as I can and to enjoy the atmosphere. I tried to do that coming on and it was a great experience. It just the start and whichever team I play for - the reserves, in the Youth League or the first team, I will give it my all and I will take every opportunity as it comes.<br /><br />He is a legend at the club. The fans will get behind him because the things he won with the club and how great of a player he was. For the manger to come in and for me to learn from a manager like Solskjaer is great and the other younger lads too because growing up we were all watching him. It is a great feeling</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United’s next generation are hungry for more after getting a thrilling taste of the big stage against Paris Saint-Germain]</b> It was a great experience, not just for me but all of the lads who came and got involved. I think there were eight players who have come through the academy that came on the trip and it just shows how much the club has an interest in the youth. It is big for the club and it showed, everywhere, how great this club is.<br /><br />The more that come, the more it shows Man United. I think it was great for Mason and Chongy to be involved. It is an experience they will never forget as well. I have grown up with these boys, right from Under-9s to now. To see us all with the first team, travelling and getting some experiences, is amazing.<br /><br />Obviously, I have only watched from the sides and been in the crowd myself, so to be able to go out and celebrate with the fans was an amazing experience and it’s something I will never forget. What was also massive for me was Sir Alex <b>[Ferguson]</b> and Eric <b>[Cantona]</b> coming in afterwards to shake hands and speak to us. They are massive, massive people and just to have them in the changing room. I think it got everybody a bit more excited and everyone was a bit overwhelmed really</p>

He netted the winner in a 2-1 victory]</b> I can’t describe how it felt. As soon as it went in I just wanted to celebrate with the fans - that’s why I slipped! This is my second tour now, but it’s my first goal. When I got the chance to come on I wanted to stamp my authority and show what I can do<br /><br /><b>[Gomes had previously seen fellow youngsters Garner and <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> find the target in meetings with Perth Glory and <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a>]</b> I got a bit of stick off the players because a few different Academy players had scored, so I had to make sure I scored too. It shows what the club are trying to do by bringing the youth products through and our stats are amazing <b>[in pre-season]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[Gomes believes <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s plans are shaping up nicely, with new arrivals <a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a> and <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Aaron Wan-Bissaka</a> having slipped seamlessly into the fold]</b> We’ve had a great tour and the team has gelled well.

  <p><b>[Angel Gomes is determined to impose himself at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> after breaking into <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s senior squad]</b> It’s something I have worked for my whole life. I really don’t want to just see myself as a young player coming up now. I want to impose myself and impose what I can do, and not just show the fans but show the club what I am here for really. It’s exciting times. Obviously, I grew up here, all my life, and just being here is amazing for me really. Being in the first team is something I’ve worked for and I’m slowly realising it<br /><br /><b>[He was pleased with his display in the European clash]</b> I thought I did okay <b>[against Astana]</b>. I tried to get into pockets and tried to go forward, when I could, to create chances. A personal aim is to create a few more chances and get a goal for myself or make a decisive pass that leads to a goal. It <b>[showing skill on the ball]</b> comes with confidence, and having more game time and, obviously, more opportunities to show yourself, so it’s something you can expect from the coming games<br /><br /><b>[Gomes was delighted to see his team-mate <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> net the winning goal]</b> I’ve played with Mason from the under-9s really so it was great to see him score as well. And it was obviously great to play with <a href="tahith-chong.html">Chongy</a> <b>[<a href="tahith-chong.html">Tahith Chong</a>]</b> as well because I’ve played with him from the start of the U18s. We all have that understanding and hunger to try and score. It has been a very long journey. Mason and I grew up playing in the U9s and in a lot of tournaments. There are a lot more pics I could have posted but I tried to get a few of the other lads in there too. You can see Dylan <b>[Levitt]</b> and Dion <b>[McGhee]</b>. So it was great for him to score his first professional goal. He deserves it. He works hard every day and hopefully a lot more of us can demonstrate that as well.</p>

Stuff like that. Growing up in the academy, we didn’t really think we’d all make it together into the first team and be there around it. That was always the goal but we were often told you don’t always make it through together with your team-mates. Luckily, we’ve had the chance to break through and to make it through together. Everyone is just encouraging towards us and each chance each of us gets is to try to show why we’re in the first team</p>

  <p><b>[Angel Gomes could still leave his mark at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> but time is running out]</b> I’ve still got massive hopes for him. He’s got a contract dispute at the minute, which all players have, and I don’t get involved in that. That’s what he does with his agent and the club. That’s personal. The boy trains every day and works hard. His work ethic, the way he approaches training every day, and the way he approaches games whether he’s playing for the reserve team, U19s, first team, is spot on. His talent is unbelievable. Angel has to get the right niche at the right time. If it all comes together then we’ve got one hell of a player on our hands</p>

  <p><b>[Video shows <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> teenager Angel Gomes visiting prophet in Nigeria in attempt to heal his injury woes]</b> I play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> Football Club. And I’ve been struggling really with injuries. I’ve been having injuries around my hip and groin which have been affecting me playing. I also suffered an ankle injury not long ago which kept me out for a long time. These injuries would come at hard times for me, times when I was having a breakthrough or times when I had to go to a tournament or playing games, these injuries would happen quite frequently. I play for Man United, I also represent the England national team Under-17 level as captain. I’ve known about the Synagogue Church of Nations for a long time. As my family follows the prophet, my parents are big fans. So we thought it would be a good time for me to come and be touched by the prophet<br /><br />Regarding the video that has come out from 2016. I am from a Christian family and at the time my mum was a fan of the pastor, and she really wanted me to go. I was going through some issues. From the outside looking in it looks crazy, but I was just practising my faith. I didn’t really need to explain myself but a lot of people were asking me what the video was about. I was young at the time and if my parents thought something was best for me I would do it. There are far more important issues out there in the world we can tackle</p>
