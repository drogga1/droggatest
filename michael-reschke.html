  <p>[On Thomas Tuchel] I had a trusting relationship with Thomas Tuchel, and knew that he admired Pep’s work. Pep, on the other hand, was impressed with Mainz’s displays. He often talked to me about Thomas</p>

  <p>[Stuttgart have slammed the door on any prospective bids of less than €30 million for in-demand defender Benjamin Pavard] We are the ideal club for him right now and he feels that. If, in the future, a club from Europe’s top 10 shows real interest, we’ll sit down. Benjamin and his agent are aware of it. But, if this summer a club believes they can sign him for €30m, this club is profoundly wrong. We wouldn’t even open the door for such a talk.</p>

  <p>[Arsenal the perfect stepping stone for ambitious Real Madrid fan Bernd Leno] He came from the second team of VfB Stuttgart and had not played a minute of professional football. We decided to play him although we knew, by doing so, that we had an inexperienced 18-year-old in goal for at least 10 Bundesliga matches, three matches in the Champions League and two cup matches.</p>

  <p>[Pavard’s value has skyrocketed during the World Cup, but he will be available for €35 million in 2019 due to a release clause in his contract] We make no secret of the fact that Benjamin has an exit clause for 2019. We would forego a lot of money if he plays with us for another year. I think that he will change for the 2019-20 season and play for one of the top eight clubs in Europe.</p>

  <p>[Stuttgart were beaten to the signing of teenage wonderkid Alphonso Davies by Bayern Munich] Congratulations, FC Bayern. We were in Vancouver at the same time as Bayern and tried to sign this guy. But Bayern had a few more important points on their end to sign him.<br /><br />With Benjamin Pavard there was this one moment in which we realised that he is ready to stay with us for one more season. For us it was very important to know that he is fully convinced to stay in Stuttgart. He is a top player and a top guy. Benji has the level to play for every top European club and we fully respect if he does from July 1st 2019 on. He has very good offers which we know about because we have a very open relationship. He is outstanding in duels, has a great heading game and strong initial play. The club which will sign him in the end will have fun with an amazing athlete for years</p>
