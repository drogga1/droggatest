  <p><b>[Luca Zidane expects time away from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to aid his development as he embarks upon a season-long loan at Racing Santander]</b> I want to grow as a footballer at a historic club. I couldn’t be happier or more excited about this new chapter I’m starting. It’s going to be good for me to leave <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> <b>[the club]</b> and Madrid <b>[the city]</b>, to get to know a new team and a new place. Every day I will seek to improve, to grow, to take steps forward and I think Racing is the best possible place to do that</p>
