  <p><b>[Bojan on life in Amsterdam and with Ajax]</b> It’s a great city on many levels. It has a very distinctive culture and a new philosophy, which I’m learning. They know what they want here and they are very well organised. Working on a daily basis with people like <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Bergkamp</a>, Stam or <a href="frank-de-boer.html">Frank de Boer</a> is fantastic. My spirits are lifting again because I feel like a key part of the team. I feel very happy. Every team wants to play good football and has young players. They don’t go out to defend. That makes football fun in Holland. People aren’t arrogant here either. Footballers are much more modest and are very positive. The league itself is very appealing</p>

  <p><b>[Bojan Krkic opens up on his anxiety attacks as a teenager that stopped him from going to <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> EURO 2008 with Spain]</b> There was a pressure here <b>[signalling his head]</b>, powerful, never going away. I was fine when I went into the dressing room for the France game but I started to feel this powerful dizziness, overwhelmed, panicked, and they lay me on the physio’s bench. That was the first time but I had nasty episodes like that again. There’s medicine, psychological treatment to overcome the barriers you’ve erected, the fear. It started in February and it lasted until the summer. When the Euros came I decided I couldn’t go, that I had to isolate myself</p>

  <p><b>[Bojan Krkic says he expects Saturday’s Champions League final between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> to be a ‘great show’ between two incredible teams]</b> The final of the Champions League between representatives of the Premier League will measure two rivals with very strong characteristics. For me, what makes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> special is that they are a team that works very well on the lines, very compact, in which everyone attacks and defends. In addition to that, they have a lot of variety: the midfield has hardworking players, with quality and speed, who give many alternatives to the players at the attack, who at the same time protect the defense very well. These virtues make them very competitive. Tactically it is run by one of the best coaches in football today, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>. So it’s going to be a game where <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is going to put a lot of intensity, wanting to take advantage of the spaces that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> can leave, especially working as a team, which is how it has done throughout this season, with such good results.<br /><br />For its part, one of the keys of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> is that it has players who know each other very well for two or three years. They have not made changes and are managed by the same coach, <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>. Therefore, they perfectly apply the idea of ​​team and style of play. In the squad there are players of a high level and quality, as is the case of <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>, who brings a lot of work in the midfield, especially in strategy plays, and who offers several options in playmaking roles. And in the attack they have one of the most fit players this year at European level, from my point of view: Son Heung-min. It is a very well-worked team. <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> is a manager with a lot of character, so <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> applies it in the field. That’s why they have eliminated big clubs like <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> or Ajax. It is a rival that surely will cause <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> problems in strategy actions and second plays. Without a doubt, we will see a great show</p>

  <p><b>[How Bojan Krkic overcame anxiety attacks to become his own man]</b> In the end, I know my qualities and I know I’m not <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. I’m Bojan. If people want to say ‘This guy was not the new Messi’, okay, yeah I was not the new <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>.<br /><br />At 17, my life changed entirely. I went to the Under-17 World Cup in July and no one knew me; when I came back, I couldn’t even walk down the road. It was all good but your head fills until there’s a moment that your body says ‘stop’.<br /><br /><b>[while getting ready for the match, he was overcome by anxiety]</b> I was fine when I went into the dressing room but I started to feel this powerful dizziness, overwhelmed, panicked, and they lay me on the physio’s bench. That was the first time but I had nasty episodes like that again<br /><br /><b>[Spain national team coach Luis Aragones wanted to call Bojan up for the 2008 European Championship - a tournament La Roja ultimately won]</b> When the Euros came I decided I couldn’t go, that I had to isolate myself. Everyone at the federation knew <b>[about my anxiety]</b>: Luis Aragonés and <a href="fernando-hierro.html">Fernando Hierro</a> <b>[the sporting director]</b>. <a href="fernando-hierro.html">Hierro</a> sent me messages every week to ask how I was and the day before the squad was announced, they rang. ‘Bojan, we’re going to call you up’. I was in the car, going to training. I said: ‘It hurts to say this but I can’t.’ The next day I saw a headline: ‘Spain call up Bojan and Bojan says no’. That headline kills me, it’s as if I don’t care. What hurt was that the headline presumably came from the Federation<br /><br /><b>[Deep down, Bojan knew that the only way to secure regular first-team football was to move away from Camp Nou]</b> It would have been easy to stay at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and not play but I needed to go. Maybe at times I should have been more patient but I’ve always been honest making decisions <b>[to move]</b>. I always wanted to play<br /><br /><b>[Bojan is plying his trade with Montreal Impact in the MLS]</b> The most important thing isn’t the trophies, it’s the experiences, what you lived, what’s here in your heart, what you know, what you live. I love football and no one will ever take that from me. I’m proud of my career, proud of what I have lived, and even if there are hard moments, you have to be strong</p>

  <p><b>[Bojan embraces all that has led to him to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> reunion]</b> I see it different. Everything now is different from what I had when I was 17 years old. All of the bad things <b>[that have happened]</b>, they are not bad things. It’s helping you to do big steps to grow. I learned a lot from all of those steps that I did. I’m really happy to have lived those mistakes because now I am who I am<br /><br /><b>[Bojan said of Henry]</b> It’s difficult to see when you play with someone. But he’s someone that I always had respect for as a player and, for me, as a young player when I started with him, I tried to always be with him in the dressing room, to listen to what he had to say. It’s good to have him<br /><br />The important thing for the players when sometimes we don’t play, we say, ‘It’s the coach! The coach is not playing me!’ But I think if we think about ourselves, you need to help your coach, especially now at the beginning of preseason. In my case with Thierry, I will not think about Thierry. I will think about me being in good condition physically, doing good things to play good and then Thierry can help me to grow and play better. I know that if I give this to him, he can help me<br /><br />Sometimes you think about football and most of the time you think about personal life. To come away from your town, from your home, sometimes it’s not easy to make that decision, but when you do it and you do this step, it helps you to grow as a man. I’m very happy with the decision I made in August to come to Montreal and play football in Montreal in this league. From the first day when I came to Montreal, I felt that it was a special city, a nice city with nice people. I’m happy to be there</p>

  <p><b>[Bojan Krkic comments on <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a>’s decision move to MLS]</b> It’s difficult to judge these types of decisions. The ones that are criticizing the move, it’s his decision. Everyone is going to do the same. <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a> is one player that he is doing a really nice career in Europe. He’s played with a lot of teams. When we decide to do a step forward, it’s not only professional. It’s personal, not just professional, because we are humans. If he decided to come here, they need to respect that. He’s coming to a league and we are saying this league is competitive and every year it’s more competitive and more important. It’s going to be a good move for him, for the league. We have big players, important players, that have a lot of experience to share. He’ll help his team to be more important</p>

I don’t like comparisons in the world of football, but there are regular players and there are players at a very high level and Leo is one of them<br /><br />What makes the difference is the number of years he’s been competing at that level. Getting to the top is not as difficult as staying there - especially at the level Leo is at. The expectations that he generates every day is practically inhuman. Very few can do what Leo does</p>

  <p><b>[Bojan Krkic says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> need to stop ‘improvising’ in the transfer market]</b> <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> have a plan. Or they had one. And I urge them to return to it. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> have always been characterised as a club that sells well, while at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> the holy sign of our colours, which makes us great, has been La Masia. Without our way of being, we would never have enjoyed <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> or <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>, among many others. Those three players don’t just figure in privileged positions in the history of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, but also form part of football’s history. The three were all on the Ballon d’Or podium in 2010, screaming to the world that we are unique and that, being unique, we are ourselves. And that doesn’t mean no signings from outside. Signings like Trincao are strategic, beyond the price, but as long there is a plan with what to do with him. After playing for Braga, does he have a place guaranteed in <a href="quique-setien.html">Quique Setien</a>’s squad? Will <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> look for a loan? Those answers must be given by those running the club at the moment. And the feeling is that there are no answers. What are we doing with Riqui Puig? Will <a href="ansu-fati.html">Ansu Fati</a> continue with the first team? <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> cannot improvise with such important decisions. And that goes for the management of the U19s and the B team. Signing <a href="martin-braithwaite.html">Braithwaite</a> when <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> got injured, as was the case with signing Maxi Lopez after <a href="samuel-eto-o.html">Samuel Eto’o</a> got injured, is improvising. It is betraying the plan that has made us great. It’s urgent that we get back to believing in ourselves. Only that way will we continue to be ourselves</p>

If you allow me a name, I would bet more on Firmino: a link player, with a lot of presence and great mobility. I do not intend that this reflection be interpreted as a refusal to sign the Argentine, but I understand that his profile must be analysed very well because it would be unforgivable that, as happened with <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a>, we sign a striker to put him on the wing and then complain that it doesn’t work. That cannot happen again because, although it seems obvious, a nine is a nine. That is his natural habitat and to move him from there is to waste his talent.
