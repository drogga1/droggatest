  <p><b>[Milla says the squad that went to South Africa 2010 was shapeless]</b> We had no team, we had no coach, and this was what we alerted even before the World Cup. The coach <b>[Paul Le Guen]</b> needed to carry out some major reforms before the tournament but nobody listened to him or us, who were shouting. The coach needed to carry out some major reforms before the tournament but nobody listened to him or us, who were shouting. In Cameroon, we don’t have to count on stars. The star we have is the squad itself. It is our cohesion that makes us strong. We’re a team that plays for a nation. We don’t have or need a star<br /><br />I don’t have a personal problem with Eto’o, I have a problem with the kind of football he plays in the national team. I have told him before that one day he would be the boss of the team and he’d be the one to galvanise everyone. But he’s not producing what’s expected of him. We, their predecessors, built and left a strong team, and so we feel very bad to see the Lions in tatters today</p>

  <p><b>[African football legend Roger Milla sees no challenge for Cameroon from Ghana and company]</b> The group stage shouldn’t be challenging for the Lions. Ghana, Benin and Guinea-Bissau are teams we’ve beaten in the past - be it during the Nations Cup or in qualifiers. We shouldn’t be afraid of anyone. It’s up to <a href="clarence-seedorf.html">Seedorf</a> and <a href="patrick-kluivert.html">Kluivert</a> to build a good team for the various games. So far, <b>[coach Clarence]</b> <a href="clarence-seedorf.html">Seedorf</a> has done a good job with qualifying the team but now is the most crucial part and he needs to live up to expectations. The ideal scenario will be for Cameroon to win their sixth trophy in Egypt and clinch a seventh in 2021 when the country stages the Africa Cup of Nations. This will be tough - but it’s possible</p>
