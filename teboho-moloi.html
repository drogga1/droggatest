<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Chippa United coach Teboho Moloi says he never undermined the head coach during his time as assistant coach at Orlando Pirates]</b> When I was an assistant I always used to see myself as a coach because I’d also bark instructions, and it would be seen as I’m saying something different to the coach, but I still maintain that I grew up in that <b>[Pirates]</b> team. When you grew up in your house, how can you stand up from having lunch and go to the corner and piss there, instead of using the bathroom? I would never give an instruction that was against what the coach wanted or that was not beneficial for Pirates to win at that time.<br /><br />I knew that whatever I was doing then was in the best interest of the team, so I don’t know now <b>[at Chippa]</b> whether it’s different from there or not. The only thing I can tell is you different is that I have to be in the office now, like I was asked <b>[by the media]</b>, ‘Coach, how many players do you think you’re going to reinforce?’. I never used to make those decisions - the financial decisions, travelling, replacements and all that - and now I have to put my head on the block</p>
