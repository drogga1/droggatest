<blockquote>
  <p>[PLC’s meetings with financial services company Deloitte carried on for a second day on Thursday at the UAE Football Association offices] We are happy with the collaboration with the PLC in this club development project. It is an indication of the PLC’s keenness to develop its competitions. We are a global company, working with various sport sectors across the world. In the past 20 years we worked with around 50 sporting establishments and leagues in 40 countries to help leagues and clubs develop sporting competitions.<br /><br />Our current project with the PLC is not something new for us, we have done the same before in multiple countries, so we are trying to offer our expertise in this area by working with the PLC and football companies to benefit from the best practices. What is available somewhere else may not necessarily be applicable here in the UAE, therefore, we will be working with the PLC to develop a mechanism to be implemented in the future to achieve financial sustainability for clubs, regulate spending, minimise reliance on government support, assist clubs in increasing their revenues and balancing revenues with expenditure</p>
