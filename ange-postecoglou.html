  <p><b>[Australia head coach Ange Postecoglou has named a 30-man squad for two 2018 World Cup qualifiers this month]</b> We have named an extended squad with a few notable returns but we will make a final decision after this weekend’s matches around Australia, Asia and Europe. With the Asian leagues and some countries in Europe only just starting I wanted to have another look.<br /><br />There is also recognition for some players who have been in good form in the A-League and have the characteristics to fit in with some of our experienced players as we move into an important stretch of qualifying</p>

He wasn’t even in consideration <b>[for the Australia squad]</b></p>

  <p><b>[On Riley McGree]</b> I just think he’s a really exciting talent. I watched him from the first couple of games he played and he kind of makes you stand up and notice him straight away for a young guy. He’s been playing not in his best position for his club who are going through a difficult time and he’s shown a real good temperament and an ability to tackle the task in front of him. Riley is a good chance to make the 23. He’s not there just to put his name amongst the 30 players, he’s in the frame.</p>

Again his training’s been good and he feels really good. From our perspective, it’s not the first time we’ve brought Timmy in with limited game time. He’s proved pretty resilient in the past in being able to do a job for us.<br /><br />With Timmy, there’s no expectations on him to play two 90 minutes of football. It’s more about the impact he can make in the two games. He’s proved that in the past. Hopefully he can get some minutes this weekend to top him up a little bit and hopefully he comes into camp in decent condition</p>

If he looks like he’s adjusted well in training and looks bright, we won’t be afraid to throw him in, either. We haven’t had in the A-League too many teenagers even getting a run these days. I thought he looked exciting from the moment he broke into the team. I really like the way he’s adjusted to playing in an unfamiliar position against some pretty good opponents. He’s played <b>[AFC]</b> Champions League and A-League. He’s just someone I want to have a look at. This is the best time for me to have a look at him in this environment. Our next game’s not until June and the A-League would have well and truly finished by then.</p>

  <p><b>[When asked if he thought Iraq could emerge victorious tonight]</b> No, I don’t think they can beat Australia, because I’m the Australian coach. If I thought that, I wouldn’t be in my job. We’re expecting a tough game and we expect a tough game every time we play, but when we’re in camp we talk about Australia. We talk about our team, we talk about our football.<br /><br />We respect every opponent, sometimes maybe it works in our favour that other teams maybe don’t respect us, but we’ll see that on the pitch <b>[on Thursday night]</b>. We’re Asian champions, we’ve qualified for the last three World Cups, we want to qualify for our fourth World Cup and we’re going to a Confederations Cup. We concentrate on ourselves and if we play our football, we don’t fear anybody<br /><br />What we saw when we played them in the first game in Perth is that they tend to sit pretty defensive and not open up too much. We’ve seen that with just about all the teams we’ve played against. Whether because they have nothing to lose they become a little bit more attacking, either way, we’ll be prepared. From our perspective it’s always great if a team does open up a little bit against us because it gives us a chance to play our football. But if they decide to sit back, we’ve got plenty of practise against that as well</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos boss Ange Postecoglou rued his side’s second half display and inability to control large parts of the contest after a 1-1 draw with Iraq]</b> Especially in the second half we really didn’t cope with them being fairly direct. And we just weren’t strong enough in our defensive areas. We were continually scrambling for things and never really got a hold of the game. The first half, in the last 20 minutes <b>[of the half]</b> we got good control of it but we needed that second goal and in the end they <b>[Iraq]</b> got one.<br /><br />In patches. But at the end of the day, regardless of the system we came up with there were just some contests out there where we were second best, which was causing us all sorts of problems. Just about every header in the defensive half we just failed to clear and that caused us some problems. And them playing direct helped them. There were a lot of second balls, a lot of scrambling. But having said that we had a lot of opportunities to get a hold of the game ourselves and sometimes we lacked a little bit of composure and bravery to keep playing our football<br /><br />Our performance probably didn’t warrant three points today. We really didn’t cope well particularly in the second half and in the end they <b>[Iraq]</b> probably got the point they deserved</p>

Perhaps if I was a foreign coach we’d all sit back and say ‘what a genius’. You know what, if someone’s got a system out there that stops oppositions from doing anything, I think it’s called the ‘11 against nothing’ <b>[system]</b> but, you know what, it’s a game of football. We’ve got to try and score goals, which we did. We created a number of opportunities, which we probably should have scored from and … like I said, if people want the perfect system it’s probably their hot water system at home but it ain’t a football system.</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou has claimed he would get rid of the A-League’s salary cap if he was in charge of Australia’s top division]</b> Get rid of the salary cap. I want teams who aspire to be the best to be the best. It’s pretty radical and goes against everything we’ve understood about sport in Australia and <b>[the A-League]</b> has obviously borrowed from Aussie Rules and rugby league, but in our game I’ve seen just so many of our good young players go overseas at the wrong time because we can’t keep them here. I’ve seen too many good players who want to come here and not be able to because of constraints of the cap.<br /><br /><b>[Postecoglou reiterated his desire for tactical debates but insisted critics wouldn’t be allowed free shots at him]</b> I love debate, but when I say debate, it means it goes both ways. If you question the coach, you’ve got to expect a response. I’m not saying I want people to debate it and I’ve got to sit there and accept what they say, I think it goes both ways and that’s the stimulating bit. You get differences of opinion and I’m not going to be happy with some of the questions and they’re not going to be happy with some of the answers. It doesn’t bother me. I think it’s a good thing. That’s exactly what we want but I think people get a bit sensitive because I don’t agree with their views but I actually like the fact that they’ve actually got an opinion</p>

At the same time, Ajdin <b>[Hrustic]</b> has come in and looked really good at training and we had Riley <b>[McGree]</b> in the last camp, so we’re constantly challenging things in that area as well.</p>

Our second 45 was outstanding and credit to the players. These are the kind of games you want to win. You don’t want to be holding on.<br /><br />I said before the game we’re a little in a hurry to get these guys sort of mature and it just takes time. Tomi’s developing all the time and it’s been his first full season <b>[at club level]</b>. He said he played about 30 games this year and that’s a first time in his career and I’ve no doubt he’ll keep developing in his career. He was great tonight. Not just his goals but he held the ball up well and caused some problems. We were in a rush to get into a certain place and we’ve just got to take our time with these guys. In the coming years they’ll grow into exciting players</p>

  <p><b>[Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou insisted he got plenty out of Tuesday night’s 4-0 friendly loss to Brazil]</b> You never like getting defeated and you don’t like a heavy defeat, particularly at home. So that has always has an effect but it doesn’t have to be a negative effect though. From our perspective it’s about now preparing for that game in a week’s time. We get on a plane tomorrow and it will be good to get over there and start knuckling down in our preparation for that game. We’ll be ready for that. Tonight we had some objectives to get out of the game. For the most part we achieved them but we failed to deliver in others<br /><br />We did need to get some game time into some players and that was important tonight. For guys like Bailey Wright and <b>[James]</b> Troisi and others in the team, who haven’t played 90 minutes in a very long time, it was good to get them out there and they’ll be better for that</p>

There are a few new faces as well to have a look at, but overall pretty pleased with the shape we are in.<br /><br />It is going to be a great challenge playing away from home against one of the top nations but that’s what we like to embrace as a team. We are looking forward to going over there and hopefully getting three points which will put us in great shape for qualification<br /><br /><b>[As for the final World Cup qualifier in Melbourne]</b> Wherever we have played away from home in this group there have been large crowds to support the home team which definitely makes a difference and we want the same in Melbourne.

He was very keen. But speaking to him last night, <b>[he’s]</b> not going to get in a game to see how he feels. Being a long trip, and his long absence from game time, he felt he wasn’t right so he ruled himself out. I think it would’ve been great to have him there, he’s the captain and been a big part of what we’ve done over the last four years. He’s been struggling with this injury for quite a while but kept playing with us through that. We have enough depth in that area to cover his absence.</p>

Whether that’s in a physical sense or with possession or with territory. Which way that’ll be will depend a little bit on how the opposition set up and which areas we can capitalise on. We’ll go into the game like we have every other World Cup qualifier and that is trying to win. While we respect our opposition always, we always believe we have the capability to win the game.<br /><br />It’s not just about qualifying for us. We want to continue to evolve and become a really strong team to compete at a World Cup and do well. If you can beat Japan away from home, it’s a good indicator that you’re a strong team. It’s not just about getting a result - it’s about playing well against a quality opponent and showing that we have progressed as a team</p>

  <p><b>[Ange Postecoglou ended Yokohama F.

It was always going to take a bit of time. But it’s consistent with what I’ve done before. I knew coming into it, the way I wanted to play was going to challenge everyone in the club. We had some really good moments and some poor moments. There was a massive difference in our best and worst, that was reflected in the results. We still made the cup final. At times, we played some good stuff.<br /><br />This year, we’ve changed the squad a fair bit. The main thing for me is we have players here who have the characteristics in what I need and I also think the club now understands sort of what we’re trying to achieve. Everyone is fully supportive of it. The start of the season is promising. We are certainly more consistent than the last year but it’s a tough league. Every week is a challenge, every week the opposition has outstanding players.<br /><br />Wherever I’ve coached, I want to win things. There’s no shying away from that, as much as I want my team playing a certain way because I believe you can be successful doing it that way. What success looks like, I’ve never really thought that way.<br /><br />When I get a team to play the way I want to, success follows. That’s the first challenge. We will see where that takes us. Hopefully we can win some silverware for the club and more importantly, win silverware playing a certain way. It will be exciting for the fans and hopefully make a difference to football</p>

I think all the times I’ve coached, especially at club level, it’s always a happy ending.

Ultimately, it’s about goals scored and that excites me a lot more than anything at all else. Each individual year I want us to rating extra objectives than the other workforce<br /><br />We want to be truly sturdy with our pressing in the entrance third. I want my goalkeeper and our back again four and our keeping midfielders to be seriously brave in the way they engage in out, probably consider them out of their comfort and ease zone. The flip side is I want our strikers to get the job done tricky defensively, which occasionally doesn’t appear obviously because strikers tend to come to existence when the staff has the ball<br /><br />My belief is that if you can get them to get in and have intent and earn the ball in the entrance 3rd, you will have more options for yourself</p>

  <p><b>[Ange Postecoglou’s struggle with Australian sport]</b> Part of my struggle with Australian sport is there’s always been this real pension for having equalisation. Every one of our sports has salary caps and measures to make sure the competition’s equal and makes club and organisations financially responsible. That they don’t overspend, that they don’t go into extreme areas of debt.<br /><br />Yet all those measures haven’t helped in this situation because clubs and organisations have probably spent more than they should in areas they shouldn’t.<br /><br />Sport in general in our country for too long has allowed itself to be controlled by this overriding thinking that certain measures will work across the board.<br /><br />What I think sports will start doing, and I hope they start doing, is treating their own sports differently in certain areas. Some sports have an international aspect to them, some don’t, and yet when I look at them, they all seem to be run the same way</p>
