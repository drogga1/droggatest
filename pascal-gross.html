  <p><b>[Pascal Gross admits talk of a possible switch to Liverpool has been shrugged off as little more than a joke by those at Brighton]</b> I don’t read the newspapers but then maybe some friends or here <b>[at the club]</b> someone sees it and makes a joke. I have got nothing to say about it. I am really enjoying and I’m really happy to play in the Premier League with Brighton. I hope we can continue as we have done. At the moment that is everything I care about. All the other stuff, that’s not my business.<br /><br />Every game I feel better. The last game against Chelsea I felt everything was good physically. I feel back to 100 per cent. I am looking forward to this period. I’m in good shape</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Maguire has seen his tremendous skill set hailed by Premier League rival Pascal Gross]</b> In one of my first games here we met Leicester City with Harry Maguire. He was the toughest opponent I’ve ever had. On the one hand he has tremendous power, but on the other hand he is fast and extremely strong on the ball. It did not surprise me that he played such a great World Cup<br /><br />Liverpool’s pace is uncomfortable, but City’s dominance is even more unpleasant. It makes you extremely tired when the opponent has 80 per cent of the ball. And when you finally conquer them, they then go again. Guardiola has perfected his playing style with City</p>

  <p><b>[Pascal Gross is flattered to be sparking talk of interest from Liverpool]</b> Of course it is an honour when such rumours arise, but I have not heard anything concrete<br /><br />Of course, the national team is a dream of mine, but I have never had contact with national coach Joachim Low<br /><br />It is certain that I will come back to Germany at some point. Maybe I’ll end my career in Neckarau. That’s my club, after all<br /><br /><b>[He is convinced that joining Brighton was the best choice for him]</b> The change was the right move. I am playing at the highest level in the world and it is a great experience for me. In a foreign country, you learn to be more independent. I have to organise things that I did not even think about before. In addition, I improve my English, which can only help me in life.</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton vs Manchester City]</b> I am a professional and I want to win every game. Klopp deserves the title because Liverpool have played on the highest level. We will try everything to take a point against Manchester City</p>
