  <p><b>[AFC postpones Asian Cup qualifier between North Korea and Malaysia]</b> FAM welcomes the positive decision made by AFC as that is the best decision in view of the safety of the players and officials had the match went on as scheduled on the 28 March. This is because the diplomatic tension between North Korea and Malaysia still have not subsided. Regarding the new date and venue, FAM will follow whatever decision made by AFC and will give our support to the matter.</p>

  <p><b>[Video assistant referees to be introduced in Malaysia Super League in 2018]</b> In a session held this afternoon, the president <b>[Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim]</b> has agreed to the use of professional referees and VAR, and we will begin the pilot project in the semifinals and the final match of the Malaysia Cup this season. The use of professionals referee will also begin next year. But the preparations will begin from now on, and the FAM Referees Committee has already identified 15 to 20 elite referees who will be offered posts as professional referees. The president has agreed to the amount of monthly salaries to be paid to these professional referees.</p>

  <p><b>[FAM to let affiliates, fans to decide for Malaysia U23 team for SEA Games and AFC Qualifiers]</b> Due to the fact that these fixtures are not listed on FIFA’s Calendar, the teams are not obligated to release their players. However, if all teams choose not to release the selected called-up players, do not start finger pointing when the U23 national team fails to achieve positive result. If we want a positive result, then every team should released the selected players in order to give the U23 national team the best chance to perform. Hence, the ball is in your court</p>

  <p><b>[Malaysian FA has announced its intention of moving Malaysia’s Asian Cup qualification home matches to the Tan Sri Dato Haji Hassan Yunos Stadium in Johor Bahru]</b> Other than good facilities, we have our own strategies why we use Larkin Stadium, but I can’t reveal why.</p>

  <p><b>[The Malaysian FA has issued a statement saying that the association has listed a number of candidates for the post of Malaysia head coach]</b> For the time being there’s a candidate from Portugal, and another will meet with the President <b>[FAM president Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim]</b> within the next few days. And His Royal Highness <b>[Tunku Ismail]</b> doesn’t want to say too much to the media because the matter cannot be disclosed yet. We can only share with the media once it’s confirmed.<br /><br />So, you need to realise that picking the coach is not as easy as buying books, which you can do easily. If the coach is not good and one day we want to get rid of him, we will need to fork out more money. Due to that, we need to be thorough in picking a coach who can take on the responsibility of managing Harimau Malaya for the long term<br /><br />Do take note that our offer isn’t huge because the FAM is broke. However, many didn’t know that the President has used his own money to increase the budget to appoint and get a better coach</p>

  <p><b>[FAM says Paulo Bento isn’t the new national team coach]</b> would like to inform all regarding the speculation on social media of former Olympiakos coach Paulo Jorge Gomes Bento being the new national head coach isn’t true at all. Once the matter is approved by HRH Major General Tunku Ismail Ibni Sultan Ibrahim, Crown Prince of Johor and President of the Football Association of Malaysia, I will announce the real national head coach from Portugal in the next 3 or 4 days to all Malaysian football fans after both sides complete all documentation and contractual processes.</p>

  <p><b>[FAM pleads time for Nelo Vingada to make the team his own]</b> First of all, the selection of the players was not decided by the highest management at FAM. In fact, it was a list suggested by assistant coach Tan Cheng Hoe, because Nelo Vingada only reached Malaysia on 23 May and did not have a chance to assess the players in action. Based on the list of 26, only nine players are over 30 whereas the 17 others are under the age of 30.<br /><br />However, everyone need to know that Vingada is a coach who likes to give chances to younger players. He has told us that he will scout for players from the 2017 SEA Games Project squad to be roped into the senior side in the future. It’s just that for the first match against Lebanon on 13 June, Vingada doesn’t have sufficient time and it is thought that using the existing squad is the best solution.<br /><br />After the Raya celebrations when the leagues resumes and Malaysia Cup starts, Vingada will be able to assess all players. For sure, the squad for the next games in September, October and November will see a combination of young and senior players<br /><br />Secondly, regarding the issue of Safiq Rahim, Aidil Zafuan, S. Kunanlan and Amirulhadi Zainal who had previously chose to retire from international football - it is their right to want to play again for the national team.<br /><br />Maybe the four of them feel more confident towards the leadership of FAM who is now led by HRH Tunuki Ismail Sultan Ibrahim as the main factor why they want to be available again. Their selection were also based on suggestion from Tan and their performance will be monitored, as they are not guaranteed a spot in the team</p>

  <p><b>[FAM’s Hamidin Amin has pleaded for president Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim and head coach Nelo Vingada to be given more time to shape Harimau Malaya]</b> It is unfair to judge Tunku Ismail who is only 83 days into his FAM presidency, and Vingada who has only taken over as Malaysia head coach for three weeks, by the first defeat and match under his <b>[Tunku Ismail’s]</b> governance.<br /><br />If we recall, Tunku Ismail has brought about many changes since his first day, such as reorganising the association so as to function more effectively, hiring an experienced and high-profile foreign coach, Vingada to improve the national team, holding executive meetings in each state beginning with Sabah in order to bring FAM closer to its affiliates, organising dialogues with fans to hear their grouses, donating the use of state-of-the-art facilities for Harimau Malaya’s training, as well as a new team coach, and many more will come<br /><br />Give Tunku Ismail and Vingada time to develop Harimau Malaya into a more formidable side, and I believe we will reap the rewards in the next one or two years</p>

  <p><b>[General-Secretary of Football Association of Malaysia, Datuk Hamidin Amin is hoping that Malaysia can reach the final]</b> If we look at the draw, Singapore and Myanmar have good U22 teams but with the games played here, all of us here want to see Malaysia enter the final for the fans. There’s no specific target set for the team, we want them to as well as they can but from a personal standpoint, we have to reach the final.</p>

  <p><b>[Datuk Hamidin Amin was also part of the welcoming back party]</b> First of all I would like congratulate Datuk Ong Kim Swee, the staff and the players who have made the country proud by qualifying for the final round. Of course their sacrifice would be rewarded. Players and officials will get RM6,000 each and they will receive some more good news from our President Tunku Ismail. His Royal Highness also requested for to meet with the players as soon as possible.<br /><br /><b>[Hamidin was adamant that the results speak for Ong]</b> <b>[We want]</b> To continue with this and with the blessing of the President. Datuk Ong’s contract finish end of this year but Tunku President will consider with Exco based on performance of Datuk Ong</p>
