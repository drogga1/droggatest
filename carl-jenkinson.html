  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> have signed <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> right-back Carl Jenkinson on a season-long loan]</b> I’m clearly seen as a big part of things here and hopefully I can prove my worth here because it is an important year for me. It’s one of them where I wanted to do the right professional thing and consider all the options, but in the back of my mind it was always <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> and I’m just so glad it’s all worked out how I wanted it to in the end. It will be brilliant to play here. I’ve got a lot of friends who are <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> fans and I know how good the supporters are here. I’ve played here a couple of times so I know exactly what it is all about, so it’s going to be fantastic to be a part of that, to be honest. You get a great atmosphere here and the fans are great, so I just can’t wait to get a <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> shirt on and get on the pitch and play. This is an exciting time for me, it really is</p>

  <p><b>[Jenkinson told reporters when asked if Emery’s side are looking higher than finishing fourth]</b> I think it’s a very easy thing to say but we’re looking at one game at a time. That’s the way we’ve got to look at things and it’s the way the manager looks at things. We just keep building. In the last few games in particular, we’ve played some really good stuff. We’re looking like a very strong side, which we are. We’ve got a lot of really talented players and we want to show that we can do well at the minute. Of course, we’ve got a tough game coming up but we’re going into it with a lot of momentum and a lot of confidence<br /><br /><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have emerged victorious in five of their last six <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> outings, finding form at a crucial stage of the season]</b> It’s hugely important. Towards the end of the season is a very critical time because the competitions are coming to an end and it’s about being consistent to get the results. I think we’re doing that really well at the minute but we’ve got some big games coming up. It’s a very important time for us but as players, we all know that. Our focus is on doing a good job and doing what we need to do</p>
