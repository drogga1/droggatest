<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Alessando Birindelli believes Juventus can win this season’s Champions League]</b> I wasn’t very surprised by what happened in Turin. The Bianconeri are very motivated and in the last few seasons, they have grown enormously in this competition. Barca, when they are lacking a little from a mental point of view, can endure very negative evenings. We must not forget, however, that when they decide to play, they are still the best in the world. But I think Juve are now a more mature team, also from a tactical perspective, with their suffocating pressing and exceptional technical qualities. Certainly, if you’re not good across the board, you couldn’t produce a performance like that against Barca at Juventus Stadium. It’s a squad that can go all the way and we should not even over-estimate the importance of having great overall balance formed by an iron defence, a powerful midfield and a lethal attack.<br /><br />Honestly, only after the passing of so much time have I realised the significance of these moments. Still today, for example, people stop me and thank me for that cross and for the goal that I scored against Deportivo La Coruna. In short, unforgettable moments. It had been a tough game. The Blaugrana had us on the ropes by throwing their full repertoire of skills at us: maximum-speed passing, draining possession and constant movement between the lines. We did well on the counter-attack, though, even if we suffered a lot physically because Barca have always been a team that make you run a lot and if you get caught short anywhere, you risk being opened up with great ease.<br /><br />Mauro <b>[Camoranesi]</b> had not been having a great game and, during the break, <b>[coach Marcello]</b> Lippi decided to put me in right away. I managed to get into the mentality of the match and, undoubtedly, playing that pass for Marcelo was a source of great satisfaction. Looking back, I consider myself fortunate. I knew how to manage my career well. I knew my limits and I didn’t push myself beyond them. It’s clear that one must never lack ambition but, personally, with Juventus I walked away with a lot of pride. I hope that the fans enjoyed those times too.</p>
