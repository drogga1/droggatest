  <p><b>[Adam Nawalka hailed the professionalism of <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a> with the <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> striker set to spearhead Poland’s World Cup challenge]</b> I believe the scale of his talent is immense but it’s supported by a lot of work and a professional attitude. He is one of the best players in the world and Robert sets an example to other players on how to run a career. I’ve said it many times, <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> is a very important player, he’s the captain, he’s the star but we always take an approach that’s it’s the team that counts. Every player contributes to what the team is capable of. Robert is an excellent captain and an excellent player<br /><br />From the beginning of my work, we’ve been trying to prepare the team so that in the case of injuries, or suspensions, we have other solutions and this is also the case of Kamil. He is suffering from a serious injury and we don’t know if Kamil is going to play in the first match. He’s going to participate in the training session tonight and we’ll see how he feels. Kamil is a very tough guy, he has done everything he can to recuperate from his injury, he trains a dozen hours or so a day but whether Kamil is going to play tomorrow is unknown. We have prepared other solutions. That’s the way football is and we have been working very hard on this</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a> is an example to young players everywhere, according to his coach Adam Nawalka, but there is more to this Poland side than the <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> star’s goals]</b> The scale and size of Robert’s talent is immense and it is supported by a lot of hard work. He is an excellent captain and one of the best players in the world but our team presents itself very well, too. I think he is an example to other players on how to run career. An athlete’s time is not very long and I hope all those other very good players out there can develop in the same way as Robert.</p>

  <p><b>[Poland manager Adam Nawalka expressed happiness at his side’s victory over Japan, but insisted he did not want to ‘sugarcoat’ the result]</b> It was a hard match, we had to mobilize all our strength to win over Japan. We showed that we do not give up, fight till the end and can bring joy to our fans. I do not want to sugarcoat this win, I don’t think that. We analyzed the first two matches. The way we look at it is we received a lot of experience in Russia. I hope this will help us in the future</p>

  <p><b>[At a media conference with Nawalka on Tuesday, Polish Football Association president <a href="zbigniew-boniek.html">Zbigniew Boniek</a> confirmed the 60-year-old’s departure as they turn their attentions to Euro 2020]</b> I am very sorry but I am optimistic about the future of Polish football. We have fulfilled the plans, and Polish football has made great progress during my term. Of course, I feel responsible that at the championships we have not met expectations and ambitions, our own and fans. I take full responsibility, because it’s always the role of a trainer and I do not run away from it. With dignity I accept a wave of criticism: sometimes malicious, sometimes substantive. We analysed the championship in terms of what was good, but above all bad, because we did not do what we assumed. I take a critical approach to what has happened and many applications will be useful for a new trainer. And I am ready to help him at any time, because the experience of the last four years is invaluable. Every day with the national team was a fantastic experience. It was an honour to represent Poland</p>

He’s always developing and making progress and I don’t believe there’s anyone who can stop him</p>
