They were very man oriented and it was tough to break the lines, but we just said you have to keep moving and finding the right spaces and in the end we did a good job of that in the second half. Obviously when you continue to do that the whole game, and you press them every time you lose the ball, it’s tough for them and they got tired. You could see that, and we did that really well tonight.</p>

I just wish we could have put away a few more of those chances in the beginning, myself as well, but in the end we got the win.<br /><br /><b>[The 1-0 victory was the second straight 1-0 result after Wednesday’s 1-0 win against Panama]</b> Not every game is going to go perfectly. Curacao did a really good job when they had the ball. They were very calm with the ball. They moved it really well and they built out of the back well. They made us defend a lot, and it was tough, but like I said, in the end we need to finish more chances towards the beginning of the game to make it easier on ourselves, but now we’re on to the next one<br /><br /><b>[The Americans move on to Wednesday’s Gold Cup semifinal against Jamaica, a rematch of the 2017 Gold Cup final won by the USMNT]</b> We know what we need to work on. Today wasn’t exactly our day, it didn’t flow as it did in the last few games offensively, but we’re going to find that rhythm. Today, if we score a few more goals early in that game it’s a completely different game. It opens up and we’re able to be much more calm. They did a good job defending us, they were calm on the ball and they were able to keep the ball for stretches, it was not easy for us, but in the end we won the game</p>

We wanted to come out with a win, but I’m definitely happy. They were very good opponents. As you saw, they tested us for 90 minutes and scored a good goal in the end. It was a tough one, but that’s why we’re training and getting ready for the season. We want to try and progress in every game and get more and more match fit, and I think that helped us out today. It’s been tough getting into things, but I’m feeling really good. It’s great to work with the coach and all these guys - it has tested me and I’m having a great time so far. I grew up watching him (Lampard), so to have him here giving me pointers and helping the team - it’s awesome to have him around. It’s nice to have a guy that we can really relate to</p>

New Chelsea manager Frank Lampard is facing a dilemma over the number of non-homegrown players in his squad as the new season closes in at Stamford Bridge. UEFA rules state clubs in the Champions League may register no more than 17 foreign players in their squads for the competition, with a further eight spots available for homegrown players. The arrival of January signing Christian Pulisic and the decision to retain Mateo Kovacic on a permanent deal following his loan spell has left Lampard with a surplus of foreign players</p>

Hopefully I have done that a bit and earned their respect. It’s what I’m out there to do. I’m in an attacking position. I want to score goals, I want to help with assists and do a lot of good things.

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic insists he is not concerned about his £58 million price tag]</b> This number doesn’t mean anything to me. I go out and try to give my best every time I’m on the pitch. I’m not sure what the price tag means to you, but I just have to keep trying to perform at my best for myself and for the team. You can’t completely ignore it (comments on social media). I don’t live under a rock. I hear things, I see things, but I do my best to block it out. I’m just working hard for myself. The outside opinions don’t matter as much to me as to what’s in the team and myself and the people who care about me.<br /><br />So, I’m just going to keep working and do my best and not worry about it. Competition in the team can only make me better and I think that’s what makes teams, it’s guys who are maybe not the second or third man, but they are pushing each other in training every single day. That’s what a good team is all about. <b>[Lampard]</b> likes players who work very hard and show a lot in training and I just have to continue to do that, do my best in training and try to earn my position.

I want to be starting every game. I’m working hard in training. I want to be there. I hope everyone can see that, so with moments like this I hope I can make a case for myself. I’m not just going to throw a fit and give up ever, so if I’m on the bench it doesn’t mean the gaffer doesn’t think I’m a part of the team, I’ve just got to keep pushing and earn my spot. I did the best I could with the minutes I got. I tried to help the team as best I could. I guess I’m happy but I’m going to keep working harder, and I’m never going to stop trying to get more minutes. Of course, you want to play, be on the field and be in the team as much as you can, and it hurts not to be there, but I’m happy I got my opportunity<br /><br />Yeah, definitely. When I go there, I definitely want to go in and get minutes and just gain more international experience. It can only help me here</p>

I think there are obstacles, I think not a lot of American players have really proved themselves in Europe and I think when you’re an American player and you’re trying to prove yourself amongst all these European guys or international guys that are top players who have played in these big competitions, not a whole lot of Americans have been there, it can be tough<br /><br /><b>[Plenty are backing him to come good, though, and the talented playmaker is grateful for the chances in senior football that he has been given across his career to date]</b> If you can play, you can play and that’s why <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> was amazing for me, the coach always trusted me.

I was going to German school over there and I will never forget that one day I was in class and I looked at my phone and it was a text from my youth coach saying you are training with the first team tonight. The rest of the day I wasn’t even paying attention. I couldn’t think of anything else. I’m getting ready, going to training and it’s just unreal I was 16 or 17 and I’m going in the warm-up and there’s huge names at the time. There’s <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>, <a href="marco-reus.html">Marco Reus</a>, <a href="mats-hummels.html">Matts Hummels</a>, Mkhitaryan. All these guys and they were just in the Champions League final the year before. It’s like I’m going in and I’m just this 16-year-old kid. I was thinking just do my best. I was just so excited and I’m just thankful to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> that he gave me that opportunity. I’ll take that with me forever and I’m really grateful</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic has revealed that nobody noticed him on his first day at Chelsea]</b> It was all pretty crazy what happened. I had to fly straight from my summer break right after the Gold Cup. I had one week off and I didn’t really get a summer. The team had already started pre-season in Japan so I flew straight there and I had to literally fly by myself and then meet the team who had flown from London. I had to go straight to the hotel and the next thing on the schedule was to go straight to training. I was tired, nervous and didn’t know what to think but, ‘I’m at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and this is insane’. I got on the bus, they had just arrived as well. Everyone is half asleep, I go and sit on the bus and nobody even noticed me. Nobody said anything. There were maybe one or two guys who said ‘hey, hello’ and I was like, ‘what’s going on here?’ Those first couple of days of training I was nervous. You know how it’s like when you move to a new team. They’re nice guys off the field but to earn that respect you have to show on the field you have that ability, that’s just how it is. I had to go in on day three when I had a really good training, scored some goals, had some nice plays and assists and then I felt the guys coming and talking to me and getting their respect. It’s interesting how it works but they’ve been great guys and I’ve enjoyed it</p>

I think they give younger players opportunities and it’s a great club to go and develop. He (Sancho) was given an opportunity, just like I was, at a very high level, and they show you right away that they trust you and they’re going to give an equal opportunity to all the players. He’s done an amazing job since he came in and has obviously shown what abilities he has.</p>

  <p><b>[Pulisic reveals the two key areas he’s working to improve at Chelsea]</b> I want to learn to be even more clinical in front of goal to continue to boost my numbers, get more goals and assists. I want to be stronger on the ball, being able to hold off players and those are two areas that I’m definitely working on<br /><br />I think it’s great to have friendly competition. They’re all great guys and it’s great to be learning from them and also getting to play with Callum (Hudson-Odoi). It’s a strong area of our team</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic admits the opportunity to link up with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in 2019 was too good to turn down]</b> I always wanted to play in Europe. Going to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> was definitely a perfect first step for me. It was awesome, and I learned so much. I grew up there - I went over there when I was 15. Now, to be here and come to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> when I was 20, I think it all worked out very well so I’m really happy with the path. I was confident and felt like I had a good couple of years in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, and obviously with the opportunity to come to a club like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> - it was just something I couldn’t turn down. I just felt like the timing was perfect and I’m really happy that I made that choice.<br /><br />The intensity, especially the schedule when you get to that winter period where you are playing games all the time. Every couple of days it’s about recovery it’s about tough games where you’re fighting for everything. It’s something I wasn’t 100% used to.<br /><br />I do really like playing on the left wing and also in that 10 spot centrally behind the forward. I’d say those are my two favourite positions</p>

  <p><b>[Pulisic didn’t take injury seriously but USMNT star is ‘100 per cent fit’ and ready for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> return]</b> I didn’t take it as seriously as I think I should have. It was one of those you felt you could do a lot of things but you try to push it that one extra step and realise it’s not ready yet. It was very tough and frustrating going through times like that. I underestimated it and tried to get back as soon as I could because I just wanted to play so bad. If anything, I’ve given myself a little more time to rest now and make sure that I’m 100 per cent fit. I’d say I’m fully recovered and ready to go as soon as we get back<br /><br />It was my first start in a little while so I just had this motivation to go out and prove a lot of people wrong. I felt I’d done okay up to that point but I hadn’t really shown everything that I could do so going into that game, I did have a chip on my shoulder. Once that first goal came, my confidence shot through the roof and it was just my day after that, everything kept falling for me. It was incredible. I’ll never forget coming home after that and just sitting down and looking back on what had just happened. I was so proud being able to talk to my family back home and people that had been watching. It wasn’t just the hat-trick but scoring, helping the team win and having a great game - there’s no better feeling</p>

I don’t think I hit it perfectly with my left, but i got enough on it to steer it on target<br /><br />Obviously it’s very different playing with no fans, but I think the team brought good energy and we finished really strongly. I’ve been out for a while, it felt really nice to be back out here after the injury, all the guys have been off but we’ve been trying to stay fit as best we can</p>

It’s a bit different without the fans but we’re really excited to be back out there. There are a lot of games to play. We want to go as far as we can in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and we want to continue finishing strong so we can be secure in a Champions League spot. We have a lot to play for<br /><br /><b>[Pulisic opened the scoring for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in their heavyweight tussle with Manchester City]</b> We looked at this game against a big opponent and we wanted to win it. We were at home, obviously in slightly different circumstances, but we’re happy that we came out and got a really good result. We have to capitalise on opportunities. I had another one in the second half as well <b>[which was cleared off the line by Kyle Walker]</b> but I’m just happy to help the team out by scoring. We needed it and we’re just happy to get the three points. We went into the game with a really confident mindset to go out and win. Obviously we want to finish the season strongly but we feel we’re capable of a lot more as well</p>

  <p><b>[Reinvigorated Pulisic coming out of his shell to fire <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to top-four finish]</b> I’ve got on TikTok to help pass the day. I’ve always liked dancing and doing fun things, other things aside from the game. I know some people might not like this sort of stuff but I really don’t care because I’m going to carry on doing it anyway!. I think it gives people a chance to see me a little better. No one really knows who I am, they just see me as a footballer, so hopefully, it gives them a little insight into my character</p>
