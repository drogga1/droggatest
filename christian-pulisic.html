I’m excited to work with a coach that is an MLS-caliber coach, so I’m very fortunate that he’s here in Rochester and this opportunity came along for me to work with him.<br /><br />I asked if I could be involved with the youth academy because I’ve been coaching my whole life</p>

Borussia Dortmund have given me everything. If I work very hard here, I will play, and I love this club. I’m happy in the city, I’m just really content with everything here at the moment.<br /><br /><b>[on becoming a regular for Thomas Tuchel’s side]</b> If you’d asked me three years ago when I started with the youth team, I did not think I’d be in this position today. Scoring my first goal was incredible - you never forget your first goal. I celebrated by doing a dab because I didn’t know what to do! My family were proud of me.

  <p><b>[The 18-year-old Christian Pulisic is focused on trying to carry over his strong club form into the upcoming World Cup qualifiers]</b> Of course, we realize that we need three points <b>[on Friday]</b>. We obviously didn’t have a great start so we need to bounce back here and we’re going to need a big performance. We played against two good teams, but just didn’t come out with the results we wanted to. It just didn’t flow, it didn’t feel right in the moment. Looking back on it there, yeah, there’s a lot of things we could have improved on, and we’re going to try and bring that tomorrow<br /><br /><b>[When asked of the comparison with Landon Donovan]</b> He was an idol of mind, so it’s obviously an honor, but I’m my own player as well so I’m just trying to do it for me, and that’s it<br /><br />Every day when I go out to training I’m trying to get better and better and over four months time, however long it’s been, being with Dortmund and playing more big games there it’s just gaining experience and I feel even stronger than I was then<br /><br />I just like to be on the field really, anywhere on the field, but I feel comfortable in that <b>[central midfield]</b> position. I’ve played there a lot, so I’m ready. I’m not going to put pressure on myself like that. I’m just going to go out like any other game, be confident, and play like I play. We’ll see where it goes</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic nicknamed ‘Figo’ due to love for Real Madrid, reveals U.S. star’s father]</b> I called him Figo from a young age, as we watched Real Madrid a lot during those years. He liked the way Figo played, so I bought him a jersey with Figo’s name on it.<br /><br /><b>[Mark Pulisic admits it wasn’t an easy decision to move across the Atlantic Ocean, but it was a necessary step for Christian to reach his true potential]</b> My wife and I were concerned of course, but me coming with him very much helped all of us. This made our decision much easier<br /><br />Our first visit made Christian feel very welcome at Dortmund. Lars <b>[Ricken]</b> and Eddie <b>[Boekamp]</b> were very influential, but most important was the former youth coach Hannes Wolf. He helped Christian get accustomed to his new life, as a coach and friend, both on and off the field<br /><br />Jurgen Klopp was great for my son, giving him the opportunity to train with the first team at 17. That experience helped his development and confidence. Christian now is fully integrated with the first team, he has good friends on the team, and is well respected and enjoying his experience<br /><br />He just signed an extension, so that shows he believes this is the right fit. Dortmund is the perfect club. He loves Borussia Dortmund. Right now, <b>[Dortmund coach]</b> Thomas Tuchel is a good fit for Christian, that is why he wants to stay here<br /><br />Let’s remember, he’s still growing and developing physically as he just turned 18, so it is nice to see him get through this time on an upward curve. Credit this development to Dortmund … they took the proper steps to ensure Christian was ready for each step towards the first team</p>

But I think young players have seen me, and others, go over to Europe and play in some of the best leagues - and MLS is improving so much too. There’s so much potential and I think it’s changing: we’ve had some bigger athletes in the past but I don’t think that defines us anymore. We’re going to keep moving forward, developing young players and we’re going to have a really good shot in the next few years</p>

  <p><b>[From boy wonder to maturing professional, Christian Pulisic ready to take on U.S. stardom]</b> Having my father there]&lt;/b&gt; was everything. Obviously I can talk to my family all the time through technology, but just having him there to comfort me and just have a face to talk to at night after a tough day and just tell him what I was feeling, and get some good advice from the guy who helped me get to that position - it meant everything.<br /><br />I definitely had my good and bad days. It was very tough in the beginning, going to school there, then going training at night and having to compete in the U-17 team for my position. I came home at night and luckily my dad was there to talk to. There were definitely some tough times, but I was just always thinking about the greater goal, and what I really wanted down the road. With that in mind I was able to fight through<br /><br />The physical side of my game, and just learning the European environment and the style every day in training and competing and being strong enough and quick enough to be able to hang at that level. That was the biggest part<br /><br /><b>[Pulisic said while signing his own special-edition autographed set of Panini America cards]</b> It’s pretty exciting knowing that I used to collect cards and now people might actually collect my card and see my face on there. It’s pretty cool<br /><br />Just knowing that people are going to the game or something with your jersey on and supporting you is really exciting and was a dream of mine. Every time I see it at Dortmund, at games, it’s still exciting and gets you really excited to play<br /><br />I’ve already played against some of my biggest idols. Lionel Messi, getting to meet him, you’re a little star-struck in the beginning of course. But when you step out on the field you’ve got to play for yourself. It’s pretty exciting to see those guys<br /><br /><b>[Pulisic said of Thomas Tuchel]</b> He always trusted me. He always gave me a chance, and just how he started to develop me as a player and what he did to start my career meant everything<br /><br /><b>[On one of several supremely talented prospects in the Dortmund setup]</b> It was great having other young players there in the same spot as me, just learning and trying to start up our careers. And having those guys around to compete with in training every day, and just learn from each other, was very helpful</p>

But I’m just trying to stay as level-grounded as I can, finding a balance.<br /><br />Of course I hear about all this stuff people talk about. This kid, there’s hype, whatever. I just try to keep it out of my mind as much as I can because that doesn’t really matter to me. I put enough pressure on myself. I don’t need all this outside tension or whatever. I just try to do the best I can for myself and the people around me<br /><br /><b>[Pulisic said of his place at Dortmund]</b> I don’t think there’s too much different. Maybe we lost a player or two, but I kind of have the same role on the team. Whenever I’m on the field, similar like I do with the national team, <b>[my focus]</b> is being effective, being dangerous. Helping my team to create and score goals.

We had to take some other chances but things didn’t go our way with decisions and other things. I have to see them again but my goal in the first half, I guess Auba was off but he didn’t touch it. I don’t know if he was offside. The second one I didn’t think was offside. Obviously refs make mistakes and the game just changed after that<br /><br />I always tried to bring confidence to the game.

And I think - I hope - that we’re going to be able to build something, here, with U.S. Soccer, where it’s not just going to be about one lost match, or one lost cycle, or one lost team. It’s going to be about an entire country, rallying around an entire sport, in a way that lasts. So let’s plan on it, then - 2022. Get your basements ready, and mark it down. We’ll be there</p>

  <p><b>[Pulisic hits the mark with criticism of MLS not playing young players]</b> It really does frustrate me, when I watch MLS, and I see our best U-17 players - who, again, are so talented and so capable - being rostered … but then not being put on the field much to actually play. I watch that, and I just think about how I was given a chance … a real chance … and it changed my life. Why then are we seemingly hesitant to allow these other talents to blossom?</p>

I was obviously playing with the youth teams at Dortmund, but he was the one who gave me my first professional training session, just to give me a taste of it.

It is normal, it took me a while as well <b>[to get starts]</b>. My first impressions of him are he is a young guy with a lot of talent. He is being a bigger part of the team now and doing a great job with that. It’s great to see guys like that coming over <b>[from England]</b> to Germany and wanting to play professional soccer at the highest level. That is why I did it, it was always my dream, it’s cool to see others following that path and to be there for those guys whenever they need advice too. Of course, we talked about it and possibly playing against each other is going to be really cool. Obviously competing with him every day in training and being good friends off the field and now getting the chance to play at international level is going to be a fun experience. The sky is the limit for a guy like him. A young player coming through, and you can see how much talent and how much skill he has.

It is it not like I’m shutting down and saying: ‘I can’t read that, I can’t read this’. It is about learning to hear that and stuff like that and not letting it affect you. Knowing what your job is and who you should be listening to and how you can get better. I really don’t put that pressure on myself. Obviously a lot of Americans do. All I can do is give my best, be a part of this team, be there for the young guys. I mean I’m young too, but just be there for them and help this team to grow and help these guys out. I am focused on what I need to do most of the year, that means being focused on Dortmund so when I come to camp I do the same things, focus myself here so it is not difficult for me to not really worry about the outside noise. We’re really excited moving forward, we can’t look back at what has happened over the past year, and now we can just look forward and grow with these young faces, continue to gain experience, and matches are the best way to do it, so we’re excited. We had a tough year and I think what we have done now with the young players is good. We have this really good schedule coming now and we are playing with really good young players, with good competition coming up which is the best thing for our guys. To continue to learn we need to get these experiences and that’s important. I am really excited for the match. I looked up to a guy like Rooney a lot, actually. It is clear to see his passion for the game, what he did in his whole career in Europe and now what he’s even doing for the sport in MLS. He’s a very passionate guy and I’m happy for him that he can have a nice send-off game. It’s even better that it’s against us. It’s going to be a lot of fun<br /><br />I was very young but I just remember going to school every day in England which I didn’t enjoy. Every day as soon as the bell would ring we would go out and be on this little, it looked like a basketball court, but it was a soccer court with goals and a hard floor. I was there for hours and my parents had to drive me home. That was my best memory. I was nervous about coming to England at first with the soccer and everything, but yeah, when I left at first I missed it a lot. I missed everything, just that culture. Everyone liked to play soccer, everyone was there. And then I would come back to the US and no one really wanted to play soccer. I think my passion definitely grew a lot during that year in England but it is not where it all started for me. I had played before that. My dad and mum both played and I loved it before that but it definitely grew that passion inside of me<br /><br /><b>[He thinks that his side are more than ready to break Bayern’s six-year run of league title wins]</b> It is going to take consistency and I think that’s why we have been so successful this year. Last year, we had a great start but we couldn’t keep that up. Now, going forward, we feel really good. We beat Bayern. We take it one game at a time and we will do as well as we can.

I had no idea what lay ahead but I soon discovered that as a young Schwarzgelben, I would be in the best possible hands.<br /><br />I would not be where I am today without the club and their believe in giving young players a chance. It’s been an honor and a dream to pull on the black-and-yellow in front of the Sudtribune! Many, many memorable moments stand out - to have experienced all of them before my 20th birthday still feels, at times, like a dream. I would like to thank all those coaches who I have played under and who gave me these opportunities. And to my amazing teammates throughout the years: You took me in as a young boy, shared your experience with me, helped me to develop and grown into a professional footballer. For this I sincerely thank you.<br /><br />To our unbelievable fans: It’s been a privilege to stand with you on the Sudtribune and to experience how you support your heroes. I feel honored to have been able to make the trip from being a supporter, to being supported. You have taken me in as one of your own. Thank you. I would also like to thank Mr. Watzke and Mr Zorc. It was very important to me that I handled my situation in as fair and professional manner as possible towards the club. So I thank them for finding a solution that was a win-win for everyone.<br /><br />In summer of 2019, I move on to Chelsea and to and to a new competition, the English Premier League. It’s a privilege to have signed for such a legendary club and I look forward to working hard towards being a contributor to their team of world class players. Looking forward to working with Maurizio Sarri and his technical team. But for the next six months, it’s all BVB! Please do not doubt my passion, determination and my 100% commitment to the team right until the last ball is kicked this season.

Even though Pierre-Emerick left Dortmund for Arsenal, we remained in contact. I have spoken with him on and off ever since he moved here. I asked him how it was in London and stuff. He loves it here. He is a big city kind of guy, you can see that and he has told me about a few places to go see. It was a very good friendship when we played for Dortmund together for a few years. He was there when I first broke into the first team and we had a nice link up on the field. He taught me a lot. That was one of the coolest things about him. He’s a very humble guy and perhaps people don’t know that about him. He was a lot older than me but took me under his wing. Not all older players are as welcoming or as accepting when a young guy comes in. But he was always very kind and wanted to be there if I had anything to ask. He went out of his way to help me. I will always be thankful for that.<br /><br />I think I can be very effective on either of the wings. I had the chance to play on both at Dortmund but I have experience of playing as a no.10 with the national team as well. Really, any of the attacking positions I can be comfortable in. I was most comfortable on the wings at Dortmund. I like this system <b>[that Chelsea play]</b>. It is a very free-flowing, attacking system that should suit my style well.<br /><br />I won’t be intimidated. At Dortmund we had experience of competing with Bayern Munich the whole time. Obviously Bayern have a very strong team, but we were so close to winning the championship this year. At Chelsea, we are going to go into the next season with confidence, we want to go in right away from the start and compete to the best of our ability. That’s what we are going to try to do</p>

I think we put a lot of hard work in and throughout the game, and at half time, we just said to keep going, keep fighting because we’re doing well and the subs are going to come in for tired guys and really make a difference. Of course, I was given another opportunity to go in and the manager told me, ‘go in, make an impact, make a difference’ and I’m happy I was able to help a little bit with that.<br /><br />I think we have a great mix of youth and experienced players, and I think that’s the reason why we’ve been getting great results lately. I think that’s coming together, we have a great balance. Team spirit definitely doesn’t need to be questioned. It’s there and we’re going to keep going. Being the only American, it’s nice; I can go with some of the French guys, the Brazilians. It’s good, it’s a good mix and I’ve been really close with everyone so it’s great just getting to know all of the guys. Now we’ve got six in a row, we want to keep going, keep fighting and keep it up and get the best results we can. He (Lampard) says that all of the time, we’re a team, we need every single player on the roster, he’s happy and I’m really happy with how it’s gone<br /><br /><b>[Of the Belgian striker]</b> <a href="michy-batshuayi.html">Batshuayi</a>’s easy to play with, we’ve played together for a while and we have a nice connection.

We had five wins in a row before this, now it’s six, another away win, big in the Champions League. We want to make it seven now and confidence helps you to keep it up and keep going. It was a really tough match for most of it. In the end, it opened up a little bit, but we worked really hard and we deserved to get a result<br /><br />I’m never gonna let that put me down by not playing, I’m going to keep fighting because this is where I want to be. I came here for a reason, I want to be here and I want to make a difference. Whenever I get that opportunity, I want to keep working hard. I go in to give absolutely everything and do the best I can with the opportunity I’m given. I’m happy with the short time I was given to make an assist, make a difference and I want to be on the field. I want to be on the field as much as I can, whatever role that maybe.

We scored a winner and it was taken back so it was tough. It shows just how much fight this team has, even being down 3-1 and then it went to 4-1, it’s crazy.

It was a pretty crazy game midweek and then coming here we really wanted a good result, we came out with a lot of energy and did some things well but we just didn’t have that finishing touch. It felt like a little something was missing. In the season, that is what happens, there are ups and downs.

But I came in, and it was realistic, and I wanted to continue to earn my position.<br /><br />The beginning, it wasn’t always easy, and I wasn’t always in the line-up, but I just kept working.

It’s my first season now, kind of halfway through, so I’m just kind of learning to take it day by day, game by game and just focusing on the next opponent and just getting ready and healthy for the next game because it’s always right around the corner.

It means so much to these people, just in the country in general, just how your team is doing. Not to say that’s the case in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> because that was some of the most passionate fans I’ve ever seen, but just the culture of the whole country, what this game means even around the holidays.

There are a couple of cases but nothing like the scale of other places. Hopefully, things can start to slow down anyway</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic admits he will be forever grateful to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> for giving him his big break]</b> The craziest thing is people don’t realise I started out in the youth teams over there. I was just working hard for that one opportunity I could get. I was going to German school over there and I will never forget that one day I was in class and I looked at my phone and it was a text from my youth coach saying you are training with the first team tonight. The rest of the day I wasn’t even paying attention. I couldn’t think of anything else. I’m getting ready, going to training and it’s just unreal I was 16 or 17 and I’m going in the warm-up and there’s huge names at the time. There’s <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>, <a href="marco-reus.html">Marco Reus</a>, <a href="mats-hummels.html">Matts Hummels</a>, Mkhitaryan. All these guys and they were just in the Champions League final the year before. It’s like I’m going in and I’m just this 16-year-old kid. I was thinking just do my best. I was just so excited and I’m just thankful to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> that he gave me that opportunity. I’ll take that with me forever and I’m really grateful</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic has revealed that nobody noticed him on his first day at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> It was all pretty crazy what happened. I had to fly straight from my summer break right after the Gold Cup. I had one week off and I didn’t really get a summer. The team had already started pre-season in Japan so I flew straight there and I had to literally fly by myself and then meet the team who had flown from London. I had to go straight to the hotel and the next thing on the schedule was to go straight to training. I was tired, nervous and didn’t know what to think but, ‘I’m at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and this is insane’. I got on the bus, they had just arrived as well. Everyone is half asleep, I go and sit on the bus and nobody even noticed me. Nobody said anything. There were maybe one or two guys who said ‘hey, hello’ and I was like, ‘what’s going on here?’ Those first couple of days of training I was nervous. You know how it’s like when you move to a new team. They’re nice guys off the field but to earn that respect you have to show on the field you have that ability, that’s just how it is. I had to go in on day three when I had a really good training, scored some goals, had some nice plays and assists and then I felt the guys coming and talking to me and getting their respect. It’s interesting how it works but they’ve been great guys and I’ve enjoyed it</p>

I think they give younger players opportunities and it’s a great club to go and develop. He (Sancho) was given an opportunity, just like I was, at a very high level, and they show you right away that they trust you and they’re going to give an equal opportunity to all the players. He’s done an amazing job since he came in and has obviously shown what abilities he has.</p>

  <p><b>[Pulisic reveals the two key areas he’s working to improve at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> I want to learn to be even more clinical in front of goal to continue to boost my numbers, get more goals and assists. I want to be stronger on the ball, being able to hold off players and those are two areas that I’m definitely working on<br /><br />I think it’s great to have friendly competition. They’re all great guys and it’s great to be learning from them and also getting to play with Callum (Hudson-Odoi). It’s a strong area of our team</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Pulisic admits the opportunity to link up with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in 2019 was too good to turn down]</b> I always wanted to play in Europe. Going to <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> was definitely a perfect first step for me. It was awesome, and I learned so much. I grew up there - I went over there when I was 15. Now, to be here and come to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> when I was 20, I think it all worked out very well so I’m really happy with the path. I was confident and felt like I had a good couple of years in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, and obviously with the opportunity to come to a club like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> - it was just something I couldn’t turn down. I just felt like the timing was perfect and I’m really happy that I made that choice.<br /><br />The intensity, especially the schedule when you get to that winter period where you are playing games all the time. Every couple of days it’s about recovery it’s about tough games where you’re fighting for everything. It’s something I wasn’t 100% used to.<br /><br />I do really like playing on the left wing and also in that 10 spot centrally behind the forward. I’d say those are my two favourite positions</p>

  <p><b>[Pulisic didn’t take injury seriously but USMNT star is ‘100 per cent fit’ and ready for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> return]</b> I didn’t take it as seriously as I think I should have. It was one of those you felt you could do a lot of things but you try to push it that one extra step and realise it’s not ready yet. It was very tough and frustrating going through times like that. I underestimated it and tried to get back as soon as I could because I just wanted to play so bad. If anything, I’ve given myself a little more time to rest now and make sure that I’m 100 per cent fit. I’d say I’m fully recovered and ready to go as soon as we get back<br /><br />It was my first start in a little while so I just had this motivation to go out and prove a lot of people wrong. I felt I’d done okay up to that point but I hadn’t really shown everything that I could do so going into that game, I did have a chip on my shoulder. Once that first goal came, my confidence shot through the roof and it was just my day after that, everything kept falling for me. It was incredible. I’ll never forget coming home after that and just sitting down and looking back on what had just happened. I was so proud being able to talk to my family back home and people that had been watching. It wasn’t just the hat-trick but scoring, helping the team win and having a great game - there’s no better feeling</p>

I know some people might not like this sort of stuff but I really don’t care because I’m going to carry on doing it anyway!. I think it gives people a chance to see me a little better. No one really knows who I am, they just see me as a footballer, so hopefully, it gives them a little insight into my character</p>
