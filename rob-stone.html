  <p><b>[On John Strong]</b> He wasn’t one those guys who got a great break by doing soccer and wanted to parlay it into something else. He was a soccer guy from the beginning and there’s not too many of us out there.</p>

  <p><b>[Rob Stone ready to take on World Cup hosting duties]</b> I might take a picture for you right now of what my kitchen table looks like because it is about 60 to 70 percent consumed with World Cup coverage. It’s laptops, it’s stacking notes, it’s my go-to college notebook binder where I hand write all the pertinent bullet points that jump out to me. I have eight pages of all the groups broken down into the matchdays, I have my day-planner that has various other notepads strewn around.<br /><br />I spent those two years working incredibly hard but always keeping an eye on what the anchors did. That was kind of the golden age of ESPN with Bob Ley and <b>[Mike]</b> Tirico and Chris Myers and Dan Patrick and <b>[Keith]</b> Olbermann, Chris Fowler and Gary Miller - name after name after name, and I leaned on those guys a lot<br /><br />The one thing that stuck out right away is that Rob started having a good relationship with the people we were working with like me and Fowler and Chris Myers. I know all of us were very fond of Rob in part because of his abilities and his personality and his approach to work. It was not a stretch to see that Rob was going to be really successful<br /><br />Here I am in this newsroom with a bunch of other young kids and these living broadcast legends, and I’m barking out the highlights like I would be really doing it on SportsCenter. That was a big step forward for me<br /><br />Bob has such a great journalistic pedigree that I watch him in action and I try to siphon off his abilities and how he asks questions and how he calmly handles situations. I stored that knowledge hoping someday I might be able to use it for a greater calling. Some people don’t realize how long and how hard he has worked to get to this point. I think this is something that he’s earned, I think it’s long overdue. He has powered through and ultimately, this is a soccer guy. This is a guy that grew up playing, this is a guy that has a history in this game and sometimes doesn’t get enough credit for the tireless effort and work and just sense of this sport<br /><br />Right now <b>[Fox’s World Cup programming]</b> is over 200 hours of linear television and I’ll tell you, if I had my druthers, I’d pump it up another 200 or 300 hours. I’m knocking on programming’s doors saying, ‘We can do more, we can do more!<br /><br />I’m well aware of the figures that I consider my friends and my colleagues that I respect immensely that have sat in that seat before. It’s people I look up to, it’s people I reach out to and it’s people that have helped drive me in this career, and that’s a seat that I’ve wanted to sit in for a long long time. It’s very difficult to topple and push away legends, and Fox has placed their faith in me to handle this role. They have full confidence that I can handle any situation that comes my way and I am in no mood to let them down</p>

  <p><b>[Will the U.S. be conspicuous by its absence?]</b> I would talk to Vegas right now and say, ‘What is the over/under on times that we mention the United States in our World Cup broadcast? My guess in all honesty is going to be four or less. And that might be on the high side.<br /><br />I think our country is in a place that’s OK with <b>[the U.S. not qualifying]</b>. They’re clearly upset that the U.S. isn’t there but it doesn’t mean we’re going to turn this tournament off. The intelligence level and sophistication of the American fan around this sport right now has grown immensely<br /><br /><b>[Russia serves up its share of controversy]</b> My guess is most of the political talk is going to happen before kickoff and the opening <b>[match]</b>. My feeling is that once the sport takes over the politics are going to step away. I think there is the majority of people in the United States who see Russia as Ivan Drago from ‘Rocky IV’. Everybody knows about Moscow and St. Petersburg but all the other host cities outside of maybe Sochi, people are probably for now at least scratching their head and have no idea where they are and why they were selected. It’s part of our job to educate everybody about that element</p>
