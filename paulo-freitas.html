<blockquote>
  <p><b>[How Football Manager works?]</b> We have head researchers coordinating the research in a country or league, and assistant researchers who research specific teams. For instance, I am head researcher of Brazil, and there is an assistant researcher for <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a>.<br /><br />The scouting teams vary in size, from only a couple in some smaller countries or leagues to hundreds in some bigger leagues or countries. Researchers who research different clubs, leagues and countries keep in touch with each other, which helps to avoid issues like one league or country getting too overrated or underrated<br /><br />It’s a bit different as a real life football scout evaluates a player according to the needs of a club, whereas in Football Manager we evaluate both a player and full squads. So we focus less on a single player than a real life scout does, but focus more on several players and how they interact with each other. The amount of times <b>[that a player is watched]</b> varies, there isn’t a predefined amount, but the idea is to watch a few times at least, and other times during the season as the situation of a player changes. The information we gather has to be converted to numbers as the attributes of a player are rated that way in the database. So a player who has good finishing may be given a rating of say 14, while a player who has world-class finishing may be given a rating of 18, for instance<br /><br /><b>[With competition for the world’s best young talents as fierce as ever, tip-offs from contacts can be key to ensuring clubs get a head-start when it comes to getting any potential deals done]</b> It happens sometimes, but it varies from country to country depending on the popularity of Football Manager. It happened with <a href="gerson.html">Gerson</a>, who was at Fluminense’s youth setup at the time, and went on to become a top player for the club, then moved to Europe, where things did not work out well. He is now a key player for <a href="flamengo-fc.html">Flamengo</a> and expected to be called up for the national team.<br /><br />I didn’t personally scout him because he was playing in the state of Sao Paulo, while I live in Rio, but I did follow his progress since he was playing for Ituano’s youth setup. His talent then became obvious when he played the prestigious Copa Sao Paulo youth tournament, even though his team did not go far. When he played the state league a few months later, his talent was confirmed as he carried his team to the quarter-finals, even though he was still only 17 years old.</p>
