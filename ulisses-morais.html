  <p><b>[Ulisses Morais takes over the reins for the first time when Johor Darul Ta’zim welcomes the visit of Penang on Saturday as the Super League kicks back into action]</b> We have done the best preparation possible and the players have tried to incorporate new ideas. They are quality and experienced players so the process has been easy. We have only trained for a week, which is too short and our physical condition is not at its optimal level. However, our minds are focused on winning and getting the three points.</p>

  <p><b>[Morais praises latest JDT win but remains concern over poor finishing]</b> It was a good start. We started off with a win and we know the players can play even better because JDT have many quality players. However it was not the best game as we hoped but it was enough to win the game. The important thing was we got three points from the match.<br /><br />Despite that, there were several negatives in the match, as we did not make full use of our goal-scoring chances. We had as many as nine chances but we missed. That was the negative part of the game but we must remain positive. Getting three points, celebrating victory and players carrying out their roles are the most important<br /><br />The physical condition of the players also played a role and there were players who were affected by different injuries. As we knew, Safiq had some problem but in today’s match, Safiq received help from other midfielders to control the game such as Natxo Insa and Amirulhadi Zainal. So, Safiq seemed to play a lot calmer.<br /><br />There were some problems with the players such as Mohammed Ghaddar picking up an injury towards the end of the game. We will surely make some changes because we possess several quality players to play in upcoming games<br /><br />We have two games to play next week and we need to work harder. We need to try winning the Super League and it is among our main objectives. For the Malaysia Cup match against Sarawak on Tuesday, we need to observe first the physical condition of our players who will play that night</p>

  <p><b>[JDT claimed an opening win in the 2017 Malaysia Cup and managed to do it despite making several changes to their starting XI]</b> The match against Sarawak was an exciting game. The players displayed a very good performance. The three points are very important for us. They played well especially in the first 70 minutes. We will play even better in future games. I am very satisfied with the squad rotation.<br /><br />The next match against Terengganu on 7th is very important for me. After that we will focus on the game against Pahang on 11th. However I’m not too worried because JDT have many quality players. That’s why I can rotate the players frequently. Currently the physical condition of the players is getting better<br /><br />As for Nazmi Faiz, he played for SC Beira-Mar in 2015 when I was the head coach. He is indeed a very good player. When I first met him, he was a young talented player; now he’s improved to become a better player. Nazmi and his team-mates played really well against Sarawak. He plays in midfield and JDT have many midfielders with different experience levels. However, it surely is not difficult for Nazmi because he’s a talented player</p>

  <p><b>[Morais prepared to give squad players further chances in Malaysia Cup]</b> Terengganu are a great side and have good players. It was a little difficult for us but the important thing was the players did well and contributed one point to the team. In the first half, we had difficulty in the first 30 minutes because Terengganu began the match well and controlled the game until they gave us some problems. But the next 30 minutes the players managed to match the playing quality of Terengganu, which was important. In general it was a great match and we had to fight to the very end because Terengganu had many goal-scoring chances like JDT had. For tonight’s match it can be said that 50% of the chance fell to JDT and another 50% to Terengganu.<br /><br />JDT have 29 players in total. I feel the Malaysia Cup can give them playing opportunities because we as the coaching staff believe in them. That is the important thing</p>

  <p><b>[Ulisses Morais praises JDT’s attacking efficiency but warns against complacency in coming matches]</b> The win against a great team like Pahang tonight was a very exciting win. What can be said is it was a difficult match, but the players managed to end it with a win. The most important thing is the players managed to score goals and in tonight’s game, we managed to take the lead against Pahang with an early goal. I saw how the players continued to work hard despite having scored an early goal. However, we still have a few important matches left to play and this is just one victory for us. The most important thing is the players score goals in upcoming matches and bring home three points<br /><br />The next match on Saturday against Sarawak is an important game for us. The players who played tonight will be rested, while those who didn’t will be picked because they will be in the best physical condition. Mohammed Ghaddar picked up an injury and we will evaluate his condition tomorrow <b>[Thursday]</b> but we think it is just a minor knock. Our doctor will take a look at him and then only we will figure out the next step</p>

  <p><b>[Despite their 3-1 win over Sarawak, JDT’s Ulisses Morais wants to see more from his players]</b> I am very happy with the match results against Sarawak tonight <b>[Saturday]</b>. However, there are still some actions from the players that have not satisfied me yet. Many had noticed that<br /><br />We realised that this match will be a challenging one because we know Sarawak will surely come to Larkin with a new spirit after the recent match with JDT. It is seen that Sarawak had given a different match tonight rather than previously<br /><br />Regarding Mohammed Ghaddar, he is a great striker. It is proven when he successfully scored two goals for the team. Nevertheless in JDT, we cannot focus on specific individuals because we cannot ignore other players who have also worked hard for 90 minutes in the match. That is the situation in every match<br /><br />JDT is now at the top of the league. We cannot be too comfortable because in football anything can happen. It is true that we have a large difference with other teams, but we still need to work hard because we want to give the best to Southern Tigers fans</p>

  <p><b>[Morais puts defeat down to mistakes but remained happy with second half performance]</b> The second half is more better than the first because we played like we know and it worked. We know too that we play against a good team and players in Selangor. The second half is more near to what we want to do and what we want our game to be in the future.<br /><br />It’s true in the first half we made some mistakes and that’s the reason we are down 2-0 at half time. In the second half we had 4 - 5 chances but at the end we concede a penalty<br /><br />Tonight we give chance to some players. It’s our job to give chance to some players because they work hard and all of them play for JDT. The reason for the loss is not the players but the mistakes we made in the first half. Even then, in the first half it’s just the result and not the performance. In the second half, we think we deserve to win the game but this is football. Congratulations to Selangor but the show will go on for us</p>

  <p><b>[JDT two wins away from an unprecedented 4th straight Super League title]</b> We managed to win tonight’s game <b>[against T-Team]</b> with a 6-1 score. The players showed a really good game in the first half that they scored three goals and created several more good chances. Then in the second half, the players maintained the strategy and momentum from the first half.<br /><br />For us, it was another three important points for JDT. JDT are currently still in two competitions, the Malaysia Cup and the Super League. JDT are in a good position in the Super League, while in the Malaysia Cup, JDT still have three games to play to reach the quarter-finals. The Malaysia Cup is very important for us too.<br /><br />Besides that, I would like to say I am very happy to be with the JDT family. I am happy with the players, and I am happy to see all the JDT fans. All the players at JDT are incredible players. They always show day-to-day improvement and work hard all the time. Tonight’s win was the result of their hard work. Thank you everyone.</p>

  <p><b>[Morais looks to shore up defence ahead of Terengganu meeting]</b> Our preparation for the match against Terengganu tonight has been going well. Of course we want to secure one of the two spots to qualify for the next round of the Malaysia Cup.<br /><br />We are aware that Terengganu are a good team. That’s why we expect tonight’s match to be among the difficult ones because they surely want to win to get three points. Tonight’s game is also our chance to book our slot in the quarter-finals.<br /><br />As for tonight’s starting line-up, we have decided to choose players who can defend our goals better. However, as I said previously, mental and physical preparation aren’t enough, as we also need motivation and support from fans to increase the team’s confidence level when facing our opponents.</p>

  <p><b>[Ulisses Morais praises Fadhli Shas’s contribution to JDT]</b> Previously we had four centre-backs in Marcos Antonio, Fadhli Shas, Junior Eldstal and Aidil Zafuan, but now we are down to three. However, our confidence in them is still the same as when we had Marcos. Regarding Fadhli Shas, he’s a quality player and showed a good game. The JDT coaching staff are very happy with his performance as well as other players’. It indirectly facilitated our job to do our best.</p>

  <p><b>[Ulisses Morais pays tribute to fans and staffs who helped pushed JDT to another title]</b> We know the pitch today was not good for both teams but it was more difficult for us. We committed some mistakes particularly in the second half. If Selangor play like that every week, maybe they fight with us for the title. After the injury to Marcos Antonio, we only have 3 central defenders. But today after the game, Fadhli will need some evaluation on his condition.<br /><br />It’s true <b>[there was confusion]</b>. He cannot follow the instruction and it was difficult for us that 10 - 12 minutes. Selangor got their goal during that time. But that’s football, it means we need to work more on those kind of situations<br /><br />I’m very happy. It was a good match against a good Selangor. It was not a victory for us but we are champions. It was very important for the players, the fans, the staffs and for me. The principal objective for the club is for the title. We would have liked to win this game but it was not possible. But we still get the title. For everyone who have a relationship with the club, it is for them. I’m very happy to be given the chance by TMJ to coach JDT. Here many players and people who have good ideas and have done good work. We appreciate all the work of the people in the club to have helped us. When we come here, it wasn’t a good moment but everybody helped us through. And we are champions before the last 3 games is played. It is not easy. The fans are also very important to us. Like tonight <b>[Saturday]</b> it feels like playing at home. This is for them</p>

  <p><b>[Ulisses Morais delighted to finally get one over Selangor]</b> It was a good first half. Maybe at ten minutes of the game, if our finishing had been better, maybe we would have been 2-0 or 3-0 up by that time. After Selangor scored, we were a bit down but we managed to quickly get the lead back. In the second half, we try to do the same thing but it was not possible.<br /><br />After the 3-1, we try to control the game because our physical condition is not so good. The first game after a long break is always not easy<br /><br />We don’t have many victories over Selangor this season and after four matches, it was good to beat them. The win was also important to stay in the first place of the group</p>

  <p><b>[Ulisses Morais pleased to have an almost fully fit JDT squad for selection as they embark on the Malaysia Cup quest]</b> For the match against Melaka, I hope the players will not slack off against the opposition team in the first leg of the Malaysia Cup quarterfinal. Almost 50% of the Melaka players are new players and they have a new coach who can pose a challenge.<br /><br />Regardless, I will put together the best JDT starting line-up to ensure we take home a comfortable lead for the second leg at our place later. Previously we made preparation without Safiq Rahim, Amirulhadi, Aidil Zafuan, Hazwan Bakri and Darren Lok. Now they have rejoined the training with the team and allowed me to field our strongest line-up.<br /><br />We will not underestimate the opponents because they might have saved energy to face JDT and, as everyone knows, any team facing JDT will fight to the finish. So, we need to be cautious</p>

They are now a better team with new players and new coach. We want to first win and if possible, score more goals. Our players did well and they delivered the two things we asked of them.<br /><br />We know we have a comfortable advantage but we will respect Melaka in the return leg because it was not easy today, especially in the first half</p>

  <p><b>[Ulisses Morais turns attention to the Malaysia Cup]</b> We are on a good run ahead of the next game. But like always we respect the opponents, in this case - Melaka. But we are looking to perhaps make some changes with an eye on the players in better physical position. We have players who have played a lot so we want to manage that. We want to win the Malaysia Cup and now make sure that we must get to the semi-final. We’ll try to win because we are playing at home.<br /><br />I’m very happy that we came here to a big club with good players and staffs. Everybody worked with us every day and we got plenty of help. TMJ <b>[HRH Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim]</b> is a fantastic owner. He has a vision of the future and we live by that. It makes our work, our project very easy</p>

  <p><b>[Morais promises that JDT will be ready to take on Perak]</b> Regarding the match against Melaka, what I could see was that we dominated the whole game. I don’t deny that JDT had a lot of opportunities to score but the Melaka goalkeeper did very well. This is football, what’s important is that the objective was achieved, which was to win the tie and reach the semi-finals.<br /><br />All the players carried out their respective duties well throughout the 90 minutes. The players did their best and from what I could see in the first half, everything went well. Meanwhile, the introductions of Cabrera and Gabriel in the second half improved our match control<br /><br />Currently we want to focus on the match against Felda. Then we will have 15 days to prepare for the semi-finals against Perak. We are aware that the semi-finals will be like a final especially with Perak’s strengths. Of course we will do our best because we want to win the Malaysia Cup<br /><br />For the match against Felda, we will field the strongest line-up because JDT have many quality players. I will also choose the players based on their fitness levels. As I have said before, we will definitely play our strongest line-up for any matches</p>

  <p><b>[Morais frustrated by defensive lapses in concentration]</b> We started the game well and created a few chances. But our individual mistakes was what penalised our team. We had a good reaction to get it back to 1-1. Some moments in the first half we don’t play how we like. We conceded a soft second goal, which wasn’t good. We wanted to start the second half well but we had Junior sent off. Still we managed to get it back to 2-2 but after that it was another mistake. That said, it was a good game. We have 15 days more to work and to get things right for the semi-final.<br /><br />We don’t like to talk about individual mistakes or any particular player. We know we made some mistakes and we paid for that. We lose as all and we win as all</p>
