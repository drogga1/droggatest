<blockquote>
  <p>[Golden Arrows coach Clinton Larsen has revealed that they have been talking to Orlando Pirates with regards to having a few of their players on-loan] At the moment, we are not engaging any talks with Mthiyane. I know my chairlady [Mato Madlala] has been talking to Orlando Pirates. I can’t divulge any names because you know that there’s a lot of competition for players.<br /><br />So, I can’t divulge any names in terms of who we are talking to because it might lead other teams to certain players and you’ll end up losing out on a player<br /><br />[On Mauricio Barrios] We are having a look at a few foreign strikers and hopefully by the time the window closes we should have a striker or two to reinforce our front-line. Mauricio is back in Colombia now. The club is still deciding whether to retain or release him. He has struggled to adapt to the South African league. I think where he was playing in Venezuela, the game is a lot more different. A lot slower. I think the pace of the game he struggled to adapt to it and at this stage it looks unlikely that he will continue at the club</p>
