  <p><b>[Barcelona legend Carles Rexach says he needed only five minutes of watching Lionel Messi to decide that he must sign for the Catalan club]</b> I was introduced to him by <b>[agent]</b> Josep Maria Minguella. But when the club called me, I was in Australia, so I asked for reports on the boy until I returned. The opinions were divided; some said he played very well, others said he was too small, even that he was a table football player. It was not clear whether he would join.<br /><br /><b>[When Rexach returned, he had little doubt]</b> We organised a practice match. I needed just five minutes to be clear that we had to sign him. He was brilliant and I knew we couldn’t let him get away, even though there were a lot of obstacles in the way<br /><br />Messi and his family wanted <b>[financial]</b> security. The days went by and the deal wasn’t getting done, although it wasn’t an economic issue. We were clear that we wanted to sign him, but because he was a non-European, he couldn’t play in the Spanish league at youth level, so he only played friendlies and there were often problems when we wanted to pick him. We found a way for it to work, with a special contract for his father. The club were still not convinced, because there were so many problems to sign a young player, not even a first-team player. They only saw the cons, the difficulty in completing the deal because of the complexity of his contract. But we only saw the pros, his tremendous quality<br /><br />It made him very strong mentally. He was also very well advised by his family the whole time</p>
