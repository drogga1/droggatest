<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Seven years ago, Brighton’s Kayleigh Green wasn’t even playing football]</b> When I was about 16, I stepped away from football because I wasn’t enjoying it. Then my first year back playing, I got a call up for the Wales squad. That showed me that I hadn’t lost the footballing ability, I just needed to get my fitness back. But if somebody had said I’d be where I am now a few years ago, I wouldn’t have believed them. It just shows how far I’ve come<br /><br /><b>[It meant she continued to work full-time while playing - until Brighton came calling]</b> You sacrifice so many hours, going out, enjoying time with your friends, for a professional contract. My dad was the first person I told. My dad and my mum are my idols, they’re my biggest fans and they’ve been there through a lot with me. Now I’ve got it, I can’t lose it, I need to try and be the best that I can be. sWhenever I step onto a training pitch or into a game, I’m always giving 100 per cent because getting a professional contract at such a late age was difficult<br /><br /><b>[Green’s career has thrown at her so far, the biggest is her switch from centre-back to centre-forward]</b> <b>[Jayne Ludlow, Wales manager]</b> had just come in and she had a specific way she wanted to play. She wanted to put players in positions that best suited them and she just tried me up front. I think I played my first game in the Cyprus Cup as a centre-forward and I scored a goal! I had to adjust to have confidence in front of goal and find the belief that Jayne had put me in a position because she thought I was good enough. She helped me a lot to gain confidence. It didn’t come overnight. I had to work on that. I just kind of kept going as a centre-forward and then I signed for Brighton. Hope <b>[Powell, manager]</b> had the understanding that I still had that centre-back ability in me, if she did need me, but I was a centre-forward by then. As you get older, you should be going from centre-forward down to defence. I seemed to go the opposite way!<br /><br /><b>[Her experience in defence helped her massively in transitioning into the new role]</b> When I was a centre-back, I had to figure other players’ movements out. Now, I know the movements that defenders don’t like. When I first started as a centre-forward, that’s how my mind worked: ‘What movements doesn’t a centre-back like?’ That’s what I based my role on<br /><br />Last season, we looked at games like that and thought, ‘We’re not going to win, but we’ll have a go’. This season, we’ve gone, ‘Okay they’re <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <b>[Manchester]</b> United, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, but there’s nothing to say we can’t compete’. I think we’ve just gone in with no fear and thought, ‘We’ve got nothing to lose and a lot more to gain’<br /><br /><b>[There will be a lot to gain in Wednesday’s clash with Man United - namely, a place in the semi-finals of the Continental Cup]</b> <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> is going to be a massive game. At the moment, they’re one point ahead of us. It’s important in that game that we take three points to help us get closer to the top half of the table<br /><br />One thing I can say about the girls is that every time we step on the pitch, we have fight. We have character. We never give up</p>
