  <p><b>[Former Manchester United defender Henning Berg says it’s possible for his old side to get a result against Liverpool]</b> Of course it’s possible for United to win. They beat Juventus away and no one expected that. They were lucky but you’re allowed to be lucky sometimes. Having said that, Liverpool will be favourites because United do have problems at the back with injuries but also with those who are playing in terms of the top, top quality that is needed. Phil Jones was a bit unlucky the other night and he’s a great talent with great potential. He’s unfortunate that he’s been too much injured over the last couple of years. They need improvement, they need to play better as a team defensively. It’s not only about the two or three defenders, it’s about the whole team. If they can produce a good defensive display, I’m sure it’s possible for them to get a result because with <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford, <b>[Jesse]</b> Lingard and maybe <b>[Romelu]</b> Lukaku, I can see them scoring a goal as well.<br /><br />We had some good games there with United. We used to win when I was playing there. That feels like a long time ago now. I remember Carragher got two own goals in one game and I was a little bit disappointed because I thought one of them was mine. But we won the match so it was good</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is capable of being a talismanic presence at Manchester United]</b> It’s a difficult one because his potential is there for everyone to see. What he can do at his best makes him one of the best in the world. In the World Cup win with France he proved that he is a winner and that he can play a part in a bigger team, which he did in Juventus too. So I don’t see why he should not be able to do it at Manchester United. I don’t know everything about Paul Pogba but from what I’ve seen from the outside, he should be able to do it.<br /><br />It’s difficult to put a timeframe on it because you see the results United had under <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> when he took over from <b>[Jose]</b> Mourinho and the upturn they’ve had in terms of confidence, positivity, playing forward and getting the best out of their players. So you cannot put a timeframe but what you definitely can say is they need better players. They have good players today, some top players, but need more consistent winners in the team and I’m not sure if they have enough of the right mentality to be consistently challenging at the top. I think they need some leaders in the group</p>
