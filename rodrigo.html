  <p><b>[The curse of <a href="bela-guttmann.html">Bela Guttmann</a> curse was not responsible for this latest loss. There were no darker forces at work here. In truth, <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> only had themselves to blame - or, more accurately, their misfiring frontline]</b> The idea that we are cursed comes from the press. Nobody in the team is worried - we don’t believe in any hoodoo</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Real Madrid’s new Brazilian teen sensation Rodrigo?]</b> Before I knew it, I was back in the changing rooms. I didn’t even swap shirts with anyone.<br /><br />It was crazy. Everything has just happened so fast. I’d only ever seen the Vila Belmiro on TV, and now I was there … It was all very surreal.<br /><br />At my age, I could still be living with my parents. So, I am very happy to be able to help out. I want to help even more<br /><br />I got my first tattoo when I was 14. It was my mother’s name. My family said I was too young, but they like it. I think I’m too young, too. I do not think I will have many more</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are now huge 2/5 favourites to win their first league title in 30 years, with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> now 9/4 shots to make it three in a row]</b> We are far from them now, but there is still a big part of the season left. We are not going to give up. We are the current champions and we are not going to make it easy for anyone. This team has shown it many times before. This team has won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> two seasons in a row and that isn’t a coincidence. This team has earned the respect in being considered for the title race. Last season, the team was seven points behind and it could have been 10 in case of losing, and they managed to win the league in the end. We are in November. There is still a lot left. They (Liverpool) are very strong at the moment and they are having everything (go) right. Let’s see what happens in the future</p>
