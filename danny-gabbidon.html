  <p><b>[The Hammers central defender has returned from a stomach injury which has kept him sidelined for a lengthy period]</b> I have been back in training since the end of last season and I asked <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> if I could play in the Legends game. They gave me the go-ahead and it was a great feeling to be back playing. The new stadium is fantastic. I love it<br /><br /><b>[There was the possibility that his career could have been ended by the injury, but the player has said that he remained positive]</b> You do get down and wonder when you’re going to get back. But you have to stay positive as negative thoughts don’t help. My wife has bore the brunt of my frustrations when I used to come home from training miserable and she and my family are the ones who have been there to support and encourage me. It is tough not being able to do the job that you love and something you take for granted when you’re playing regularly. When you see your team-mates playing you want to be out there so it makes you more determined to get back out there with your mates. The experience has made me love the game more.</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham United’s Danny Gabbidon Glad To Be Back In Wales Setup]</b> It is good to be back and be available for games after so long out. I’ve had a couple of games, a few bits of matches and I am getting stronger by the day. I need games now. I had a short spell on Saturday against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and now I need more matches to help with my fitness<br /><br />I always felt I would get back to playing, no matter how long it was going to take. I have been out a long time and people talked about whether I would play again, but I always had belief I would. I have done all the pre-season training and got back to some work at the end of last season<br /><br />I have been out for so long I have great enthusiasm now. When things are taken away from you, obviously you miss it. Now I am back the squad has changed a lot, with several young lads now. It is good to see them come through - the future looks good if they keep progressing. Maybe in a couple of years <b>[…]</b> we will start reaching major finals<br /><br /><b>[Gabbidon admitted <a href="craig-bellamy.html">Craig Bellamy</a> would be missed, however, he remained positive]</b> It is disappointing Craig is not with us, he is obviously injured, but as our main striker he will be missed. Any team would miss someone of his quality. It is disappointing, but it now gives a chance to one of the young lads we have with us to come in and show what he can do</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham &amp; Wales Defender Danny Gabbidon Retires From International Football]</b> After nine fantastic years of playing international football for Wales, during which I had the honour and privilege of captaining my country, and after long consideration, I have decided to retire from international duty. On a personal note, I would like to thank the <a href="fa.html">Football Association</a> of Wales for their support over the years and I would like to thank the people of Wales who supported me and my fellow team-mates at every game, home and away, giving their all to the cause - true supporters! I would also like to say a special thank you to my family, friends and management team, who have stood by me throughout the many good times and very few bad times.</p>

  <p><b>[QPR will not give too much respect to Manchester City]</b> We showed <b>[Spurs]</b> a bit too much respect in the first half and we’ll learn from that. We can’t be scared of these teams. We need to go out there and believe in ourselves a bit more. I think we showed in the second half what we’re about and we’ve got to approach the City game in a similar fashion. It’s 11 versus 11 at the end of the day and we can’t afford to give them too much respect. We’ll just give it our best shot and see where it takes us on the day<br /><br /><b>[After making his first appearance in over a month against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, the former Hammer is happy to have come through unscathed and hopes his luck continues]</b> There was no reaction with the knee. I was a bit leggy after, but the knee was fine and coming through unscathed was the most important thing. Hopefully I’ll be injury-free for the rest of the season now.</p>

  <p><b>[Swansea City are in the market for a new manager after parting with <a href="bob-bradley.html">Bob Bradley</a>, but former Wales international Danny Gabbidon does not believe that it is nailed on for <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> to inherit the reins]</b> I don’t think it’s nailed on <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> will get the job at all. He had that interview <b>[in October]</b> and missed out to <a href="bob-bradley.html">Bob Bradley</a>, so I wouldn’t say that he’s the favourite. It’s a difficult job to take on. He’s had a little spell as manager at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and worked under <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> but it’s difficult to come into this situation when you’re still a bit unproven as a manager. <a href="alan-pardew.html">Alan Pardew</a> might be a shout after leaving Crystal Palace. He knows <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and he might want to get straight back into work<br /><br />They need to bring someone in who has experience of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, if they can. Someone who knows about being in that kind of situation and can go into the transfer market, if there’s money available, and wheel and deal and get a few players that they need to help keep them up. With the American owners you just don’t know what they are going to do next. They might be looking overseas again. You just hope they can get the next appointment right and they need to spend a bit of money in the transfer market. It’s the only way I can see them staying up</p>
