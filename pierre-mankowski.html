  <p><b>[France international star Paul Pogba is a victim of his own success]</b> Everyone is always a little against him. We always think he can do more. But he matured very quickly. If he had only appeared today, we’d say he is a good player. We expect so much of him because he was such a phenomenon at 19. Everyone praised him, he was extraordinary. He was already drawing the spotlight. It pleased the media, too, and he was given extraordinary coverage. It may not have served him well. Today, he still has his level, but we already want to see him improve. What harms him is the way he is on the park. He appears laidback, you never have the impression that he’s sprinting to get the ball. His rhythm is always unusual. He has this great muscle mass, he carries his head high.<br /><br />He’s always believed in himself a great deal. Initially, it was seen as something charging; it was said that this attitude could take him very far. But today it’s almost too much. We want him to progress constantly and be a prodigy. But he’s a human being and must be hurt by being criticised. He must not lose confidence and begin to doubt himself. We know what he’s worth and what he can bring. He won’t change now</p>

  <p><b>[Aymeric Laporte is the only Manchester City outfield player to have played every minute of Premier League and Champions League]</b> He does not engage with the group. He is a loner. When he communicates, it may seem awkward, because he has a great perception of his value and he shows it. In the end, he’s a good pro who has trouble integrating into the group.</p>
