  <p><b>[San Diego’s rise to MLS expansion favorite will come down to public vote]</b> There’s a real age divide that’s at play here around the understanding of the sport of soccer and its popularity. Generally speaking, if you’re over the age of 60 then chances are you understand the sport a lot less than if you’re under the age of 40. So a huge chunk of the question is who shows up to vote, and who is going to come forward and let their voice be heard.<br /><br />With respect to the sport, I think it’s a huge strength of soccer that the population that is most enthusiastic about is is between the age of 20 and 40. Convincing those people that they want to show up and vote and take their destiny in their own hands for what we have in San Diego for professional sports is one of our key goals<br /><br />We feel pretty good about where we’re sitting right now. I think this is our election to lose, but it’s not a slam dunk. People have to show up and let their voice be heard. If we win, I feel we’re incredibly well positioned. No guarantees in life obviously, but I can’t think of a market out there from a quality of market standpoint, and what Major League Soccer is trying to create, that beats San Diego. If we win, I can see San Diego becoming a new epicenter for soccer in the United States. You can’t find a better market for soccer than this</p>
