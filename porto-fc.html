  <p><b>[Hector Herrera out for Mexico friendlies vs. Iceland, Croatia]</b> Effectively, Hector has a problem, it’s the same one that caused him to miss the games against Belgium and Poland. Thinking more of the health of the player, because that’s what our job is and he’s one of the most important players, we’ve decided to put him aside and he’s not going to participate. Hopefully they continue the rehabilitation process with the same objectives, for the good of every one of us who are counting on him.</p>
