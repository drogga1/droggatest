  <p><b>[The <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Player of the Year has sent out the battle cries ahead of his club’s showdown with Italian opposition Inter]</b> From now on, all games are important.

It will be a difficult game, but I think that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have a better team, and we’ll do our best to win it<br /><br />They’re a good side and first in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> so we need to be very careful. They’re a team with very experienced players, but we also have our aces and great players. We have a more experienced team, we’re the reigning champions. It will be a good game, a well-contested game, and the better team will win<br /><br />I always had a great ambition to win the Champions League, because it isn’t obtainable for every player. It was my first Champions League win, so the emotion was spectacular. I remember <a href="edwin-van-der-sar.html">Edwin van der Sar</a> saving <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Nicolas Anelka</a>’s penalty and for me it was like the earth stood still, it was a really brilliant sensation. Sometimes we can’t control our emotions<br /><br />The Champions League is unique. When you hear the music and you come out on to the pitch, you feel you’re part of a game that is completely different to all the others. It is already the most evenly-balanced competition in football in my opinion and it is spectacular to play in<br /><br />It’s every player’s ambition to be a part of the Champions League, and they would all like to win it. I’ve had that privilege, and I hope to repeat that very soon</p>

Cristiano is Cristiano and Messi is Messi. We’re both great players and our individual and collective titles speak for themselves. He tries to do his best for his team and me for mine. We are rivals because we play at different clubs, but when we are together we have a mutual respect. I don’t like to compare - the word does not exist for me. We’re two different people, two people doing their work. They even compared our children when they were born, at school, who is faster or smarter … <br /><br />I just try to do my job, to be myself. Everyone has people who hate him, it’s not just me. I’m not here to try to satisfy my detractors, I am here to make my fans happy - they are the ones who show me love and affection and are with me all the time. That is the most important thing for me<br /><br />If I am in good physical condition, if I don’t have injuries and I’m still motived, I will keep playing until I’m 35, 36, 37, 41, 45 … I don’t know, it depends on your mind and I hope that every year I find the motivation to play football because it is my passion and what I love to do</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo has given his guide to the essential must haves for every modern man]</b> There are a few luxuries that I think every man should treat himself to…I love music so it’s important to me to have a good pair of headphones, a beautiful watch, smelling great is a must so every man should have a nice signature fragrance and of course, very good quality underwear! I love fashion and like to invest in luxurious items for my wardrobe. I think that the key pieces that every man needs in his wardrobe are a great suit, well-fitting jeans, a crisp white shirt, some good pairs of sneakers and, of course, great underwear. Clothing doesn’t have to be expensive to feel luxurious - an amazing fit and nice fabrics are what makes items stand out, and are also what makes pieces timeless.<br /><br />Underwear is the foundation to any outfit, so it’s important to wear quality, premium styles that make you both look and feel good. My CR7 underwear luxury lifestyle campaign showcases the collection in a more intimate way than ever before. Since underwear is so personal, I wanted to bring a more personal element to the campaign, which shows me relaxing at home. Downtime in itself is a luxury! I choose different CR7 underwear styles depending on how I feel each morning, so with each collection I like to design contrasting patterns and colourways to make sure there’s an option for any occasion. The spring and summer 18 CR7 underwear range includes timeless white silhouettes for a classic look and bold blue and even pinks for when you want to be more adventurous. I love the styles with touches of vibrant colour. To me, that is luxury!<br /><br />For spring and summer 2018, I really wanted to create a luxurious feel for the collection. Colour still plays a big role, but the colour palette is more refined, we’ve got crisp whites and more sophisticated tones. I started this brand six years ago and the designs have evolved alongside my own style choices. This collection is more mature, with a real focus on premium, luxury materials</p>

There is always the possibility of making a difference, I was prepared for all this. I used as a base some photos of Cristiano Ronaldo that I found on the internet, nothing specific. I put the photos next to me and started working on the bust<br /><br />I was with the brother at Cristiano’s museum in Madeira and from the messages he sent, I could tell that he liked what he saw. He only asked for some wrinkles to be changed, that give him a certain expression in his face when he’s about to laugh. He said it made him look older and asked for it to be thinned out a bit to make it smoother and more jovial. But they gave it the go-ahead before they liked what they saw</p>

This is where he recharges all his batteries.<br /><br />He’s very focused, in his own bubble, but he’s also very anxious. He plays the match out in his head, thinks about how things will happen. There are some who play until the age of 37. Cristiano is not a machine, but he will continue to play while he can, I think for three or four more years. Cristiano has always been a perfectionist, he’s always seeking to be the best, to do everything to win. But aside from that, he is really reserved</p>

Their three front players, they’re very quick … they are powerful in attack and I respect them. But Madrid are better.

You can see it around the training ground: we’re not conscious of how historic it would be because everybody is completely focused on the game. But, afterwards, if everything goes well, we will enter into the history books. You always have to be motivated. You can’t relax at this club, particularly in this competition. The Champions League has been synonymous with Real Madrid since Gento and Di Stefano. We sense it as players and the fans do as well.

I don’t have a precise moment when I decided. During the years, we played a few times against Juve and I had a special feeling that the Italian supporters like Cristiano.

I won’t say it was the key point in my decision, but every detail helps. Maybe. Of course, it helps when you see the people like you, the supporters and club like you, the feeling is completely different. I have to say thank you to all of them for the support. My priority is to do my best, be professional, try to make the team even better. That is my job, I’ll try to enjoy it as much as I can and make Juventus even better. My first goal will happen in a natural way, I’m not thinking about that. I know that I will be prepared, I’ll be ready, but my first goal doesn’t matter. I just want to be ready. I want to be in good shape, help the team, win trophies - that is what I’m looking for<br /><br />I don’t know, maybe it’ll be different here in this club. So far, I feel the people at the club are different, they are nice and like a family. The supporters are the same. I’m excited and of course I want to make them happy. I’ve been a professional for 15-16 years, so my method is always the same.

He never stops, he always runs, helps the team. He’s a fantastic team player and he scores goals. He scored important goals, for me he’s fantastic. He was the kid of England. Everyone loved him. He is a fantastic boy, fantastic player. I used to call him, between me and my mates, the pit bull. I remember when he lost the ball he was so powerful, a strong guy, he shoots unbelievable. He scored many goals, what can I say? I miss playing with him. The future nobody knows. Maybe we’ll play one day together again.</p>

I’ll never say which ones, but Juventus are a solid club. They have so much history. Two Champions League finals, seven league titles…I knew the atmosphere of their stadium. I’d played in Italy several times before, a couple of times against Juventus. I felt a connection and then everything else. I couldn’t be 100 per cent sure that I was joining the best club in the world, given I spent nine years at Real Madrid, but I’m 100 per cent sure I made the right decision at the right time.<br /><br />Juve are different to everyone else in many ways, even in the way they treat me. Small details make a big difference. However, I prefer to emphasise similarities. Manchester United, Real and Juve are the top teams in their respective countries, but here the roads are divided. Italian teams, for example, tend to defend more on the field, while things are much more relaxed away from football in Spain. In Italy, the concentration, dedication and commitment are greater. At the end of the day, the level is similar</p>

We won the final of the Supercoppa of Italy in Saudi Arabia. It was my first title. The balance is very positive, at an individual level I feel good.

I did not expect the Italian league to have this quality. I am happy, my family and my children are happy. Everything is positive.<br /><br />We adapt well, my family likes Italy, it’s a different reality, a different country, a different language and culture. I have always lived outside the home since I was 11 years old so I have no problems adapting to another country I went to England with 18, to Madrid with 25 and to Turin with 33. It is not difficult for me to adapt to a country or to a different culture. I do not miss Spain or Portugal. Things are the way they are. Obviously, I left many friends, left a great club. I left a club that gave me a lot of love, people and friends. But I do not miss the country itself, because I have the same here. It has not been difficult for me. Everything has been very intense, interesting and different but I have adapted well. I am happy<br /><br />As I said it’s going to be a difficult game. Atletico is a team that has played two Champions League finals in the last four years, it’s one of the teams that can win the Champions League. We know it will be difficult but, if Juventus play well, we will get through</p>
