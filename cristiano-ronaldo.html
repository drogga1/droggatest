  <p><b>[The <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Player of the Year has sent out the battle cries ahead of his club’s showdown with Italian opposition Inter]</b> From now on, all games are important. It’s time to kill or be killed. Whoever loses will exit the competition and we don’t want to lose, we don’t want to get stuck along the way. It will be a difficult game, but I think that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have a better team, and we’ll do our best to win it<br /><br />They’re a good side and first in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> so we need to be very careful. They’re a team with very experienced players, but we also have our aces and great players. We have a more experienced team, we’re the reigning champions. It will be a good game, a well-contested game, and the better team will win<br /><br />I always had a great ambition to win the Champions League, because it isn’t obtainable for every player. It was my first Champions League win, so the emotion was spectacular. I remember <a href="edwin-van-der-sar.html">Edwin van der Sar</a> saving <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Nicolas Anelka</a>’s penalty and for me it was like the earth stood still, it was a really brilliant sensation. Sometimes we can’t control our emotions<br /><br />The Champions League is unique. When you hear the music and you come out on to the pitch, you feel you’re part of a game that is completely different to all the others. It is already the most evenly-balanced competition in football in my opinion and it is spectacular to play in<br /><br />It’s every player’s ambition to be a part of the Champions League, and they would all like to win it. I’ve had that privilege, and I hope to repeat that very soon</p>

Not anymore, but when I was younger, it was always a big challenge. Obviously, with maturity, you’re able to control your emotions but I knew it was an important step in my career. There were a lot of clubs interested in me at the time. I always had my feet on the ground and I knew that my future would be in football, that I would be a professional footballer and my life would be around football. I was taking it step by step. This time it was about playing, enjoying the game, playing against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, a great team, doing my best, trying to play an excellent game and obviously things went well. The before and after… I didn’t think about it. I was just thinking about the moment and enjoying the game<br /><br />Obviously, I think you always change. I was more of a dribbler back then, I wasn’t as direct as I am now and in recent years. I was a talented dribbler and I used to like assisting. Obviously with time and experience I’ve changed and, I believe, for the better. To score wasn’t important, honestly. If I had scored, maybe there would have been 100 teams after me. Since I didn’t score, there were only 50 teams! I think the most important thing was to play well and help my team win. Even without a goal the interest was very high. I have to say, and it’s true, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> were already interested in me before the game. The game was like the icing on the cake. I played well, I shone in the game and this aroused even more interest. After the game I felt I had nothing left to prove to anyone. Every club knew after that game that if they bet on me, they would win<br /><br />It was just after the game. I remember that the game was over. There was a Sporting director who called me over and said that Ferguson wanted to talk to me. I left the dressing room and went to the other dressing room with him, along with an interpreter. He showed his interest, we talked, and obviously I was very happy. Knowing that I was a young man and feeling that everyone wanted me on their team, that for me was an emotional moment</h4>

One of the things that I seek to challenge myself in, for example, is acting in a movie. I always recommend learning all that is new. This is what I always strive for. I always seek to educate myself, because my studies tend to answer many of the questions on my mind. We have to learn the best of others, and this is an important part in helping me achieve what I have reached now<br /><br />Our life is based on balance, you can eat all the food you want, but in return, you should keep exercising and not eat what harms your body. I know my body 100 per cent, and I always maintain a diet that brings me the physique that makes me different. Everyone knows my way of living, and my life is devoted to football. Maintaining my level of success in the past 15 years is mainly linked to my perseverance in being the best! I don’t want my words to be understood as narcissism. The love of football is the main motive in achieving all the titles I ever won. There are no special miracles or secrets in my success story, or any other success story. Rather, it is a great dedication to what you do. At the age of 34, I still have that fitness through diligence and hard work to get titles</h4>
