  <p><b>[The <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Player of the Year has sent out the battle cries ahead of his club’s showdown with Italian opposition Inter]</b> From now on, all games are important. It’s time to kill or be killed. Whoever loses will exit the competition and we don’t want to lose, we don’t want to get stuck along the way. It will be a difficult game, but I think that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have a better team, and we’ll do our best to win it<br /><br />They’re a good side and first in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> so we need to be very careful. They’re a team with very experienced players, but we also have our aces and great players. We have a more experienced team, we’re the reigning champions. It will be a good game, a well-contested game, and the better team will win<br /><br />I always had a great ambition to win the Champions League, because it isn’t obtainable for every player. It was my first Champions League win, so the emotion was spectacular. I remember <a href="edwin-van-der-sar.html">Edwin van der Sar</a> saving <a href="nicolas-anelka.html">Nicolas Anelka</a>’s penalty and for me it was like the earth stood still, it was a really brilliant sensation. Sometimes we can’t control our emotions<br /><br />The Champions League is unique. When you hear the music and you come out on to the pitch, you feel you’re part of a game that is completely different to all the others. It is already the most evenly-balanced competition in football in my opinion and it is spectacular to play in<br /><br />It’s every player’s ambition to be a part of the Champions League, and they would all like to win it. I’ve had that privilege, and I hope to repeat that very soon</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo rape allegation: Case dropped as Las Vegas officials ‘decline to prosecute’]</b> The Clark County District Attorney’s Office announced today that it will decline to prosecute a 10-year-old sexual assault allegation against Cristiano Ronaldo. On June 13, 2009, a female victim (‘V’) placed a call to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and reported that she had been the victim of sexual assault. Members of law enforcement responded to her location to take a crime report. Police transported V to the hospital so that a sexual assault examination could be conducted. A short time later, sexual assault detectives arrived at the hospital and made contact with V. Although she knew who the person was who assaulted her, V refused to identify him or disclose where the crime occurred. As a result, the police were unable to follow investigative protocols for sexual assault cases or to conduct any meaningful investigation. Without knowing the identity of the perpetrator or the location of the crime, detectives were unable to search for and impound vital forensic evidence<br /><br />In addition, video evidence, showing interactions between the victim and perpetrator before and after the alleged crime, was lost. The criminal investigation was closed. V and Cristiano Ronaldo, through their respective attorneys, eventually reached a civil settlement related to this matter in 2010. For the next eight years, law enforcement heard nothing more from V regarding the crime on the perpetrator. On August 28, 2018, V contacted the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, asking that her sexual assault investigation be reopened, naming Cristiano Ronaldo as the offender. In spite of the passage of over nine years, Metro investigated her allegations. A Request for Prosecution was submitted to the District Attorney’s Office on July 8, 2019. Based upon a review of the information presented at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, no charges will be forthcoming</p>

Juventus said in its reply that Ronaldo’s absence was due to muscle fatigue from previous matches that had forced him to take a rest. If Ronaldo was unable to play, it would be a blatant deception to include Ronaldo as a substitute on the start list. Also, according to a phone recording between the promoter and an official from Juventus released in the media, everyone from Juventus including Ronaldo himself and the manager Sarri knew it clearly that Ronaldo was supposed to play.<br /><br />Yet, Juventus has so far avoided responsibility for Ronaldo’s no-show without any explanations. Other assertions from Juventus are also filled with untruth and deception. K League clearly register our profound indignation and disappointment to Juventus’s irresponsible behaviour and manners, and we strongly urge Juventus to offer a sincere apology and explain the reason for Ronaldo’s no-show.</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo reveals all about THAT Man Utd game in 2003, Sir Alex’s dressing-room invite &amp; how 50 teams wanted him]</b> It was the first game in the new Sporting stadium. I remember it perfectly, as if it were today. I was happy. I was going to play against one of the best teams in the world and the game was spectacular. I mentioned to my friends at the Sporting academy that I would play against Manchester and that I was a bit nervous. Nervousness is a part of being a football player, in big games. I’m always nervous because I always want to play well and do the best I can for my team and nervousness always plays a part. But when you’re nervous and focused, things usually work out better. I was motivated, I was happy and I knew that if I played well it would generate even more interest, not only from Manchester United, but from other clubs as well because I was being watched. I felt that many teams came to watch me and of course watch Sporting too. The game went really well for me.<br /><br />I try to take all big challenges as a big test. Not anymore, but when I was younger, it was always a big challenge. Obviously, with maturity, you’re able to control your emotions but I knew it was an important step in my career. There were a lot of clubs interested in me at the time. I always had my feet on the ground and I knew that my future would be in football, that I would be a professional footballer and my life would be around football. I was taking it step by step. This time it was about playing, enjoying the game, playing against Manchester United, a great team, doing my best, trying to play an excellent game and obviously things went well. The before and after… I didn’t think about it. I was just thinking about the moment and enjoying the game<br /><br />Obviously, I think you always change. I was more of a dribbler back then, I wasn’t as direct as I am now and in recent years. I was a talented dribbler and I used to like assisting. Obviously with time and experience I’ve changed and, I believe, for the better. To score wasn’t important, honestly. If I had scored, maybe there would have been 100 teams after me. Since I didn’t score, there were only 50 teams! I think the most important thing was to play well and help my team win. Even without a goal the interest was very high. I have to say, and it’s true, Manchester United were already interested in me before the game. The game was like the icing on the cake. I played well, I shone in the game and this aroused even more interest. After the game I felt I had nothing left to prove to anyone. Every club knew after that game that if they bet on me, they would win<br /><br />It was just after the game. I remember that the game was over. There was a Sporting director who called me over and said that Ferguson wanted to talk to me. I left the dressing room and went to the other dressing room with him, along with an interpreter. He showed his interest, we talked, and obviously I was very happy. Knowing that I was a young man and feeling that everyone wanted me on their team, that for me was an emotional moment</p>

If you have this and a real ethic and a good lifestyle, you can still do it at 34-and-a-half<br /><br /><b>[Ronaldo added that the right mentality is absolutely essential to reach - and stay - at the top]</b> We faced Lokomotiv Moscow, who refused to play and parked the bus in front of their goal. It was hard to score. I didn’t do it and I was frustrated at the end. That’s normal. The most important thing is that the team wins. But when I went back to the dressing room, I chilled out. After the match, I went to dinner with friends. I got home at four in the morning. I had a glass of iced water before bed. I slept until 10 then I had my breakfast. At 11, I went to work in the gym. If you don’t have that discipline every day, you can’t stay at the top for 15 years<br /><br /><b>[Ronaldo speak of the importance of yoga and meditation in his life]</b> I’ve learned from Michael Jordan and all those who achieved excellence. I like to read about the Noble Prize, on what people have invented, generated, created, developed. The Nobel Prize for people like that, it’s like winning the Ballon d’Or for me. I like to know why they’ve invented something and how they did it. It’s important and it’s going to help me become even better</p>

  <p><b>[Ronaldo’s hotel refutes reports of being a paid-up coronavirus infirmary]</b> The world is going through a very difficult moment which demands the utmost care and attention from all of us. I speak to you today not as a football player, but as a son, father, a human being concerned with the latest developments that is affecting the whole world. It is important we all follow the advice of WHO (World Health Organization) and the governing bodies on how we handle this current situation. Protecting human life must come above any other interests. I would like to send my thoughts to everyone who has lost someone close to them, my solidarity to those who are fighting the virus, like my team-mate <a href="daniele-rugani.html">Daniele Rugani</a>, and my continued support to the amazing health professionals putting their own lives at risk to save others</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo’s mother, Maria Dolores, has posted an emotional message on social media thanking those who have offered support during her recent health scare]</b> I am lucky to have the opportunity to live, to love my family and have them close to me. Thank you to everyone for their support and affection. These have been difficult days, but ones of struggle and victory. Now I’m at home surrounded by the love of my family, my good energy. I will stay here as I like to but always looking after myself first. Everything will be fine. You thought I wouldn’t come back but I returned slowly, softly, calmly and with peace in my heart<br /><br />I also returned with a thought in the form of a message - why judge the colour of one’s skin, the clothes or shoes people use or the way they look. We are nothing when it comes to life, we are simple, pedestrians in this world. Life is a lesson and we just have to value it and be thankful for everything. And have faith in God that everything will turn out okay</p>

  <p><b>[Emanuel Santos on Cristiano Ronaldo statue]</b> Even Jesus did not please everyone. This is a matter of taste, it’s not as simple as it seems. I used photos of Cristiano Ronaldo that I searched on the internet as a base. I put the photos next to me and started working on the bust. What matters is the impact that this work generates. There is always the possibility of making a difference, I was prepared for all this</p>

  <p><b>[Ronaldo on Zidane]</b> I think <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> knows how to handle the team in an intelligent way. It’s not an easy situation because all the players like to play a lot, but he knows how to work intelligently and he manages to involve all the team.<br /><br />You need to feel like you are an important part of the group and <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> made me feel special. He helped me a lot. I already had a lot of respect for him but working with him made me admire him more. That’s because of what he’s like as a person, how he talks, how he led the team and how he treated me</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo has ‘left door open’ for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> return]</b> I know he loves Madrid, that’s for sure. It’s clear that he loves the club itself, it’s one of the biggest clubs in the world, if not the biggest. He’s left many, many friends there and he’s always left the door open. So I wouldn’t be surprised if he goes back to Real Madrid</p>

  <p><b>[Ronaldo to David Beckham: You’re one of the best of all time]</b> You were one the best of all time. The way you touched the ball, the way you could put the ball wherever you wanted, without looking at me, I would just be moving and the ball came. I should thank you for the many balls you gave to me. To move from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> was a big move for me because I’d been there my whole life. But one of the first people that I ever saw was you. When you walked into the changing room it made me feel comfortable to be in the club</p>

  <p><b>[Ronaldo on Energy Levels]</b> If you train regularly it’s important to keep energy levels high to fuel your body for better performance. I sometimes eat up to six smaller meals a day to make sure I have enough energy to perform each session at top level<br /><br /><b>[As well as tending to his hair, Ronaldo has used the time to study]</b> When I quit football I would like to resume my studies. I focus a lot on studying, on learning, because unfortunately the studies I have done can’t give answer all the questions I have in mind.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Georgina Rodriguez? Everything you need to know about Cristiano Ronaldo’s girlfriend]</b> His height, his body, his beauty caught my attention. I was trembling in front of him, but a spark ignited. I am very shy and perhaps this stirred me more in front of a person who, with one glance, had touched me deeply. Then after, the way Cristiano treats me, cares for me and loves me did the rest</p>
