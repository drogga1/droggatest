  <p><b>[Aaron Lennon is hopeful that he caught the eye of England manager Gareth Southgate during Burnley’s 4-0 weekend victory over Bournemouth]</b> It’s a long time since I played international football. You never know. But the only thing I am concentrating on is playing well for Burnley. Whatever happens, happens<br /><br />It’s been preying on my mind to be honest. I should score more. I’ve had a few chances this season but it is great to get the goal. If you are playing every game you want to aim for double figures. But for me getting assists is just as important. It makes my day if the other lads score as well. It didn’t matter how we won. We knew it was just important to get back to winning ways. To win 4-0 was even better. We worked on it all week, getting back to basics, being on the front foot and doing what we do. From minute one we were in their faces and it has paid off for us.</p>
