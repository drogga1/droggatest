  <p>[Former USMNT defender Michael Orozco happy with life at Lobos BUAP after resurgence] The video, even my kids have it on the iPad. I came into that camp with just one goal: To make a difference. Thankfully, it happened for me in that 15 or 20 minutes when I got in and played defense, scored the goal. Getting the first victory for the United States on Mexican soil in the Azteca, which is a stadium that has so much history, I think it was something beautiful, not just for me but for my family. I’m really proud to be part of that moment in history and when I’m at home in Anaheim, California, they remind me of that.<br /><br />Right now, I’m focused on what I can do here with Lobos, helping to save the team from relegation. My showings on the field speak for themselves. I think the national team is in the process right now of changing the whole structure, starting a new cycle, but I’d never close the door on the national team because this is the highest honor a soccer player can have - to one day get there and represent your country with honor. So, if a call comes, I’ll be there and help however I can help, whether it be motivating or giving my experience or if I’m going to play as well, it’d be a pleasure, a happy moment to be there once again. Not going to the World Cup has left a lot of players ‘marked’, but I think we can overcome that with work<br /><br />I’d love to, first, save the team with my teammates, possibly re-sign which would be ideal for me and my family. Having kids and having to adapt and figure out a new city is difficult. But, look, I’m also not ruling out going to MLS one day, which is something really great and I enjoyed the experience I had in 2010. It was perfect. Right now, I’m taking on everything calmly. I’ve got six months left. I’m going to give everything for the team to stay up and if we stay there’s the potential plus of getting to the Liguilla and moving forward. But first of all we have to save the team</p>
