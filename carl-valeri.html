  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory captain Carl Valeri urged his team to immediately switch their focus to Perth Glory after suffering a shock loss to Wellington Phoenix]</b> In the first five minutes Phoenix started better than us, and it kind of set the tone for the game. It’s a little slip up along the way.<br /><br />The good thing about this week is we don’t have time to dwell on it. We have a tough game on Saturday <b>[against Perth]</b>, which gives us a chance to redeem ourselves<br /><br />We’ve always had good depth. And there are those on the bench and at home who are ready to step in so it’s only up to us now</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory captain Carl Valeri has signed a year’s contract extension to remain at the club until 2017-18]</b> It has been a privilege to represent Melbourne Victory and I’m thrilled to extend my contract for another season. This is a great club with a proud history, and it’s an honour to be captain of a playing group which is hungry for success. I look forward to leading the team through the rest of the current season and beyond.</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory captain Carl Valeri backs Melbourne Victory youngsters to step up]</b> It’s exciting and I’m happy for them because I see the way they train, the way they play and … they get their chance. I know they’ll take it because of how hard they’ve worked and I see it and everyone knows that around them. They come in full of confidence and it’s just like playing with anyone there. I mean everyone in the team, who plays a certain position, works the same. Whether it’s Jimmy Troisi, he sometimes works with Chris Theoharous and they do the same things, the same movements. So they’ll embrace it and it’ll be a great game for them.<br /><br />It’s kind of been our problem because we’ve got an attacking mindset and we’re an aggressive team, we kind of have that lapse and concede silly goals, and we all know it and we all try and prevent but it’s just one of those things … I still think we could defend better, so we’re forever looking to improve and I think that’s a great thing. I mean, we’re in second position with a good amount of points, so the fact that we’re looking to get better I think is a great sign and a reason why this club is successful</p>
