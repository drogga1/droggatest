  <p><b>[Ivan Cordoba claims <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> did not understand the potential of Romelu Lukaku]</b> <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> is an extraordinary player. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> did not understand the player’s potential and his last season was bad for him. In my opinion <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> is proving everyone to be a champion. He is determined and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has improved him a lot. I met him: he is a positive leader in the changing rooms. It’s a shame that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> sold him, but I’m happy that Inter bought him. <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> has been fundamental to his form at Inter.<br /><br /><a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> and <a href="ashley-young.html">Ashley Young</a> are excellent players and will give determination and strength to Inter. I am happy that they chose Inter. <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> comes from <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, a wonderful team, and Young was a symbol of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Inter made two big purchases.</p>

  <p><b>[Ivan Cordoba says <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> would be great destination for James Rodriguez]</b> <a href="james-rodriguez.html">James Rodriguez</a> is the best player for us Colombians. It depends on him - he has everything he needs to do well. I wish James would go to England because there are so many interesting options for him. James is already at one of the best teams in <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, but <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would be a great destination. Those who buy him will make an excellent choice. Selfishly, I hope to see him in Italy at my Inter. I hope that one day he can replace me as a Colombian footballer at the San Siro.<br /><br /><b>[on Sanchez]</b> He is fast and has a lot of physique. I really like him and he has a great physical impact. In the national team he is highly rated, but I hope he will improve a lot. He could be one of the strongest and I have great respect for him</p>
