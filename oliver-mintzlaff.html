We are happy that we were able to extend the contract with him until 2023. He played a really strong first half of the season. We also believe that we are still a very good stage for <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> on which to develop as a Germany international<br /><br /><b>[Mintzlaff went on to play down Leipzig’s chances of dethroning Bayern]</b> It is now important for us not to deal with the championship, but to focus on the fact that we qualify for the Champions League again. This will be difficult enough because there are at least five teams fighting for these places<br /><br /><b>[Leipzig’s progress was halted when the season was put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic]</b> That would be an absolute disaster because it could lead many clubs to bankruptcy. We love the diversity of the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and every fan wants it to continue. Therefore we want to do everything possible to prevent this disaster</p>

  <p><b>[RB Leipzig have suggested that they could be willing to broker a deal for promising centre-back <a href="dayot-upamecano.html">Dayot Upamecano</a> over the course of the summer]</b> In the Covid-19 crisis, we have other issues greater than concerns about contracts. We know the terms of our players’ contracts and I know them very well - especially that of our top performers. For us, it is a no go that the top performers will be allowed to leave our club free of charge. That’s the case with <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> and that will be the case with <a href="dayot-upamecano.html">Dayot Upamecano</a>. I have the economic stability of the club in mind<br /><br />We have to sell before we buy anything. But I see the need to sell only to a limited extent. We have a good squad. If we can’t finish the season, we don’t have to deal with new transfers at all. It wouldn’t fit into the big financial loss that we have.</p>

  <p><b>[RB Leipzig chief executive Oliver Mintzlaff insisted <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> won’t get any cheaper]</b> It won’t get any cheaper. We will not sell a player below value if he is under contract for more than a year. In general, we always have to ask the following question - can we replace a player if we sell him for less than his market value? But, I only think about those things once I have the facts on the table</p>

  <p><b>[Oliver Mintzlaff says No £54m <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> deal in place for Werner]</b> We haven’t had an exchange yet. Accordingly, we have nothing to report. <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> is a player for <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a>. He signalled a few weeks ago that he was busy with a transfer. Until now nothing is done. We are concentrating on the final sprint in the league. We want to qualify for the Champions League. That is the only thing we are currently discussing with Timo. It was important for us that we extend the contract with him. We did that last summer because of course it is important for our young club that no player moves on a free transfer. Of course, there was this exit clause that we put in the contract to give him the opportunity to take the next step. Now Timo is sitting in the driver’s seat, not us anymore. So far, he has not drawn upon the clause, nor has any club sent us a transfer contract<br /><br />If Timo should leave the club, we’re sure that the buying club will allow us to keep him until the end of the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> season, whenever that is. We can only discuss the Champions League when we know when it is going to take place. It won’t be decided until mid-June</p>

  <p><b>[Leipzig sporting director Oliver Mintzlaff has made it clear that <a href="dayot-upamecano.html">Dayot Upamecano</a> will not be allowed to leave on a free transfer in 2021]</b> Upa’ is an extremely important player for us and one of the most sought-after talents in Europe. And we can assure that we have a clear understanding with him and his agent he won’t leave us on a free. We can’t afford that as a club. There are only two options: prolong or leave. I am sure we’ll soon find out in which direction it’s going</p>
