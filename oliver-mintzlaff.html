  <p><b>[UEFA will only allow one of Red Bull Salzburg and RB Leipzig to compete in either the Champions League or the Europa League next season]</b> We are not nervous at RB Leipzig and also the UEFA signals don’t exist.

  <p><b>[Liverpool were more driven in their pursuit of Naby Keita than Barcelona were]</b> Barcelona enquired about the signing of Naby Keita. But it seems they were not as driven as Liverpool.<br /><br />We wanted our focus to be 250 per cent on our triple burden this season, but it had become difficult for Naby. That way, we found a solution which gave the player back his security. Also, we were able to negotiate for a much higher transfer fee</p>

  <p><b>[RB Leipzig chairman Oliver Mintzlaff has robustly denied that will have any bearing on his side’s game against Salzburg]</b> It’s nonsense to even suggest the outcome of this game has been decided. Leipzig and Salzburg have been independent clubs for a few years now. In the first leg, it was obvious that both teams wanted to win. This will also be the case in the second leg.</p>

  <p><b>[Timo Werner has yet to decide on a move to Bayern Munich]</b> We haven’t spoken to Timo Werner about Bayern Munich, but what the player wanted to do was important for us as he wanted to see how the season would go. Last year we certainly didn’t play football like we did in the season before. We have submitted an offer and we know that Timo would rather not extend - but that can still change.<br /><br />He has matured with us as a personality and he’s willing to take the next step now. We have always said that we do not want to stand in the way of a player’s career if he has decided to leave us. As long as we qualify for the Champions League, we believe that - with the new coach Julian Nagelsmann - it would certainly also be a platform where Timo Werner can develop and feel good<br /><br />Maybe he doesn’t even want to go to Munich. Maybe he wants to go to <b>[Thomas]</b> Tuchel in Paris or, I have no idea, maybe to Jurgen Klopp <b>[at Liverpool]</b> or Lucien Favre <b>[at Dortmund]</b></p>

It was important for us what Timo Werner wants. It was legitimate for a young player like Werner to spend time deciding on his future. Maybe Timo will tell us after the Cup final: ‘Come on, I’ll extend that by two more years.<br /><br />Ralf Rangnick will stay with us, there is no question mark. We have no dissent at all, but have extremely harmonious and open discussions about the future</p>

We know the terms of our players’ contracts and I know them very well - especially that of our top performers. For us, it is a no go that the top performers will be allowed to leave our club free of charge.

I have the economic stability of the club in mind<br /><br />We have to sell before we buy anything. But I see the need to sell only to a limited extent. We have a good squad.

We will not sell a player below value if he is under contract for more than a year.

  <p><b>[Oliver Mintzlaff says No £54m <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> deal in place for Werner]</b> We haven’t had an exchange yet. Accordingly, we have nothing to report. <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> is a player for <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a>. He signalled a few weeks ago that he was busy with a transfer. Until now nothing is done. We are concentrating on the final sprint in the league. We want to qualify for the Champions League. That is the only thing we are currently discussing with Timo. It was important for us that we extend the contract with him. We did that last summer because of course it is important for our young club that no player moves on a free transfer. Of course, there was this exit clause that we put in the contract to give him the opportunity to take the next step. Now Timo is sitting in the driver’s seat, not us anymore. So far, he has not drawn upon the clause, nor has any club sent us a transfer contract<br /><br />If Timo should leave the club, we’re sure that the buying club will allow us to keep him until the end of the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> season, whenever that is. We can only discuss the Champions League when we know when it is going to take place. It won’t be decided until mid-June</p>

And we can assure that we have a clear understanding with him and his agent he won’t leave us on a free. We can’t afford that as a club. There are only two options: prolong or leave. I am sure we’ll soon find out in which direction it’s going</p>
