  <p><b>[Former Toffees defender Alessandro Pistone urges <a href="moise-kean.html">Moise Kean</a> to use <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> as inspiration]</b> <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> have exceptional fans who support the team and ask their players one thing only, to give maximum commitment. Moise will have to give 100 per cent to be loved. He is a player with great perspective, with huge potential and an education in Italian football. To become their main man he has to make the jump from being a squad player to one that can take them to trophies. It won’t be easy but the city of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is a perfect place to improve his game. He will fall in love with it<br /><br /><b>[Pistone, who played alongside Rooney]</b> <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> was a 16-year-old phenomenon. He was one of the greatest English players ever and I am happy to have played with him and to have seen his desire to reach the top. As well as being technically strong, he was also mentally tough. He had a lot of grit and if he had something to say he always knew how and when to say it. Kean has arrived in England with a different background to <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>. He has a lot of potential though and can still take things from how <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> took his raw talent and became a legend<br /><br /><b>[Rooney is preparing to make a return to English football from <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> outfit D.C. United, with the 33-year-old set to link up with Championship side Derby as a player-coach in January]</b> I wish Wayne good luck in his coaching career. It is not easy for anyone to establish himself as a coach, even when they have been a great player. But, because of the technical and character skills he had as a player, I am convinced he will do his best to become a great coach too</p>
