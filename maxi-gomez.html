<blockquote>
  <p>[Valencia have announced the signing of Maxi Gomez from fellow La Liga club Celta Vigo. The striker has signed a five-year deal at Mestalla, with a release clause set at €140 million] I’m very happy to be joining Valencia. They’re a very big club and I’m happy to be here. It’s really nice to be able to play in the Champions League. I’ve never done that before, and from a young age I’ve always dreamt of playing in the Champions League and La Liga. I’m very grateful to Valencia and very happy. I came here with Celta and when we arrived at the stadium there were all the fans waiting for the Valencia players. It was a really beautiful thing.<br /><br />I want to help the team and score many goals. I hope that good things are on the way. I’m going to give my all, as I have done for every club for which I’ve played. I was able to meet some of my teammates the other day, although a lot of them were missing still. I’m very eager to stat training and give everything for Valencia</p>
