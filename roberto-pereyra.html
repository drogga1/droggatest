  <p><b>[Roberto Pereyra one of the comeback stories of 2018]</b> I am very happy to start the season like this. I worked hard and prepared myself after the many injuries I have had over recent years. When I arrived here I had the misfortune of being injured. I lost almost a year-and-a-half of football. Last year, I hadn’t done the pre-season preparation and so I struggled a bit because I would play and then get hurt again. But this year I prepared great and then also Watford changed a few things inside the club. Things have been working well and we are all happy.<br /><br />Javi Gracia has been very important for me. He understood how I wanted to play and then he instilled his trust in me, which was also very important<br /><br /><b>[When asked to pick five footballers - dead or alive - he would invite to dinner, Pereyra includes Okaka along with Diego Maradona, Ronaldinho, the Brazilian Ronaldo and himself]</b> That would be some party!<br /><br />Due to my bad injuries, many years have passed since I was last selected. I am happy to be back. I worked hard for this and I want to make the most of this moment. It was an objective of mine to return and to help lead my country, but I know it will now be even harder to keep my place. I will continue to work hard for my club so the next call-up arrives<br /><br />It was not what we expected from the Argentina national team, given the class and the standard of players that we have. It went badly but we can’t look backwards. There are new players that are joining the national team and we hope to create a good group ahead of the Copa America next year. There is lots of young Argentina talent. I like <b>[Exequiel]</b> Palacios, who plays for River Plate. He is a strong midfielder. There is Paulo <b>[Dybala]</b>, there is Lautaro <b>[Martinez]</b>, there is <b>[Mauro]</b> Icardi. These are strong players who definitely will give a hand to the squad<br /><br />Dybala has already shown that he is a great player. With the years he has accumulated <b>[at Juventus]</b>, he has gained more experience and now he must continue doing what he has been doing. Definitely, he will reach great heights. I believe it is not a problem for Dybala and Messi to play together. They have more or less the same characteristics but them playing together for Argentina would be fantastic. We hope this happens so we can reap the rewards of these two players of great class<br /><br /><b>[On Lionel Messi]</b> For me, he is the greatest ever. I have seen him play and seen what he does in training. I have not seen anyone else do the same things he does. At Barcelona, he has demonstrated just how great a player he is through everything that he has won and will continue to win. He demonstrates his greatness in every game. Even when he doesn’t score, just his presence creates fear. He showed this against Tottenham in the last Champions League game. He scored two goals and made the difference</p>

  <p><b>[Watford star Roberto Pereyra believes that his former team-mate Paul Pogba is happy at Manchester United]</b> I don’t know if Pogba and Mourinho have problems or not. The last time that I saw Paul, I spoke with him and he told me that he was happy there in Manchester, that he was there with his family, that he was settled. He was making the most of things. Then, certainly some things happened there between them but I don’t believe it was anything that serious.<br /><br />Paul is a great player, that there is no discussion. I have played with him and he has amazing quality. He does things which not just any footballer can do. It is true that at Juventus he did very well and now at Manchester United he has struggled a bit but it is still early. I believe that if he is still at Man Utd next year or in two or three years, he will make history there<br /><br />They were two very beautiful years for me. I learned many things at a great club with great players. I learned a type of mentality and professionalism that is inside the dressing room of the club. These are things that you do not find in many clubs in Europe<br /><br />My memories of that game are a bit ugly because we lost but I am happy because it was my first year at Juventus. We only missed winning the Champions League, we won everything else. I came on as a substitute in the final for 15-20 minutes, I don’t remember exactly how long. In that moment of the game <b>[at 1-1 when Barcelona scored their second goal]</b> we were doing well. It was a shame that we lost but I am happy about that year because we gave everything<br /><br /><b>[Pereyra, though, disagrees that this is the reason Juve have gone 22 years without lifting the Champions League]</b> I believe we have had a bit of bad luck. The mentality of Juventus is rivalled by only a few clubs in Europe. Maybe it just comes down to a bit of lack of concentration or a little slack moment of play and you lose the game. And against great teams like the Real Madrid they lost to, you can’t give away anything</p>
