  <p><b>[Despite UiTM FC’s round two FA Cup win over Petaling Jaya Rangers FC, the university club head coach Wan Mustaffa Wan Ismail is now worried about the fixtures his men will be facing]</b> I am slightly worried now, as we’ve had two postponed league matches, which will be replayed. In February alone we have seven matches, combined with the FA Cup match in March. In order for my men to cope with this, they need to be prepared in terms of recovery.<br /><br />Our target in the FA Cup is only to advance past round two, thank God today we’ve achieved that. But I wouldn’t say no to going beyond that! We can do that if we plan it correctly as this is where squad depth comes into play. Whoever is picked to play must be ready to shoulder the responsibilities</p>

  <p><b>[Mustaffa said that the team were let down by their strikers’ lack of finishing in the match]</b> We were once again let down by our strikers’ poor finishing, and tonight it’s more obvious than in our previous match against Kelantan. But I’m still proud of my men, who gave their best especially in the second half. They must never stop trying, as we are still in a learning process<br /><br />Maybe Kedah’s bomoh is more powerful! But on a serious note, I will not take any drastic actions. They need to be hard working. They are students, they need to keep on learning, training, undergo drills. Actually I am not worried <b>[about the goal dearth]</b>, as Sunday and Dong-hyun are currently among the top scorers in the league. I just don’t know why we have only managed to score one goal in two Malaysia Cup matches. What’s more disappointing tonight is that the opportunities we had were not half-chances, they were open goal scoring opportunities. But I hope they never stop trying until they start finding the back of the net</p>
