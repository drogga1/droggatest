  <p><b>[Leicester City full-back Ricardo Pereira is hoping that his stellar form this season results in a recall for Portugal]</b> These are just the choices made by the coach. I do my job here, I always stand ready for the national team. But there are very good players in very big clubs that play the same role as me; <b>[Barcelona’s Nelson]</b> Semedo, <b>[Juventus’s Joao]</b> Cancelo or <b>[Inter’s]</b> Cedric Soares. My goal remains the same, I tasted the national team and I only think about being back there.<br /><br />It is true that after being a champion with Porto and playing in the Champions League <b>[in 2017-18]</b> that allowed me to be in the squad for the World Cup. And it is true that Leicester are not at the same level because there is no Champions League and the club is not among the biggest in the league. But we can see things in a different way. With Leicester in the Premier League I play big matches every weekend, there are big games all the time. There is also a lot of exposure so no, I think the explanation is elsewhere.<br /><br />Honestly I don’t think about it because I feel good in Leicester. But you never know what can happen with football. I did not talk about my future with the bosses <b>[at Leicester]</b>. Like all players I dream of playing in the most beautiful competitions. There will probably some opportunities this summer and we will decide with the club what is best for everyone. It’s amazing to be rewarded in my first season <b>[Pereira claimed Leicester’s Player and Players’ Player of the Season awards]</b>, for me and for my family it makes us very proud. It rewards all the work done this year and of course I am happy. And then, when we look at the history of recent years and the names of those who had the trophy, it’s pretty good for me!<br /><br /><b>[Pereira also discussed the tragic passing of club owner <a href="vichai-srivaddhanaprabha.html">Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha</a>]</b> It was very complicated, everyone loved him at the club and in the city. He was someone very kind, always attentive and generous. We were all shocked and they were very difficult weeks for the club. The group was affected but it allowed us to come together even more and move forward</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> defender Ricardo Pereira has likened ‘ruthless’ team-mate <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a> to his national compatriot <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>]</b> They are very different people but they are both ruthless in front of goal. It’s important to have a player like that. When he has a chance he scores. In some games where we don’t have many chances, it’s important to take them and score one goal. In some games the small details make the difference. We are happy to have him<br /><br /><b>[Pereira’s performances at the back have, however, been equally important to <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a>’s displays in front of goal, with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> boasting the best defensive record in the league. Their eight goals conceded is one better than <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>’s nine, and two better than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>’s right-back puts the success down to the collective effort of the entire team]</b> It not only the back four, it’s the whole team, it’s another good thing not to concede a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Ricardo Pereira: It’s my goal to play at Euro 2020 for Portugal]</b> This is a goal since the start of the season. But I must play very well here with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> to have the opportunity to help the national team at the European Championship<br /><br /><b>[Portugal have been given an unfavourable route to defend their European title, having been drawn in Group F along with France and Germany]</b> It’s a very difficult group. There are three big teams, but I don’t think there are any favorites. We’re all going to play against each other. It’s going to be very tight, for sure. But anything can happen and I hope Portugal will win at the end<br /><br /><b>[Portugal are European champions but France lifted the World Cup last year to become world champions]</b> Perhaps. If they became world champions, it is not by chance. But Germany also has a good squad. They will be two very difficult games.</p>

  <p><b>[Ricardo Pereira believes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have not locked in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title yet]</b> Here in England, you never know <b>[about <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> race]</b>. It’s true that 10 points ahead of second is a lot. But last year too, they were seven points ahead, and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> finally won the title. I think that is not done yet, even if they have a very good advantage. <b>[Thursday]</b> will be a big game. We will face a very tough opponent, who is also the championship leader. We know it will be difficult, but we will play at home, with our fans. I think that if we defend well and we are effective, we can do something<br /><br /><b>[<a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a>’s importance to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>’s cause cannot be underestimated]</b> <b>[<a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a> is]</b> one of the best. I have played with some good strikers, but he’s very efficient, he never gives up. He fights to the end when he loses a ball. It’s very important for the team. He helps us a lot with his goals<br /><br /><b>[Ricardo Pereira insists he was currently solely focused on <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>’s cause]</b> We always want to level up and all the players dream of playing the Champions League. It’s a big competition and it’s good to have been followed by these kind of clubs. These are positive things that inspire me to work. You never know what can happen in the future. <b>[<a href="psg.html">PSG</a> is]</b> a big club. In addition, I played in France. I know the club and the championship. It’s the biggest club in France. He plays the Champions League and the title in all competitions. But for the moment, there is nothing. I must to keep performing with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> before</p>
