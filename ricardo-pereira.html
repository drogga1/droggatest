  <p><b>[Leicester City defender Ricardo Pereira has likened ‘ruthless’ team-mate <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Jamie Vardy</a> to his national compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> They are very different people but they are both ruthless in front of goal. It’s important to have a player like that. When he has a chance he scores. In some games where we don’t have many chances, it’s important to take them and score one goal. In some games the small details make the difference. We are happy to have him<br /><br /><b>[Pereira’s performances at the back have, however, been equally important to <a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a>’s displays in front of goal, with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> boasting the best defensive record in the league. Their eight goals conceded is one better than <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>’s nine, and two better than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, but <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>’s right-back puts the success down to the collective effort of the entire team]</b> It not only the back four, it’s the whole team, it’s another good thing not to concede a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Ricardo Pereira: It’s my goal to play at Euro 2020 for Portugal]</b> This is a goal since the start of the season. But I must play very well here with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> to have the opportunity to help the national team at the European Championship<br /><br /><b>[Portugal have been given an unfavourable route to defend their European title, having been drawn in Group F along with France and Germany]</b> It’s a very difficult group. There are three big teams, but I don’t think there are any favorites. We’re all going to play against each other. It’s going to be very tight, for sure. But anything can happen and I hope Portugal will win at the end<br /><br /><b>[Portugal are European champions but France lifted the World Cup last year to become world champions]</b> Perhaps. If they became world champions, it is not by chance. But Germany also has a good squad. They will be two very difficult games.</p>

  <p><b>[Ricardo Pereira believes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have not locked in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> title yet]</b> Here in England, you never know <b>[about <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> race]</b>. It’s true that 10 points ahead of second is a lot. But last year too, they were seven points ahead, and Manchester City finally won the title. I think that is not done yet, even if they have a very good advantage. <b>[Thursday]</b> will be a big game. We will face a very tough opponent, who is also the championship leader. We know it will be difficult, but we will play at home, with our fans. I think that if we defend well and we are effective, we can do something<br /><br /><b>[Vardy’s importance to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>’s cause cannot be underestimated]</b> <b>[Vardy is]</b> one of the best. I have played with some good strikers, but he’s very efficient, he never gives up. He fights to the end when he loses a ball. It’s very important for the team. He helps us a lot with his goals<br /><br /><b>[Ricardo Pereira insists he was currently solely focused on <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>’s cause]</b> We always want to level up and all the players dream of playing the Champions League. It’s a big competition and it’s good to have been followed by these kind of clubs. These are positive things that inspire me to work. You never know what can happen in the future. <b>[PSG is]</b> a big club. In addition, I played in France. I know the club and the championship. It’s the biggest club in France. He plays the Champions League and the title in all competitions. But for the moment, there is nothing. I must to keep performing with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> before</p>
