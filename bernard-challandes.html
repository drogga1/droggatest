  <p><b>[England vs Kosovo. With eight points from four matches and an undefeated record to boot, Kosovo have a realistic chance to complete a fairy-tale run to the finals]</b> I think it is in my philosophy that if we don’t dream it is unnecessary to play such games, we should dream and do all that is possible to disturb England. For me as a coach it is not easy to have a good mix for the evaluation of this game. If I say: ‘We come to win,’ I think a lot of people think that is pretentious; if I say: ‘It is not possible to win against England,’ I must change my job. It is clear for me it will be a very, very hard game but it is a possibility for our very young team to show what is a very, very high level</p>

  <p><b>[Bernard Challandes on Raheem Sterling]</b> It’s impossible to play against him or you do a foul. In the past he was very speedy but the final ball or shot was not so good. It is now incredible. He’s learned a lot with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>. He’s one of the best players in the world now</p>

  <p><b>[Kosovo coach Bernard Challandes believes <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> is so good a broken leg may be the only way to stop the England star]</b> The bad news for us is that Sterling will play. He is one of the best in the world in his position. But <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> is great, <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>, <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> - England have a lot of great players. Whether we play against Sterling or not, we have to play a superb match. We are not dealing with individuals but with the team as a whole, so we will be preparing for England. How to stop Sterling? Maybe we break his leg, but it’s not our style. We are too nice. But we have a good team, as we have shown in this qualification campaign<br /><br /><b>[The Three Lions’ goal-hungry attack concerns Challandes, who admit he is somewhat scared by what could happen to his side]</b> England have tremendous offensive potential, scoring many goals and winning 7-0, 6-0 and 5-0. For us, it is a challenge, an incredible challenge. As a coach, I can enjoy this game but, of course, I am a little bit scared. This is the 1001st match for England, and it is the 29th for us. They have a little bit more experience than we do</p>

  <p><b>[Kosovo manager Bernard Challandes believes England have no equals in the attacking third of the pitch]</b> We have seen all this campaign, England has the best offensive team in the world. They are the favourite for the European Championship<br /><br />There is big enthusiasm within the team. People are very proud of the team. The good feeling with the support can help, particularly today. We have never lost here but we have never played against such a team as England</p>
