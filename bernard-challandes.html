  <p><b>[England vs Kosovo. With eight points from four matches and an undefeated record to boot, Kosovo have a realistic chance to complete a fairy-tale run to the finals]</b> I think it is in my philosophy that if we don’t dream it is unnecessary to play such games, we should dream and do all that is possible to disturb England. For me as a coach it is not easy to have a good mix for the evaluation of this game. If I say: ‘We come to win,’ I think a lot of people think that is pretentious; if I say: ‘It is not possible to win against England,’ I must change my job. It is clear for me it will be a very, very hard game but it is a possibility for our very young team to show what is a very, very high level</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bernard.html">Bernard</a> Challandes on <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>]</b> It’s impossible to play against him or you do a foul. In the past he was very speedy but the final ball or shot was not so good. It is now incredible. He’s learned a lot with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>. He’s one of the best players in the world now</p>

For us, it is a challenge, an incredible challenge. As a coach, I can enjoy this game but, of course, I am a little bit scared. This is the 1001st match for England, and it is the 29th for us. They have a little bit more experience than we do</h4>
