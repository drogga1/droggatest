  <p><b>[Former Wales striker Dean Saunders, surprised about the run <a href="chris-coleman.html">Chris Coleman</a>’s squad are on at <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> EURO 2016]</b> I parked in the short stay car park two weeks ago in the <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> airport! I brought a small suitcase. I’ve run out of clothes and I’m going to have a £1,000 parking bill when I get back, that’s how confident I was! All of a sudden we’re three games away from winning it</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool should sell Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona for £130 million next summer and reinvest the funds on a new defence]</b> If Liverpool want to win trophies, if they want to get to that next level, they need to improve their defence. One way around that would be to sell Coutinho next summer for £130 million and buy three new defenders and a defensive midfield player…and maybe a goalkeeper as well.<br /><br />Liverpool’s front three are already brilliant, so I’d take the money for Coutinho and that’s one way you can get the back-four better. I wonder if the manager is sitting there this morning thinking, ‘is my back-four good enough to go where I want to go with this team?’<br /><br />Would Loris Karius get in Manchester United’s team? Would Joe Gomez? Would Alberto Moreno? Would Joel Matip or Dejan Lovren or Ragnar Klaven? Go through the seven best teams in Europe, none of those players are getting in those teams, so as a manager you sit there and think, ‘are they good enough, and if not what can I do about it?’ He could change the way they play to protect them a little bit more, or change the personnel.<br /><br />They are not far away, Liverpool. But again, great teams can win games 1-0, and at the moment Liverpool can’t do that against the top teams</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool have been urged to make a move for Arsenal contract rebel Aaron Ramsey]</b> When you first said it, my reaction was ‘it will make them stronger, having Ramsey in the squad’. He covers more ground than everyone almost every week, and he scores goals and makes goals; he’s a good footballer with a good brain. Liverpool have signed Fabinho and Keita - they look really good - and Fabinho is more like <b>[Patrick]</b> Vieira, where he will sit in front of the defence. Then you’ve got Keita and Ramsey … I can see that. I think Aaron Ramsey will make Liverpool stronger. I think he’d be a great signing for Liverpool. If Liverpool sign him, they definitely get stronger. What a midfield that would be - Ramsey, Keita and Fabinho.<br /><br />It’s Arsenal’s own fault this situation has come up. They’ve let his contract run down to a year, and the power now goes to the player and the agent, because they can demand what they want. If you get that contract they are offering him now signed with two years left on his contract, as a club you’ve got the power. But Arsenal have let a number of players’ - including Sanchez and Ozil - contracts run down, and it cost the club in the end. To stop Ramsey going to Liverpool now they’ve got to give him more money</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United do not boast a single player that would get into Liverpool’s team despite spending £711 million since Sir Alex Ferguson retired]</b> Would any of their players get in Liverpool’s team? I’m not Man United bashing, and I haven’t picked Liverpool because I used to play for them, I’ve picked them because they are one of the top teams this year. United have spent £711 million since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club, and they probably have not got one player who is a certainty to get into Liverpool’s team. <b>[David]</b> de Gea over Alisson? Maybe. <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba? Possibly, but with the disruption he is causing, I don’t know whether I would have him. Liverpool have spent as well, but they have spent wisely and they are going in the right direction.<br /><br />For Manchester United to spend £711 million and have the team playing how it is at the minute, I just think it’s amazing. Manchester United are in turmoil. I can’t understand how it’s gone so pear-shaped. The manager doesn’t look happy and the fans are really, really not happy. Things are just not right at the club. It’s like two massive film stars getting married and you know it’s going to end in tears</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool now boast such strength in depth that injuries to key men such as Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino would not have a detrimental impact]</b> Well, they look really good don’t they. I think pre-season they were really good. I think the manager’s done the right thing. He’s looked at what was wrong last year, what was holding them back and he’s sorted the goalkeeper situation out. He’s signed <b>[Naby]</b> Keita, who looks like he could be a great player, as well as Fabinho and Shaqiri. So, he’s signed four players <b>[with Alisson acquired as well]</b>. Now, when you look at the depth in the squad, if Salah’s injured, Shaqiri goes in and he can score goals at any level. And at £13 million you won’t get a better buy all season for a player who’s 26 and won 70-odd caps for his country. And the way he plays he can score goals, he can win them games. So, I think the manager’s done well.<br /><br />You could argue that they could do with another centre-half but you look at midfield now they’ve got <b>[Jordan]</b> Henderson, <b>[James]</b> Milner, <b>[Adam]</b> Lallana, Keita, Fabinho and <b>[Georginio]</b> Wijnaldum all trying to get three slots really. And I think at a push he could play two sitting midfield players and play Shaqiri at number 10. I was really impressed with Lallana who’s not getting a game at the moment. Pre-season he was brilliant, he’s not getting a game. And obviously you’ve got Sturridge who’s had a good pre-season and he could play his part this season. If Firmino’s injured or not scoring, Klopp can stick him in. With his talents he’s without doubt one of the most talented strikers in the league, he just can’t stay fit.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have placed themselves in a difficult position over the future of midfielder Aaron Ramsey]</b> I can’t understand it. He’s been at Arsenal for ten years and they’ve let his contract run down. And it’s not just him, it happened with Ozil and it happened with Alexis Sanchez. Once the players can see the finishing line on their contract, you’ve lost all control as a club. They managed to keep hold of Ozil, but it has cost them an absolute fortune, and now this is what happens, the players are knocking on the door saying: ‘If he’s getting that, what are you going to give me?’ The bar has gone up. It’s a game of poker now, but Arsenal have lost the power. Ramsey and his agent have got the power now, because he can just let his contract run out and leave for nothing.<br /><br />He can do a bit of everything, he sees passes, he’ll go box to box and he covers more ground than most players - at the Euros I think he covered more ground than every other player. Arsene Wenger played him everywhere across in the midfield and he is a massively important player for Wales</p>

They lost one game all season and lost the league by one point when <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> won each of their last 14 games, so they didn’t bottle it.

No.<br /><br /><a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a> are the front three, and <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a> and <a href="xherdan-shaqiri.html">Xherdan Shaqiri</a> have come in and done their bit.

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> striker Dean Saunders has claimed that <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> would be a useful addition to <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s squad]</b> I think the whole thing is a mystery <b>[that he left England in the first place]</b>. When he left <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> he was top of assists, he and <a href="gylfi-sigurdsson.html">Gylfi Sigurdsson</a> were level, he was top goalscorer and had the most key passes, and they let him go. He was still only 31 at the time, he scored 250 goals for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and he’s England’s highest scorer. He’s still 33, he’s not 35. 30 now is not the 30 that we knew, with the nutrition and everything. I know he hasn’t lived his life perfectly, but who has? And he started young at 16, so an argument could be that he’s played all that time and he’s burned out. But he could definitely still play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and a club should have gone for him. Have you seen the goals he’s scored in America? He must be thinking to himself, ‘this is not a challenge for me’. I was even thinking, it crossed my mind, if he’s fit and he’s hungry, you know who need that type of player? <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. They could do with someone who can play in midfield and turn defence into attack, hit defence-splitting passes and score goals<br /><br />Obviously <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> probably wouldn’t get in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s team, but he could definitely play for other <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> teams, maybe mid-table; he could get in <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>’s team, he could get in <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>’s team. The only reason he’s not playing for a top-six club is because his legs are not what they were, and maybe because the candle inside, that burning desire, maybe that’s not as bright as it was. You’d have to get him in, look him in the eye and ask, ‘Wayne, are you here for the ride or are you here because you’ve got that <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> fire in your belly where nobody takes the ball off you, you want to win and you want to drive your team-mates on?’. But it’s a great signing for Derby if he signed for them</p>
