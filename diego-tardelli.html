  <p><b>[Atletico Mineiro Striker Diego Tardelli Rules Out <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> Move]</b> I’m tired of talking to the president but he wants to do business in January. I’ve told you, it’s important I can stay here at a club I know and where I’ve adapted in order to have a chance of being at the next World Cup. For now, I’ll stop here. I know some rumours emerged about <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> but nothing was concrete. My thoughts are still focused on Atletico Mineiro and I’ve said that my intention is to stay here</p>
