  <p><b>[Fiorentina have no intention of parting with Federico Chiesa]</b> I will not make the same mistake with Chiesa that was made with Baggio. Roby Baggio was the greatest player ever and they sold him just for money. I don’t know if there are any particular clauses in Chiesa’s contract, but as far as I am concerned, he is our champion and I won’t sell him even for €100m. I have my dreams, we’ll take it one step at a time and see what happens, but I want to do something for Florence and Fiorentina. I want to leave my mark here.<br /><br /><b>[Commisso is determined to retain the services of Chiesa as he has big plans for Fiorentina]</b> I am 69 years old, but this morning I again woke up at 5.30am to start work. You never stop running here. My family left Italy as losers, we struggled to reach the end of the month and didn’t even have money to buy shoes. I worked for my older brother from age 14-17, as he opened the first pizza delivery service in the Bronx, called Pizza Time. I told myself, I am 69 years old, so if I don’t buy a Serie A club now, when will I do it? I don’t have much time left and I want to really leave my mark. I threw myself into this new challenge</p>

After finishing last term on a 14-match winless run, any victories are welcome for the Florence outfit, as new owner Rocco Commisso seemed to suggest after watching his side overcome Guadalajara 2-1 thanks to efforts from Giovanni Simeone and Riccardo Sottil]</b> I thought we’d lose because the Mexicans can play</p>

  <p><b>[Franck Ribery was better than Cristiano Ronaldo in Fiorentina’s 0-0 draw with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> on Saturday]</b> I am very happy, as the lads gave their heart and it was a fun afternoon. Did you see Franck Ribery at the age of 36? He played better than Cristiano Ronaldo! And our two Italians, Gaetano Castrovilli and Federico Chiesa, were phenomenal. I see this match as like the history of my company, Mediacom. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> had €300 million worth of players between transfer fees and salaries, while ours was about €50m, but we still got a point<br /><br /><b>[Despite this dreadful spell of form, Commisso is confident of a brighter future at the Stadio Franchi]</b> If you give me time, I want to help <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> win something. Look at the success we’ve had over the last two months, we had more season tickets than in the last 30 years. We’ve rebuilt the team and now have a great champion like <a href="franck-ribery.html">Ribery</a> too. If you give us time, we’ll one day win games like this</p>

  <p><b>[Fiorentina owner Rocco Commisso admitted that <a href="franck-ribery.html">Franck Ribery</a> was wrong for pushing an official during a 2-1 defeat to Lazio at Artemio Franchi Stadium on Sunday]</b> <a href="franck-ribery.html">Ribery</a> was a bit nervous and he was wrong, even though he had a reason. We’ll see how we move forward<br /><br />We’ve had replays in the US for years and we have no controversy. Last night, I saw why it’s so controversial in Italy. It’s a little bit scandalous what happened to us because it will penalise us for a long time. But it all comes from a foul that wasn’t given. Why is VAR there if it isn’t used? It was the same against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. This is an international rule and it seems right to me that he was sent off. But I don’t understand why, at international level, it wasn’t signalled to go to VAR</p>

  <p><b>[Fiorentina will not stand in the way of Federico Chiesa if he wants to join Juventus]</b> Chiesa must decide and, if he wants to leave, I won’t stand in his way, as long as the amount is right. How much is <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a>’s release clause? €111 million? I could take off a million for Chiesa… I’m just kidding! Chiesa knows what <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> are about, who Rocco is, and what he’ll find here in Florence in the future. If he goes elsewhere, then I don’t know. If he wants to go to <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>, there are no vetoes for certain clubs. However, at the moment I have a splendid relationship with Federico and his father</p>

If he wants to go then I’m sorry, but we’d accommodate him, providing the offer is fair. We must also see what he’s worth. <b>[His price]</b> may have dropped since last year. It must suit everyone, although there’s a chance that he’ll stay. I haven’t offered Federico anything. There hasn’t been a proposal, it’s fake news. The important thing is that a player wants to stay. Many players have understood that <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> are aiming high. I don’t want to put anything in Chiesa’s mouth, he’s a very good lad. We have a very good relationship and I want to keep him. I want to do the right thing for <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> and, if he wants to go, we’ll accommodate him.<br /><br />There’s <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, but there are also other teams in Europe</p>
