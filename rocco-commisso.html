  <p><b>[Rocco B. Commisso claims that the governing body should be held responsible for the failures of the national team to make the World Cup]</b> The real causes of last night’s debacle, however, weren’t actually present on the field or on the sidelines in Trinidad. Instead, the result was a byproduct of larger, systemic problems within the sport in our country.<br /><br />The blame must be placed squarely at the feet of U.S. Soccer’s management, led by Sunil Gulati. The first step in ensuring that American soccer consistently performs at a level that spares all of us the kind of negative emotions generated by our National Team’s failure to qualify for the World Cup is for Mr. Gulati to resign. It is his only honorable path forward. The USSF Board members and senior management personnel appointed or nominated by Mr. Gulati should follow him out the door<br /><br />While I’m disheartened by the result of the game, I’m not surprised. Going back to the first New York Cosmos Media Day after I assumed control of the club earlier this year, I have consistently expressed my dissatisfaction with the efforts put forth by the USSF<br /><br />As a passionate soccer fan and team owner, I wish that the outcome against Trinidad and Tobago had proven me wrong. Regrettably, the team’s performance along the road to the World Cup in Russia did just the opposite<br /><br />When it comes to men’s soccer, the U.S. has never come close to achieving international prominence, as it should, given our country’s size, resources and huge pool of athletic talent. We produce the best baseball, basketball and football players in the world, but in the case of soccer the reverse is true.<br /><br />In the almost 12 years during which Sunil Gulati has been the USSF’s President, little or nothing has been done to enhance our prospects, despite the vast resources and power that he commands as chief executive of the sport’s governing body.<br /><br />Frankly, the leadership of U.S. Soccer has failed all of its stakeholders: players, fans, sponsors and those of us who have invested in professional soccer. Getting back on track requires fundamental change in the structure and management of the sport in our country, starting with a change in the Federation’s leadership. I pledge my personal support and that of the NY Cosmos to the task of bringing about the necessary reforms<br /><br /><b>[Commisso said that the federation left NASL with no choice but to file suit]</b> The NASL has taken this step to protect not just the league, but also the game, fans, and everyone with a stake in the future success of professional soccer leagues based in this country.<br /><br />Under the USSF’s divisional criteria, there are European clubs that have successfully operated for decades that would be considered ineligible for ‘Division I’ or even ‘Division II’ status due to arbitrary requirements like stadium capacity and market size</p>

  <p><b>[American entrepreneur Rocco Commisso has completed his purchase of <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> side <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>]</b> I am forever a fan of Italian football and there are no words to describe how incredibly honoured I am to have the opportunity to contribute to write the next chapter in the story of a legendary club like <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>. Florence is known across the entire world as a city that represents the best of Italian culture. In these three years of contact to acquire the club, I’ve developed a deep understanding of how important La Viola is for this city and its fans. I would like to thank the Della Valle family for managing <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> for the past 17 years. Diego and Andrea deserve great honours for saving this club from financial instability. They leave a strong foundation to build the club on</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> have no intention of parting with Federico Chiesa]</b> I will not make the same mistake with Chiesa that was made with Baggio. Roby Baggio was the greatest player ever and they sold him just for money. I don’t know if there are any particular clauses in Chiesa’s contract, but as far as I am concerned, he is our champion and I won’t sell him even for €100m. I have my dreams, we’ll take it one step at a time and see what happens, but I want to do something for Florence and <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>. I want to leave my mark here.<br /><br /><b>[Commisso is determined to retain the services of Chiesa as he has big plans for <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>]</b> I am 69 years old, but this morning I again woke up at 5.30am to start work. You never stop running here. My family left Italy as losers, we struggled to reach the end of the month and didn’t even have money to buy shoes. I worked for my older brother from age 14-17, as he opened the first pizza delivery service in the Bronx, called Pizza Time. I told myself, I am 69 years old, so if I don’t buy a <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> club now, when will I do it? I don’t have much time left and I want to really leave my mark.

Did you see <a href="franck-ribery.html">Franck Ribery</a> at the age of 36? He played better than <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>! And our two Italians, Gaetano Castrovilli and Federico Chiesa, were phenomenal.

We’ll see how we move forward<br /><br />We’ve had replays in the US for years and we have no controversy. Last night, I saw why it’s so controversial in Italy. It’s a little bit scandalous what happened to us because it will penalise us for a long time. But it all comes from a foul that wasn’t given. Why is VAR there if it isn’t used? It was the same against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. This is an international rule and it seems right to me that he was sent off.
