He also has a family and a career. It is a massive operation and it was too much. The risk that my cousin Gerard took was huge. He saved my life. It is as simple as that. I did not have chemo but the transplant had its own complications. My immune system had to accept the new liver. I was in hospital for 42 days. I was in awful pain. You do not forget that you have cancer. It is always there, in your mind, and physically I felt so weak. The support I received was amazing. One time I was at home and a package arrived from the Far East. I opened it up and thousands of butterflies flew out around my living room. It was different and beautiful. It was so humbling to think that these people cared so much</p>

But I can say also he has to, because he has a lot of talent. He is only 18-years-old. PSG have hired one of the best players of his age so he deserves a good career. But he has to work. Talent is not enough, you have to work every day. And with Neymar and other good players around him he has to learn from them. I’m French and he’s French too so I hope in a few years he wins some titles with his club and maybe in a personal capacity too, like a Ballon d’Or.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="martin-braithwaite.html">Braithwaite</a> could make his debut when <a href="eibar.html">Eibar</a> visit <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> on Saturday]</b> Martin is a Denmark international, with experience different from those players we have. He has character, strength, speed and great potential. I have had the opportunity to speak with coaches he has had. He will contribute a lot and be decisive. Hopefully, we can compete with him at the highest level</p>
