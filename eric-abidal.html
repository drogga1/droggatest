  <p><b>[Eric Abidal on Dani Alves]</b> <a href="dani-alves.html">Dani Alves</a> offered me his liver. He was serious, but I could never have accepted it. He also has a family and a career. It is a massive operation and it was too much. The risk that my cousin Gerard took was huge. He saved my life. It is as simple as that. I did not have chemo but the transplant had its own complications. My immune system had to accept the new liver. I was in hospital for 42 days. I was in awful pain. You do not forget that you have cancer. It is always there, in your mind, and physically I felt so weak. The support I received was amazing. One time I was at home and a package arrived from the Far East. I opened it up and thousands of butterflies flew out around my living room. It was different and beautiful. It was so humbling to think that these people cared so much</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Abidal has suggested that Neymar is not needed at Camp Nou, with Antoine Griezmann taking their collection of attackers to their desired mark of six]</b> We needed six attacking players and, with Griezmann, we have those six. After that, it’s the coach who makes the decisions<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on why Griezmann is such a useful addition]</b> To start, his talent. We all know this. His experience too because he’s won a lot of titles. He was a very important player for Atletico Madrid. He can make a difference in the big matches and is capable of playing in various positions. He’s still a great goalscorer and Barca need players like him<br /><br /><b>[Abidal is not all that bothered about Barca talisman Lionel Messi staying quiet on a deal for Griezmann]</b> That isn’t Messi’s role. If he gives his opinion on someone who players for another team, it’s disrespectful to his current teammates. I believe that’s why Leo didn’t want to talk about Antoine<br /><br /><b>[Adrien Rabiot had been a top target as he edged towards the exits at Paris Saint-Germain]</b> He was on our list and decided to sign for Juventus.

From there, at the sports level we can make decisions, but the whole financial issue, there are things that you can reach and others that you cannot. The future will say. If it continues at this level, because the season is very long, I will not say that it will be option number 1 but it can be a clear option</p>

He is a player we know, there are other players who also have a lot of quality. I know <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, I know what adaptation is like, but I don’t pay much attention to the player who plays every weekend, I look at others<br /><br />I am transparent with the players, <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> can tell you because last year I already told him that it was going to be like that, that we were going to look for an offensive player and I don’t say he did not accept it, he accepted it because he wants the best for the team. Today I can tell you that there is no priority, the planning will always be done, no matter the position in the field, the only change will be the decision. It may be the first signing, the second, it depends on whether there are injuries, exits, ethics, etc</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Abidal says <a href="ernesto-valverde.html">Ernesto Valverde</a> has the backing of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s backroom staff]</b> There’s always a debate about Valverde. The same thing that happened in Rome happened in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Because of one result, you can end up thinking that it’s been a bad season. And for the way that it happened. In these situations, you can think that the coach is to blame, but you have to analyse everything. What does the coach bring to the team and vice-versa? We support the coach and we give him all the information, although the day-to-day is his. There are clubs that change coaches after bad results, but you always have to look at the wider situation. If the coach sees that it can be improved, you have to back him<br /><br /><b>[On rumours of a managerial search being conducted behind the scenes as Valverde approaches the end of his contract]</b> I can assure you that no one has spoken to anyone, although its continuity depends on the result. He is seen to like to train. In the end, he can only say that he wants to continue because of how he feels. I don’t know if it will be the last season because he has the decision. The only thing I know is that we talked face to face about the situation recently. He will decide when he must decide</p>

  <p><b>[Abidal thinks <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> is still adapting to life at Barcelona]</b> He knows it’s complicated to adapt. Here the movements are different, but he’s a player that can add a lot and the coach knows that. Defensively he brings a lot and he can play in many positions. He came because he wants to win the Champions League. He knows he’s not at his best and that’s only fixed by working hard. <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> is an intelligent player and the important thing is to know what you can add to the team in the position you are playing<br /><br /><b>[Abidal added on <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> needing more time to adjust to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s unique style of play]</b> It is very difficult to handle.

He’s a coach who has shown through the teams that he has had that he has great skills. What I like most is the communication he has with his players, his way of working, his way of coaching. He is always focused on details. To compete at the highest level, the details are very important, whether it’s in the league, the cup or the Champions League</p>

If he’s got one, let him show it because I haven’t seen it. In the first meeting we had, <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> listened and in the second, he had to tell us his plan. What came out in the media was more political than sporting. I don’t do politics. I only talk football.

No. I did my job. I stuck with a couple of coaches and nothing leaked. If anything did, I did it the same because it’s my job. It’s impossible to sign a coach without speaking to him. After that, whatever leaks leaks. He doesn’t have that much experience. It’s true he’s from here. It could be his moment, or not.

He is important, and in his team he is decisive. It is good to bring this profile of player who can be in the market and can help you. We’ll see what will happen. It is logical that in summer a ‘9’ will come. It is a necessity. We know that Suarez will come back strong, but you have to bring a top player in the summer. We do not know if he will be young or experienced. We only look at the talent and adaptation they may have. We must think that some top players have come and have not adapted well</p>

But having talented players like Lautaro, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> or others would always be good for the club. I don’t see it as impossible. We will try to work for that<br /><br />It gives you a price, but the price would be the same for all clubs. not just <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. The decision is always that of the player.

We are talking about the best player in the world and having a renewal with such a player is never easy<br /><br /><b>[Abidal said when asked if fitness issues will impact discussions]</b> No, first you have to have respect for the players and what they are giving, what they gave and what they will give for the club in the future. Now he is in a situation of injury, hopefully he will recover well and from there, just talk. If we as a club feel it makes sense, of course we will enter into negotiations and he will also have to tell us how he feels because in the end it is about respect for the club and for the team.<br /><br /><b>[While suggesting that <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and Suarez will be sticking around, Abidal remained coy when it comes to the future of <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a> - with the Brazilian currently on loan at Bayern Munich]</b> Bayern is very happy with Philippe and Philippe is also very happy there.

We may wish to have all the best players, but we can’t make a mistake in the development of players. Since Ansu broke into the first team, he’s contributed a lot. In the last <b>[La Liga]</b> game, he showed his talent again. He’s a player who can play in many positions and you have to take that into account. I think the player is 100 per cent with us, with the first team, and has the goal of staying here for many years<br /><br />The information we have is that Bayern are very happy with Philippe and Philippe is also very happy there. It’s true they have an option <b>[to buy him]</b>, but we have to plan perfectly with those who are in house and on loan, and then we’ll see<br /><br /><b>[on <a href="ivan-rakitic.html">Ivan Rakitic</a>, who accused the club of a lack of respect and was disappointed by the treatment of former coach Ernesto Valverde]</b> I don’t know in what sense of respect he spoke about. For a player, the most important thing is to have minutes. He’s gone through a difficult moment with Valverde, now we have changed coach. It’s something for the coach, because I can’t manage playing minutes for a player. We have respect because we haven’t spoken with anybody, and neither has he, it seems. He said he planned to leave but in the end he decided to stay at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and if he did that, it’s because there is a percentage of satisfaction</p>
