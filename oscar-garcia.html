  <p><b>[Oscar Garcia claims <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> is the only player capable of matching the skill set once boasted by former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> striker and two-time World Cup winner Ronaldo]</b> I was lucky to be very close to him for some of his goals, I saw how fast he was moving, it was even difficult to catch him to celebrate goals, he was still at the same speed. From his very first training sessions we saw that he was a different player and that he was going to help us a lot. You just knew he was going to be a world star, and he was, but what caught my attention most was his humility, he treated everyone the same and was always smiling and joking, he gained confidence very quickly<br /><br />Until the arrival of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, I hadn’t seen a player who drove with the ball at that speed. I have only seen him and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> do that. I have been fortunate to have many great team-mates, but without a doubt <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> is in the top three</p>
