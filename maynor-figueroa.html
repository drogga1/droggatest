  <p><b>[Maxi Urruti sends reminder of importance to FC Dallas with two-goal showing]</b> Drinking mate before every game! He drinks a lot of mate and motivates himself by listening to traditional music. No, the truth is Maxi is a great player, very important for us. He’s showed that not only tonight but also the whole previous season and this one that he’s also started well.</p>

  <p><b>[the 36-year-old Maynor Figueroa on Honduras Gold Cup elimination at hands of historic Curacao]</b> Of course we were frustrated by that, and everything else. We tried to score but weren’t able to do it. There are games where you have no chances, but obviously we have the responsibility to finish.<br /><br /><b>[How to get better? For Figueroa, it’s not about mixing things up but rather about pushing even harder in the way Honduras has been pushing]</b> We have to do the same thing. When you win, you have to keep working, and when you lose, work even harder. We’ve got to keep working, getting better. There are a lot of things to improve upon, and that’s it. Keep believing, keep trying every day</p>
