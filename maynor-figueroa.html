  <p><b>[Maxi Urruti sends reminder of importance to FC Dallas with two-goal showing]</b> Drinking mate before every game! He drinks a lot of mate and motivates himself by listening to traditional music. No, the truth is Maxi is a great player, very important for us. He’s showed that not only tonight but also the whole previous season and this one that he’s also started well.</p>

  <p><b>[Los Catrachos have been to the previous two World Cups, with qualification for the 2010 tournament their first trip to the sport’s biggest stage since 1982]</b> I see it as a desire every player has because qualifying for the World Cup is the top thing you can aspire to. I’ve had the chance to be in two World Cups, and obviously I’d like to close out my cycle with a third. That’s not to say there’s pressure because practically we haven’t felt anything. But as professional players, if we’re in the national team it’s because we have goals. One of those is to qualify. That’s why we’re going, not just to hang out. We believe that, with God first, we can achieve it.<br /><br />I think in the toughest moments, when we’ve been there, those aren’t moments that we’ve forgotten not only in this qualifying cycle but also in the last one, at the end we’ve always been able to achieve our goal. We weren’t at the place where we wanted to be, but we’ve got to be very brave. Obviously, the game against the United States hurt us. We arrived to Honduras for the game against Costa Rica a bit beat up and also weren’t able to win this game, but also didn’t lose it. From there, there are still chances, and as I said, we’re going to keep fighting<br /><br />It gives us a nice outlook, but soccer is day to day. I think ahead of both those games we had really good preparation, we did what was necessary to be able to be in good conditions. We hope that happens again on this occasion, that everyone who is part of this national team has that same willingness<br /><br />We feel good playing both ways. What’s important is the form we arrive in and the willingness we have to be able to do things as well as possible. I think at the time, I don’t know if it was the conditions in the stadium but at the best it wasn’t our best and from there the United States got everything right. Starting the match, I think conceding this first goal and then the second so quickly I think cut us down, it weakened our ability but with the back five we also went and got a result in Mexico. I think beyond the scheme the coach is using, it’s about how ready each individual player is.<br /><br />We hope to be able to get a result that keeps us alive, with the dream in tact, to keep having the ability to fight. Obviously we’re in a tough spot in the table. It’s going to be an extremely tough game for us, being away in the altitude and everything, but we’re gotten good results in the last two matches there and I think we have to go from there</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico can’t overlook Honduras qualifier as grander tasks loom]</b> I think Mexico is a national team that knows how to decide matches in the moments when they have to be decided. We’ve already seen in these last few games they’ve played and also playing them several times that it’s one of the best national teams there is today. We have to look at them carefully off the field, but on the field we’re 11 vs. 11 and we’ve got to fight against them</p>

  <p><b>[the 36-year-old Maynor Figueroa on Honduras Gold Cup elimination at hands of historic Curacao]</b> Of course we were frustrated by that, and everything else. We tried to score but weren’t able to do it. There are games where you have no chances, but obviously we have the responsibility to finish.<br /><br /><b>[How to get better? For Figueroa, it’s not about mixing things up but rather about pushing even harder in the way Honduras has been pushing]</b> We have to do the same thing. When you win, you have to keep working, and when you lose, work even harder. We’ve got to keep working, getting better. There are a lot of things to improve upon, and that’s it. Keep believing, keep trying every day</p>
