I can’t describe it. I want to thank the coach for this opportunity and my debut. I am quite emotional about it</p>

Paolo Maldini has moved to dismiss any suggestions that AC Milan would sell their much-coveted shot-stopping starlet Gianluigi Donnarumma.</p>

  <p><b>[Gianluigi Donnarumma says AC Milan must harness the bitter experience of missing out on a top-four finish last season and focus on making amends in 2019-20]</b> I was upset to leave the field early in Ferrara <b>[against SPAL]</b> but I’m eager to begin the new season. It’s upsetting that we won’t be in Europe this year but as our coach and director said, we can now focus on returning to the Champions League, where the club deserves to be. We were qualified for the Champions League with just 10 minutes to go but we all know how it ended. We were all disappointed but it has to be a boost for us to achieve our goal this year<br /><br />The first day of training is always a flurry of emotions. It always feels like my first time at Milanello and I’m excited. I’m keen to begin training and give my all. We have to give our best in order to return to where we deserve to be, which is in Europe. I’m more mature even though I’m just 20 years old but I feel more like a man now, which is also thanks to AC Milan, and I feel the same way on the pitch. I have greatly improved in many aspects, but I still have to improve a lot, because it is never enough - you always have to give your best in every training session in order to constantly improve</p>

And then, lots of cheers for our gladiators at the end of the match. Let’s not stumble on cliches and old labels. Respect for Verona and its people.</p>

We are more compact at the back. We work in training to achieve this, but it is thanks to the whole team. Our goal now is to qualify for Europe. We must continue like this and not relax. We take it game by game and won’t stop. We have to win as many games as possible and then at the end of the season we will see</p>
