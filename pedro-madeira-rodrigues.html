<blockquote>
  <p>[John Terry has agreed to join Portuguese side Sporting if Pedro Madeira Rodrigues is elected president] I’m very close to presenting players for Sporting already. If I wanted to, I could present three players today. I just won’t announce them because I can’t go beyond certain limits. I’m negotiating by the penny. They are foreigners. A left-back, a striker and a great champion - all players who have no contract. I can say one because I’ve been caught up with him. It’s John Terry, a great champion, a player who does not come to win games, but comes to win games in training. I cannot pay him what he’s used to, but I think he’s very close to being our player. Unfortunately we lost Marchisio, he would be Sporting’s player if I was president last week. On Monday we lost one to Olympiacos.<br /><br />[On Claudio Ranieri] We took a step back and we will believe, a bit like the other six candidates, that Peseiro may be the solution for now, but I will continue to defend a profile like Ranieri. He won a trophy with the clubs he went through, he was recognised by everyone, he won a championship against all odds and won the award for the best coach in the world, he told me and promised that he was going to be a champion at Sporting. He is the right person</p>
