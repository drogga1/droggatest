  <p>[Gor Mahia have decided against extending striker Enock Agwanda’s stay at the club] We had agreed on everything and all that was remaining was for the player to sign the contract, however, he stood up and just walked away saying he is going to read it. He left us seated and walked off, it was disrespectful to us. The NEC decided to release him, meaning he is no longer part of the Gor Mahia family.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Gor Mahia have decided to let go their longtime target from Mathare United Eric Johanna] We were ready and willing to sign Eric Johanna but it is like he was not ready for the same. All along, we have been trying to make it happen but he fails us, until we now decided to give up on him. All in all, our tray is now full and we have officially closed the shopping for this window.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Gor Mahia have failed in their search for National Super League defender Bernard Ochieng] We wanted to sign Ochieng’ [Bernard] but he was not free to join us. So we thought it would be wise if we stop the search for now until next time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Gor Mahia have safely arrived in Sudan but minus their foreign players ahead of a friendly match against Al-Hilal] Good afternoon, we reached Sudan safely. We left all the foreigners behind because the immigration from Sudan didn’t send an email to Kenya to show that the visas were already in Sudan. I’m already working on it and they will join the rest of the team shortly. Concerning the kits I could not travel with a team not kitted and what you have seen is only for this trip. Thanks.</p>

  <p>[Judith Nyangi has explained that head coach Ze Maria, who also did not travel with the players] Morning. Coach [Ze Maria] will be arriving anytime now. The second group will be here by six in the evening. Our first training will be at 8pm Alhilal stadium</p>

  <p>[Gor Mahia have safely returned home from Sudan where they were involved in an international friendly match on Wednesday] We traveled well and have arrived safely. God has to be thanked for the journey mercies. For fans, I want to say thank you for following our proceedings while we were in Sudan.</p>
