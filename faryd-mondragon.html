  <p><b>[David <a href="david-ospina.html">Ospina</a> has been advised to consider his <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> future this summer, with fellow Colombian Faryd Mondragon of the opinion that the 29-year-old could play for any club in the world]</b> Players need game time to get used to the pace of competition. It would be better for him to have more continuity and I am sure he is contemplating that option because he could play for any club in the world<br /><br /><b>[He has, however, been called upon to put costly mistakes to the back of his mind by a man who has previously offered words of comfort in times of trouble]</b> <a href="david-ospina.html">Ospina</a> is very important for Colombia. He made only one mistake against Paraguay in the qualifiers. In Lima, after that game, I went to the locker room to talk to him. He saw me and tears came out because he was under a lot of stress. I told him that I was happy that he made a mistake because that is a good way to prove that you are human. I told him he had been playing without mistakes for five years.<br /><br /><b>[While backing <a href="david-ospina.html">Ospina</a> to come good at Russia 2018, Mondragon could see that tournament scratch his name from the record books]</b> If they include El Hadary he will break my record, so I will be sad. If he plays for the national team at this age it is because he deserves that. When you are part of an elite team at this age it means that you can contribute. He is in good shape because I saw him in the friendly against Colombia. Hopefully they will do all the tributes in his country and not at the World Cup</p>
