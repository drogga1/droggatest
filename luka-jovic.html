  <p><b>[Real Madrid striker Luka Jovic believes he was born with a natural instinct for scoring goals]</b> Sometimes I think I was just born with it. Everyone in this life has certain talents, and I think mine is scoring goals. I don’t know how I ended up playing as a striker, but as far back as I can remember I’ve always been obsessed with scoring. When I was a child, I used to have these two VHS tapes of all the goals from every single World Cup up to 2006, I think. I remember being mesmerized by Roger Milla from Cameroon at the ‘90 World Cup, and of course Ronaldo - the original Ronaldo. I was obsessed with how he did that step-over dribble against goalkeepers. I remember it being so fast, like a magician’s trick, and I would practice how to do it at home. Ronaldo would play football with such ease, almost as if he was at 30%, and I thought it was incredible. His style and confidence left a mark on me. I guess my coaches must have seen that instinct in me, because they put me at striker from my very first steps in football<br /><br />Things have happened very fast for me. A few years ago, I was just dreaming of playing for Red Star. To play in a Europa League semi-final, to play in a World Cup, and now to move to Real Madrid, it is incredible. But I think the most important thing for a striker is confidence. I’ve never doubted my worth. I just feel like I have a quality that I was born with, and I will never doubt it. It’s funny, the last time I played for the national team, one of my team-mates, Stefan Mitrovic, said something like: ‘Man, the things I could do if I had your confidence’. But for me, it just makes sense. How can you be a striker without confidence? For this position, the most important part is not the beginning, it is the ending. Same for me. In the beginning, I was born in a small village in Serbia with 105 houses, a place that you have probably never heard of before. Where is this story going next? What will I achieve? What is the ending? I don’t know, but I have really big dreams</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid striker Luka Jovic says he was inspired to chase his dream of becoming a successful footballer after seeing his sister overcome leukemia]</b> I don’t talk about this a lot, but when I was nine or 10 years old, my older sister got really sick. And this was the moment that marked our lives. The doctors found out that she had leukemia, and she was in and out of the hospital for a long time. My mum had to stop managing the supermarket to look after her. For a whole year, our family was split up. I was living with my dad and my grandpa, going to and from training sessions at Red Star Belgrade, while my mum stayed with my sister. <br /><br />It was a very difficult time. What I most remember is the feeling when I went home from Belgrade to Batar after a game. One day, while he was giving me a ride home from training, my dad stopped and picked up my uncle and my cousin. I didn’t know what was happening at first, but then I realised we were having a big celebration. We went home and I remember my sister was wearing this paper hat, like it was her birthday. They told us that she was cured. And it was just an amazing feeling, knowing that she was going to be O.K., because we had been very scared for a long time. When my sister beat her illness, it gave me a fire to succeed. I wanted to be a winner like her</p>

Real Madrid will be sweating over the fitness of striker Luka Jovic, who had to be removed from Friday night’s defeat to Atletico Madrid with a left ankle injury. Jovic collided with Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak in the 24th minute of the International Champions Cup match.</p>

I have been used to all kinds of comments since the beginning of my senior career, I have come to terms with the fact that there can always be those comments. Time will tell what is true. I’m ready to give the maximum and offer everything I can. I don’t even expect to play all of the games right away. However, through work and effort, I will reach my goal. I am pleased with the way the <b>[club]</b> have accepted me, I wish I could have scored at the start, but I am in no hurry. I know my <b>[time]</b> will come.<br /><br />It takes time to adjust to the club, the players, the style of play itself. I prefer to constantly contribute to my team and grow with it than to shine in a few games without me being anywhere. Each of us is different, adapting in different ways</p>

  <p><b>[Luka Jovic: <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> forward explains quarantine breach]</b> Having seen the situation throughout the world and in our country is very difficult, like it has been for some time, I have to speak out and send support to everyone. Firstly, I’m very sorry to be the main talking point these days and I’m sorry that I’m the one constantly being written about and not those key protagonists who are fighting the crisis, who are the doctors and all those working in health. In Madrid, my Covid-19 test was negative, so I decided to travel to Serbia, to help and support our people as well as be close to my family, with the club’s permission. Upon arriving in Serbia, I was tested and it came out negative. I’m very sorry that some people haven’t done their job professionally and haven’t given me concrete instructions on how to behave in my isolation. In Spain, you’re allowed to go out to the supermarket or the pharmacy, which doesn’t happen here. I hope that we can get over this together. All my support, Serbia, we’ll get through this together</p>

  <p><b>[Jovic ready to accept consequences of breaching self isolation restrictions due to coronavirus]</b> I broke the isolation because I was not aware of the rules. I know it is hard to believe, but it is true. In the country where I come from, and even in Italy, as far as we can see on the Internet, anyone in quarantine can get out throwing trash once a day, going to a pharmacy or a store. I thought the same rules applied here. It’s my fault for not doing better research, but I think it’s important that they explain the conditions correctly, especially for people who come from abroad. My intention was not to blame the authorities for my ignorance, I was aware that I was isolating myself, for which there is a document that proves it. My ignorance was that I did not know how I should behave in isolation. Once again I insist that it was because of the conditions I came from. Of course, I am ready to bear the consequences of my actions</p>

Now it seems like he’s a major criminal. If he has to go to jail, then he goes. I’m totally in agreement with the <b>[Serbian]</b> president and prime minister <b>[for threatening criminal charges]</b>, but only if he’s guilty. I would support that decision if he’d done something wrong, but he arrived in Belgrade and stayed at home. <b>[His girlfriend]</b> Sofia is pregnant and she couldn’t go out <b>[to celebrate her birthday]</b>.
