  <p><b>[<a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> striker Luka Jovic believes he was born with a natural instinct for scoring goals]</b> Sometimes I think I was just born with it. Everyone in this life has certain talents, and I think mine is scoring goals. I don’t know how I ended up playing as a striker, but as far back as I can remember I’ve always been obsessed with scoring. When I was a child, I used to have these two VHS tapes of all the goals from every single World Cup up to 2006, I think. I remember being mesmerized by <a href="roger-milla.html">Roger Milla</a> from Cameroon at the ‘90 World Cup, and of course <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> - the original <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. I was obsessed with how he did that step-over dribble against goalkeepers. I remember it being so fast, like a magician’s trick, and I would practice how to do it at home. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> would play football with such ease, almost as if he was at 30%, and I thought it was incredible. His style and confidence left a mark on me. I guess my coaches must have seen that instinct in me, because they put me at striker from my very first steps in football<br /><br />Things have happened very fast for me. A few years ago, I was just dreaming of playing for Red Star. To play in a Europa League semi-final, to play in a World Cup, and now to move to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, it is incredible. But I think the most important thing for a striker is confidence. I’ve never doubted my worth. I just feel like I have a quality that I was born with, and I will never doubt it. It’s funny, the last time I played for the national team, one of my team-mates, Stefan <a href="aleksandar-mitrovic.html">Mitrovic</a>, said something like: ‘Man, the things I could do if I had your confidence’. But for me, it just makes sense. How can you be a striker without confidence? For this position, the most important part is not the beginning, it is the ending. Same for me. In the beginning, I was born in a small village in Serbia with 105 houses, a place that you have probably never heard of before. Where is this story going next? What will I achieve? What is the ending? I don’t know, but I have really big dreams</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> striker Luka Jovic says he was inspired to chase his dream of becoming a successful footballer after seeing his sister overcome leukemia]</b> I don’t talk about this a lot, but when I was nine or 10 years old, my older sister got really sick. And this was the moment that marked our lives. The doctors found out that she had leukemia, and she was in and out of the hospital for a long time. My mum had to stop managing the supermarket to look after her. For a whole year, our family was split up. I was living with my dad and my grandpa, going to and from training sessions at Red Star Belgrade, while my mum stayed with my sister.<br /><br />It was a very difficult time. What I most remember is the feeling when I went home from Belgrade to Batar after a game. One day, while he was giving me a ride home from training, my dad stopped and picked up my uncle and my cousin. I didn’t know what was happening at first, but then I realised we were having a big celebration. We went home and I remember my sister was wearing this paper hat, like it was her birthday. They told us that she was cured. And it was just an amazing feeling, knowing that she was going to be O.K., because we had been very scared for a long time. When my sister beat her illness, it gave me a fire to succeed. I wanted to be a winner like her</p>

My intention was not to blame the authorities for my ignorance, I was aware that I was isolating myself, for which there is a document that proves it.

And he is sure that he is going to achieve all of that. A lot of his team-mates are talking with him and trying to help him and he is absolutely fine. He is going to demonstrate his true potential, he just needs to be patient<br /><br />He is in top shape and he feels healthy and well in every sense. Luka trains at home for three hours every day. Every morning we have a one-hour session and in the afternoon, two hours of high-intensity training, a physically more demanding workout. He has a treadmill at home, an exercise bike as well as other training equipment so we use all of that for our training sessions. We have been doing workouts that are specifically designed for footballers - thinking about the movements they make and what kind of exercise is required. Every 14 days we revise how his training sessions have gone and analyse his level of fitness</p>

  <p><b>[Luka Jovic’s father defends <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> striker after he returned to training injured]</b> He is depressed and a little scared. He was preparing at home in Belgrade according to the training program he received from the club and during an exercise, he felt great pain. Who could know what was so serious? He was preparing to be like never before, go out and be the best - and this is happening now.<br /><br /><b>[He added on how long the Madrid forward is likely to be out of action for]</b> You need to do more detailed exams to know how much time you have to be on leave</p>
