  <p>How did a 20-year-old student who tanked with just 380 votes in his first local election outing in 1999 rise to the highest political office in Ireland? Conor McMorrow of our political staff spoke to some of the people who have witnessed first-hand <a href="leo-varadkar.html">Leo Varadkar</a>’s meteoric rise to the office of Taoiseach. From meeting his parents, to visiting his old school, to tracking down the former Republican congressman who he interned with in Washington as a student, we find out more about who Mr <a href="leo-varadkar.html">Leo Varadkar</a> really is<br /><br />After Ashok Varadkar, a doctor from India, and his wife Miriam Varadkar, a nurse from Dungarvan, Co Waterford, met in London, they moved to Ashok’s homeland to build a new life. Their eldest daughter Sophie Varadkar was born in England. Their second daughter Sonia Varadkar was born when they moved to India. But Miriam found it difficult to settle in India.<br /><br />The only problem the future taoiseach <b>[Leo Varadkar]</b> gave his parents growing up was when he wanted to leave school in The King’s Hospital in Palmerstown as he did not want to do transition year.<br /><br />There is a misconception that <a href="leo-varadkar.html">Leo Varadkar</a> is the first person in his family to pursue an interest in politics. But Ashok says there was a political backdrop to his upbringing. Two of his elder brothers were political prisoners for their involvement in the movement for Indian independence. His sisters were involved in the liberation of Goa. He is eager to point out that his siblings were not involved in violence. ‘They were politically involved and they went the Ghandian way of no violence’
vNobody currently lives in the <a href="leo-varadkar.html">Leo Varadkar</a>’s ancestral home in India. But after news of Leo’s election as Fine Gael leader reached the area, the local people got together outside the house and had a procession from there for over 2km to the local Hindu temple where they had prayers for the new Fine Gael leader. Ashok Varadkar’s relatives in Mumbai held a traditional Indian celebration that involved dancing outside their home.<br /><br />Averil Power, a former Senator, studied in Trinity College Dublin at the same time as Mr Varadkar. She was in Ógra Fianna Fáil while the future taoiseach was in Young Fine Gael. Despite their political differences, the pair have been friends since their college days<br /><br />Jack Quinn was a Republican member of the US House of Representatives from 1993-2005. <a href="leo-varadkar.html">Leo Varadkar</a> was one of the students that worked with him as an intern back in 2000. <a href="leo-varadkar.html">Leo Varadkar</a> worked in the congressman’s office in Washington DC while he was on an internship under the Washington Ireland Program</p>
