  <p><b>[A certain amount of good fortune is required for a player to reach their potential. He had the potential - many saw it - but just not the luck]</b> I went through quite a lot as a young kid. When I made it, it was 100 per cent more achievement than other young lads<br /><br /><b>[The family departed Killarney when their son was two-and-a-half and then bounced between Derby and Belfast. They left the North at the height of The Troubles when McElhatton was six]</b> They moved to Derby, where I lost my <b>[Irish]</b> accent at the age of seven or eight. The biggest thing that I hate about myself is my accent</p>

They wanted me to sign before that. I didn’t bother, I went straight into work because £35-a-week in those days wasn’t a lot of money as a YTS (Youth Training Scheme player). I then joined as a second-year YTS. It was still £35-a-week with £10 travel and expenses. I made my first-team debut at 17</p>

  <p><b>[The lower reaches of Division Two (what is now called League One) was Bournemouth’s station during McElhatton’s time there]</b> I went through a time at Bournemouth where I played centre-half for a while in the Great Escape year at Bournemouth. I scored two important goals that kept them up that season. Mel Machin, when he first came along, I was the next <a href="franz-beckenbauer.html">Beckenbauer</a> to him. I was the best thing since sliced bread. He said <b>[good]</b> things in the paper <b>[about me]</b> and I was very popular at Bournemouth because I was a local lad in a way.</p>

  <p>I had a choice of playing for three <b>[countries]</b> at the time. England, I said ‘No chance’ to. Gerry Armstrong from Northern Ireland, he came over, watched me in a few games and wanted me to play for them, I said no. Then Big Jack, I had a conversation with <a href="jack-charlton.html">Jack Charlton</a>, he said he’d like me to play for the Irish schoolboys, which I agreed to do. I spoke to him at Bournemouth in the manager’s office. He had some people come and watch me. He knew that Northern Ireland wanted me. I said that I would only ever play for the Republic. The rest is history</p>

  <p><b>[McElhatton never got to play for Ireland. He was called up to the under-21s but the first of what would be a series of crippling knee injuries prevented him from wearing the green jersey]</b> <a href="chris-kamara.html">Chris Kamara</a> did say live on TV that I was the next <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>. I had a few people saying that they didn’t understand why I wasn’t in the Premiership. Everything was in the paper about me getting a call from Big Jack. It was all highlighted. Then <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> came in for me. You can imagine my frustration that I’d just got picked for Ireland, I was close to a £500,000 move to <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> at the age of 19, and then I got a bad injury<br /><br /><b>[It was a medial ligament which McElhatton damaged. These days, it’s an easy fix. Back then, medical science was still rubbing two sticks together to spark a recovery when it came to knee injuries]</b> In a way, I got let down by the manager in Mel Machin. I just felt that Bournemouth weren’t protecting me as a young player. I went to see a specialist and he said, ‘He’ll be fine, he’ll be fine, just put him in a cast for six weeks’. They didn’t give me a scan and, of course, I came back from the injury, played a couple of first team games; I think against Crewe Alexandra it snapped really bad <b>[again]</b>. I went, ‘Something’s not right. I told you it’s not right’. Of course, they wanted to quickly play me again because the money was there on the table waiting for me to go.<br /><br />Mel Machin’s went, ‘There’s nothing wrong with you. I’ve been told’. Then I had to get the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> involved, it went further. I fell out with a manager, which at the time ruined me as a young lad. I felt he’d destroyed me and the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> didn’t do me any favours. I know they had to help me out but when I went for the scan finally and it showed what was wrong, it was never going to heal. Because I went behind the manager’s back to get all this done, we had a falling out. While I was a sub, fans were screaming to get me on, to play me, but Mel Machin never did it. He never did it for a long while. I realised I was never going to play</p>

  <p><b>[Scarborough would be a drop down to Division Three but also an escape from spinning his wheels under Machin. He joined initially on loan and then permanently]</b> There were some players at Scarborough who made me feel like a million dollars. It made me sign. There was Andy Ritchie who had been at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and Oldham. Ian Snodin, his brother played for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. They made me feel so welcome and it was a breath of fresh air really. I had a great season there. People were interested. I’ve got a paper clipping of <a href="kevin-keegan.html">Kevin Keegan</a> coming down while he was at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> saying he was very interested in me<br /><br />In a way, I probably shouldn’t have gone to Scarborough - I should have waited - but I was so depressed at a club where I was wanted by the fans but not by the manager. I had a few offers to go to Wimbledon, and <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> under <a href="neil-warnock.html">Neil Warnock</a>, because we played them in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup. They didn’t let me go because we got into the playoffs. The worst thing happened, we didn’t win in the playoffs and it was too late because clubs had gone and got the players they wanted. Then Scarborough told they couldn’t afford to keep me because they didn’t go up.</p>

  <p><b>[Former England international <a href="brian-talbot.html">Brian Talbot</a> was manager and he’d tabled what McElhatton calls a ‘crazy bid’ while he was at Scarborough]</b> Rushden and Diamonds were like a mini <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>. There was an unbelievable team. They were throwing out better money than the Championship. I thought about what I should do and I risked it, I made that phone call to <a href="brian-talbot.html">Brian Talbot</a> and he told me to come down and have a look. It was better facilities than most clubs in League One and the Championship. He said he’d give me a relocation fee, you get can this house. It was mad offerings what they did for me; when you’ve got a wife and a newborn baby and she had a boy at the same time, not taking it is a risk. As soon as I signed for Rushden, I had quite a lot of phone calls saying, ‘Please don’t tell me you’ve signed’. It was quite off-putting that a lot of clubs saying they would have signed me</p>

  <p><b>[In his first season at Rushden and Diamonds - where they finished fourth and failed to gain promotion to the Football League - McEhlhatton played a conservative midfield role]</b> <a href="brian-talbot.html">Brian Talbot</a> made me into a very good player. He signed me and said, ‘Do you know what? You remind me of myself’. That’s a man who’s played for England, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and Ipswich. He basically bred me into being him. He made me into one of those defensive midfielders, like a <a href="n-golo-kante.html">Kanté</a> at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He wanted me to do it and I did do it. I got Player of the Year that season, Players Player of the Year; it was like something that I thought he’d done right for me. It was just the second season that I went, ‘Do you know what? I’m better than this. I can score’. I just started scoring for fun and realised that was going to be my game<br /><br />He knew I was a leader. They all knew that I had that in me as a player, that <b>[defensive midfield]</b> role. That’s why a lot of clubs were interested in me, doing that role<br /><br />It was pre-season that I scored some crazy amount of goals in friendlies. I went into him and said, ‘Look, give me an opportunity. I’ve got another player beside me who can do the holding role. Let me go on’. It worked. I did like a <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> role</p>

  <p><b>[McElhatton flourished in that more adventurous post. Goals flowed in the 1999/00 season with an ease reflected in his demeanour on the pitch: the jersey was untucked and the collar up.

There were a lot of clubs making big money bids for me but the trouble was Max Griggs, he was having none of it. He didn’t want the money. He just wanted us to go up. He was turning deals down</p>

  <p><b>[With the season entering the final straight and Rushden in the promotion hunt, disaster struck when McElhatton’s knee buckled. He got back on the pitch but would suffer the same injury twice more]</b> When it first went, it was basically a shock to us all - the physio, the manager. I was flying and no one thinks anything like that can happen. My determination, I thought I’d get back there with rehabilitation - ‘I’ll do whatever they say’. They should have given me the proper ACL operation first. They stapled my cruciate together. It was a new design but it shouldn’t have been done with an active sportsman. It was a rush job by <a href="brian-talbot.html">Brian Talbot</a> - he wanted me back as soon as possible. It went quite quickly <b>[again]</b>. After it going that time, then they repaired it the way it should have been done the first time. Then it took me a whole year of gruesome rehabilitation. That’s when I came back and it was like, ‘I’ve done it!’. I was out nearly one year with the first injury, came back, played nine games. It was frustrating because I only had to make ten games and I’d get all my bonuses. It was a big deal. The mad thing about it, I had that serious injury and they gave me a four-year contract after I got the injury. They didn’t just dump me. They looked after me and said, ‘Look, we’ll get you through this. We’ll get you back’. I think they realised that they might have messed up a move that I should have had</p>

  <p><b>[After finishing second in the season where McElhatton got injured, Rushden won promotion to Football League in 2000/01]</b> I went through a lot of traumatising myself, seeing the club progressing while I wasn’t playing. They went out and bought more players, bought themselves a couple of titles. It was like I missing out on everything. I was missing out on the move I should have had. Every time there was a big move <b>[on the cards]</b> I got injured. It was all going through my head but I was determined to get back, which I did. I started playing well. I went to Chester City <b>[on loan]</b> to play for Mark Wright from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I scored some crazy amount of goals to keep them up. I came back to Rushden, played in the league, and the injury went again. The third time it went, that was where the specialist said, ‘Look, I’ll repair it but you’re not playing again. There’s no way you can ever play again. You’ll end up on crutches or in a wheelchair</p>

  <p><b>[McElhatton’s tough childhood - the details of which he doesn’t want to go into right now - was an ocean he had to sail before reaching his football career]</b> It took a while to realise that my dream was gone. When I had to quit. I couldn’t talk. I think I cried for about a week. I couldn’t stop. I went through a spell where people didn’t realise that football meant more to me than most people because I had to fight hard for it. Truthfully, I struggled. I really did struggle. I’ve been told that I should write a book. Honestly, my childhood to finishing, to what happened afterwards - it was crazy. It was very difficult to take. I moved down to Bournemouth with the money I made, bought a lovely big house and then I got a divorce. I did go through a real bad spell. I went in to drink, drugs. I was gambling. I needed the fix of winning things. I became not the person I wanted to be. I was hiding everything from my daughter when I saw her. People never saw it in me because I hid everything well. I was really, really bad.<br /><br /><b>[Drinking and doing drugs]</b> was happening through my career, through the disappointment. When things were going well, I was sky high because I realised I deserved it for what had happened. Then when an injury would happen, it would all come flooding back. It’s what happens in people’s lives if you’ve had a trauma as a kid. It comes back at the worst time.</p>

  <p><b>[McElhatton, who worked as a plasterer following retirement, is now a site manager for Apollo Building Services, constructing specialised rooms in hospitals for MRI and CT scanners]</b> I’ve done well. I fought for everything. It must the Irish in me. I’ve just moved on, got better and better. I’m living in Bournemouth now. My daughter lives around the corner. I see her as much as I can. I have a really lovely relationship with my daughter which is the thing that got me through after the end of my career. If it wasn’t for her, I probably wouldn’t have carried on<br /><br />The truth is - my Irish family know it - I’m moving back to Ireland soon. I would say within one to two years, I’m planning to be in Killarney. This has been my dream. I’ve been back to Killarney and have been down south a few times with friends and family. I’m drawn back there, it’s where I’ve got to be. When I hit the turf of Ireland, I’m happier than I’ve ever been; I realise it’s for me. My daughter is going to be 21 soon. I’ve her setup as much as I can and then it’s my time. What I went through in my life, I feel there’s only one place I should be and it’s Ireland. I’ve not had the best run over here. I’ve had such a hectic life. I think if I go over there, I’ll have a bit of peace</p>
