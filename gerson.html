  <p><b>[Brazil legend Gerson says that <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> would not even get on the bench for the Selecao side of 1970]</b> There wouldn’t be a space for <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. In whose place would he play? He can’t take <a href="rivellino.html">Rivellino</a>’s spot. Nor <a href="pele.html">Pele</a>. Would he come in for Tostao? For Jairzinho? There wouldn’t even be room in midfield for him
<br />&lt;br.<b>[So if <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> could not get in the starting XI, surely he would make the bench? Not so, according to Gerson]</b> We had Caju, an enormous talent. As a No.10 and in midfield he played a lot. He was pure talent. He was brilliant wherever you put him – and he was a substitute. So I don’t even know if <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> would have a place on the bench in that team</p>
