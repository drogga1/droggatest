<blockquote>
  <p>[Cristian Romero is unsure if a deal to take him to Juventus is done] I’ve always wanted to become a professional football player and I’ve made it happen. Now I dream of playing in the Champions League for one of the four most important clubs in the world: Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester United. After that, I want to be part of the Argentine national team, even if I know it’s difficult because there’s [Nicolas] Otamendi, one of the best in the world. Have Juve already secured me? I don’t know. I don’t deal with the market and my first thought is Genoa. There’s still so many matches remaining and I want to keep playing like I am. After that, I’ll talk to the directors and my agent.<br /><br />[about facing Ronaldo and the most fearsome attacking threats in Serie A] So many people have asked me this question but I have a quiet character and, when I play, I don’t think about who I have in front of me. Ronaldo’s one of the best in the world, [Paulo] Dybala is also very good and Juventus is a great team, but I’m only focused on giving my best. [Torino striker Andrea] Belotti is the one who has bothered me the most: he moves a lot and is strong physically</p>
