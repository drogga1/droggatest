  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen’s CEO Fernando Carro does not expect young star <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a>’s value in the transfer market to decline]</b> Kai is a top player. Top players remain valuable because there are not many of them. I assume that the market value losses will not be reflected in the transfer fees for top players<br /><br />We are still happy to have him and of course would like to keep him with us for as long as possible. You have to do this but also respect the player’s desire</p>

  <p><b>[Havertz future still to be decided with Leverkusen aware of interest in Germany star]</b> I can see that many clubs are interested in him. Kai has been with us for 10 years. I see the wish of the player to take his next step sometime in the near future, which you have to respect, just as you have to respect the fact that he has a contract with us until 2022. You have to try to find a solution where the player’s goal can be reconciled with ours. At the moment nobody can say for sure what will happen</p>
