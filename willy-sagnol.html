The last time I was here in this room was for my farewell as a player. Yes, Bayern became bigger, much bigger, but it’s the culture that has remained the same. That’s the most important thing<br /><br />I think if the <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern Munich</a> wants to give me a contract all the other options aren’t that important anymore, compared to Bayern. For me personally, the opportunity to be back in Munich and work together with one of the best coaches in the world was simply the best solution for my career</p>

It means that something is missing, a <b>[naturally]</b> grown hierarchy, continuity.

  <p><b>[Sagnol reveals how German giants lost out to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> in <a href="raphael-varane.html">Varane</a> pursuit]</b> When I was at Bayern, one day a friend called me and said ‘you absolutely have to go to Lens to see a super interesting little player’. After just one half, I saw how mature he was at the time. He played as a defensive midfielder in the first half and was moved to central defence after the break.<br /><br />I had some connections in Lens and within 48 hours, I managed to get a price, with the added possibility to make a small friendly match with the receipts which would go to Lens. In all, his price would have gone up to between four and five million.<br /><br />When I gave the dossier to the sports management, I was told that it was still a bit expensive for an 18-year-old player. Two months later, he left for Real for ten million. <a href="raphael-varane.html">Varane</a> has no regrets about going to Madrid at all, I’m sure he’s super happy, but for a recruiter, failing to get management to understand these things is frustrating when you are sure you have a central defender who could have stayed at Bayern for 10 to 12 years!</p>

You are deep in disappointment, in your world.<br /><br /><b>[Sagnol added that he found it difficult to accept <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>’s apology and also joked that he smoked 250 cigarettes in ten minutes immediately after the defeat to Italy]</b> I did not want to accept his apologies, or talk to him. Now was not the moment. I had to go to the bathroom, smoke 250 cigarettes in ten minutes. This is how I escaped<br /><br /><b>[However, Sagnol revealed that he and <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> eventually managed to make up]</b> We did not speak for almost two years. In 2008, after the European Championship, I had to get married. My wife told me to invite him. I called him but he couldn’t come to the party at night, but it made me happy to see him arrive for the morning. We had an aperitif together</p>

He’s had a lot of problems at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and with the national team<br /><br /><b>[Sagnol even went so far as to suggest an alternative to Sane, who had been on the brink of signing for Bayern last summer before his Community Shield injury against Liverpool]</b> We’re talking about a cost of €80 million (£72m/$89m). In that case, I would prefer to put another €20m down and sign Kai Havertz</p>
