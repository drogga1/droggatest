  <p><b>[Katie Zelem revelling in her role as United’s women continue flying start]</b> It’s been extraordinary to be honest. At Juventus that’s a huge club too and when I went over there they gave everything to the women’s side. Then I thought not much can top that. But Man Utd have proved me wrong, they’ve given us everything and we’ve trained at Carrington, we’ve got all the staff, we’ve got all the facilities, we’re playing in Leigh, we couldn’t ask for much more.<br /><br />I feel like I’ve had experience of it before because Juventus was a new team, but we’ve all clicked really naturally and really quickly actually, the staff and the players. Don’t ask me how because I couldn’t ask another team to do it but it’s just happened how it has and it’s worked well for us. Casey’s excellent. I played with Casey as well so I already knew what kind of person she was and that kind of brought me here as well, not just Casey but Willie as well - they really complement each other. He’s won this league with other clubs so he’s got a lot of experience to bring. So they complement each other well, and so far our training sessions have been a really high standard and I think that’s shown on the pitch<br /><br />I think there’s a lot of external expectation, but from inside we know what we’re capable of and we’re just trying to achieve our potential. I think the 12-0 hasn’t helped really but being Manchester United anyway everyone wants to beat you, especially with us coming into the second division. I think that there’s a lot of press and coverage around that, but we can’t control that so we just play how we do and hopefully the run can continue<br /><br />The fans have been unbelievable, against Sheffield United it was raining and there were still 2,000 there, that’s more than most of the top division as well. But the near-5,000 when we played Reading <b>[in the League Cup]</b> was obviously a record and for me it’s amazing to see the little girls. That’s why I like to spend time with them at the end, because I’ve been there and there’s not been this when I was younger, so for me to just say hello and sign a programme means a lot to them, more than you can imagine. So hopefully that inspires them to be like us one day. It might sound cliched but that’s a big part of the women’s game. We want to inspire and we want to bring the younger generation through</p>

  <p><b>[Casey Stoney has led Man United’s women’s team to success in their first season]</b> She’s had such high standards from the minute we came in. She even had us doing the Yo-Yo Endurance Test with three days left of the season. But that’s Casey all over as a manager and as a person, she’s great to have around and she demands high standards but that’s what we need. We’re quite a young, inexperienced squad but for Casey to drive those standards up is what we needed this year and going into next year.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> captain Katie Zelem has labelled <a href="casey-stoney.html">Casey Stoney</a> as ‘one of the best managers’ she has worked under, adding that she ‘works too hard’]</b> Casey’s one of the best managers I’ve worked under. Because she’s so recent out of the game, she has a better understanding. Little things off the pitch she deals with so well and because she’s been there herself, it just makes it so much easier for her to understand the situation. She takes on a lot of work herself, but she’s a good manager and a good coach and you really don’t find that very often<br /><br /><b>[It’s not a case of <a href="casey-stoney.html">Stoney</a> becoming very hands-on since the club were promoted to <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Women’s Super League last year either]</b> Casey will never change, no matter what team she’s working with. She’s the first person here and the last person to leave. Whether we’re playing <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> or we’re playing a friendly, she prepares the same for every game and you could ask anyone, not just me, she works too hard, to be honest. She never leaves. She gives everything to the team to make sure we’re the most prepared and she doesn’t ever want to let us down<br /><br /><b>[<a href="casey-stoney.html">Stoney</a>’s players speak highly of her player-management abilities and Zelem is no different]</b> I think I’ve been at that point since I met Casey. I think I’m probably one of the only people that would dare to challenge Casey, sometimes I get some dirty looks but I’ve learnt to handle it. But Casey’s a new coach and she wants people to challenge her because she wants to become better. I think that she likes that we challenge her and her staff challenge her and that helps her improve. And maybe I’ve seen something or I’m looking it from a different perspective and she hasn’t seen that so it’s good that we’re able to discuss things so openly</p>
