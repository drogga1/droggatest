  <p><b>[Manchester United captain Katie Zelem has labelled <a href="casey-stoney.html">Casey Stoney</a> as ‘one of the best managers’ she has worked under, adding that she ‘works too hard’]</b> Casey’s one of the best managers I’ve worked under. Because she’s so recent out of the game, she has a better understanding. Little things off the pitch she deals with so well and because she’s been there herself, it just makes it so much easier for her to understand the situation. She takes on a lot of work herself, but she’s a good manager and a good coach and you really don’t find that very often<br /><br /><b>[It’s not a case of <a href="casey-stoney.html">Stoney</a> becoming very hands-on since the club were promoted to <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Women’s Super League last year either]</b> Casey will never change, no matter what team she’s working with. She’s the first person here and the last person to leave. Whether we’re playing <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> or we’re playing a friendly, she prepares the same for every game and you could ask anyone, not just me, she works too hard, to be honest. She never leaves. She gives everything to the team to make sure we’re the most prepared and she doesn’t ever want to let us down<br /><br /><b>[Stoney’s players speak highly of her player-management abilities and Zelem is no different]</b> I think I’ve been at that point since I met Casey. I think I’m probably one of the only people that would dare to challenge Casey, sometimes I get some dirty looks but I’ve learnt to handle it. But Casey’s a new coach and she wants people to challenge her because she wants to become better. I think that she likes that we challenge her and her staff challenge her and that helps her improve. And maybe I’ve seen something or I’m looking it from a different perspective and she hasn’t seen that so it’s good that we’re able to discuss things so openly</p>
