  <p><b>[Great Goals Retold: Carlos Alberto vs Italy, 1970]</b> I noticed there could be a chance seconds after we stopped Italy and started that counter; Zagallo had told us that Italy would leave their left flank open if Jairzinho, Tostao and <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> moved to our left all at once. When Clodoaldo dribbled through four Italians I started moving slowly forward. When Rivelino passed to Jairzinho it was very clear that the three brought their markers to the left. It was the only time <b>[it happened]</b> in the whole 90 minutes<br /><br />When Jairzinho had the ball on the left edge of the box, I ran as far as I could. I knew <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> would come into action. In a different moment he could have used Tostao, just next to him, but he also knew the right flank would be free. It was only that good because the ball bounced on the pitch before I hit it and the stride was perfect. I think of that moment every day</p>

He’s a guy who transmits a certain sympathy to the players, and is very knowledgeable about all aspects of the game, about football. His greatest achievement so far is returning the joy and confidence of Brazilian football as a whole. I am so happy to see that his players are interested in improving their knowledge, improving themselves as players, desperate every day to add something to their game</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Alberto Parreira gave his observations of the competition]</b> You can’t compare different eras of the game and say, ‘it was a more beautiful game before’ or ‘it was more tactical before’. There’s no such thing as more beautiful football or uglier football. Football changes. Possession of the ball is no longer a must. The teams were more concerned with playing in smaller spaces, in staying compact and getting into the opposition half as quickly as possible, and they won as teams, with individual talents playing for their teams</p>
