  <p><b>[Great Goals Retold: Carlos Alberto vs Italy, 1970]</b> I noticed there could be a chance seconds after we stopped Italy and started that counter; Zagallo had told us that Italy would leave their left flank open if Jairzinho, Tostao and <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> moved to our left all at once. When Clodoaldo dribbled through four Italians I started moving slowly forward. When Rivelino passed to Jairzinho it was very clear that the three brought their markers to the left. It was the only time <b>[it happened]</b> in the whole 90 minutes<br /><br />When Jairzinho had the ball on the left edge of the box, I ran as far as I could. I knew <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> would come into action. In a different moment he could have used Tostao, just next to him, but he also knew the right flank would be free. It was only that good because the ball bounced on the pitch before I hit it and the stride was perfect. I think of that moment every day</p>

He’s a guy who transmits a certain sympathy to the players, and is very knowledgeable about all aspects of the game, about football. His greatest achievement so far is returning the joy and confidence of Brazilian football as a whole. I am so happy to see that his players are interested in improving their knowledge, improving themselves as players, desperate every day to add something to their game</p>

  <p><b>[Brazil were favourites to take the title]</b> I think we’ll arrive at the Copa with a team that is settled. There are always changes during the competition, but for the quality we have, for what the team is showing, it’s not just us who say that Brazil are favourites - the whole world is calling Brazil ‘super favourite’. To win a World Cup you need, in addition to team, players that make a difference, and we have those. Only Brazil are capable of recovering from such a defeat, from what happened in 2014, to go from hell to heaven, arriving at a World Cup just three years later as a super favourite - only Brazilian football with its potential and wealth could have done what we’re doing now. A year ago, I dared to say that we have the best attack in world football at the moment: Neymar, Coutinho and Gabriel Jesus. Nobody has three players like this, who can improvise and decide games. So I think Brazil are in Russia as the super favourites. And we still have Roberto Firmino and Douglas Costa to come in, too, which is a hugely beneficial with a coach like Tite who has done so well to balance the defence and attack. It does not mean that we will win the World Cup. It is a short, treacherous competition, and the best team does not always win, but we have everything we need to lift the hexa.<br /><br />Last year, I went to give a talk to coaches at UFEA. Wales coach Chris Coleman said, ‘Gareth Bale told me that Casemiro was Real Madrid’s most important player, because he gave the team balance. With Casemiro there, Luka Modric can go, Bale can go, because Casemiro protects the team behind the midfield<br /><br />Paulinho has a fundamental quality: He is the player that spring forward as a surprise and that is why he is so often unmarked. He scored three goals against Uruguay in Montevideo, where we hardly ever win. He was reborn, and credit to Tite for that, who knew him Corinthians and went looking for him in China when nobody was talking about Paulinho anymore<br /><br />The great advantage of this team is that there are no world champions and certainly everyone wants to beat the chest and say I am the champion of the world<br /><br /><b>[Parreira still has no explanation for the 7-1]</b> That never happened before in a World Cup semi-final - a team conceding seven. Brazil had never conceded seven. It was the first time in history. When I was interviewed after the game I just said that it cannot be explained</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Alberto Parreira gave his observations of the competition]</b> You can’t compare different eras of the game and say, ‘it was a more beautiful game before’ or ‘it was more tactical before’. There’s no such thing as more beautiful football or uglier football. Football changes. Possession of the ball is no longer a must. The teams were more concerned with playing in smaller spaces, in staying compact and getting into the opposition half as quickly as possible, and they won as teams, with individual talents playing for their teams</p>
