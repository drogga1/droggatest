<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Mancini opens up on partnership with <a href="chris-smalling.html">Chris Smalling</a> says We understand each other with our eyes]</b> There’s a lot of reasons. Chris doesn’t speak Italian, although he is learning. It’s something that’s difficult to explain, sometimes we understand each other with a look. In football terms, I can speak a little English but he knows how to say a few things in Italian - if a man is coming over, if we need to move to the left or to the right. We understand each other with our eyes.<br /><br />He is someone who always gives everything though and that’s what I love about him. In that regard I still need to improve a lot, even if I’m still young. He is always locked in. For 90 minutes and beyond he’s 100 per cent focused. That helps me as well with the little slips I can make. But we all have a great rapport. It’s not just about Mancini and Smalling. Federico Fazio - he’s called ‘Il Comandante’ (‘The Commander’) and he really is exactly that.<br /><br />Even if he hasn’t played so much, in training if there’s something he’s seen or some advice he has he will always pass it on. That’s the spirit we have among all the defenders. We follow the coach’s instructions. He decides who goes out there on matchday, but everyone knows exactly what they have to do and that’s really important</p>
