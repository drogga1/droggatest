<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Stamford Bridge redevelopment off the table as Abramovich’s <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> planning permission expires]</b> <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> Pitch Owners is a Limited Company set up by the former owner Ken Bates in order to separate the ownership of the land where the stadium is from the club itself. What it means that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is obliged to play their football at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> until the owners of CPO, generally the fans, give them permission not to do so. It is important because that means in the event of whenever the club changes ownership, then the club’s home stays permanent. It isn’t unique but it is in top-flight football. The way it is actually structured is that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> loaned CPO the money to buy the ground and therefore CPO have an obligation to repay the loan over 999 years to the club. In return, the club get the ground for no rent, a peppercorn rent. In that agreement is the clause that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea FC</a> have to play their football on the grounds of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>. While CPO owns the ground where the stadium is located. If <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> wanted to leave <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>. CPO would have to give <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> permission to play at Wembley, Twickenham or the London Stadium. There was a permission to give for development and certainly, we were party to all the legal proceedings that were being drawn up</p>
