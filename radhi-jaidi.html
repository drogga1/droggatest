  <p><b>[Radhi Jaidi has explained how former Tunisia manager Roger Lemerre gave him direction in his decision to go into coaching]</b> As a player I had the chance to train with a lot of coaches. At Esperance, we had almost every year a new coach, apart from the <b>[Youssef]</b> Zouaoui or <b>[Faouzi]</b> Benzarti periods. I have had coaches from Brazil, Italy, France and Switzerland. It gave me a lot of contact with different cultures and approaches. There were open coaches and others more closed, aggressive coaches and others more relaxed<br /><br />Roger Lemerre gave me direction. I already had ideas before meeting him, but Roger Lemerre led me to another idea of ​​what a professional coach could accomplish. He opened my eyes to the other levels, he who had won the World Cup and the Euro, and who was going to win the Afcon with us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Jaidi also recounts the greatest moments in his career, with the Afcon victory topping the list]</b> I had a lot of emotions. I had some very strong ones with the national team in 2004, everyone still talks about it. This victory at Afcon, at home, was something extraordinary for me and for a whole people. Twelve million Tunisians remember it so far as if it were yesterday. I don’t know if I was stronger than that, to see my people everywhere in the streets, who celebrate this, it’s unforgettable.<br /><br />Whenever I come back to Tunisia, people talk to me about that. Well, I had other great moments, my first year in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with Bolton was very successful, especially since I was the first Tunisian to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I scored goals against big teams like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or Tottenham</p>
