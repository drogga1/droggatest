  <p><b>[New Rangers signing Borna Barisic has revealed that a personal phone call from Steven Gerrard convinced him that Ibrox was the place for him]</b> The club, the coach and the fans, they all wanted me and that made me decide to join Rangers. Although I had offers from England, Italy and France. After our second match versus Rangers in the Europa League, I received a call from an unknown number and the man said, ‘Hello, my name is Steven Gerrard’! It was amazing! I immediately told him it was an honour for me even to talk to such legend, and yes, I would like to join him in Glasgow. As I arrived, he welcomed me and told me to be ready to make my debut this weekend. And on social networks I have received thousands of welcoming messages from Rangers fans.<br /><br />We, as well as our fans, dream of the title and to play the Europa League group stage. We know of course, it will be difficult to fight Celtic and Aberdeen for the domestic title</p>
