  <p><b>[Cagliari Keeper Cristiano Lupatelli Urges Team-Mates To Be Optimistic Against Roma]</b> We need to remain optimistic, as we are in a great position to qualify for Europe next season. We may have conceded eight goals in two games, but this can happen from time to time, so we just have to remain focused on the job at hand. The coaches are going to have to be careful where they place the midfielders especially, as we know how strong Roma are in that position<br /><br /><b>[The ‘keeper made a few final comments regarding his future with the Rossoblu and his lack of opportunity over the past 18 months]</b> My contract is soon to expire, and I have already been in contact with the leaders of the club, but there is nothing more to say for now. I am playing with a wonderful group of people in a wonderful environment. It is true that I haven’t played much since joining <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a>, but I have a lot of experience throughout my career.</p>
