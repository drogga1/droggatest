  <p><b>[There was good news for <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> defender Robert Kovac on Saturday as he had a game knocked off his suspension following a successful appeal]</b> Robert Kovac has hardly ever come into contact with the disciplinary committee in his long career. Furthermore, his coach <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> practically opened the door for his players with his behaviour. And finally, Mr Kovac has publicly apologised to Dr Jochen Drees</p>

  <p><b>[Niko and Robert Kovac’s farewell message to <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> Munich’s staff]</b> Dear associates of FC Bayern<br /><br />You have certainly already heard the news: our time as coach/assistant coach of our club is at an end. Since it is difficult to say goodbye personally to over 1000 colleagues, and we would like to give the team the necessary peace and concentration before the two important games against <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> Piraeus and <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a>, we have chosen this way by email<br /><br />We say ‘Dankeschön’ from the bottom of our heart. You all have welcomed me and my brother warmly at Säbener Straße, were always there for us, and constantly supported us during this time, wherever we needed help<br /><br />We thank you all for many personal encounters and conversations. Winning the championship, the DFB-Pokal, and the Supercup together will remain a pleasant memory for all of us<br /><br />To all of you personally, to the club, and to our team, we wish all the very, very best!<br /><br />We naturally will continue to follow <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> as fans!<br /><br />All the best, and cordial greetings<br /><br />Niko and Robert Kovac</p>
