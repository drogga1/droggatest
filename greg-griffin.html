  <p>[The A-League clubs continue to push for more control over their own destiny after rejecting Football Federation Australia’s offer of $32.5million for the 2017-18 season] We have worked in good faith for the last eighteen months to achieve a distribution that will deliver a sustainable future for the league. With this proposal the FFA has shown its disregard for the A-League and those who have invested in it. The clubs are no longer prepared to fund the FFA through annual club losses. This is yet another example of the need for reform of the governance and management of our game and things must change now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Griffin revealed that captain Eugene Galekovic, who has played over 250 games for Adelaide, will meet with the Reds’ general manager of football Ante Kovacevic] He’s like every player that’s coming out of contract. Every player in professional sport comes to the day when your contract expires, it either gets extended or it doesn’t. Eugene is no different to Cirio, he’s no different to Jordan Elsey and we treat all the players the same.<br /><br />[Galekovic wants to play on and reading between the lines it appears the 35-year-old will need to go elsewhere to do that] He has been given an indication of where the club sees it all going<br /><br />[Griffin also bristled when reminded of comments made by Tarek Elrich] Tarek is 100 per cent wrong. We have 14 players signed and more players to be signed. We have more players signed than virtually every other A-League club. Tarek Elrich has made a statement to Fox [Sports] that has no foundation in fact, and I’ll be addressing that with Tarek when I see him<br /><br />There has been a contingency plan but a contingency plan that hasn’t been really developed or followed because literally we’ve been awaiting the decision of Guillermo. Obviously, the last month of speculation there’s been a Melbourne Cup field of candidates that has put themselves forward but we haven’t commenced any dealings with them. But now, of course, our obligation is to get a senior and experienced coach in place prior to the commencement of [pre-season].</p>
