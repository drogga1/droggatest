  <p><b>[Why can’t <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> score free kicks any more?]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is only going through a difficult spell. There are many free kicks in a match and it is normal for the ball to hit the wall or sail over the crossbar. We have to analyse if the wall is at the right distance, if the referee is counting the steps. The biggest difficulty for a free-kick taker is the wall not being at the right distance. So the ball often hits the wall or goes over the crossbar.<br /><br />He doesn’t have to change. He has already scored many free kicks with his technique. If the ball is hitting the wall or going over crossbar, it may be because the wall is too close or he is bringing his body back, which makes the ball goes over the bar. These are some difficulties for the free-kick taker<br /><br />It’s not a lack of training. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> trains hard and is going through a difficult moment, like I have had <b>[in the past]</b>. Each free-kick taker has their way of hitting the ball. So he does not have to change his style. He has been training in that way for a long time. It is not the time to change. A big change now would affect him. He should keep his technique<br /><br />A knee injury can affect things. I had a problem in my right knee and had difficulties because of that. When I was going to hit the ball, the knee movement, with the impact, caused me pain. If he has this problem, it may be also affecting his way of hitting the ball. This problem changes some movements and the ball can go over the crossbar or hit the wall. He may be avoiding impact and pain<br /><br /><b>[At Madrid, <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> takes free kicks more suited to a left-footed specialist, but other players such as <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a>, <a href="isco.html">Isco</a>, <a href="toni-kroos.html">Toni Kroos</a> and <a href="luka-modric.html">Luka Modric</a> all strike the ball with power and accuracy from distance. However, they are unlikely to get a chance with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> on the pitch]</b> He is the official free-kick taker. He has always done it, helped his team and scored. It’s not the time for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> to choose another player. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> has always trained well and continues to improve. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> need another option for when <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is tired or in pain but, when he is confident, he always has to be the official free-kick taker</p>
