  <p><b>[Damiano Tommasi Dedicates First Goal In China To Earthquake Victims]</b> I would like to share this goal with the people suffered the terrible earthquake in Italy. But we lost in the end and it is not important anymore. In this situation, I couldn’t be happy</p>

However, all of us cheer for the country and most of all we believe in its strength; that’s why we’re supporting BTP Day (Government Bond Day) on Monday. We, as an association, will purchase government bonds, and I sent a letter to the captains of all the professional clubs to invite their colleagues to do the same. I’ve already received positive signs from many of them regarding this</p>

  <p><b>[Italian Players Union president Damiano Tommasi has voiced his opinion that homosexuality is still a taboo in football and has advised any gay footballers not to publicly come out]</b> Homosexuality is still a taboo in football in the sense that there is a different kind of cohabitation to other professions. Coming out’s to be discouraged. The fact of being identified or singled out as ‘the one who is’, regardless of your profession, whether journalist, footballer or politician, I don’t think it would be an advisable path to take. Expressing your personal sexuality is difficult in every professional environment, and even more so for a footballer, who shares a changing room with his team-mates, and hence also his intimacy with others. In our world it could cause embarrassment. In a sport in which you get undressed it could cause an extra difficulty in cohabitation</p>

  <p><b>[Damiano Tommasi to hold AIC meeting following Morosini’s death]</b> This leaves us impotent and disarmed. Something like this is inexplicable. We are waiting for more info, any comments right now feel out of place. We had a meeting scheduled for Monday, which has been postponed, but we will convene to talk about this tragedy and the issue regarding the safety of players. If in professional divisions there are certain guarantees, tens of thousands of players in the amateur divisions undergo very few tests</p>

But going to sleep in the same hotel is a thing of the past</p>

  <p><b>[Damiano Tommasi says Impossible for <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> to restart in April]</b> It’s clearly impossible to start playing at the beginning of April. If all goes well, we can resume in May or June. When we talk about football, people think we are only ensuring the safety of players, but there’s a whole world behind the team. The first to be contaminated were in Serie C with Pianese, and their kit man is still in intensive care. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have 100 people under quarantine. These are people who travel all around Italy and Europe, meeting many, many people during the course of their work. The problem is not just Italian, but European, so <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> have to behave like the European Union.</p>

The desire, not so much implied, of wanting to dump on the players, putting them in a bad light, the economic damage resulting from the crisis situation, is a fact that makes you reconsider the entrepreneurial credibility of those who should be ferrying the football system at this difficult time<br /><br />The same Presidents who would like a suspension of salaries sent their teams out to play until March 9, made them train until mid-March and still monitor and control individual training carried out according to the directives of their coaches<br /><br />The discussion of the past few weeks focused on the contestation of remaining payments to be suspended or postponed, but it never went beyond short telephone calls<br /><br />Now we understand why no agreement was sought on the technical changes to the Collective Agreement. The real intention <b>[of clubs]</b> is not to pay. It leaves us stunned, given that several teams are already sitting with their players, to discuss how to help each other at a time like this<br /><br />If the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> clubs have to meet at an assembly meeting to say they won’t pay wages when in reality, face to face with the players, individual clubs are looking for common-sense agreements, it’s very worrying. I can’t understand the business logic behind this behaviour: putting the players, the main protagonists, in a bad light, when almost everyone else is already discussing with clubs how to get out of this crisis together. It seems crazy to me</p>
