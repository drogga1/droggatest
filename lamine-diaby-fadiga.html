  <p><b>[Nice teenager Diaby-Fadiga sacked after stealing <a href="kasper-dolberg.html">Dolberg</a>’s €70,000 watch]</b> <a href="nice-fc.html">OGC Nice</a> and Lamine Diaby-Fadiga parted ways on Tuesday. Following the theft of <a href="kasper-dolberg.html">Kasper Dolberg</a>’s watch from the professional first team’s changing room, and the subsequent admission of the player, the club decided to cancel its contract with the 18-year-old forward with immediate effect. Above and beyond all sporting and financial consideration, <a href="nice-fc.html">OGC Nice</a> cannot and will not accept such behaviour that betrays the confidence that unites all the club’s employees and all the members of the Rouge et Noir family</p>

  <p><b>[Lamine Diaby-Fadiga says that jealousy was the reason that he stole Nice striker <a href="kasper-dolberg.html">Kasper Dolberg</a>’s watch last month, prompting his sacking by the club which he views as the greatest possible punishment]</b> After several days of an unprecedented media storm for me, I have decided to give myself a voice via communication.<br /><br />I would like to first of all apologise to the fans and those who love Le Gym. A lot of them supported me and showed me kindness since I made my professional debut, as a youngster from the local region who joined the club when I was 14. Their reactions embody the level of disappointment that they feel towards me and I owe them an explanation. I proudly wore the club of my childhood’s shirt last season in <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a>. I was unfortunately injured for several months and my return to competitive action was further delayed following a red card I picked up whilst playing for the U19s. That affected me mentally and my difficult situation contrasted starkly the success and aura of Kasper, my team-mate. I took it out on him without having any reason to do so, maybe a bit because of jealousy. Instead of trying to battle on the pitch to provide him with competition for places, I reacted stupidly towards<br /><br />My actions were not taken out of an appetite to gain something from it, but out of disappointment, frustration and feeling discredited. Of course, I am only 18, but my age excuses nothing. I therefore owned up to what I had done to Kasper, Mr Fournier, the Director General of the club, <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>, my coach and Dante, my captain. One by one, I apologised to each one of them. I also took on the responsibility of reimbursing my team-mate fully, which I have now done. I wish him a lot of success at <a href="nice-fc.html">OGC Nice</a> and in his career. Maybe one day we will come across each other on a pitch and this affair will be merely a bad memory. Now, I am leaving the club where I had always wanted to succeed and enjoy myself, which for me is the greatest possible punishment. I thank all those who believed in me. I hope to be able to prove one day that they were right and that I am worth more than what has happened. Redemption for me will come on the football pitch and I now want to concentrate on my passion: football</p>
