  <p><b>[Stanislav Cherchesov speaks about the achievements of the host nation at Russia 2018]</b> I didn’t want to say it myself, so as not to appear immodest but since you’ve mentioned it … In my opinion, it was the best match of the tournament, both in terms of the tension and the football</p>

  <p><b>[Scotland vs Russia. Stanislav Cherchesov, the Russia boss, has taken a different view of the fixture]</b> We are looking at our opponents, we are looking at the table and we might say that this match is for six points rather than three. Nonetheless there will still be five games ahead of us and 15 points to play for. We are not going to talk about maths at this time. We just understand that both teams have similar chances to win</p>
