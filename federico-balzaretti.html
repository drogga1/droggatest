  <p><b>[former Italy international Federico Balzaretti says rescia’s young star <a href="sandro-tonali.html">Sandro Tonali</a> is ready to play for a ‘top, top club’ amid strong links to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and Inter]</b> <a href="sandro-tonali.html">Tonali</a>, the first time I watched him, his passing <b>[stood out]</b>. His idea, to pass and to play vertical. He is totally different to <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Andrea Pirlo</a> but he could play together with <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a>. It would be a great, great partnership because he is more physical maybe than <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a>. What Andrea has is a light interior and a vision to map the field, to play under pressure and understand one or two times before other players. <a href="sandro-tonali.html">Tonali</a> doesn’t have that yet. But of course, <a href="sandro-tonali.html">Tonali</a> is a great character. His defensive numbers are very high in the league. When you watch him after 10-15 minutes, you say okay he will be a national team player for the next 15 years. It’s impressive. I watched him three years ago, he is very young. It’s unbelievable. He is an incredible player. He is ready to play for a top, top club in Europe - if it’s <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, Inter, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, I don’t know, it doesn’t matter. He is ready for the next step<br /><br />It’s very important to keep the best player, of course. But also, there is the financial part, which is sometimes more important because if you have a big debt, you have to sell, sometimes the management doesn’t want to sell but they need to. When you need to sell, the offer comes for the best player you have. Clubs aren’t stupid. They don’t want to buy your worst player, they want your best player. Sometimes you need to.<br /><br />The problem is not to sell this kind of player, maybe it’s a problem, but the first thing is to have a good balance financially. You have to be stable. You don’t need to sell players, <a href="nicolo-zaniolo.html">Zaniolo</a> or someone else. This is the goal for this kind of club for me. Sometimes, you don’t want but if you have less €100 million, you need to sell because if not, <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> will kill you.<br /><br />If you want to win the league, be stable in the Champions League, compete with the best clubs, you have to keep your best player. If they are young, like <a href="nicolo-zaniolo.html">Zaniolo</a> and <b>[Lorenzo]</b> <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Pellegrini</a>, that can improve and be part of your future, of course it’s not good. But if you ask everyone in Rome, the president and sport director, no one wants to sell their best player and sometimes you have to<br /><br /><a href="nicolo-zaniolo.html">Zaniolo</a> is a modern player physically. The power, amazing power. He is fast, he kicks well, he is a very modern player. He can play in midfield, wide, he can play number 10. A complete midfielder, an offensive midfielder. His impact in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> is so huge. You have to think that he played in Primavera, so under-19. His step was U19 direct to <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and not direct to <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> to one ‘normal club’, with Roma and the pressure you have at Roma is amazing, so huge. His impact was more huge than the pressure he has. When you are special, you do something like that</p>
