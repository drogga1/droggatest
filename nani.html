  <p><b>[Nani says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> need to sign more world-class players if they want to compete in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and Europe]</b> United need more world-class players. Change something, attitude on the pitch. I remember from my time with <b>[former manager]</b> <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a>, a lot of games we weren’t playing our best, we weren’t playing beautiful football but in 15 minutes we played with our hearts and to score goals.

They must have more desire to win every battle on the pitch, every ball, every challenge because just like that they’re going to improve.<br /><br />It’s hard to do well when the past is still there. All the big names and important people who made the club achieve so many trophies, they left. Now, most of them are still around but not doing what they were doing in the past like coaching or playing. Now, they need to build a new strong team, a new strong mentality. This takes time. This has been the problem at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> at the moment<br /><br />I keep track. It makes me sad for the club, the players. It’s not the moment of United. Maybe for next season, they can do much better. As a team, they are not a strong team. They must know that. Obviously, it’s still a young team too and maybe the club need to sign some top, experienced players to keep United among the best clubs in the world, with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.

  <p><b>[Ex-Man Utd winger Nani: In England, you can be drunk at training on New Year &amp; the coach doesn’t care!]</b> I never got in trouble. Nights out at the right time, if I had the next day off, for example, then I could have some fun. Or on special days like Christmas or New Year - no one in England cares about that. On New Year, we could even go to training drunk and the coach didn’t care about it. That’s the side of <b>[Sir Alex]</b> that knew how to deal with the players and have the perception to say ‘this day is special, I can’t make demands’. We had been playing non-stop all year long. If one day <a href="wes-brown.html">Wes Brown</a> gets drunk, what are we going to do? It was a joy, a moment of relaxation, a different kind of training - clowning around. I won’t lie, I liked nights out. But now I avoid them because to be able to play at the highest level you have to drop the nights out and know the right time to enjoy yourself. That is basically what I do</p>

  <p><b>[Nani lifts lid on <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> exit &amp; how Red Devils blocked <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> move at last minute]</b> The Sporting move happened after the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, where I returned to Manchester and there was a change of coach. It was <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a>. The year before we had changed too, it was <b>[David]</b> <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a>. When Ferguson left, I also wanted to leave. I thought it was the right time because things had happened that had not made me happy<br /><br /><b>[When asked for a specific example]</b> The Champions League final - I thought I should have played as a starter in a year in which I had featured all season long. I was the best player in the team, had been in great form and when the decisive moment came, which was to play the Champions League final, they didn’t opt ​​for me and left me on the bench. That struck me. I thought I should try to find another club, in another league maybe. It was fixed in my head. But it wasn’t easy, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> weren’t going to let me go anywhere that easily.<br /><br />Unfortunately I had an injury after signing <b>[the new contract with <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in 2013]</b> and I knew I had no chance of going to any other club. A thousand and one proposals came in for me but the club thought that by renewing my contract it was all settled. I said ‘okay’<br /><br />When I say five million it’s a figure of speech, I didn’t get to those figures. After a while, I thought that by them doing that to me, I really did have to leave. When I recovered <b>[from a leg injury in 2013]</b> I was going to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, everything was alive, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> wanted me. The director said ‘yes’, the coach said ‘yes’. And at the last minute, at the last second, when the market closes, they said: ‘No, we don’t want that anymore, we won’t let Nani leave’.<br /><br />I asked why. ‘No, you’re staying here, you’re not going’. I got upset, we argued. But when I realised I was staying I spoke to the director and said to him: ‘I am here this year, I will do my best, you showed that I am valuable, thank you very much. I’m upset by the way it was done, you left it until the last second, but I appreciate your attitude in wanting to keep me because it means I’m important to the club’.<br /><br />The following year there was a change with Van Gaal arriving. In a quiet conversation with him he said he had no time or patience and that he needed to make a change. That was exactly what happened and then there was an opportunity and I went to Sporting<br /><br /><b>[That seemingly did not stop Van Gaal making a final attempt to change Nani’s mind]</b> He told me that he was counting on me, that he knew my qualities, that I was an asset. But I explained my situation to him. I recovered from injury and after some training sessions he started to see me getting my quality back and called me: ‘Are you sure you really want to go? You can see we need you’. I said: ‘No, the decision is already made, we had already spoken hadn’t we?’ ‘Yes, yes, it was just to see if you were really sure’. And I came to Sporting</p>

And there were no shadows at that time. We had a fantastic team. I played with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> lots of times as a starter.

  <p><b>[Nani wants Euro 2020 spot with Portugal as <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> season kicks off]</b> <b>[The current Portugal team is]</b> a great generation. You can see some quality from the young players from that next generation, but you know that every time there’s a competition, every time there’s a World Cup, a European Cup, you need a mix of a young team and experienced players to match the difficulty of that competition<br /><br />I say that it’s good to bring in all this young talent, to give opportunity to young players like I did in the past, but I remember in my time, we were not so much young players in the big competitions. There were more experienced players than young players. It was a mix, and that helped a lot for the team to be more strong and with more ability to compete with the stronger teams<br /><br />You cannot just say that you are playing in the USA and that league is no good compared to others. No, it’s not like that. You have one of the best leagues in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, Spain, probably Italy, and then after that, <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is not too far from others. You can compete with those other leagues. For sure, it’s a possibility, if I do well and I’m at my best, there’s a chance to come back to the national team, so I hope so!<br /><br />The moment was not good for me with the club I was representing. The coach decided that he had to do what he had to do. The opportunity was there for other players that were doing better. It’s kind of just the moment. If you are doing well and scoring goals and performing very good, obviously there’s a chance for you to represent the national team. That’s why I want to perform well with my club this season and do my best and see if there’s a small opportunity for me to be there and represent my best as usual<br /><br />If you see in other leagues, the players are important. They protect the quality of the stars of the league who make the league big, who make the league look good. The stars of the league show their quality each game, and that makes fans go to the stadium and want to see the games on TV because the game is always beautiful. When the referee is the one who is the showman, it’s not so important, the game. They have improved a lot. I have seen from the last few years that they have improved a lot, but you ask me to compare to Europe? The referees in Europe are strong, but they know when to be<br /><br />The young kids, I give them motivation. The way I tried to teach some things they don’t know yet or the way I try to motivate every player to be ready for a game, these kinds of things, as a captain, I learn a lot. I know certain things that, if I say in a certain moment, will help a lot for our team.<br /><br />The best sport in Portugal is football, and everyone wants to play football and has this dream to play for the national team. I think one of the reasons that makes this so special in Portugal is because I arrived to the national team and we won a very important cup, the European Cup. All of those stars, all of the best players that have been with the national team, the best teams we had in the past, they were so close and they couldn’t. We made a fantastic team in 2016 and we made that happen for our country. That’s what makes this generation so special</p>

We were playing everything every day. We were competing to see who was the best and, at the same time, we were improving our physical conditioning. We didn’t notice, but after all these years, we know that all of those competitions made us better<br /><br />I think the way <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> managed the club, the respect he got from everyone in the club, especially the players, everything he was saying everyone was agreeing with.

If you take a little bit about who were the players that played at our time, the age of the players, we had so many experienced players in our team. They were performing very well and they were producing a lot of quality inside the pitch and outside of the pitch. They were helping the young players to be at the same level. They were giving advice, they were motivating the players, they were helping to improve the quality of the game and giving some responsibility to the young players because we were required to be responsible very, very fast. Otherwise, you cannot be in the team and you must be away and be in the stand watching the game<br /><br />Our country lives and breathes football. I grew up just focused on football, dreaming to one day be a superstar. I was dreaming of being in the position of <a href="luis-figo.html">Figo</a>, <a href="deco.html">Deco</a>, to be on TV playing as a professional. That made me continue to dream and play every day in the street with my friends. I never lost my attention or my focus on what I was doing because I had a lot of friends that were doing different things, different roads. I just kept doing what I loved at the time</p>

  <p><b>[Portugal winger Nani speaks about his hopes to return to the national team]</b> You cannot just say that you are playing in the USA and that league is no good compared to others. No, it’s not like that. You have one of the best leagues in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, Spain, probably Italy, and then after that, <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is not too far from others. You can compete with those other leagues. For sure, it’s a possibility, if I do well and I’m at my best, there’s a chance to come back to the national team, so I hope so!</p>

  <p><b>[Nani has admitted that he was initially scared of <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>]</b> I was playing unbelievable with a lot of confidence. We won a penalty and it was <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> who took the penalties but I felt confident and <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> didn’t say anything. So, I took the penalty but I missed. The penalty would have made it 3-1 and, in the dressing room afterwards, <b>[Ferguson]</b> killed me. He said, ‘Nani, who do you think you are? Who gave you permission to take the penalty?! Ryan?!’. And then he killed <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a>, because he said, ‘Ryan, why did you let him take the penalty!’ Ryan said, ‘He grabbed the ball and I let him’. Oh my god, that day was incredible!<br /><br /><b>[To make matters worse, Nani had to share a care with the irate Ferguson after the game]</b> I drove him back home and he didn’t talk to me. I felt very uncomfortable!<br /><br />At the beginning, I was very scared of him. Like a father, when you make a mistake or do something wrong, you know?. I would see him talking with other players and I wanted to be involved but I was thinking, ‘What am I going to say? I didn’t know. So, I was scared of him until I learned to understand the language better and was able to express myself. My English has never been perfect, and is never going to be, but, at that time, it was worse than now and when we he found I could speak more with him, he started coming to me and giving me more attention.

I didn’t understand what they were doing. I thought they didn’t like me. They would just go mad at me all the time but that was because but they saw a lot of potential in me in training and actually believed in me. After two years or three years, I started to realise that, so I tried to do what they were saying to me</p>

  <p><b>[Nani lifts lid on life with ex-Man Utd star]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> was very competitive. When you’re staying in his house for a day, it means he challenges you at any time. He had a swimming pool, a tennis court and ping-pong table. Sometimes, it’s just competing to see who knows who’s telling the truth, or who is right about something. Every time, there was a discussion to see who was right or who was better. The only time we were not playing was the night time, we’d sit on the sofa talking and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> would just disappear <b>[to bed]</b>.

Fantastic moments and great memories we have<br /><br />I’d not let it affect me as my focus was not on there but, after, when I had more responsibility in Manchester, when <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> left, at the beginning it was a little bit difficult. There were a lot of comparisons and it looks like you need to prove yourself every time, to do the same or as good as him, when you are a different player. When you arrive, people in the stadium, all the fans, they love you because they saw something different in you. They like that difference but, after they create something in their minds that he needs to be the other <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, or the new <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. For those moments it was a little bit difficult but, very fast, I learned how to protect myself and distract myself from that. I had great moments in Manchester. I enjoyed so much my football there. I had some injuries in the middle and several moments that didn’t allow me to perform consistently for as long as I wanted. But I’m still very happy for everything I did in that club, all the fantastic players I played with, the coaches, all the staff I met in that great club</p>

Some days he <b>[<a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> was telling us openly ‘I’m here six or seven years now, I think it’s enough for me’, he said that a couple of times.

It will never be the same after leaving <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to play for another club. It’s not the same. As a club, as a structure, the quality: everyone knows that. I’m not offending anybody. Everyone knows that: that’s why <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> is <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, all over the world. It was great to come back to Sporting because I came back home, close to my family and my friends. It was good to breathe a little bit, to recover and get some energy back and motivation, to find a new challenge. To tell the truth, it was a great season for Sporting for me that year. I played very well and in the Champions League I scored a couple of goals. I enjoyed the football a lot in that time</p>

We knew the times to play together, to respect each other. When we had to enjoy it together as well. We used to do celebrations because we never had a day off, our boss was a very hard person. At Christmas or someone’s birthday, or <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> Foundation galas, they were our opportunities to be together, drink a beer and sing. I remember a great moment at a Christmas party where I remember <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a> singing, drinking his beer. Then I had to sing as well and improvise something. I think sometimes I can rap a little bit and Rio was pushing me a lot to do that. I was doing it in English, so imagine that. My English is horrible!

We all know we want to change the world, we want a better world, in which people look to each other without any difference, with no discrimination for colour or nationality and I think the decision at the beginning of the game and the performance from everyone was beautiful. It’s emotional for those there and I felt it for a couple of moments and I started thinking that everyone in the world should stop for a minute and start thinking about their attitudes and to see what we all can do to make a difference in the world. We must think about our children and the future for them, to teach them to behave, to be a better person and to create a better world.</p>
