  <p><b>[Bill Hamid on his father]</b> My father would always, always, always bring us out here - he loved to come to DC United games. Usually we’d have a youth soccer game the morning of, and then after that we knew we would be going to a DC United game, so we were always psyched up, it would give us that energy to play the game. Then we’d get out here, take the truck, open the trunk, listen to music, set up two goals, and me and my cousins and team-mates would go at it. They would always set up a huge barbecue. You could get a burger, a hotdog, however many you wanted. Then we’d follow the crowd and march on into the stadium. It just meant a lot to me. And from then on I was like, ‘Man, I really wanna play for DC United one day’</p>

  <p><b>[DC United defense entering 2017 with new options]</b> That’s been a part of our identity - having a sound defensive effort, keeping the scoreline low and building off of that. I’m happy that those guys are coming back, I’m happy that I have those guys in front of me - they make my job that much easier.</p>

  <p><b>[Bill Hamid overcomes injuries to regain place as top USMNT goalkeeper prospect]</b> It made it exciting. It was an interesting prospect because there was a little screen in the locker room that showed us the score of the previous game so we kept up with what was going on. The pregame team talk was based around winning and winning big, and thank God we did.<br /><br /><b>[Hamid, fighting back emotions as he pondered what the moment meant to him]</b> It means everything to me to play for the country that I was born in. It means everything to me to represent a team that has had so many amazing goalkeepers throughout the history of the U.S. men’s national team. For me, the objective that we had going into this game, we accomplished it. A clean sheet was number one on that objective. This really means everything to me<br /><br /><b>[Hamid said of overcoming his recent injuries]</b> It was made easier by people around me that care about me a lot. Ben Olsen, Zack Thornton and Dave Kasper. They’ve shown that they care about me a lot and they’re willing to help me and be there for me. I’m grateful for that. I’m grateful for having people that care about me and know that I have the ability. Their trust in me helped me along the way, through the injuries, and thankfully I kept pushing. Now I’m healthy, and I feel good<br /><br />I’ve been patiently waiting for the opportunity. It’s been years that I haven’t had the opportunity. Obviously there was another country interested in me, but I know where my heart is</p>

  <p><b>[Solid loan stint has Matt Miazga eyeing Chelsea first team and World Cup spot]</b> <b>[Miazga’s]</b> path is amazing. He’s growing, you can tell. The first day of camp he was sharp even though he came off the offseason. He was playing really, really well. I went up to him at the end of the first session. I said, ‘Yo Miazga, I see the Dutch system is making you clean with the ball at your feet.’ He’s pinging the ball left and right and I can tell that is something he’s learned over there.</p>

  <p><b>[DC United goalkeeper Bill Hamid will be leaving the club after the 2017 MLS season]</b> I want to push myself and see how far I can go because I know I have the work ethic and the hunger to take myself very far in this game. I know I can make it to the next level.<br /><br /><b>[Hamid, who will turn 27 next month, said an announcement on his next club could come within the next two days]</b> I think you are going to find out in the next 48 hours. I am extremely excited for what’s next. It’s a big opportunity. It’s a big steppingstone to what can come later on in my career. I want to see myself continue to grow and continue to get better and be the number one for the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Europe-bound Hamid bids quiet farewell to D.C. United as RFK Stadium takes center stage]</b> To walk out, to see the crowd, to see the upper bowl have a few butts in the seats, it was kind of cool. Unfortunately they didn’t get the win, but you can see that people bought into it and they have the passion for the sport here and it’s going to be interesting moving into a new stadium. I think it’s going to be a sweet transition.<br /><br />Part of it is the fact that I’ve never lived anywhere else in my life. Am I choosing the right <b>[club]</b>? I had options where I’d be a No. 2. I didn’t like that. I was going to be a No. 2 at Frankfurt. I don’t know if I would have preferred that. But this is an opportunity for me to walk in and be a starter and continue playing, which is important<br /><br />I did find it a little difficult to solidify a national team spot playing here. I think it is the right thing to move away and try to take the next jump. And hopefully, if I can take another jump from there within the next year or two, then I can solidify that spot and be a part of that three <b>[U.S. goalkeepers]</b>. I was always in and out, got some caps here and there, but I want more. I want to push myself for more<br /><br />I think the strongest imprint that I want to have is that I was a young man from this neighborhood that had the dream, because he came to this team and he was accepted into this D.C. United family. And he made the most of that opportunity</p>
