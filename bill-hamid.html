  <p><b>[Bill Hamid on his father]</b> My father would always, always, always bring us out here - he loved to come to DC United games. Usually we’d have a youth soccer game the morning of, and then after that we knew we would be going to a DC United game, so we were always psyched up, it would give us that energy to play the game. Then we’d get out here, take the truck, open the trunk, listen to music, set up two goals, and me and my cousins and team-mates would go at it. They would always set up a huge barbecue. You could get a burger, a hotdog, however many you wanted. Then we’d follow the crowd and march on into the stadium. It just meant a lot to me. And from then on I was like, ‘Man, I really wanna play for DC United one day’</p>
