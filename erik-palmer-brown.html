  <p><b>[Erik Palmer-Brown was napping Sunday when his phone rang with a call from Sporting Kansas City executive Brian Bliss]</b> I was still asleep and I was like, ‘What? I’m moving tomorrow - I can’t fly out. He was like, ‘Well they called us, they need someone and you’re going in’.<br /><br />You have a blast just meeting all of the Homegrown guys. Being able to play in this game, it’s really fun to be involved in All-Star week and just take part of it. … It’s cool to play with the guys that have the same dreams and aspirations as you<br /><br />It’s really important to get games, and it’s really fun to be out there at Children’s Mercy Park playing in front of the home fans. It doesn’t come often for young players, so when you get to play you hope to take advantage of it and never look back</p>

  <p><b>[When Erik Palmer-Brown moved to Manchester City it was no mystery that a loan and not the first team would be in his immediate future. Asked by the team’s website what his goals for the loan move are]</b> To win. To be a team player and do whatever the team needs from me. That’s my ambition.</p>
