I think Jose wanted that, too, and although he was able to do so in 13th place, he had a chance on a fantastic team like Chelsea. I was in fourth place! I still do not blame him.

I was convinced of it and by winning trophies in four countries, I proved the philosophy worked. But my legacy is bigger than just my results. I am also a relations coach, not only with my players but everyone in a club. It is not my image but I am very human in that way. At Manchester United there were more than 40 people in the performance department. The medical department, the fans. They all had a heart for the club.

  <p><b>[Louis van Gaal has questioned the spending power and appeal of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> The problem begins with, of course, that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> was never refreshed. I think when you are a manager you have to refresh every year to keep the team-building process going.<br /><br /><b>[Van Gaal added on his transfer frustrations]</b> I didn’t always get the players that I want. That’s the problem. There is <a href="edward-woodward.html">Ed Woodward</a> and his right hand is <b>[head of corporate development]</b> Matt Judge. Judge I met once in a while but not too much. And there was the head of scouting. That was the structure but you are always dependent on <a href="edward-woodward.html">Woodward</a> and Judge. I thought always <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> can buy every player because they have a lot of power.

  <p><b>[Louis van Gaal takes aim at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> legend <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> despite making him his captain]</b> I’m sorry but he was over the hill. But in spite of that he was one of my best players.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on why he made <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> skipper]</b> You can say nothing about his professionalism as a player in the training sessions or on a pitch. Outside the environment of the training pitch and the stadium is different. I made him my captain because I want to control that life outside<br /><br />This is significant that I have to think a lot. <a href="luke-shaw.html">Luke Shaw</a> was starting very well but he was kicked out <b>[badly injured]</b> by <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>. Shaw was above average. <a href="ander-herrera.html">Ander Herrera</a> was above average. He started not so well but he became more important for the team because of his inspiring behaviour and coaching qualities. I think that overall <a href="daley-blind.html">Daley Blind</a> was my most consistent player with high qualities for building up the play. <a href="juan-mata.html">Juan Mata</a> was also a quality player with a lot of creativity and I was very happy with him because we had a big lack of creative players. That’s why we played that, in your eyes, ‘boring football’. We did not have too many creative players to increase the tempo of the ball and to use more vertical passes. But it was better than parking the bus, I think. We played there <b>[points to the opposition half]</b>. We were mostly always better than our opponents, but, when your opponent is parking the bus, you need creative players. That’s why I allowed <a href="angel-di-maria.html">Angel di Maria</a> and <a href="memphis-depay.html">Memphis Depay</a> to come because they were creative players and I think a team needs at least three or four creative players to break down those opponents.<br /><br /><b>[Van Gaal added on the problems he faced in bringing the required quality in]</b> In scouting players, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> don’t have the organisation to deliver the best players in my opinion. Then with the education of players, you cannot say that the education of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is very good. How many players are coming through? With <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, you have a fantastic performance department and that is under the guidance of the doctor. But this performance department needs also the guidance of an experienced technical director. You have to use that department not only for the first team but also intensively for the youth education. Then young players are more educated in the philosophy of Man United and the big step to the first team is much easier. These are the important aspects that you have to develop as a technical director</p>

  <p><b>[Van Gaal blasts clubs trying to use coronavirus for their own benefit]</b> If it is established that the coronavirus has been defeated, you first have to finish the current competition. Sport is there to designate a winner on the field. Not to say after 25 matches we cut things off and <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> is champion. It doesn’t matter that <a href="az-alkmaar.html">AZ</a> has the same number of points in three quarters of a competition? That is nonsense. Anyone who is an athlete understands what I mean.<br /><br />I also find it outrageous how the health issue is used in the discussion about ‘playing out or quitting’. The whole of the Netherlands adheres to what RIVM (Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) prescribes. They are the specialists. But while the government has also been following the experts for weeks, some football clubs suddenly say that it is not possible - <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> first.<br /><br />Who doesn’t want to play out? Check it out - clubs that are now in a European position, with the exception of Feyenoord, and clubs in the relegation zone. Clubs that misuse this corona crisis for their own gain and then make it a public health statement; I’m a man who can’t take that. If it is allowed by the experts of the RIVM, I actually hope that the middle bracket of the division can ensure that the competition is completed.<br /><br />You can also play the season out in June or July. There is plenty of time this summer, the European Championship is off the calendar. And if <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> and <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> are willing to change rules and provide space, well then get started. And next season the league then gets a bit thicker, through more week-day duels. It can be great in the load of players, because in these weeks they are now unintentionally resting.</p>
