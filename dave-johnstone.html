<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Dave Johnstone has been left just as bemused by Sarri’s stubborness]</b> Sometimes at Stamford Bridge it seems like the 40,000 people in the stands are better players than those on the pitch and sometimes it seems like they are better managers than the man in the dugout. The same goes for the 100 million online. But I don’t think it is easy to run, play for or manage Chelsea. Abramovich has been there for 15 years. If you are a 25-year-old fan, then you are not used to seeing struggle but football is about struggle. The fans do deserve to hear their voices heard, though, particularly those who have been following the club through thick and thin for years. And a lot of people who have seen even more of Chelsea than me say that this is one of the more bizarre managers that we have ever had. He is so inflexible. I don’t think everyone at the club is on board with him. He cuts a sorry figure. I do think it will be hard for him to change opinions. A lot of people have said to me, ‘I would be happy if we go to Wembley on Sunday <b>[against Man City]</b> and we don’t lose more than 3-0.<br /><br />If you support the club, you support them through thick and thin. Up the Blues! I will always love you</p>
