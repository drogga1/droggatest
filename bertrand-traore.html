  <p><b>[Bertrand Traore says he is not interested in Ajax fans growing frustrated with his performances]</b> I give everything to win. I don’t give a shit about side issues like that. I don’t want to speak about other people as well. Of course we feel tired as a team. We have played a lot of matches this season, so it’s logical that your legs are starting to feel that.<br /><br />My focus on this season is very important. After this season, I will see whatever appears in my path. Right now, I’m not focussed on calls and texts with Chelsea coach Antonio Conte. We will have to see what happens</p>

  <p><b>[Bertrand Traore has explained that he left Chelsea for Lyon because he knew he would not be given any opportunities to play]</b> It was time. Considering my age and for my development, it was time for me to leave the club. I could have stayed at Chelsea and played a few minutes in every game, fighting every day for a spot, knowing that I’ll never get a spot, I trained at the club, I did everything. Two seasons ago, I challenged the starters but we all know what happened last year. I was there during pre-season and then I was sent out on loan. So this year, I did not want to re-live the same scenario. It was time for me to find a stable club where I could play first-team football, where I could be one of the key players in the team. To be one of the key players in the team, you need to fight, and here, I’ll do everything to be amongst them, and I’ll give everything for the club</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Bertrand Traore lighting up Ligue 1]</b> I told Nabil that I wanted to take it. I saw the wall was well placed for me and my left foot. I regularly score free kicks like that. When I’m with my big brother in the national team, I have competitions with <b>[him]</b> over this.<br /><br /><b>[He was presented following his €10 million move]</b> I had to leave Chelsea, I would never have had a chance there. At this point in my career, Lyon were the best choice I could make to keep growing. Adaption should be quite easy here and I will have the stability that I’ve been seeking for so many years. I had to find stability by finding a club where I could play a leading role, and I’ll do everything to achieve that with OL<br /><br />Before each game, I tell myself that I have to carry my weight defensively because that allows the team to be stable. I feel good on the field. I hear the applause of the fans when I go back to tackle. After that, I must try to allow the others to play and to be decisive. I try to lose as few balls as possible, that’s important</p>
