<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Angers president Said Chabane questioned by police after sexual assault allegation from employee at <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> club]</b> The management of Angers SCO confirms that President Said Chabane went to the premises of the Angers police services on Wednesday 5 February, in response to a summons received at the end of January<br /><br />In accordance with the rules of the procedural code, he is currently being interviewed under police custody in the context of an investigation opened by the Angers prosecutor following the complaint of an employee of the club. Said Chabane formally challenges all the allegations brought against him and will bring to light all the elements necessary to restore the truth and to preserve his honour.<br /><br />Determined to have his innocence recognised, he is confident in the outcome of the investigation in which he fully cooperates. If the club management regrets leaks of fragmented and oriented information (which appeared in the press in violation of the secrecy of the investigation and respect for the presumption of innocence), the teams and the players remain fully focused on achieving SCO objectives. All the components of the club are ready for the visit of LOSC on Friday February 7, 2020 at 8:45pm at the Raymond Kopa stadium</p>
