  <p><b>[Former Manchester United goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak has revealed that Newcastle United tried to sign him on loan in January]</b> In the winter transfer window, I had a loan offer from Newcastle, and Derby also approached me. However, Birmingham said that I should stay at the club<br /><br />My contract is still valid for a year, but the situation has changed a little, because after the season I received a green light to be transferred. I am waiting for a signal from my representatives. Other managers already know that a transfer option has appeared. I am calm, if there are no good offers then I will wait for a year, then I will be a free agent</p>

  <p><b>[Tomasz Kuszczak says David De Gea was like Spider-Man in training!]</b> I trained with him for nearly a year and I remember I used to watch someone hit a ball towards the top corner and from nowhere he would fly across and save it like Spider-Man! I was like ‘wow what a guy’. He’s powerful and quick, and a top guy. Obviously you’ll make mistakes, we all do, but he has proved himself for many years. His performances over the last eight or nine years have been unbelievable. To play for a team which is doing well and is on top is easy, but unfortunately, after Sir Alex left there were changes at the club, United struggled a little bit and David was put under massive pressure. I’m not surprised he picked up the best player award for four or five years in a row because he deserved it. He’s made so many key saves and in almost every game he has been under massive pressure. I played some games for United and I touched the ball three times maybe, I had nothing to do! I just passed the ball and we won 3-0, thank you very much! David hasn’t had that, in almost every game he’s played he’s made massive saves and for me he’s an unbelievable goalkeeper and one of the best, no doubt about it</p>
