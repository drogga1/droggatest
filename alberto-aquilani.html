  <p><b>[Alberto Aquilani turned up at Anfield the following year after Alonso had departed for Real Madrid. The injury-prone Italian was plagued by injuries]</b> Maybe I should have stayed, but I wanted to come back to Italy for family reasons.</p>

  <p><b>[Stefano Sensi is considered to be in the Marco Verratti mould by Alberto Aquilani]</b> The right man for Milan? I would say yes because Stefano is young and has great prospects. In the last months, he has grown a lot. He reminds me of Verratti for the way he plays. Both regista and mezzala? Exactly. He can play in both roles in the middle of the field. As a regista, he has a very good vision of building the game, even if there is a lack of physicality. Otherwise, if one wants to build a team devoted to dribbling, he is ideal as an internal midfielder.<br /><br />Stefano is very polite and an easy-going guy, with his head on his shoulders. What struck me was his attention to the advice I gave him in training. He often ran a bit for no good reason and then I suggested to him the position to make the most out of his characteristics.<br /><br /><b>[On Gennaro Gattuso]</b> Gattuso? He was one of the leaders in the locker room at Milan, he had a great personality, so I was not surprised to see him on the bench. Gattuso surprised me with the organisation of his teams and the constant search for attack. He practises a very offensive game.</p>

But there is a time for everything. And now the time has come to take new paths, different for everyday aspects, but at the same time attractive as new challenges. I took some time to understand what was the best choice. But despite the many proposals <b>[that]</b> arrived, I think it’s time to say enough.</p>
