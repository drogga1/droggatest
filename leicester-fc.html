  <p><b>[<a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Claudio Ranieri</a> sacked by Leicester City]</b> Leicester City Football Club has tonight <b>[Thursday]</b> parted company with its first team Manager, <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Claudio Ranieri</a>. Claudio, appointed City manager in July 2015, led the Foxes to the greatest triumph in the club’s 133-year history last season, as we were crowned champions of England for the first time. His status as the most successful Leicester City manager of all time is without question. However, domestic results in the current campaign have placed the club’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> status under threat and the board reluctantly feels that a change of leadership, while admittedly painful, is necessary in the club’s greatest interest.</p>
