  <p><b>[Claudio Ranieri sacked by Leicester City]</b> Leicester City Football Club has tonight <b>[Thursday]</b> parted company with its first team Manager, <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Claudio Ranieri</a>. Claudio, appointed City manager in July 2015, led the Foxes to the greatest triumph in the club’s 133-year history last season, as we were crowned champions of England for the first time. His status as the most successful Leicester City manager of all time is without question. However, domestic results in the current campaign have placed the club’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> status under threat and the board reluctantly feels that a change of leadership, while admittedly painful, is necessary in the club’s greatest interest.</p>

None of the five people on-board survived<br /><br />The primary thoughts of everyone at the club are with the Srivaddhanaprabha family and the families of all those on-board at this time of unspeakable loss.<br /><br />In Khun Vichai, the world has lost a great man. A man of kindness, of generosity and a man whose life was defined by the love he devoted to his family and those he so successfully led. Leicester City was a family under his leadership. It is as a family that we will grieve his passing and maintain the pursuit of a vision for the club that is now his legacy.<br /><br />A book of condolence, which will be shared with the Srivaddhanaprabha family, will be opened at King Power Stadium from 8am on Tuesday 30 October for supporters wishing to pay their respects.<br /><br />Supporters unable to visit King Power Stadium that wish to leave a message can do so through an online book of condolence, which will be made available via lcfc.com in due course.<br /><br />Both Tuesday’s first-team fixture against Southampton in the EFL Cup and the development squad fixture against Feyenoord in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> International Cup have been postponed.<br /><br />Everyone at the club has been truly touched by the remarkable response of the football family, whose thoughtful messages of support and solidarity have been deeply appreciated at this difficult time</p>

Supporters suffering particular financial hardship who are concerned that they may not be able to meet the 1 April payment should contact the Club on <b>[email protected]</b>, quoting their supporter number</p>
