  <p><b>[Massimo Maccarone regrets turning down <a href="giovanni-trapattoni.html">Giovanni Trapattoni</a> to stay working with <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>, describing the now England manager as ‘big talks, no facts’]</b> I played the last seasons of his career with him and as a player he has always been correct, kind, humble. As a manager, though, I didn’t like very much what he did to me. I had already had some quarrels with his predecessor, Steve McLaren, another one who has managed England, when I reacted berating him a lot .In hindsight I understood I had made some mistakes myself too<br /><br />But not with <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a>, who talked me into staying at Middlesborough, promising I would have played a lot since he knew what had happened to me the season before. But then, nothing - even if we made seven points in the first six games. Big talks, no facts<br /><br /><b>[If things had played out differently, Maccarone could have been playing for Salzburg under Trappatoni, the man who had given him his Italy debut]</b> When I was in England he was managing Salzburg in Austria. He had called me for one month to convince me to join him there but I still had a one year contract with Middlesborough and I wanted to prove myself there after a negative season despite some sparks in the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Cup. So I stayed with <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a> at Middlesborough when <a href="giovanni-trapattoni.html">Trapattoni</a> had made my dream of playing for Italy come true<br /><br /><b>[Asked if that is a decision he now regrets, Maccarone replied]</b> In hindsight, yes. But <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a> had been my team-mate and captain for four years. He kept telling me, ‘I can’t understand why <b>[McLaren]</b> doesn’t let you play’ but then when he became the manager he truncated my career at Boro. I said no to <a href="giovanni-trapattoni.html">Trapattoni</a> for <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a> but I should have done the opposite</p>

  <p><b>[Massimo Maccarone recalls <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>’s great Empoli test]</b> At Empoli, the strikers were me and <b>[Ciccio]</b> Tavano, but he started with only one forward. So, to let us both play - we were still young at 33 since we are still playing at 40 now, but still we were not so young - he adapted himself to the talent he had. This is when a manager proves to be smart. Ever since he changed the formation, we started getting points. Now he says, ‘I have got <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> who will score at least one goal per game, so I have to adapt my style to his’<br /><br /><b>[Looking back on <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>’s Empoli reign]</b> At the beginning things didn’t work out well, but there his style was born. I think he is one of the best managers I had. He gives you a lot of motivation and is a good talker. On the pitch you already know where, how and when you will receive the ball, then of course you have to add your spin. I like <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>’s way of playing football. When needed, he makes himself understood, he gets often angry because he wants everything perfect</p>
