<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Alen Boksic has paid bizarre tribute to ex-Marseille president Bernard Tapie]</b> Recently I went to Marseille for the 25th anniversary of winning the European Cup. We were a great team and had the best president! He bought a game for us and then we even got a bonus for that victory! And in the end he got punished <b>[in jail, suspended from football]</b> and us players profited! As I arrived to Marseille, I was young and ready, and I played with Rudi Voller, who was older and didn’t have to prove himself any more, so he was not selfish and allowed me to score as much as I can. That helped me a lot<br /><br /><b>[On Ivan Rakitic]</b> Rakitic has surprised me a lot, even training him in national team, I never believed he could reach the level he has reached. Croatia have great players but they need to be more disciplined. They don’t have a leader to push them when things are not working as they should<br /><br />Take the Champions League final for example. It was decided by <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah’s injury. Sergio Ramos knew what he had to do and he never even got a yellow card! His move in the final was just as valuable as Bale’s scissor-kick goal. And without those kinds of players you can not build a champion team!</p>
