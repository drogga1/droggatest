  <p><b>[Lucy Bronze speaks ahead of the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Women’s World Cup Draw]</b> We’re good enough on our day to beat any team in the world. Over the next six or seven months, we need to push ourselves to be the best players we can be, then do it on a big stage</p>

  <p><b>[Lucy Bronze talks about her <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Women’s World Cup Canada 2015 memories]</b> Finishing third in the last Women’s World Cup in 2015 was amazing. I scored a cool goal against Norway in the last 16. It was the first time an England women’s team had won a World Cup knockout game – we knew we had changed something forever. I also scored the winner against the hosts, Canada, in the quarter-finals in front of 55,000 fans. A few years before we were playing in front of 100 people, so even though the Canadians were shouting ‘You’re rubbish!’ we loved it</p>

  <p><b>[England right-back Lucy Bronze says she doesn’t believe Phil Neville when he says that she is the best player in the world]</b> In terms of football talent and football ability, Dzsenifer Marozsan. It’s a lovely compliment to receive, although I don’t believe him. This tournament, you’ve not seen the best of her because she got injured in the first 10 minutes in the first game and struggled to get back to fitness to play <b>[for Germany]</b> against Sweden. She’s someone that I’m really good friends with and I’m gutted for her. In terms of football talent and ability, you rarely see players like that. I think the only player I could really compare her to who I played with or against is Kelly Smith.<br /><br />She’s just got so much raw talent that I’ll never be able to hit a ball like she does, unfortunately for me. But I say that to her and she’s like, ‘Yes but Lucy I’ll never be as physically dominant as you’. When I think about best players in the world, I always think about these tricky, skilful <b>[players]</b> and I’m just more of a direct, physical player. I love Marozsan. For me, I’ve watched her for a long time, she’s got to be one of the most talented, definitely.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if she will be more reserved in her attacking to deal with the American]</b> I’m not going to change the way I play. The only reason I’ll change the way I play is when I get old and my legs give up on me. I can’t imagine that Rapinoe’s going to change the way she plays just because I run up and down. I think that’s what top teams do. You need to stick to the way you play. You can adapt a little and, I’ve adapted throughout the tournament, my game’s been a little bit different every game. But I don’t think Phil will ever be able to keep me still and stood on the half way line. That’s just not me. For me, I’ll play the normal game that I always want to play, full of energy, joining in attacks, joining in defence, and working hard for the team<br /><br /><b>[After the USA beat hosts France in the last round, England’s No. 2 is hoping to have the backing of a lot of her team-mates at Lyon, who were on the wrong end of that 2-1 result]</b> A lot of people at Lyon have text me over the past two days - they didn’t text at the start of the tournament, but since France have gone, they’ve sent me a few messages! I’ve had a few messages from the last few days from a lot of the Lyon staff, saying good luck, beat the United States for us. So I think we have a few more supporters than we normally have</p>

  <p><b>[Lucy Bronze has formed a potent partnership with Nikita Parris down the right wing]</b> I just know where she’s going to be.<br /><br /><b>[It will be, by far, the biggest test of the Lyon star’s tournament – but she’s not fazed]</b> I’ve always said I love playing against the best players in the world. I love a challenge. I remember, a couple of years ago, I had a list of names that I wanted to play against. Marta, Kelly Smith, and Rapinoe was definitely on there. It was two years ago I first played against her and I was so excited because I finally got to play against one of the best players in the world. She’s still up there today as one of the best, so of course I’m still excited to have that challenge and to be able to go toe-to-toe with one of the best is the reason I play as a defender – because all the best players are attackers!</p>

  <p><b>[Lucy Bronze, a Champions League winner with Lyon barely a month ago, says that England’s lack of experience winning international tournaments will actually help the team]</b> We have more hunger than the other teams because we have never reached a final. You look at the four teams left and we’re the only team that hasn’t reached a final. The Olympics, the World Cup, the Euros, these other three teams have all reached finals in recent years. It definitely takes more to reach a final - but who better to know that it takes more than a team that has been knocked out of two consecutive semi-finals?</p>

  <p><b>[Lucy Bronze is confident that England will win a trophy in the near future, despite another semi-final defeat in the Women’s World Cup]</b> Of course it’s a disappointment, we wanted to win this World Cup, we came here to win this World Cup and we’ve fallen short. We wanted to make it to the final because we haven’t quite made it there but the fact that we’re consistently reaching semi-finals shows how immense this team is and the strengths of this team. Now we’ve got <b>[the Olympics]</b> as Team GB next year and then we’ve got a home Euros. There’s so much ahead of us and we can really push on and I know for a fact that this team is going to win a trophy at some point.<br /><br /><b>[Despite their manager saying before this game that a semi-final defeat would be a failure, Phil Neville was incredibly proud of the group, the full-back revealed]</b> He just said he was proud of us. He’s proud of the fact that we came to this tournament wanting to play a style of football. We’ve evolved from two years ago from the team that we were in the Euros. We’re now playing football and to do that in such a short space of time is such a tribute to all the players that have featured in an England shirt. The fact that we went completely 180 on the type of football that we tried to play before and now we’ve got to the semi-finals of a World Cup playing some nice football, scoring lots of goals, I’m super proud of us for doing that<br /><br /><b>[Bronze has been one of the stars of the tournament, contributing a goal and two assists from right-back, but she was disappointed with her own display against the USA]</b> I was just disappointed with myself, disappointed in the first goal, that’s not something I’m used to, I’m used to being defensively solid. No matter what people say about me as an attacker I always want to defend my player well and I’m disappointed that I didn’t do that to my best tonight. But obviously the USA have great movement and you can analyse them as much as you want but trying to stop them and trying to do it in the heat of the moment in the game, unfortunately we didn’t quite do that tonight. I’m disappointed in my own performance, I thought I could have played a lot better tonight, a lot higher level than what I showed tonight.<br /><br />We pushed them right to the edge. We got the penalty, the goalkeeper made a really good save, inches away from a goal ruled offside, but we can’t say ifs and buts. The USA won and we’ve got to have huge respect for them. We tried our best to play our football, we stuck to the way we play even with 10 men, and I’m super proud of the girls but unfortunately it wasn’t enough tonight</p>

  <p><b>[Lucy Bronze could have been playing for Portugal against England on Tuesday night if her first senior call-up had come four months later]</b> <b>[Portugal]</b> got in touch when I was 16. I turned around and said to my mum if I don’t make the England team before my 22nd birthday, I’m off to play for Portugal. My mum always just says whatever makes you happy. My dad wasn’t bothered either. But I was doing everything I could. I was playing well on the pitch and I thought I deserved a call up and it took a long, long time.<br /><br />When I was younger, it’s not as easy as it is now for these young ones. But I fought my way into the squad. England was always the dream. I knew I could go and play for Portugal and I would have loved it as much<br /><br /><b>[Despite making close to 80 appearances for the Lionesses since, Tuesday will be the first time Bronze has faced Portugal]</b> We’ve never played in Portugal and my Portuguese family have never watched me in an England shirt. My dad is Portuguese and he came <b>[to watch England play Brazil on Saturday]</b>. He’s flying across <b>[to Portugal]</b> and he’s basically taking all his family. My auntie, my uncle, my grandma and some of my dad’s cousins are coming. Obviously I’m excited for that, but it’s the same when I play in the North East. My family live here so they get to come, so I was excited for both games this week. I’m excited to play against Portugal<br /><br />We know we’re one of the best teams in the world, but the results haven’t showed that necessarily. I think we just need to be playing more games together. You look at the front three <b>[against Brazil]</b> and they all play in different leagues to each other - let alone different teams. We’ve got to develop that understanding together. It’s started to click, but it’s just the end product still</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon treble &amp; England heartbreak: The full story behind Lucy Bronze’s dramatic 2019]</b> People don’t always appreciate how hard it is to focus on so many competitions at the same time, regardless of how good you might be and the talent you have. It’s still hard to keep your focus and your drive in every single game, but that’s the expectation at <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. It’s ‘every single game is <b>[to]</b> win’, because you’ve got to have that focus to win trophies<br /><br /><b>[Running through her biggest games of the past 12 months, Bronze recalls them with gleeful nostalgia]</b> The atmosphere at that game <b>[…]</b> It’s a game I remember because I’m taking throw-ins and I’m right next to the Parisian fans and they’re throwing toilet paper on the pitch and stuff, trying to intimidate us. It’s a game that I really enjoyed in that respect<br /><br />I think they were kind of going for that feel of, ‘Oh, England won’t be used to this’, and I was thinking, well we are, because we’re not these superstars. We don’t play on Wembley every single time we have a game. We play in the Women’s Super League in small stadiums and the French league in small stadiums. It was actually funny coming to training and they’d moved the line in so they’d made the pitch smaller as well. I think they did it to try and put us off our game, whereas we kind of found it quite amusing. It just made us more excited for the game<br /><br /><b>[She says of England’s meeting with Brazil last October]</b> I was excited to play against <a href="marta.html">Marta</a>. Unfortunately, she came off after 20 minutes!<br /><br /><b>[She was similarly enthused when England women head coach <a href="phil-neville.html">Phil Neville</a> informed her that she would be playing out of position]</b> <b>[Neville]</b> told me a few weeks before and I was excited. Although <a href="megan-rapinoe.html">Megan Rapinoe</a> and Tobin Heath play on the wing, they come in a lot, so I was involved <b>[with]</b> all of their best players. It was exciting<br /><br /><b>[As for the thrilling Champions League quarter-final against Wolfsburg, which eventually finished 6-3 on aggregate to Lyon]</b> That was a lot of fun. I remember the first leg we played at home in our big stadium and our first half was amazing, but we kind of blew up a little bit in the second half and their second half was amazing! The away game was just crazy. We started off on fire, we got the away goals, they came back after half-time with two more goals and then it ended up 4-2 or something. I enjoy playing against <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, I enjoy playing against Wolfsburg, because they’re the top teams that challenge you<br /><br /><b>[it was frustrating for Bronze to see people questioning the competitiveness of the Champions League final – in which <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> beat <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> 4-1, scoring all of their goals in the first half an hour]</b> <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are a really good team. We struggled against them last year in the Champions League. We respected them and we were prepared. I think maybe playing them the year before made us even more focused, because we knew we had to play well to beat them. We were so focused and so honed in that it just clicked. Everything went together and within that first 25-30 minutes, it was game over, game done, job done, get through the 90 and pick the trophy up<br /><br />Every time I see a VAR decision in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I just think of <a href="ellen-white.html">Ellen White</a>’s offside goal by this much. That’s the reason we weren’t in the final. Yes, it would’ve made it just 2-2 but I think in the dying moments of the game, we were kind of on top. They’re a top team, world champions twice now, twice in a row, but I think that’s a game that is going to haunt me for the rest of my life because of those little things that didn’t quite go in our favour. It was slight margins. We ended up finishing fourth and they were first, but the game that we actually played against each other… Literally this was the difference<br /><br /><b>[Bronze was recognised handsomely in the aftermath]</b> I don’t enjoy winning individual awards. The Silver Ball kind of came with no meaning for me, because the whole point of winning those awards is winning the World Cup. Ultimately, I would trade every single one of those awards, every award I have at home, just to win the World Cup</p>

It’s pretty special (being voted by the public) and quite amazing. All the girls that have been nominated are global superstars. I look at the list now and think everyone knows who these girls are so that’s pretty special.<br /><br />Winning the first time was a surprise - and it is now - but to win a trophy twice is really special as it’s so much harder, to stay at the top level is so difficult, it’s not something that’s easy and I don’t take it for granted one bit<br /><br /><b>[She said of the Covid-19 pandemic]</b> The players have been given some time off and all been told to stay in our homes and that’s what I’m doing the majority of the time. I’m now home in England, I’ve got my dog here and I’ve two girls who live with me in my house so we’re doing things to keep fit. I have been sent a fitness programme from the club.

I was pleased with my performance and we put on a real good show for women’s football. The World Cup hit me hard (losing in the semi-finals) but it’s motivated me to do more. I’m really proud in my career the fact there was a time I had to pay to train on a pitch twice a week to now the heights of being paid to play in another country, winning the Champions League, playing at Wembley. To see where women’s football is now, I would never have dreamt about it when I was first getting in to football when I was 12 years old. It’s part of the reason I don’t want my career to end with the buzz that’s around women’s football</p>

In women’s football especially, I don’t think that we see that as a difference, whether it’s a male of a female manager. If they know what they’re doing on the pitch and they can make us a better team, then bring them in and let’s go and win something</p>
