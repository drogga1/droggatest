Gary was an inspirational and much-loved player at Newcastle United during his time with the club from 1998 to 2004, making 285 appearances and scoring 40 goals. He was an excellent servant to the club, the ultimate professional, and an exceptional role model for younger players. Gary will be deeply missed by everyone at Newcastle United.

We have worked hard to extend Rafa’s contract over a significant period of time, however it has not been - and will not be - possible to reach an agreement with Rafa and his representatives. Rafa’s coaching staff, Paco de Miguel Moreno, Antonio Gomez Perez and Mikel Antia, will also leave the club on 30th June. We would like to thank Rafa and his coaching team for their efforts over the last three years and their significant contribution to what has been collectively achieved. We would also like to thank our supporters, players and staff for their patience during a period of uncertainty. The process to appoint a successor will now begin.</p>

From winning the Championship to our two seasons in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, fans, staff and players have all been United. I wanted to stay, but I didn’t just want to sign an extended contract, I wanted to be part of a project. Unfortunately, it became increasingly clear to me that those at the top of the Club did not share the same vision. I’m very sad about that, but I do not regret for one moment my decision to come to Tyneside and I’m very proud of what we achieved together. I will always have you in my heart. Best of luck for the future. C’mon Toons!</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle United have defended owner <a href="mike-ashley.html">Mike Ashley</a> in the wake of criticism from UK politician Jeremy Corbyn]</b> In overlooking existing governance and regulation, as well as the hugely positive impact Newcastle United and other professional clubs have in their communities, Mr Corbyn has demonstrated a surprising lack of knowledge about our national game. Financially, other than sums provided to the club on a short-term, interest-free basis and repaid to him as intended, we would like to make it clear that <a href="mike-ashley.html">Mike Ashley</a> has not taken a penny out of Newcastle United in interest, salary or dividend, as is customary at many clubs.<br /><br />As stated on numerous occasions before, every penny Newcastle United has will continue to be available to it. In this financial year, the club will use an overdraft facility to manage its cashflow following a significant spend on talent in the summer. As a well-run, responsible club, that amount will be repaid in full and on time and our other regulatory obligations will be met. We will not apologise for being financially sustainable, but we will push the boundaries of our budgets as far as possible to maximise the impact on the team.<br /><br />We agree with Mr Corbyn that ‘a football club is more than just a club; it is an institution at the heart of our communities’. That is why our vast work across the local community will continue, with Newcastle United Foundation providing services and support to tens of thousands of people in our region each year who truly need them. Often, Newcastle United Foundation’s projects fill in significant gaps that the public sector sadly cannot stretch to, particularly at a time when government cuts are so prevalent. We would like to invite Mr Corbyn to visit one of these initiatives to experience at first hand the incredible work that is being undertaken by the Foundation in our local community every day</p>

  <p><b>[Newcastle fans turn on <a href="mike-ashley.html">Mike Ashley</a> as club continues to charge season ticket costs]</b> Last week Newcastle United Supporters Trust (NUST) contacted Newcastle United Football Club to express significant concerns regarding Season Ticket payments. We did not receive a response. Yesterday we went public with our request for the suspension of all future Season Ticket payments during this incredibly difficult time.<br /><br />There is no prospect of professional football recommencing any time soon given the current global health crisis, let alone the prospect of understanding the implications on timing on fixtures for next season.<br /><br />We find it incredibly disturbing that the club continues to take payments from supporters during these extremely difficult times, in what is a health and economic crisis. Following our call for the suspension and delay of all future Season Ticket payments Newcastle United contacted us earlier today. The club stated it has no intention of freezing or delaying payments, both for those that pay annually and monthly.<br /><br />Today, Tuesday 25 March 2020, Newcastle United took payments for the 2020-21 season from those supporters who opt to pay for their season ticket annually. Monthly payments will also continue as normal.<br /><br />We are disappointed that Newcastle United is unwilling to offer a meaningful support system to fans through this difficult time. Many supporters can afford to continue to pay, but we still feel more MUST be done for supporters who will suffer most due to the knock on effects of coronavirus global pandemic.<br /><br />We are also deeply concerned to learn that some supporters who normally pay monthly have seen the full payment taken today. Any fans in that situation should contact the club immediately</p>
