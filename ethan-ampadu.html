  <p><b>[Ampadu reveals Chelsea dream as he aims to impress new boss Maurizio Sarri]</b> I never expected it. The day before the game another player said ‘Are you ready for tomorrow night?’ and I didn’t really understand that he meant that I was starting!<br /><br /><b>[Chelsea came knocking in 2017]</b> I’ve always been a fan. I grew up as a Chelsea fan and I wanted to play for Chelsea. It gave me a chance to fulfill my dream. I liked <b>[Didier]</b> Drogba. When I was younger, I wanted to be a striker and I liked him so that sort of attracted me towards Chelsea<br /><br />I didn’t expect it, but it’s what you aim towards. It’s sort of like the Exeter situation, you work towards it but I didn’t expect it. I wouldn’t say I’ve made it but I’m trying to, I’ve still got a long way to go. You try and take bits and pieces from everyone. You can learn off everyone in different ways<br /><br />Coming on against France was probably the best experience I’ve had, albeit in a friendly but it was still amazing. Especially playing at the stadium <b>[Stade de France]</b>, it was an unreal night</p>

  <p><b>[Wales international Ethan Ampadu has penned a five-year contract extension with Chelse]</b> I’m really proud and happy. I’m looking forward to the next five years and all I have got to do now is continue to work hard, and hopefully good things will happen<br /><br /><b>[he opted to stay and fight for a chance in <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a>’s team instead, having been given his first taste of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> action last December]</b> You could say there’s been frustration on one hand, but at the same time I’m getting experience training with the players. I’m just trying to improve to get into the team. This season’s plans are this season’s plans and at the moment I’ve just to keep improving to try and get in the team. I want to show the manager what I can do</p>

I want to get to know the team as quickly as possible and integrate myself. I’ve been following the club in recent years and saw how fantastic young players have come to develop here and what potential there is in this club. So it’s the perfect step for me. I’m really happy to be wearing the <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> jersey now. I have heard a lot about the club and am convinced that the way football is played here suits me very well. I already know some of my new team-mates: I’ve already played against Jean-Kevin Augustin in Paris and against <a href="dayot-upamecano.html">Dayot Upamecano</a> and Nordi Mukiele in the French Under-21 national team. Therefore, I am optimistic that I can adapt here quickly</p>

  <p><b>[Ethan Ampadu planning <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> future but is enjoying <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> learning curve]</b> I am always watching <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and seeing what is going on. It is good to see the young players are shining at the moment. They are in the top four so fingers crossed they can hold on to that. I would like to go back, I aim to, but right now I am focused on Leipzig and finishing the season. I have not played as much as I would have liked to, but I am definitely learning in training and working hard. When this situation came of starting <b>[against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>]</b> I knew it was a good opportunity to show what I can do and I’d like to think I’ve done that. I just tried to play my game. I try to be composed and just try to play</p>

  <p><b>[Ethan Ampadu has admitted that his loan at <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> has not gone as well as he would have hoped]</b> There’s been a lot of frustration at times; however, I’ve learned a lot through those frustrations which will only help me later in my career. I’ve not played as many games as I’d have liked to but in the games I’ve played in, I think I’ve done reasonably well. That’ll give me confidence, but I’ve things to learn from. If I’m honest, it’s not been as good as I hoped, not all that I wanted it to be. But I hope technically I’ve improved and, tactically, I’ve now played under another manager. So I’ve learned another style of football and how another manager thinks football should be played.<br /><br />Starting at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>? Yeah, that came out of the blue a little bit. It was my first start in a little while, obviously. I knew I had to concentrate 100 per cent, I was up against high-class players - <a href="lucas-moura.html">Lucas Moura</a> with his pace and movement, <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> also. <b>[Harry]</b> <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> and Son <b>[Heung-min]</b> are a miss to any team, but they still <b>[have]</b> class players. <b>[I]</b> felt positive, felt I’d done well. It was tiring, the lungs and legs needed to get used to it.</p>
