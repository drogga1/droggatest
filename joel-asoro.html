<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sunderland starlet Joel Asoro claims Arsenal are keen on signing him this summer]</b> People were a little shocked because I have played very little first-team football. I’ve heard a little bit, but if I think about it too much, it becomes ‘what if, what if.’ I try not to think about it too much. It came as a shock. It is clear clubs contact each other and stuff, but it’s my agent in charge of it. I try to focus on my football.</p>
