  <p><b>[Liverpool’s new teenage signing Harvey Elliott has apologised via social media following the publication of a video in which he appeared to mock Tottenham star Harry Kane]</b> I would just like to wholeheartedly apologise for any offence caused on the back of a video of me currently circulating on the internet. The video was taken whilst messing around with friends in a private environment and was not directed at any individual but I realise that my actions were both immature and senseless. I would like to stress that the contents of the video do not represent who I am as a person or how I’ve been brought up, and I am truly sorry</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool have said that a video of Harvey Elliott that appeared to show him mocking England captain Harry Kane is completely wrong and not in keeping with the club’s values]</b> The club believes Harvey is right in offering a full and unreserved apology for the comments made in the video. Clearly the use of such language is completely wrong and not in keeping with our values or what we would expect from any employee. Given the clip was recorded prior to the player signing for the club and was not in the public domain at that time, we won’t be making any further comment publicly</p>

  <p><b>[When asked about his goals with the club, Elliott reply]</b> To win everything with this club. I strive to be like <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a>, to be as big of a legend here as him. I want to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and the Champions League with this amazing club. For me, that’s what I strive towards and I want to help the club in every way possible to accomplish these things.<br /><br />I think if I added <b>[more goals]</b> to my game, it would take me on further. I have a thought in my head to be a team player; I’d rather set my friend in and he has a clear shot on goal than me take a shot on and it gets deflected or the defender comes and tackles me.<br /><br />Sometimes in situations I need to be more selfish, but at the same time I have a thought of my friends around me and whether they have an easier position to score or a better chance<br /><br /><b>[The teenager also spoke about his fondness for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> boss Jurgen Klopp]</b> I just think he is any player’s dream to play under, to be honest. I think many people can say that, just because of who he is. Off the pitch, he can have a joke, he can dish the jokes out, but when it’s serious and we need to focus he brings the best out of everyone</p>

I don’t like him after what he did to <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>. Mo is the King. Going up against him in training I learn a lot of things. I idolise him a lot. Even in the gym, he helps and tells me to do higher weights to push myself even more. He’s a really big influence on the young players</p>

  <p><b>[Harvey Elliott: <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> youngster signs professional contract]</b> I think since the first day I’ve walked in, it’s been an indescribable journey so far. I think now to top it off with my first professional contract is a dream come true for me and my family. I’m excited to see what the future holds and I’m just excited to give everything to the club and the fans.<br /><br />Brilliant news - really happy. Harvey is such an exciting prospect. We all know his qualities - we have seen them this season in the first team and U23s. I love his attitude - love his enthusiasm - love his bravery - love the fact he has the right amount of football confidence and cheekiness. What is critical - so important - is that he is given time and space to develop. He will get that from us. He needs to be allowed to make mistakes while he learns and not feel more pressure than is right and fair. What is great is that he has the perfect culture here and we will protect him. The senior players and the coaches really care about him and are as excited as I am about his future. So, we will all be part of his story as it unfolds.</p>
