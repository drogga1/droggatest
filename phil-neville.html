It’s going to be a really fiercely contested series. England look like they’ve refound their form and Australia look like a team in transition. We’ve got (Andrew) Flintoff fit, (Kevin) Pietersen fit - all the big guns. For me it’s one of the best duals in sport and there’s nothing better than beating the Aussies! My money is on England, no doubt about it.</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Neville says Manchester City are now miles better than arch-rivals Manchester United]</b> Over the last five years, you’ve seen a team that’s gone away from the vision and philosophy of what the club is all about. When you look at City, Liverpool and Tottenham, their club’s foundations are really strong - and you’d say United’s are from a financial point of view. But stability on the field? If you look at those teams <b>[City, Liverpool, Spurs]</b>, they have a system and a style of play and a tried and trusted method, whereas United seem to be going left and right from manager to manager. They need to get back to what United do best, which is playing a certain brand of football which hasn’t just been synonymous with Sir Alex Ferguson, it’s from the year dot, Sir Matt <b>[Busby]</b>, Ron Atkinson…You hope with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Mick Phelan, Michael Carrick and Nicky Butt <b>[in the academy]</b> that United will start getting back to the foundations. I think it will take a long time - it’s not a quick fix - but hopefully with those guys in charge and the financial muscle United have still got, they can get back challenging soon because it’s difficult watching Man City win everything. It’s difficult because you think they’re miles better than United at this moment in time.</p>

What blew me away was that I wanted them to just say I want to win the World Cup. They said: ‘We want bigger than just winning a World Cup. We want, over the next five, 10 years, for the Lionesses to become one of the greatest sports teams in the world, to be talked about like the All Blacks, leave legacies that the young kids of today will always remember<br /><br /><b>[Phil Neville is not a manager content with standing still]</b> When I came out of SheBelieves, the thing I thought was that the team need more belief in the style that I want to play.

That I’m certain of. We’ll have to do a superhuman effort. The players know that. We’re in it to win it. We’ve had defeats to Canada and New Zealand in the last few months and I think what those defeats told us was that we cannot drop below our best or we will pay the price.<br /><br />A lot of team have caught the USA up. They were the outstanding team but what happens to outstanding teams is people study them. The fact that Lucy Bronze plays in France for Lyon means she has no fear about playing against the best players. My England players who play in America have no fear about playing American girls. They know they’re only human.<br /><br /><b>[Phil Neville preaches bravery to his team and insists that he won’t berate them for making mistakes]</b> I only criticise my players if they don’t try and make that pass, if they take the safe option.

We’ve talked long and hard about it, we’ve not been shy about our expectations. Now we need to deliver. That’s my challenge and my excitement. We’ve dreamt of this moment all our lives. When we get to it we’re going to have to perform. I’m going to have to manage better than I ever have and they’re going to have to play, to have any kind of success they are going to have superhuman efforts. People don’t just knock on the door and give you a World Cup medal.<br /><br />If we’d have won today, it would be ‘it was just New Zealand’. The players are deflated because of the crowd. I think they know really that it’s all about the Scotland game now. Nothing in the Denmark or New Zealand game was going to change our thinking.<br /><br />We experimented a bit. We wanted to see players in different positions. The most important thing for us is to go away and reflect. As much as there were good things in the game, there are things we need to improve on. Jamaica were very direct and they have some very quick players and at times we struggled to cope with that</p>

The ability to score, the ability to create, the ability to play left, right and through the middle, and I think <b>[against Scotland]</b> you’ve seen a little snippet of what a special player we’ve got.

I’m looking for something that may take a long time to achieve, that total domination for 90 minutes. I sometimes expect more of them, but maybe no team can do it for 90 minutes. My expectation levels are sometimes higher than what’s achievable. But I have to keep pushing the standards. And so far I’ve seen nothing in this tournament that gives me fear. I’ve seen nothing that makes me go: ‘Oh dear me, if we play them we’re going to struggle’.<br /><br /><b>[England are favourites to beat Cameroon]</b> Our biggest tests are going to be against teams like that, the teams that we’re expected to beat but will sit low and really try to stifle us.

Over the years I’ve learned that, if you have one cog that’s not quite right in the system, that flow of how you want to play can’t work.

This is going out worldwide and I can’t stand here and say that I particularly enjoyed it, my players didn’t enjoy it. Young girls all over the world were seeing that behaviour, for me it’s not right and I can’t stand here and say it’s fantastic or it’s brilliant that we’re into the quarter-final because there’s a bigger picture here. The behaviour was wrong because it’s the image of women’s football, and it’s going out worldwide about a team that comes to the side and start refusing to play. There is a certain standard of behaviour that you’ve got to do, my players did that and I’m proud.<br /><br />Sympathy? None. Ellen White was onside, deal with it. We know the rules, we’ve been spoken to by referees 350,000 times in the last three weeks and she got every decision right.

That, for me, makes me very proud.<br /><br /><b>[Houghton missed her post-match media duties to receive treatment]</b> We’re concerned about her, she’s not someone who stays down. It was a late tackle and we’re going to have to do everything possible to get her fit for the quarter-final. She’s a big player for us, our captain, and her and Lucy Bronze were outstanding.

We’re hoping she takes part in some of the training today. That’s the key for Steph. Millie has got a virus that’s going a little bit through the camp. She’s probably more of a doubt than Steph, so we’re going to give them right until the last minute to be fit.<br /><br /><b>[Phil Neville has no qualms about bringing in Leah Williamson and Abbie McManus]</b> You guys <b>[the media]</b> have had an obsession with my rotation for the last 18 months. What I would say is the players that we’ve played are for moments like this. We can just say no problem, Steph, Millie, whoever, we can just bring two people in who know the system, know the style and have got utter belief and confidence in each other. It’s a seamless transition. You plan for these moments. I said six months ago, ‘You don’t want to get to the quarter-final of a World Cup and throw a young kid in or someone we haven’t tested, haven’t tried, who doesn’t know our system’.<br /><br />There’s been a plan behind it for moments like this. I’m totally relaxed. When I got into management, I said from day one, only worry about those that can get on the bus - and those that can get on the bus are the fit ones. Unfortunately, in situations, you’re going to have injuries and it’s opportunities for others.

Their last-16 encounter against Cameroon, however, was not a match without controversy as their opponents railed against two VAR decisions]</b> That wasn’t a World Cup last-16 tie in terms of behaviour that I want to see from footballers. I am completely and utterly ashamed of the opposition. At times, we probably didn’t know whether the game would continue. It didn’t feel like football. I didn’t enjoy it, the players didn’t enjoy it. My players kept their concentration fantastically, but those images are going out worldwide about how to act, the young girls playing all over the world that are seeing that behaviour.

  <p><b>[England women’s team manager Phil Neville has questioned the handball rules, calling them a ‘minefield’, but ultimately supports attempts to keep the game moving forward. And when asked his opinion on VAR]</b> Handball I think is the big problem. I think a prime example is the penalty we got against Scotland and the goal disallowed <b>[against Sweden]</b>, the handball. There’s a grey area between what is unnatural, silhouette, and even I don’t understand it to be honest with you. I say I don’t understand it, it’s how can we get that consistency. I think the referees have been really good in the tournament and they’ve just abided by the rules that have been set. There’s no criticism of the referees<br /><br /><b>[Neville believes it is for the good of the game and something everyone will have to adjust to]</b> The hurt is if you think about the goal that Ellen <b>[White]</b> scored the other night and the goal she scored today, we’d scored it, we’d celebrated it, we’d done silly dances down the line, we were then thinking about how we were going to win the game and then literally four, three minutes later it’s taken away from you. It’s a horrible feeling. I remember the Champions League game when Pep did the same when City were against Tottenham and you think at the time it’s alright, and then when it happens to you, it’s a nightmare. It will take some getting used to, I have to say. But to keep the game moving forward, we’ve just got to make sure we keep nailing the big ones.<br /><br /><b>[Neville believes most of the problem stems from adjusting from going from judgment calls over rules to a strict interpretation]</b> They were, they were explained and they’ve been implemented to the law, to the absolute law. When the goal was disallowed, or when Ellen’s against the USA was disallowed, whether it’s a toe a foot or an arm, it was offside. You can’t argue, you can’t speak to the referee afterwards and say ‘that wasn’t offside’ because it was offside. It takes away all that, all the controversy. I just thought today that the handball one, we probably just need to … what is handball? It didn’t look like a handball because ultimately the Swedish defender came and clashed in and the ball was there … could you see where she touched it?<br /><br />The handball is an impossible one for someone that probably is watching to actually give. I feel sorry for them. That is the rule that I thought ‘this is going to be a minefield’ and it will continue to be so. If you abide by the rule of common sense then you’re going to get inconsistencies, week-in, week-out and I think it has to be black and white. What they’ve implemented is black and white rules. We were told beforehand that would be the case, it’s happened but we still don’t like it. I just feel the handball still needs work because the Scotland goal, Jen Beattie is probably on a beach somewhere on holiday right now thinking ‘that was never a handball’ and Ellen today is thinking ‘that’s never a handball and that’s my golden boot’. And it just seems cruel</p>

I’ve seen a team that play a certain way with a certain system. There’s been a shift in culture in terms of the players they’ve brought in. The signings that Ole has made, and with the likes of Mason Greenwood, Angel Gomes and Tahith Chong coming into the squad, the bare minimum is that we’re going to see a Man United team that are going to fight to the end. The best moment for me on Sunday was when Daniel James scored that goal. The emotion on his face and what it meant to him. I think Manchester United should mean something to you<br /><br />There are probably more skilful players, and players with better reputations than McTominay, but if you’re talking about character and resilience, that lad has gone through it all to get to where he wants to be. And that’s through sheer hard work, dedication and training, doing extra. It’s no coincidence that Jose Mourinho picked him in the biggest games against Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, and Ole’s doing the same now. And there’s nothing better. A level-headed young lad who is working his socks off. The fundamental basis of any successful person is hard work, and Scott McTominay is doing that in abundance.</p>

  <p><b>[England manager Phil Neville has named his 21-strong squad for the forthcoming clashes against Germany and the Czech Republic]</b> This is going to be a momentous occasion in the history of women’s football in England. To have sold out Wembley Stadium for the first time and to have potentially over 80,000 fans cheering on our team will not only be record-breaking, it will be an incredibly proud and humbling experience for myself and my players and staff. It will be a hugely significant landmark moment on our journey and we are all extremely honoured to be playing a part in that. But it will also be a moment for us to say thank you and show our enormous appreciation to all those players throughout the history of the women’s game in England whose hard work, determination and resilience in far tougher times has helped bring us to where we are today.<br /><br />The hairs will be standing up on the backs of our necks a week on Saturday when we walk out onto the Wembley pitch. I’m delighted that so many of England’s former players are able to join us for an occasion which celebrates the achievements of every one of them. There’s an incredible amount of work that goes on behind the scenes at The FA to help us attract huge crowds like this and I want to thank everyone for their tremendous support. On my recent travels around Europe to watch my players I can tell you that what’s happening in England - the way the Lionesses have connected with the nation and the attendances in the Barclays FAWSL and of course at Wembley - is attracting huge admiration from other nations</p>

I think that was a big loss for them at the World Cup. My second game was against them and since then no one has really spoken about them.

Performance levels have to change and it is up to me to find that formula. I take responsibility for that. Our tactic <b>[vs Germany]</b> was to go away from the style of performance we have promoted and play more direct.

It is the way Gareth <b>[Southgate]</b> is playing, that I am playing, that the pathway coaches are playing on both sides, it is what we believe in. I do think it is the right way to play football, it is just we need to get better at it faster than we are at the moment.<br /><br />We are being punished for mistakes, for the expansiveness of our style, but we need to get better because the mistakes are coming not because of the shape we are in but little technical errors that we are working on all the time.

Whether <b>[that is]</b> at the Olympics, or Euro 2021 or the World Cup in 2023, this is the way we are going as <a href="fa.html">the FA</a>, as a group of coaches.

Faster, more energy, and more forward-thinking. It was actually good to watch. I spoke to Ole - I drop him a text every now and then - and just ‘keep going, I think the fans are actually liking what they’re seeing’. Regardless of Ole being a legend of the club, the signings in the summer were young, adventurous, they gave the club a little bit of energy, and I think you can see the direction now that the club is going in. I think we’ve not had that now for probably two or three years. He’s going to get time; he’s blooding all these young players. When I speak to United supporters outside the ground, I can see a genuine energy and a genuine feeling that regardless of the results or where we are in the table, I think they can see the pathway and the journey that we’re going now. It’s what we want to see as a Man United supporter, and we’re all Man United fans. I think we have to go away from the fact from signing these big galacticos and all that, and just sign good, young, hungry players that are going to come in and make this club better.<br /><br />You can’t change the philosophy or the history of the club.

One more signing and United can challenge<br /><br /><b>[on <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s potential attacking plans]</b> He’ll want <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> to develop into a centre-forward, 100 per cent. But I think <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>, Martial and <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> like to play in and around a centre forward. It wouldn’t be a surprise if they still went into the transfer market and bought a centre forward. But with <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and Fernandes and their type of creativity, Martial and <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> and <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> will get better service. It means that when they play a little loose, they’ve got someone in Fernandes who will play that killer pass</p>
