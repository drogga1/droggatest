It’s going to be a really fiercely contested series. England look like they’ve refound their form and Australia look like a team in transition. We’ve got (Andrew) Flintoff fit, (Kevin) Pietersen fit - all the big guns. For me it’s one of the best duals in sport and there’s nothing better than beating the Aussies! My money is on England, no doubt about it.</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Neville believes Manchester United are in the right direction]</b> They are 100 per cent going in the right direction. They are playing with a better style, they are playing with more confidence, they have got a determination about them. They have lost tonight, qualified for a major final and those players didn’t really celebrate at the end of the game. That shows you how far they have come, that the standards have been raised at that football club back to where it should be.<br /><br />They have to finish in the top four because of the marketing and the commercial side and I think that is the minimum that they want. But, winning a major trophy should not be taken lightly. I think the league is a little bit too much, so you look at getting in the Champions League through either finishing in the top four or winning the Europa League. United can more than do that</p>

I read something the other day, that his methods are outdated and I think that’s the most disrespectful thing ever. How do these people know his methods are outdated when he comes back in a Manchester derby and wins 3-2 last year? Were his methods outdated in that? I think his record speaks for itself. They are going through a bad period, that performance at Brighton was unacceptable but I don’t see a better man for the job. In terms of his record since he’s gone to Manchester United, FA Cup win, Europa League win, two Carabao Cup win, two Champions League qualifications. Yes, I don’t think all is smooth there and I think it’s a club issue but I think that the criticism he’s getting, I just think it’s disgraceful, I really do.</p>

There are players in that Manchester United dressing room that probably know that they can be playing better but he is not criticising them publicly at the moment. ‘He is actually taking the hits for them. As a young manager, that’s something that I am looking at and thinking: ‘That’s something that I would like to do for my players’.

I think a Manchester derby, we used to talk about from 48 hours before. Merseyside derbies were a week before. The masseur would put up on the wall ‘five more sleeps’. The next day ‘four more sleeps’, the next day ‘three more sleeps until the Merseyside derby’. It was the biggest game. We used to go into derby days full of confidence thinking we could compete but Liverpool always used to play the game. We got too involved in trying to smash someone early on, fans saying you’ve got to die for the badge. It was the only game Everton wanted to win.<br /><br /><b>[David Moyes spent £3 million to sign Neville from United, and he was given the captain’s armband almost immediately]</b> They <b>[the fans]</b> hadn’t accepted me because after one month David Moyes made me captain.

  <p><b>[Man Utd can forget about Premier League and Champions League]</b> What we saw at Old Trafford on Tuesday showed why Juventus can win this season’s Champions League, and why Manchester United won’t. There was a huge gulf in class between the two sides - United are 10th in the Premier League for a reason, while Juve are one of the best teams in Europe and have got everything you need to be successful. Getting fourth place has to be their focus now because they are not going to win the Premier League or the Champions League, and they need to concentrate on getting back into it next season.<br /><br />Mourinho is still getting criticism himself of course, but I said before the game I think United should stick with him, and this defeat does not change that. United have now won only one of their past seven games but I don’t think it is a crisis situation because the players have given everything and, if they play at the same level as against Newcastle and Chelsea, their Premier League results will improve and they will get out of their Champions League group. The fans have to accept any manager in charge of this United team would probably have been beaten by Juventus, so Mourinho just needs to be allowed to get on with it - starting against Everton on Sunday</p>

Ole over the last couple of games has been really happy, saying the right things. They had the best player on the pitch and probably the best midfielder in Europe on his day in Paul Pogba who has had a disappointing, horrendous last 18 months at the club because of the fall-out with the manager. It looked like the shackles were off, playing with that freedom of expression, anything is possible type attitude, playing with arrogance. The passing was back to his best. Look, he is the best player at the club when he is at his best and with performances like this he should be a 12-15 goal a season person - he hasn’t been that in his career so far but he can be.<br /><br />I think they would <b>[have lost him]</b>.

He’s not the Alexis Sanchez we fell in love with at Arsenal. He needs a 10 or 15-game run in the team without being brought off to build his form. Sanchez’s form has dipped so much that at the moment you look at subs to come on and make an impact, he’s not the one. I don’t think he’s gone, I think he might have to re-adapt his game. I think it’s confidence. He needs some love and he’s the one Ole has to work on. If Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard are maybe out, <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> has to get Sanchez back in to form.<br /><br />I don’t think Manchester United have any chance in Paris.

I thought that after they lost at home to Juventus in October and, although they now have a different manager, as a team they are still in exactly the same place, which is well behind the leading European sides. I think we have to accept that United are not good enough, and move on.<br /><br />Tuesday’s defeat by Paris Saint-Germain should not define Manchester United’s season, or decide whether interim boss <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> gets the job permanently. Realistically, they were never going to win the Champions League anyway but what they can achieve is finish in the top four of the Premier League, and continue their progress in the FA Cup. That has to be the focus now. Their final league position, in particular, is what actually will define United’s season and I am sure that is the way Ole will look at it too. I think he should get the job on a full-time basis based on what he has done since taking charge - not just with his fantastic results but because of the way he has changed the whole outlook of the club</p>

United’s not about the results, United is about seeing a team fight and seeing a team play right up to the very last minute, with a togetherness and a spirit. Everything that he’s done has been right. He’s getting every ounce of ability and effort out of these players.<br /><br />Management isn’t all about tactics; it’s about managing a set of players to get the best out of them. Part of me says don’t give <b>[the permanent job]</b> to him yet. Everything’s going really well, don’t spoil it. Just let the players keep fighting for him. I think it’s impossible not to give him the job. That’s my opinion. But why not just keep this momentum going and keep this bandwagon going?<br /><br />United have real momentum now they could easily go and win the Champions League. I’d run through a brick wall for him. People questioned whether he’d be good enough. He’s rammed that down everyone’s throat!</p>

I said this around eight months ago, but I firmly believe Rashford has the ability to be held in the same breath as Mbappe - he’s that good. Marcus is a special, special player. He is world class. He’s playing with an arrogance and a swagger. England and Manchester United are very lucky to have someone like that who purposes the kind of bravery, courage and speed to be a top-level player.<br /><br />He’s just getting better and better, the sky is the limit for him. What he went through with Jose Mourinho, in terms of the changing of positions and discipline, has actually helped him so much in the long run. He’s really seeing the benefits of it now, quite evidently that has taught him how to deal with negative situations and kick on. He’s a special player</p>

Drastic action is needed - either through points deductions or by emptying stadiums and making clubs play behind closed doors. I don’t want to over-dramatise things, but everyone remembers what happened to the tennis player Monica Seles, who was stabbed on court during a match in 1993. We need to start protecting players properly because all it takes is for one of these people who get hurt on the pitch to have a knife or other weapon and it will be a footballer who is badly hurt next time.<br /><br />I have seen many incidents this season that worry me about the way football is going, and we need to nip things in the bud before they get worse.

One of my players in the England women team, Karen Carney, received death threats last year. It was disgusting, but that just seem to be seen as part of being a public figure these days, whether you are male or female<br /><br />It happened to me when I was playing for Everton in a Merseyside derby in 2008. I was taking a throw at Anfield, and I got a punch in the back from a Liverpool fan. At the time I thought nothing of it and I just got on with the game. It was not until I came off afterwards that I thought that jab in the back could have been something else - and he could have had a weapon in his hand</p>

What my players have done in this tournament, they’ve had visibility around the world. What they’ve found is millions of people - boys, girls, men, women, any religion, skin colour - have probably fallen in love with a group of 23 players that love playing for their country. I think that’s more powerful than any press conference or words you can use</p>

  <p><b>[England women’s team manager Phil Neville has questioned the handball rules, calling them a ‘minefield’, but ultimately supports attempts to keep the game moving forward. And when asked his opinion on VAR]</b> Handball I think is the big problem. I think a prime example is the penalty we got against Scotland and the goal disallowed <b>[against Sweden]</b>, the handball. There’s a grey area between what is unnatural, silhouette, and even I don’t understand it to be honest with you. I say I don’t understand it, it’s how can we get that consistency. I think the referees have been really good in the tournament and they’ve just abided by the rules that have been set. There’s no criticism of the referees<br /><br /><b>[Neville believes it is for the good of the game and something everyone will have to adjust to]</b> The hurt is if you think about the goal that Ellen <b>[White]</b> scored the other night and the goal she scored today, we’d scored it, we’d celebrated it, we’d done silly dances down the line, we were then thinking about how we were going to win the game and then literally four, three minutes later it’s taken away from you. It’s a horrible feeling. I remember the Champions League game when Pep did the same when City were against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and you think at the time it’s alright, and then when it happens to you, it’s a nightmare. It will take some getting used to, I have to say. But to keep the game moving forward, we’ve just got to make sure we keep nailing the big ones.<br /><br /><b>[Neville believes most of the problem stems from adjusting from going from judgment calls over rules to a strict interpretation]</b> They were, they were explained and they’ve been implemented to the law, to the absolute law. When the goal was disallowed, or when Ellen’s against the USA was disallowed, whether it’s a toe a foot or an arm, it was offside. You can’t argue, you can’t speak to the referee afterwards and say ‘that wasn’t offside’ because it was offside. It takes away all that, all the controversy. I just thought today that the handball one, we probably just need to … what is handball? It didn’t look like a handball because ultimately the Swedish defender came and clashed in and the ball was there … could you see where she touched it?<br /><br />The handball is an impossible one for someone that probably is watching to actually give. I feel sorry for them. That is the rule that I thought ‘this is going to be a minefield’ and it will continue to be so. If you abide by the rule of common sense then you’re going to get inconsistencies, week-in, week-out and I think it has to be black and white. What they’ve implemented is black and white rules. We were told beforehand that would be the case, it’s happened but we still don’t like it. I just feel the handball still needs work because the Scotland goal, Jen Beattie is probably on a beach somewhere on holiday right now thinking ‘that was never a handball’ and Ellen today is thinking ‘that’s never a handball and that’s my golden boot’. And it just seems cruel</p>

To have sold out Wembley Stadium for the first time and to have potentially over 80,000 fans cheering on our team will not only be record-breaking, it will be an incredibly proud and humbling experience for myself and my players and staff. It will be a hugely significant landmark moment on our journey and we are all extremely honoured to be playing a part in that. But it will also be a moment for us to say thank you and show our enormous appreciation to all those players throughout the history of the women’s game in England whose hard work, determination and resilience in far tougher times has helped bring us to where we are today.<br /><br />The hairs will be standing up on the backs of our necks a week on Saturday when we walk out onto the Wembley pitch. I’m delighted that so many of England’s former players are able to join us for an occasion which celebrates the achievements of every one of them. There’s an incredible amount of work that goes on behind the scenes at <a href="fa.html">The FA</a> to help us attract huge crowds like this and I want to thank everyone for their tremendous support. On my recent travels around Europe to watch my players I can tell you that what’s happening in England - the way the Lionesses have connected with the nation and the attendances in the Barclays FAWSL and of course at Wembley - is attracting huge admiration from other nations</p>

  <p><b>[Phil Neville believes England will have to give one of their best performances under his charge if they are to beat Germany on Saturday evening]</b> They are in a state of transition but they still maintain their spot - second in the world. They are Germans, they know what they are doing. They are consistent and that’s what you will see tomorrow. You will see a team that won’t fold. You will see a team that will be disciplined, a team that won’t be scared of that occasion and we will have to play probably as good as we’ve ever played under me to get that win tomorrow<br /><br /><b>[Neville believes they have been a different team over the last few months]</b> They have scored 31 goals in the last four games haven’t they? Albeit they have played some pretty good games. I thought they missed <a href="dzsenifer-marozsan.html">Marozsan</a> massively in the World Cup. I’ve got to say, if she would have been fit like we know her then they could have easily got to the final instead of the Netherlands - I think they would have beat Sweden.

Performance levels have to change and it is up to me to find that formula. I take responsibility for that. Our tactic <b>[vs Germany]</b> was to go away from the style of performance we have promoted and play more direct.

Whether <b>[that is]</b> at the Olympics, or Euro 2021 or the World Cup in 2023, this is the way we are going as <a href="fa.html">the FA</a>, as a group of coaches. For me it is the only way to play: entertaining, attacking football. I know we have to win games, and we have won games, but at the moment we are not and we have to look at a way of finding a tweak to make sure we start winning games again<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether he believes it is an issue within the squad and his players]</b> I’d go to my grave with these players and their attitudes.

I know there was a little bit of negativity and stuff, but I remember watching a game - I think it was <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, 2-2 - and I came away and I just saw a different type of football. Faster, more energy, and more forward-thinking. It was actually good to watch. I spoke to Ole - I drop him a text every now and then - and just ‘keep going, I think the fans are actually liking what they’re seeing’. Regardless of Ole being a legend of the club, the signings in the summer were young, adventurous, they gave the club a little bit of energy, and I think you can see the direction now that the club is going in. I think we’ve not had that now for probably two or three years. He’s going to get time; he’s blooding all these young players. When I speak to United supporters outside the ground, I can see a genuine energy and a genuine feeling that regardless of the results or where we are in the table, I think they can see the pathway and the journey that we’re going now. It’s what we want to see as a Man United supporter, and we’re all Man United fans. I think we have to go away from the fact from signing these big galacticos and all that, and just sign good, young, hungry players that are going to come in and make this club better.<br /><br />You can’t change the philosophy or the history of the club.
