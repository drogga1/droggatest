  <p><b>[Coventry City manager Chris Coleman sang the praises of goalkeeper Kieren Westwood after his performance in the 1-0 win over <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham City</a> last night]</b> It looked like there was two of him in our goal, Kieren was absolutely tremendous for us. I can’t remember one save that stood out in particular because there were so many of them. In the second half he was absolutely outstanding. We had 11 players who were up for it and I thought they were all tremendous although obviously Kieren was particularly outstanding<br /><br />The reaction of the <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> players suggested it was over the line. I’ve not seen a replay and I’m not going to look at one, either. We’ve had so many bad decisions given against us this season, if one has gone our way, then we’ll take it. Our keeper was fantastic. He has made some tremendous saves and probably earned us three points</p>

Gareth was so good I’ve even asked him afterwards for a photograph and his autograph myself! I played with <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a>, of course, and I always said he was the finest player I appeared with but I honestly do think <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> will be even better in time.

  <p><b>[Chris Coleman succeeded Speed in the national team job and he stated Wales’ journey against the odds into the final four has no bearing on how often he recalls an old friend]</b> People talk about his legacy as a manager, but it’s hard to have a legacy in 10 games. Speedo’s legacy is 85 caps for Wales, and maybe over 50 as a captain, plus his 10 or 11 games as a manager, in which he showed great promise as a young manager. And then what happened, happened, unfortunately. He’s not just a Welsh but a sporting icon. But I don’t need a game of football for me to remember Speeds. I think about him every day, not just because I’m at a tournament. I don’t need Wales football to remind me of my friend. He could be sitting here where I am, enjoying what we’re enjoying. Unfortunately that was taken away</p>

  <p><b>[Wales manager Chris Coleman rules himself out of the England manager’s job]</b> My answer to the England job would be a big fat no. I think the next England manager should be an Englishman. It shouldn’t be anyone from overseas; I don’t care what his record is. Unless you’re from that country you can never ever know what it means to represent that country. You’d never see Germany, Italy or Spain looking outside. Why should England look further afield? Gareth <b>[Southgate]</b>, Brucey <b>[<a href="steve-bruce.html">Steve Bruce</a>]</b>, that’s where they should be looking. Certainly not a Welshman. Certainly not this Welshman</p>

  <p><b>[Paddy Coleman died in December 2013, aged 74, and it was an emotional journey that his three children made to Dublin to scatter his ashes on the river Liffey]</b> I took my two sisters over and Charlotte <b>[my wife]</b> came with me when we did it. It was his request. He always said: ‘Make sure that you do it there.’ So we did it outside the Brazen Head pub next to the river Liffey, which is the oldest pub in Dublin. It dates back to 1198 and the history is incredible and unbelievable. I thought it was poignant<br /><br />He lived in <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> for 50 years, he still had his Dublin accent and never changed. I used to take him back most summers for a few days. He would have a little roam around where he was brought up.<br /><br />No, he never ever <b>[wanted me to do that]</b>. He always pushed me to play for Wales Under-15s, in my day. If you had shown a bit of talent then, you would play for south Wales against north Wales. It was all about playing for Wales. There was talk about <b>[Ireland]</b> when Jackie Charlton was manager of the Republic and there was a tentative phone call that came my way. But <b>[my father]</b> was always Wales<br /><br />He was a huge football man - he loved football. He was a good parent, a great father and brilliant with me. I started playing football at the age of seven and he was one of those who never raised his voice; he guided me. I watch parents sometimes on the touchlines at youth games and they are screaming and shouting, which is not the way to go. He was the opposite to that. He was always a quiet talker but massive for me as a youngster coming through. I wouldn’t have got to the different levels I got to without his guidance<br /><br />He passed away three years ago and unfortunately for him it was going wrong for me with Wales <b>[at the time]</b>, so he never got to see us at the tournament<br /><br /><b>[The fixture in Dublin on Friday will evoke memories of the family tribute in Ireland a few years ago, with Coleman now in a position to be able to smile about some of the traditions they followed that day, right down to pouring a pint of Guinness in the river Liffey]</b> That’s a done thing there, especially where he is from. I wasted a whole pint - it was €8. If I’m honest with you, I did have a little drop first. I’ll have a pint of Guinness after the game definitely, and that will be remembering him. But beforehand it will be business</p>

  <p><b>[Chris Coleman on <a href="ethan-ampadu.html">Ethan Ampadu</a> capability]</b> He’s capable of playing both <b>[positions]</b>. His frame, athleticism, and understanding of the game, he’s a great communicator for someone so young. So at the moment it’s a tough one to call. He could end up playing holding midfielder or as a centre-back<br /><br />He’s got a long way to go before you can liken him to someone like <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a> but I remember him coming on at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> in midfield, he gravitated into a centre-back. Probably, in the last 20 years, Rio has been the best centre-back in the Premier League<br /><br />Your modern day centre-backs start play and you need to be confident in possession. He’s <b>[Ampadu]</b> a good communicator and a good all-round player.</p>

Well he’s never done that. It’s not his character. When he comes home he plays golf, stays with his family, in his little circle. I just thought it was unfair when people were picking him apart. He should do this, do that. No, be yourself. If he’s not happy in his head he won’t be right on the pitch. I’ve been with Gareth in Madrid, in a restaurant, and he’s speaking perfect Spanish, ordering food, greeting people. He was very polite, but it’s his own space. He has done all his talking on the pitch. He is the most decorated foreign import from the UK<br /><br /><b>[Coleman also added that, given the right circumstances, <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> has no issues in spending recreational time with his team-mates]</b> At the Vale <b>[Wales’ training base]</b> we introduced a massive room for the players. Pool, table tennis, darts, PlayStations, golf on to the screen. The atmosphere was brilliant and Gareth was in the middle of it with all the lads. He’s not looking over his shoulder, nobody is taking a picture of him. He is quite a shy person, Gareth. The only time he is not is on the pitch</p>

The <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is definitely an interest but it’s hard to get into because it’s such a growing league. I’ve left <a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a> a few messages - but he’s just not got back to me!<br /><br /><b>[Having spent time in Spain, Greece and Asia, the 49-year-old is ready to spread his wings once more]</b> e’s only five or six managers in the world that can take a pick and say, ‘I’m going there’. But that’s not me. I’m in a position where I don’t have to be impatient and jump on the first offer and I haven’t. If I really wanted to be back in, I’d be back in by now - and that’s not being arrogant. I have a lot of experience and I’m confident in myself and the people I’ve got with me that we can go and affect something when the time is right.<br /><br /><b>[Coleman added on his experiences to date]</b> Have I fallen flat on my face? Countless times. Has it put me off? No. It doesn’t bother me. I’m not afraid by it. If you are going to fail, you have to fail big style. You never achieve anything going under the radar. Sometimes, people don’t achieve because they are afraid to show everybody what they are. They shy away from it. I have a big ego but I must have to do the job I do. And the day I don’t want to put myself in the position of being scrutinised and criticised again is the day I will stop. I’m nowhere near that. I miss the stress of it all. I miss training every day. The games are awful, 90 minutes of carnage. But when you win it’s a relief - when you lose it’s the end of the world. Management is so difficult when you’re in it but when you are out, you miss it</p>

  <p><b>[Ramsey could handle playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> if it’s not working out at Juventus]</b> My advice to him is, obviously, I don’t know what’s going on at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, if he’s got a chance at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> likes him but he just may be out of form, maybe it’s taken him a while to get used to a different culture because it’s not easy. It’s not walk in the park when you go from one country to the next, different type of football, different asks, different challenge. It may take him a season to settle in there. But if it’s not going to happen for him, he’s definitely the type of player that could handle playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Because when you play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> the jersey is much heavier than when you’re playing for another club in the same league, a smaller club with all due respect, and the weight of the jersey is not the same. When you’re playing for a big club you’ve got to be able to handle that week in, week out. And he’s certainly got the appetite for that.<br /><br />I understand why he went to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, obviously a great club, they’ve got a great chance of winning the league. But he wants to be in the starting XI, that’s where he needs to be, and in my opinion, he’s good enough to be there, I don’t know why he’s not in the starting XI. I was glad when I heard he’d gone to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. He’d been at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> a long, long time, probably didn’t achieve what he wanted to achieve, or <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> haven’t achieved in the last 10 years what they used to. And to play abroad, the pull of that, the challenge of playing abroad for a massive club like <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> who, season in, season out, are challenging for the league or a cup competition, they were in the Champions League final a year or two ago. So, obviously, he’s gone there for a good reason, but he’s too good to be sitting on the bench, in my opinion</p>
