  <p><b>[Coventry City manager Chris Coleman sang the praises of goalkeeper Kieren Westwood after his performance in the 1-0 win over <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham City</a> last night]</b> It looked like there was two of him in our goal, Kieren was absolutely tremendous for us. I can’t remember one save that stood out in particular because there were so many of them. In the second half he was absolutely outstanding. We had 11 players who were up for it and I thought they were all tremendous although obviously Kieren was particularly outstanding<br /><br />The reaction of the <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> players suggested it was over the line. I’ve not seen a replay and I’m not going to look at one, either. We’ve had so many bad decisions given against us this season, if one has gone our way, then we’ll take it. Our keeper was fantastic. He has made some tremendous saves and probably earned us three points</p>

  <p><b>[Andorra vs Wales]</b> If we have a little bit of luck injury-wise and get our best team on the pitch, maybe we can go that one step further that no other Welsh team has done. The holy grail for us is to qualify and we’ve got a chance to do that over 10 games. We’ve got some really good players and one great player, but it’s about getting them fit and on the pitch.<br /><br />I was speaking to Carlo and he said when Madrid played on 3G pitch against weaker opposition the players struggled because they didn’t like the surface. My message to our players is, ‘Forget where we’re playing’. We’ve got to get a result and whatever the surface, we’ve got to get through it and do our job</p>

That’s a huge compliment, I’ve told them they’ve got to earn it and they knew the pressure going into the game. There was a big crowd for a reason but they didn’t disappoint.

  <p><b>[Chris Coleman has called on referees to give his star man Gareth Bale more protection following Wales’ bruising 2-1 win over Cyprus]</b> Baley knows before he walks on the pitch <b>[that]</b> he’s going to get kicked. I know that and I’m not complaining about that. Cyprus have got to do what they think right’s to win the game, but the referee’s there for a reason - to make a decision. When we play opposition in their back yard, their star players het rewards, they get free-kicks, but it doesn’t happen for us. That makes you nervous and you lose a bit of trust with the officials. The red card was a heavy challenge but if he sends one of ours off, surely he can send one or two of theirs off because they weren’t shy either.<br /><br />The players were absolutely magnificent. We’ve only had one defeat in eight games and we’ve not lost here for a year. People have questioned the players’ team spirit and <b>[whether they]</b> want to play for Wales, but I don’t think I have to answer that anymore</p>

  <p><b>[Wales coach Chris Coleman hailed his side’s growing maturity as they held off Cyprus with 10 men for a crucial win in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Monday]</b> We never had that in the last campaign. I thought we were too soft in the last campaign. We probably played better football in a lot of games, sometimes it came off for us and we won, but we were too open and gave sloppy goals away - we weren’t difficult to beat and when we went behind we couldn’t get back. We’re a different group of people this time. The group has really matured. A lot of those that have been around a while have really matured and the younger ones have got belief. The togetherness is incredible. If we didn’t have that, we wouldn’t have won the game tonight.<br /><br /><b>[Coleman admitted he feared the worst when Wales went down to 10 men following King’s crude challenge on Constantinos Makridis]</b> My heart was jumping out of my chest. When I saw the red card, I thought that’s going to kill us. We went 2-0 up and were cruising and should have been three or four up really. We got a bit sloppy. I think we thought it was going to be a rout but in these games you have to kill them off. We got to half-time and said, ‘let’s set our stall out and be calm’, but with the red card so early on you think it’s not going to be your night. But credit to our players. We’re greedy now, we want the points and we want to get them no matter what we have to do to get them, and we’ve done that. It was a great three points</p>

I can’t explain it, it’s unbelievable. It’s been an absolute dream, it means everything for Wales. It’s a dream come true. All the players from my generation, and generations before, nearly got there and it was really tough. But this group have gone that extra yard. They deserve everything they have got. From the first game to tonight they have given me their all. When I took the job I was in a sticky situation. Gary Speed was such a great man and a great presence that I wanted to carry on his work.

Speedo’s legacy is 85 caps for Wales, and maybe over 50 as a captain, plus his 10 or 11 games as a manager, in which he showed great promise as a young manager. And then what happened, happened, unfortunately. He’s not just a Welsh but a sporting icon. But I don’t need a game of football for me to remember Speeds. I think about him every day, not just because I’m at a tournament. I don’t need Wales football to remind me of my friend. He could be sitting here where I am, enjoying what we’re enjoying.

I started playing football at the age of seven and he was one of those who never raised his voice; he guided me. I watch parents sometimes on the touchlines at youth games and they are screaming and shouting, which is not the way to go. He was the opposite to that. He was always a quiet talker but massive for me as a youngster coming through.

And the day I don’t want to put myself in the position of being scrutinised and criticised again is the day I will stop. I’m nowhere near that. I miss the stress of it all. I miss training every day. The games are awful, 90 minutes of carnage. But when you win it’s a relief - when you lose it’s the end of the world. Management is so difficult when you’re in it but when you are out, you miss it</p>

  <p><b>[Ramsey could handle playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> if it’s not working out at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> My advice to him is, obviously, I don’t know what’s going on at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, if he’s got a chance at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> likes him but he just may be out of form, maybe it’s taken him a while to get used to a different culture because it’s not easy. It’s not walk in the park when you go from one country to the next, different type of football, different asks, different challenge. It may take him a season to settle in there. But if it’s not going to happen for him, he’s definitely the type of player that could handle playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Because when you play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> the jersey is much heavier than when you’re playing for another club in the same league, a smaller club with all due respect, and the weight of the jersey is not the same. When you’re playing for a big club you’ve got to be able to handle that week in, week out. And he’s certainly got the appetite for that.<br /><br />I understand why he went to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, obviously a great club, they’ve got a great chance of winning the league. But he wants to be in the starting XI, that’s where he needs to be, and in my opinion, he’s good enough to be there, I don’t know why he’s not in the starting XI. I was glad when I heard he’d gone to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. He’d been at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> a long, long time, probably didn’t achieve what he wanted to achieve, or <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> haven’t achieved in the last 10 years what they used to. And to play abroad, the pull of that, the challenge of playing abroad for a massive club like <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> who, season in, season out, are challenging for the league or a cup competition, they were in the Champions League final a year or two ago. So, obviously, he’s gone there for a good reason, but he’s too good to be sitting on the bench, in my opinion</p>

  <p><b>[Former Wales manager Chris Coleman has insisted that <a href="aaron-ramsey.html">Aaron Ramsey</a> would be a good fit for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> if he decided to return to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> from <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> giants <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> I’ve been fortunate to see the best of Aaron when I was manager of Wales.
