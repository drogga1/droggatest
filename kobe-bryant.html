  <p><b>[Kobe Bryant, the basketball mega-star, to Steve <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>]</b> Welcome to Los Angeles. Welcome to La La Land. Hopefully that means bringing another championship to the Galaxy - I’m sure it will. I’m looking forward to getting out there and watching you do your thing. I’ve been a fan of yours for a very, very long time. So welcome to LA, enjoy, and kick some arse in the process. I’ll be down here rooting you on, my man. Peace</p>

  <p><b>[Kobe Bryant compares the current <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> side to his previous Lakers teams in a conversation with Thierry Henry]</b> I think they can win it all again <b>[<a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, Champions League and Copa del Rey]</b>, they have a different style to other clubs. You could compare them with us <b>[the Lakers]</b> when we won with our offensive triangle, a style of play which brought us success under Phil Jackson as coach - or with the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> with the fast movement of the ball and exploiting the space. Everyone is synchronised and, when they are in position, your team-mate knows exactly what to do. When you have this flexibility and see the ability of the players, it is very difficult to stop them</p>

  <p><b>[He was introduced to soccer as a six-year-old while living in Italy]</b> To be able to fast forward to now and to see the energy put behind <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and the support behind it, I wouldn’t say it’s surprising. I’ve always appreciated the game and what a beautiful game it is. I knew eventually it would catch on<br /><br /><b>[Bryant says that that two sports are naturally connected because of their similarities]</b> It’s the connectivity of the sport itself. You have to use each other. You have to communicate with each other verbally and also through the ball itself. You have to read each other, open space for each other. There are a lot of similarities between basketball and the way that soccer is played<br /><br /><b>[Bryant prefers to stay in his current role of spokesman and supporter, at least for the time being]</b> I have looked at several opportunities. I’m not really big on owning franchises or sports teams, per se. But you never know. If the right opportunity comes along, it’s something that I’ll definitely look at<br /><br /><b>[He was some combination of a fan and a businessman]</b> Hopefully with my involvement, it will help in some of these markets with storytelling. But the most important thing in some of these newer markets that are coming now, it’s the marketing and storytelling of the players. It’s about who they are, the beauty of the game, educating fans about beautiful play and things of that nature. With BODYARMOR and our partnership, we’re absolutely looking forward to doing those stories and getting that word out there. With my name, hopefully, I can help</p>

  <p><b>[Bryant said on January 16th when asked about what links soccer and basketball together]</b> It’s the connectivity of the sport itself. You have to use each other. You have to communicate with each other verbally and also through the ball itself. You have to read each other, open space for each other. There are a lot of similarities between basketball and the way that soccer is played<br /><br /><b>[Yet, it was his start in soccer that Bryant often credited for being the foundation of his basketball skills]</b> Most of the time, American basketball is only taught in twos: 1-2, pick and roll, or give and go, or something like that. In playing soccer growing up, you really see the game in a combination of threes, sometimes four - and how you play within triangles. You see things in multiple combinations. And growing up playing <b>[soccer]</b>, my eye and my brain became accustomed to seeing those combinations in threes and fours versus one and two<br /><br />Playing basketball, you know, the focus is always on winning, winning championships. Winning championships comes and goes. It’s going to be another team that wins another championship, another player that wins another MVP award. If you really want to create something that lasts generations, you have to help inspire the next generation, right? They create something great, and then that generation will inspire the one behind them. That’s when you create something forever, and that’s what’s the most beautiful</p>
