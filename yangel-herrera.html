  <p><b>[New York City FC announced Tuesday the signing of midfielder Yangel Herrera on loan from sister club Manchester City]</b> I’m very happy to take this next step in my career. To have the opportunity to play with such a high caliber of players is very exciting and to join a team that has a good football philosophy is very important to me. I’m looking forward to playing under <b>[NYCFC head coach]</b> Patrick Vieira as he’s someone who played my position and I know I’ll be able to learn a lot from him. I want to absorb all the good things from Patrick and the other players.</p>

  <p><b>[Rising Man City prospect Yangel Herrera shining on loan in MLS]</b> I think when someone is born to do something, they do it.<br /><br />It was an extra motivation, a bonus for us knowing what was going on in our country and being able to give our people some happiness at a time when they needed it. As a player that fills your soul. I think we gave them some of the best times they’ve been able to experience in recent times with everything going on. The truth is that has filled us with a lot of joy knowing they were happy with what we were doing at the World Cup<br /><br />It was a great experience at the World Cup, it’s the best experienced I’ve been able to enjoy in my short career. It showed me that nothing is impossible as long as you believe in your work and the teammates around you, you’re always going to be okay in life<br /><br />Those are coach’s decisions more than anything. I haven’t been able to play with Pirlo yet, I’d love to and I’d be grateful if I had the chance to play with him<br /><br />I want to finish the season here in good form, and I’d love to stay here, but I’d also like to look for another team in Europe where I’d have the possibility to play. Not necessarily Manchester, because I know that in England I can’t play yet, but in Europe I’d like to look for another option and a club where I can play</p>

  <p><b>[Granada vs <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. Granada lie sixth in the Primera Division, boasting an identical record to the Catalans in terms of their wins and losses, but lagging on goal difference]</b> If this team has something, it is that always goes onto the field to compete, regardless of the rival in front of us. We know <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are a great team, but we have to do our job, believe we can hurt them and that we can win. We go into the game optimistically</p>
