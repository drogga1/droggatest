  <p><b>[Although Celtic cannot win the league on Sunday after being held to a scoreless draw by Hibs last weekend, they can close to within a point of the title and manager Neil Lennon said his troops are eager to seal a third successive domestic treble in McNeill’s memory]</b> With this in the background, it makes it even more significant. The players will be highly motivated on two fronts now. We’re a club in mourning. Billy McNeill was Celtic. He was an icon, a hero. My image of Billy will always be him stood on that podium in Lisbon, this Adonis in a green and white shirt holding the cup. I can’t put into words how big a loss he is for this club</p>

But you have to ignore that, stay focused, and they’ve done an amazing job, the players. It’s been really, really tough. It’s been the toughest piece of management I’ve had to do. I know on the outside people think it looks easy but it’s been difficult going in on my own. There was a lot of discontent around the club and a bit of agitation but the players have helped me and I’d like to think I’ve helped them. It’s a real privilege to be here as interim manager or any kind of manager on championship day. It’s very special<br /><br /><b>[Lennon paid tribute to his predecessor Rodgers, who won back-to-back titles in just under three years at Celtic Park, and credited his players for keeping their cool in a week when they attended the funeral of club legend Billy McNeill]</b> ‘s a wonderful moment for the club and great moment for the players and the supporters because they’re the most important people. The players were fantastic once again. They give me the heebie jeebies sometimes with the way they play and take chances. I have to pay tribute to Brendan. I have to pay a huge amount of credit to him for this title success because of the foundations that he’s built here. I was lucky enough to carry it on so it’s a great moment for me personally and for my family. It just felt right this week. We kept really calm, with all the emotions this week of Billy’s funeral. There’s a lot of negativity at times surrounding us and I’ve had to listen to a lot of fake news, but the players have done really well</p>

I think it is fair to say that a lot of us, whether it be management, players or people at the club were not satisfied with the comments<br /><br />When I speak to Olivier it will be done privately but you can imagine, we find the comments untimely and not particularly accurate<br /><br />He still has a future <b>[at Celtic]</b>, he is under contract.

  <p><b>[FC Sarajevo vs Celtic. Neil Lennon’s side will take any aid going into such an important match, they go into the game high in confidence after a successful training camp in Austria, where they played four friendlies and won three]</b> These are the most difficult games. The Champions League and everything that comes with it is brilliant, but the hard work is getting there. We could have had an easier draw, but the guys know what the incentives are and they know what’s at stake. I’ve had experience in the Champions League during my time at Celtic, as have these players. Qualification is one of our priorities. We know it’s a difficult road to travel but it’s one we’re prepared and ready for.<br /><br />The experience that I’ve had will stand us in good stead, and as a core group, these players know what to expect. I think it’s harsh that we need to play four qualifiers but we have to accept that. It’s almost as good as winning a trophy, qualifying for the Champions League. This is the first step in hopefully achieving that. The game will sway to and fro and they’re going to be tight. We’ve no divine right to get into the Champions League, but from our perspective it’d be massive for the club to qualify.</p>

Speaking about the possibility of the 22-year-old moving to Arsenal]</b> I have taken no notice of the headlines. I am well aware of where we are in terms of the situation. I spoke to Kieran in Austria and to be honest I haven’t really seen much of him because he came back early for rehab, so has not been on the training ground as yet. It can be an unsettling period for any player and that is understandable but until a club comes up with any sort of realistic valuation of the player we don’t have to do anything and we won’t. It’s as you were. Kieran is getting on with his rehabilitation and we are getting on with what we have to do here</p>

  <p><b>[Neil Lennon says Celtic will not be pushed over in Kieran Tierney transfer talks with Arsenal]</b> We can’t do anything about what clubs do in England. £50m for Wan-Bissaka is a lot of money and we feel that Kieran is a far more experienced and rounded full-back at this juncture in his career. He’s an asset for us and we do have a value for the player and we rate the player very highly. So disrespectful is the wrong word but we’re certainly not going to be pushed over in any negotiations and we’re in a very strong position with regard to a number of our assets in the team<br /><br />The club’s valuation of Kieran has not been met and until then we don’t have a discussion to make. I don’t know what Arsenal’s financial state is. I know what ours is and we are quite comfortable with the situation at the moment. There has been a second bid, the bid has been rejected and it’s as you were. He’s a great player and a great talent. He’s just 22 years old and has so much more to give to the game. It doesn’t surprise me that there are potential suitors. It’s a compliment for all the work he’s done over the years. He’s got a long-term contract and we don’t want him to go</p>

The games in between the European ties are very important in terms topping up the fitness levels of the ones who maybe didn’t play in midweek, while the ones who have had a longer off-season maybe need a bit more sharpness.

It is as you were a week ago. Two bids have been in and two bids have been rejected. That is where we are<br /><br />If there is interest in him then other clubs may come in or Arsenal may come again. I can’t predict that. At the minute he is working away in the background and it is difficult for him to keep focused at times because he is only human. But we are supporting him all we can<br /><br /><b>[The summer transfer window in Scotland will slam shut on September 2, with Celtic eager to ensure that they are not left short when the deadline passes]</b> You always have a contingency plan for cases and work out other options if that worst-case scenario were to happen.

It’s really important to win the game the best we can. Complacency is your enemy in a situation like this. Most people will see Celtic qualifying as a foregone conclusion but we need to be professional. Even in the strong position we’re in, we’re here to compete and to win. I don’t think the scoreline last week flattered us as we played very well. But going away from home in the Champions League, these are difficult ties and we’ll prepare the team as best as we can possibly can<br /><br /><b>[Lennon reserve particular praise for Ryan Christie’s performance last week]</b> Ryan Christie has had a great couple of games. I thought he was fantastic in his all-round game and is weighing in with goals now. Getting goals from attacking midfield is something we’re looking to improve on as the season goes on</p>

That’s not from personal knowledge of anything, that’s just my own experience of things. We know the window shuts on Thursday, so if we are talking about Arsenal then they have five or six days to come back with a revised offer<br /><br /><b>[And transfer talk aside, Lennon freely admits that getting the fan-favourite back up to speed in training has been one of his top priorities]</b> We will continue on and get Kieran back with us and fit as quickly as possible because he is such an important player. <br /><br /><b>[Lennon believes his squad is more than ready to launch their bid for what would be a record-equalling ninth-successive Scottish league title]</b> They don’t really talk about it (nine in a row). That’s for fans and media, it gives them something to talk about. We’ve asked the players whether it’s your first, fifth, seventh or ninth title, have you got the hunger to go again? You can see it in their eyes, they’re well set to go</p>

So until that valuation is met then thankfully we don’t have a decision to make. If we’re talking about Arsenal, they have five or six days to come back in with a revised offer. The closer it comes to the end of the window and then something crops up, we are prepared for that aspect of it, but it’s not welcome</p>

  <p><b>[Cluj vs Celtic. Celtic boss Neil Lennon is under no illusions that his side will have an easy ride]</b> I would imagine this will be our biggest test so far this season. Cluj are the Romanian champions, they negotiated a tough tie in the last round, they’re strong and they’re compact. They cross the ball early, get the ball forward quickly, and they’re well-organised in their defensive structure. We’re away from home in the first leg, so we’ll have to apply ourselves and we’ll have to reset things, in terms of our own mentality, going into this game. But we know what our incentives are and what our motivation is<br /><br /><b>[Speaking on Hatem Abd Elhamed ‘s inclusion]</b> Hatem had a great debut, and I think he set the tone for the game. He was strong, he was very quick and able going forward, and he was comfortable on the ball. He’s also a good size, so aerially, for a full-back, he’s in a good place as well. He can be delighted with his contribution. Unfortunately, he picked up a bit of a dead leg, but we’re hoping he can be fit for Wednesday</p>

Although he is still a young guy, Kieran has given the club so much. He’s a great lad and I’ve really enjoyed working with him. I’m sure he will continue to progress and develop and make a big impact in the English Premiership. It has obviously been a long process, but now it has been finalised we can now look ahead and concentrate on continuing to build our own squad and meet the many challenges ahead, domestically and in Europe</p>

You have to give Cluj credit, they scored a fine goal on the counterattack. But our reaction was superb, with Ryan Christie and Edouard playing brilliantly throughout the game.

You’ve got to do the basics well – you’ve got to stop crosses, close people down, get your head on things – and it was almost as if we scored and wanted to switch off and control the game. In the first half, we were way too passive, way too slow with the tempo, so we gave them a bit of a razz at half-time and we got the right response going 2-1 up. But we needed that two-goal cushion. It’s suicidal the goals we gave away. The first goal, we got a warning before that, and we still didn’t stop the cross and the guy’s got across for a run. If you don’t do the basics defensively well enough then, at this level, you get punished. We’ve let it go. We’ve only ourselves to blame. We had the lead and we let it slip through our own decision-making, really<br /><br /><b>[Lennon is keen to lift his side’s spirits before they now prepare for a play-off to reach the Europa League group stages]</b> We’ve got to work with the players.

A huge boost. Confidence always does a player the world of good. I’m sure they are monitoring him very closely. His record with the French Under-21s is excellent. But they are the World Cup winners and have such strength in depth, so I don’t know. He’s scored in Old Firm games, cup finals and Europe. He’s done all of it. The form he is in is really helping the team. But his record in the big games is outstanding.<br /><br />It’s inevitable he will attract interest. I don’t want to talk about that - I’m in a good mood! He could play in most top leagues and for most top teams, no problem at all. His potential is massive. He’s not only done it at domestic level, he’s done it at European level as well. A price tag? Don’t even ask me. Leave him be!

He was powerful, really strong and quick, a good goalscorer. Eddie is very similar but they are different types. Moussa was more of a target type, if you want to call him that, but he could go in behind as well. Eddie can do a bit of both, he can drop deep and play off the shoulder.<br /><br />There’s always comparisons between players but I’m just delighted with the way he is playing and I’m delighted to be able to work with him. But it would not be fair to say one is better than the other. They are different personalities. You can see by the way he is playing he is happy and his representatives are pretty happy with the way things are going. He’s really quiet, he doesn’t give much away. But he’s a lovely boy. He looks happy. He’s just in a good place and is playing brilliant football. I’m really enjoying working with him and he is very easy to manage.

Odsonne’s just a special talent<br /><br />He has got that aura about him. He can play up on his own or can drop into the spaces and pockets. He’s got good feet, his link up play is getting a lot better which is really important for him. His goal tally already is fantastic<br /><br /><b>[Neil Lennon believes France National Team’s recognition is not out of the question]</b> I’m sure they are monitoring him very closely. He’s a formidable scorer</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic boss Neil Lennon hopes <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Odsonne Edouard</a> stay]</b> I’d love to keep him. I’d give him a five-year deal tomorrow if I could, but I don’t know anything about that and I would know <b>[if there were talks]</b>. But, if it’s true, then brilliant. He’s improving all the time. He’s a talismanic player for us and he’s been absolutely magnificent this season but I think there’s more to come from him and I hope he’s doing that here with us. I definitely think there’s improvement in him. He can get better but he’s already a highly talented player. I think he’d be better off here. I’m sure there’s plenty of suitors so it won’t be down to my decision but I’ll do all I can to keep him. He’s not the type to be banging down your door. He seems quite happy<br /><br />Odsonne’s laid back. He’s got 27 goals already this season and I think he can get to 30 comfortably and that would be a wonderful season for him but it’s not just his goals, his all-round game has been absolutely superb</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic manager Neil Lennon says Celtic players are like caged animals]</b> They’re like caged animals. These are young, fit men who are used to an almost regimented way of living. Their routine is training and playing. All of that is gone. Some of them will be cooking for themselves for the first time in their lives. Mentally, the change can put a strain on them. They are used to intensity and suddenly it’s not there. We are very aware of the mental <b>[health]</b> side of this. We all need to keep our well-being in order. As long as I can get out and get some exercise for my own peace of mind then I’m fine. The silence is deafening when you go out for a walk. The place is deserted. We just have to ride it out as best we can. We are all in the same boat<br /><br />I’m really missing football. I’m missing the players, the staff, the games, the colour, the noise, but it is no bad thing to take a moment and appreciate what you’ve got. I think football will mean a lot more to a lot of people when it returns. What I’m seeing now is us going back to our roots, going back to community life with people looking out for each other and maybe we hadd gone away from that. What is happening is tragic but everybody is pulling together to try to get through it and that is brilliant</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic players and management take ‘significant salary reduction’ amid coronavirus crisis]</b> This club is all about teamwork and solidarity, on and off the park. We are well aware of the economic realities and are very willing to play our part in recognising them. We will come through this in unity and then look forward to the challenges ahead. We also know that many within society, including our own support, are facing distress and, in some cases, tragedy. Everyone at Celtic Football Club, including the players and my own backroom team, expresses our appreciation of the work being done by NHS staff, carers and all who are providing vital public services at this time</p>

  <p><b>[Lennon revels in Celtic’s ‘best’ title triumph after coronavirus ends Scottish Premiership season]</b> To be sitting here now as the manager of the nine in a row, and having played a huge part in that, fills me with so much pride. It feels wonderful and I’m so proud of the players. It’s an incredible record and to be part of that is something very special, and I think it’s thoroughly deserved as well. It’s the best, no question it’s the best and I’ve enjoyed the season immensely. I enjoyed the European campaign and winning the League Cup and I enjoyed working with the players every day, I enjoyed working with my staff. Whether you look at the first half of the season or the second half of the season, we’ve played some brilliant football throughout, and then you throw in the European campaign, you throw in the League Cup. A lot of that gets overlooked with all that’s been going on around Scottish football of late. The style of play pleased me, the amount of goals pleased me, and we had massive contributions from numerous individual players as well</p>

Ultimately he’s a player we want around. He’s a fantastic player. He’s really blossomed over the last couple of seasons. He had a magnificent season this year and we want to keep him. It’s as simple as that. We’re doing everything we can to keep him here for at least another season anyway. I think he is <b>[happy]</b>. I think he’s got a fantastic relationship certainly with me and my backroom team and his team-mates. You can see how much the supporters appreciate him as well. I think that’s reciprocated. He’s grown into a top-class striker. Of course, there is going to be speculation around a player of that quality. But we’re comfortable at the minute with the position we’re in with him</p>

He had all of those attributes - he was quick, composed, brilliant in the air in both boxes. Everything you’re seeing now, at <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> and European level, that’s what I saw. I couldn’t believe there was no English interest. I also couldn’t believe he was at Celtic for two seasons! I thought he might have gone after the first. I like finding players under the radar. Van Dijk is the standout example. He goes for £12m to Southampton, then £75m to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and now he’s probably the best centre-half in the world. We take pride in that. We take pride in <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> going to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> for £25m. There is a lot of untapped natural talent here.

  <p><b>[Fraser Forster: Celtic chasing new goalkeeper after talks go cold]</b> We are looking at other options. There was a deal <b>[for Forster]</b> agreed between the clubs but it’s gone quiet from the player’s side of things. We would dearly love him back here but if that’s not going to be the case then we’ll look elsewhere. We’re looking at a number of options on the goalkeeping front. It’s such an important position and Fraser did wonderful things for us last season. We’ve got big gloves to fill if you want to put it that way but ideally we’ll try to get an exceptional number one in again<br /><br /><b>[Lennon admits the current closed-door restrictions are frustrating his attempts to sniff out fresh recruits]</b> It’s different. A bit fragmented obviously. We’ll probably get a fairer idea of the transfer market once <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and other main leagues in Europe finish. But it’s been predominantly business as usual. We’ve got a lot of options for a lot of positions. The difficult thing is we can’t look at players live at the minute.</p>

  <p><b>[Lennon: 10th title would be monumental]</b> We’re very excited. It’s great to have the players back the last few weeks. It’s a big season for us domestically and on the European front as well. We’ve got to just take it as the next title really. For some of the players that will come it will be the first, for some it will be the 10th, but we have to keep a balance and just say ‘look this is the next challenge to win’. There’s going to be a lot of hype surrounding it from the outside and we’ve just got to find our levels and our consistency as quickly as we possibly can. It is monumental what we’re going for but we can’t let that distract us from playing the games, and not looking too far ahead.</p>

  <p><b>[Neil Lennon blasts Leigh Griffiths for returning to Celtic overweight]</b> I’m not happy. I think that’s fairly obvious by the fact that we’ve left him behind. He’s come back out of condition and overweight. Any physical work we asked him to do, he was coming out of saying he was injured. That’s going to be the case because he’s out of condition. It would have been absolutely pointless bringing him with us. We had an extensive week in Loughborough and he wouldn’t have been fit to play the games here. The ball is firmly in his court in terms of getting in the right condition. He needs to stop all the social media nonsense with all these slogans he puts out there. The boys here are all top professionals and I have a great staff who are all professional as well. They deserve better and he should know better. If he wants to have a future here at the club, it’s down to himself. We’re not prepared to do a lot more for him. Everything’s there for him. He’s let himself down and he’s let us down</p>
