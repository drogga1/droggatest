  <p><b>[Former Celtic boss Neil Lennon has sent a warning to those tipping Steven Gerrard to oversee a reversal in fortune for Rangers]</b> I think it’s too early to say if Celtic and Rangers are going to go on and become the top two teams. There’s obviously a significant improvement at Rangers - but for me it was not that major a job to do on the back of what wasn’t a great season for them last year. They are investing, which is something the likes of ourselves, Aberdeen and Hearts can’t do. But on any given day any team can be beaten. I still think Celtic will win the league. Whether the gap gets closer remains to be seen. Rangers will be firm favourites for second place but I don’t believe in the hype. There is a lot of hysteria around big clubs, not just in Scotland but England and elsewhere. But when you sit down and watch the games, you think, ‘Mmm… mmm. Not so sure’.</p>

  <p><b>[Hibs vs Rangers]</b> Gerrard was one of my heroes as a player. As a manager now, he’s getting the best out of that group of players which augurs well for the future. I was surprised that he took the Rangers job … Rangers is a very difficult job - a big job. It’s a very difficult first job, in particular. Especially coming from the outside in. It took guts to do that. He has that quiet steel and self-belief and it is a great quality and admirable.<br /><br />Rangers like Celtic are beatable although they’re top of the league for a reason. The win on Sunday will have given everyone a lift. We’ve taken one huge step forward and now we need to take another. We know we’re capable of beating anyone in this league. We have to replicate Sunday’s performance against Rangers now. We have to be consistent and the players have set their marker</p>

After one day I pulled him in after training and said to him ‘Look, you’re not going to be here long, so enjoy yourself’. He was just that good. And I couldn’t believe our luck that we had got him from Groningen for €2million. He had everything. Pace, great physicality, technique and superb in the air in both boxes.</p>

  <p><b>[Neil Lennon might have overseen two victories since returning to Celtic as interim manager]</b> I think we can score more goals. I think we can get the ball forward a little bit quicker. We have great pace in wide areas and through the middle in an attacking sense so I would like us to utilise that a little bit quicker if we can. But I understand teams like Hibs for example on Saturday and even Hearts when they went down to 10 men, they get back into shape very, very early, and sometimes you can’t move the ball quickly, and it requires a little bit of patience and probing. But maybe just varying attacks a bit more when we get into the final third - but you can’t have everything. The lads have been absolutely fantastic this season, the last two seasons and certainly in my tenure so far, even though it’s embryonic, they have played great</p>

  <p><b>[Dundee vs Celtic]</b> We looked leggy, little bit fatigued, and I understand that. Psychologically, they’re a little bit fatigued, too, after everything that’s happened. There was always going to be a lull and hopefully that’s over now. If you can’t win it, don’t lose it, and it’s a point going forward. That’s three really difficult games in 10 days and we have come out unscathed. The gap is still eight points so we move on.</p>

It’s unacceptable<br /><br />We’ve come away with a fantastic win against a very motivated Rangers side. I can’t ask for any more from my players. Rangers’ goal made everyone a little anxious. We should have been on the front foot but it was all or nothing for <b>[Rangers]</b> today. At 1-0 the game’s always in the balance even against 10 men. We looked a little naive at times but we re-galvanised and scored a great goal to win. I thought Odsonne Edouard was the best player on the pitch by a country mile</p>

It’s been quite a while coming so I’m delighted for the Hibs public. But we are coming into the game knowing what our motivation is and that is to win and win well off the back of a very convincing semi-final performance last week. Psychologically the boys are in a good place and we need to do maintain it.<br /><br />I am aware the team does get leaked and I’m really not happy about it. Someone is letting us down.

He’s a very good player and he’s been a good player since he walked in the door. He’s made a big contribution in the goals column and that experience and football intelligence is always important to have around. There’s a familiarity with Scott. Going into the Champions League qualifiers next season, he’ll be one we don’t have to go and replace. He’s played a lot of games this season so I wouldn’t say he’s struggled for time on the pitch. Under me, he’s played maybe played 75 to 80 per cent of the games. He maybe hasn’t hit the heights of his first season but that was a stellar season and it’s very difficult to replicate that year on year. We know what we’ve got with Scott - he’s an excellent player and always a threat</p>

But you have to ignore that, stay focused, and they’ve done an amazing job, the players. It’s been really, really tough. It’s been the toughest piece of management I’ve had to do.

I was lucky enough to carry it on so it’s a great moment for me personally and for my family. It just felt right this week. We kept really calm, with all the emotions this week of Billy’s funeral.

They don’t remember the 1990s as the older generation do. I can’t take it for granted, they might. That comes from an immaturity from their point of view.

People saying, ‘well the performances aren’t the same’, well they are. If I had gone in there and changed things and it hadn’t worked, then I would’ve been making a huge mistake. It was important to get the players over the line, win the league. The training, everything, we kept the same. You’ve got to put the players first. It’s an important piece of the club’s history that they could achieve here. Going forward, the style of play I think can be a little bit different. Teams are starting to work out the way we play. We need to be more flexible in our style. I was a bit shocked that Brendan had left, just the timing of it, but it’s understandable because it’s a professional decision at the end of the day and he’s back in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> with a great club that I know of.

  <p><b>[Neil Lennon says he saw similarities between <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> and ex-Manchester United defender <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a> when he arrived at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> in 2013]</b> He was <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a> in the making. He had all of those attributes - he was quick, composed, brilliant in the air in both boxes. Everything you’re seeing now, at <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> and European level, that’s what I saw. I couldn’t believe there was no English interest. I also couldn’t believe he was at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> for two seasons! I thought he might have gone after the first. I like finding players under the radar. <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> is the standout example. He goes for £12m to <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>, then £75m to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and now he’s probably the best centre-half in the world. We take pride in that. We take pride in <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> going to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> for £25m. There is a lot of untapped natural talent here. Ideally, you’d love to hold on to these players because then we’d have a strong chance of achieving something in Europe.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> manager Neil Lennon has passed comment on the future of <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Odsonne Edouard</a>, the club’s much-coveted forward player]</b> Will there be bids for Odsonne? I don’t know. There’s been no bids for anyone at the minute, which is pleasing because I want to maintain the continuity</p>

  <p><b>[Fraser Forster: <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> chasing new goalkeeper after talks go cold]</b> We are looking at other options. There was a deal <b>[for Forster]</b> agreed between the clubs but it’s gone quiet from the player’s side of things. We would dearly love him back here but if that’s not going to be the case then we’ll look elsewhere. We’re looking at a number of options on the goalkeeping front. It’s such an important position and Fraser did wonderful things for us last season. We’ve got big gloves to fill if you want to put it that way but ideally we’ll try to get an exceptional number one in again<br /><br /><b>[Lennon admits the current closed-door restrictions are frustrating his attempts to sniff out fresh recruits]</b> It’s different. A bit fragmented obviously. We’ll probably get a fairer idea of the transfer market once <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and other main leagues in Europe finish. But it’s been predominantly business as usual. We’ve got a lot of options for a lot of positions. The difficult thing is we can’t look at players live at the minute.</p>

  <p><b>[Lennon: 10th title would be monumental]</b> We’re very excited. It’s great to have the players back the last few weeks. It’s a big season for us domestically and on the European front as well. We’ve got to just take it as the next title really. For some of the players that will come it will be the first, for some it will be the 10th, but we have to keep a balance and just say ‘look this is the next challenge to win’. There’s going to be a lot of hype surrounding it from the outside and we’ve just got to find our levels and our consistency as quickly as we possibly can. It is monumental what we’re going for but we can’t let that distract us from playing the games, and not looking too far ahead.</p>

  <p><b>[Neil Lennon blasts Leigh Griffiths for returning to <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> overweight]</b> I’m not happy. I think that’s fairly obvious by the fact that we’ve left him behind. He’s come back out of condition and overweight. Any physical work we asked him to do, he was coming out of saying he was injured. That’s going to be the case because he’s out of condition. It would have been absolutely pointless bringing him with us. We had an extensive week in Loughborough and he wouldn’t have been fit to play the games here. The ball is firmly in his court in terms of getting in the right condition. He needs to stop all the social media nonsense with all these slogans he puts out there. The boys here are all top professionals and I have a great staff who are all professional as well. They deserve better and he should know better. If he wants to have a future here at the club, it’s down to himself. We’re not prepared to do a lot more for him. Everything’s there for him. He’s let himself down and he’s let us down</p>
