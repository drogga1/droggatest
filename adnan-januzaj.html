  <p><b>[Adnan Januzaj says Paul Pogba has quizzed him on his future]</b> Paul is a great player. He made a different choice but eventually he was successful and he has returned. He remains a great player. He’s a very good friend. At United, we were always together. We went to dinner together, played the PlayStation. He was a brother to me.<br /><br />Of course, Paul asks if I’ll be back at Manchester United. He wants to play with me. But I am now at Sunderland and I have to do what’s right for the club. These are decisions from above. I’m a professional footballer and I have to remain professional and work<br /><br />My goal is always to play at Manchester United. But you should always keep your ears open and keep options. You cannot play for the future. I have a contract until 2018. There are many clubs interested. It is up to me to work, the rest will come</p>

  <p><b>[Adnan Januzaj has taken to Twitter to post a farewell message to Manchester United fans Wednesday]</b> Where to start … I’ve had some incredible moments with Manchester United since I joined. I want to say a massive thank you to all my team-mates that have come and gone from the club. It’s been a pleasure to play with you all. Thank you to some of the coaches and staff that work at Manchester United to make it such a great club!<br /><br />Unfortunately, my time at the club has come to an end and it didn’t go the way I wanted it to go but I will always have love for Manchester United. And finally, a huge thank you to the fans that have stuck by me through the good and bad times! I will never forget that positive support. Thank you #GGMU</p>

  <p><b>[Januzaj slams ‘stupid’ questioning of his attitude during Man Utd spell]</b> If I only played for a contract, I would have stopped football right away. Since I was a little boy, I have loved this game. I started from age four and it’s all I wanted. Those suggestions are stupid. I had very good stats when I came on. Sir Alex texted me and called during that spell. He told me, ‘Keep working hard, never give up, life goes on, you have quality and never stop working’. I needed that. Giggsy was assistant during <b>[Louis]</b> Van Gaal’s time. He always talked to me and tried to help. He could see I was not the Adnan everyone knows.<br /><br />Jose had to make things happen very quickly and make quick decisions. I had not been playing for two years. He is a great manager and he has been fair to me because he let me leave to improve somewhere else. That’s how the world goes and I look forward. I know Sir Alex is always at the end of the phone. The same with Giggsy and David. Those people will always back me. My first job now is to impress here. I’m hoping for a World Cup place. The world does not stop</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United wonderkid Adnan Januzaj has hit out at those who have questioned his mentality]</b> These are the people that don’t know anything about football. I don’t care, I keep working hard. You can only go in one direction, and that is to shut those people up. Once you do it, they will look ridiculous. It will feel amazing, I will feel very good because those people were chatting shit about me. If anything, I’m even happier because it gives me more power. It gives me the feeling: I want to show these people that if they want to talk badly of me, I’ll show them. It’s a challenge for me, I don’t mind. They can say whatever, I know that it is not true.<br /><br />“I gave up a lot. Everyone likes to go out with friends and that kind of stuff, but I always had that mindset of football and people behind me that were very strict with me. My dad was very strict. He always told me: ‘Do you want to be a professional? Because this is how it is going to be’. I wanted to be a professional player. Now, I give a lot of credit to him because he is the one that always pushed me further and further to try and become better and better</p>

  <p><b>[Adnan Januzaj believes he is good enough for Manchester United]</b> I didn’t really get a chance because at the time he <b>[Mourinho]</b> probably wanted more experienced players with names<br /><br />For me, it wasn’t a problem. I had to move on and now I am happy in Spain and making a difference. I always knew I had the quality to play for Manchester United. I know what I am capable of. They didn’t give me a chance but it’s not a problem. I am happy in Spain and enjoying my football<br /><br />They <b>[Manchester United]</b> are struggling, it is a great team and great fans but they are struggling at the moment. Obviously, they are going to get back on top. I think they need to make the right decisions to win games. There are many different reasons <b>[why they are struggling]</b>, so they need to make the right decisions</p>

  <p><b>[Adnan Januzaj has suggested that a penchant for long ball in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and a lack of faith from <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> are to blame for the struggles he endured at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> It’s been a good move. I had other options but I really wanted to come and play in Spain. I also looked at how the team was … they love football and they love to play the beautiful game - that’s the most important thing in football and why you play.​ <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> suits my style. It is much more technical, players are much more skilful. The positioning of the players is really clever. In England, it’s a bit more physical, a bit long ball, more direct. In Spain, most of the teams try and play from the back. It’s great to have players around you who are comfortable on the ball, too, because it helps you. It makes attacking easier, it makes the difference<br /><br /><b>[Januzaj believes his progress at United was stunted by the arrival of Van Gaal]</b> I grew up there <b>[United]</b>, I was really happy until one year I had a bit of a struggle with the manager and that slowed me down. I always knew I had all the qualities to turn things around. The problem was, I was not playing and, then, every time I came in, it was difficult to change the game or make something happen, so, obviously, then imagine playing for a year like this? It makes it more difficult for you<br /><br /><b>[Januzaj’s cause was made all the more difficult as a creative midfielder]</b> Exactly, because you are the one player who can make the difference, score goals and you can imagine if he <b>[the manager]</b> does not give you the confidence to take your opponent on, it gets even more difficult for you because you don’t know what to do: to attack or to play simple. I came in for a lot of criticism but, for me, it’s not a problem because I never look back on it. I just keep doing my stuff and now I’m in another league, I’m happy, I played in my second World Cup, I scored against England, too, so I showed to people that against an English team, who all play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I can still make the difference. It was a good moment</p>

  <p><b>[Reflecting on this goalless season under Van Gaal, Januzaj admits]</b> There was not the same freedom. A winger needs that confidence, a manager telling you, ‘go and take people on’. With him, it was a slow passing game. I was frustrated and everyone could see that I was not the same Adnan as the first year. I was sometimes even in the stands<br /><br /><b>[Januzaj was shipped out on another loan in August 2016, this time to Sunderland to link up with old mentor <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a>, who placed great faith in the player, saying]</b> It’s a big boost, because it’s the level of quality I would like to bring here. This boy can play two or three different positions, he’s got an ability to go past people, score goals, make goals. He’s got the talent to be a big, big player<br /><br /><b>[He briefly lost his place in the <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a> team and as a result was dropped by Belgium manager <a href="roberto-martinez.html">Roberto Martinez</a> who said]</b> He needs to be playing more. Talent on its own is not enough. You have to have the mentality of helping the team<br /><br /><b>[Januzaj has confirmed that his resurgence at Sociedad could have been cut short by yet another transfer switch, but acknowledged that now, more than ever, he needs to justify his apparent potential]</b> Of course there were things, but I stayed and I am very happy.<br /><br />Well, my colleagues have helped me in that regard, because a few weeks ago the fans were a little bit on top of me. But as a player I don’t care, they know the quality I have and expect much more from me. I get it. But now I am in a good moment, especially physically. And that’s good, because I also have peace of mind in my head.<br /><br />I believe that with my quality I have to score more goals and make more assists. I am a player who must make a difference in all matches. I have to get at it, that’s what I’m missing</p>

I really should not be defending myself against him, I think the statistics say it all. Every time I made the difference with an assist or a goal, I was always out of the team for the next match. It was the same with Memphis (Depay). He does not speak the truth if he says that he gave us plenty of opportunities, it’s as simple as that.
