  <p><b>[Guadalajara to host 2020 Concacaf Olympic qualifying tournament]</b> I am sure that it will be a great experience for the 8 teams that will try to secure a slot in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, as well as for the fans, since Guadalajara is a city that is characterized by the warmth and joy of its people, for its extensive culture, its delicious cuisine, as well as being the land of Mariachi, one of our cultural icons, also considered a World Heritage Site<br /><br />We appreciate the privilege for our federation to collaborate with Concacaf and the Government of Jalisco in organizing this important event</p>

  <p><b>[The Mexican federation (FMF) also will put efforts into place to keep fans from using ‘goalkeeper chant’ as well. <a href="fmf.html">FMF</a> president Yon de Luisa said Mexico risks its spot in the World Cup should incidents continue]</b> Matches start in the second half of 2020 for the process of qualifying for the World Cup in Qatar. If we don’t have this problem resolved before the World Cup qualification matches for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, we’d be putting ourselves in risk of being punished with losing points, and - worst case scenario - with elimination from the World Cup qualification tournament<br /><br /><b>[Mexico has faced fines in the past, consequences could be more severe going forward after <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s new protocol]</b> This summer <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> modified its disciplinary code. <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> will take action against these in stadiums all over the world. In Mexico’s case, we’re repeat offenders because we have 14 previous sanctions. The possible stipulations in this new <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> code could apply: fines, prohibitions against playing in certain stadiums, a points deduction, forfeited games, playing without fans, being kicked out of a tournament or competition and in the case of the clubs being sent to a lower division</p>

  <p><b>[Mexican FA president Yon de Luisa says a competition like the Copa America Centenario would be critical for Mexico’s growth]</b> On the level of possibility for calendar questions, that part already has been resolved. Today more then ever, the possibility is open. On the level of negotiations with Concacaf and Conmebol, today there aren’t any<br /><br />It’s on us to keep pushing. I’ve been saying for more than 10 years and now as the responsible party for the country’s national team and with the vote we have within Concacaf and the close relationship we have with (Concacaf president Victor) <a href="victor-montagliani.html">Montagliani</a>, every time we meet - which we’ll do this very week, we’re going to have a meeting to share advice in Miami - and once again we’ll say that for us it would be very important to have this Copa Continental with Mexico not being invited to the Copa America but if we have continental tournament where teams from Conmebol and teams from Concacaf have a great tournament like we had in 2016<br /><br />One of the positive things Mr. Martino presented in the last meeting with (Liga MX) owners was, ‘Gentlemen, don’t be surprised if we’re go play more games in South America. That rather than bring in hundreds of opponents to Mexico or the United States we should go to their houses,’. We might play against Colombia in Colombia, we might play against Ecuador in Ecuador. We have to require our boys to play games that are more difficult. Why? So that when we’re in the group stage of the World Cup, it’s more natural to have that kind of competition</p>
