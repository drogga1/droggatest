  <p><b>[Sebastien Corchia says he is thrilled that Marcelo Bielsa has agreed to become Lille head coach]</b> We are all excited about Bielsa arriving this summer. We saw Bielsa in Marseille as a coach who developed his players enormously. He has a great reputation, and his style of football will be exciting for players and fans. But football is not about what happens next season - it is all about working hard and producing here and now. As a club, we want to make big progress, but we want it to start right now and not wait till next season<br /><br />I don’t know my own future yet because this summer I will have only one year left on my contract. So it will be a good time to have a look at plans for the next stage of my career, especially as I am entering what normally is the best years for a football player<br /><br />It is a super group of players all sharing very high ambitions for the future of the France team. I feel comfortable on that international level, and it is an enormous motivation for me to work hard every day at training to keep on developing myself and to be able to produce my very best on the pitch in every game. My debut brought me a lot of pride. It is a whole new dimension for me. Returning to Clairefontaine, where I spent three years as a youth player in the academy, and representing my country. It was always my dream to play for Les Bleus - as a child and ever since I was the captain of the France U21 team<br /><br />I enjoy hearing about stats like this - you can’t argue against facts. People often ask me about my attacking skills with free-kicks, running against the opponent and crossing, but my most important role is to defend - I am a defender. So, I am happy to see proof that I do a good job winning my duels. Actually, I also saw another stat, that I am the most fouled right-back in Ligue 1, and that is a nice stat as well. I love to defend, and I enjoy both the tactical part of that and to go in there trying to win every little battle, direct challenge and duel with my opponent. As a defender, I treasure every clean sheet like I have scored a goal - and every won duel is just the same good feeling for me as when I deliver a dangerous cross in attack</p>

  <p><b>[Kylian Mbappe can become ‘truly great’]</b> Kylian is a super talent and he has all the qualities to become a truly great player - and what an impact he has made this season. Kylian is really impressive. Last week I trained with him for a few days with the France squad, so I’ up to date on him, and I must say, that his development is fantastic. He is a very intelligent player and he is surrounded by good people. That is a great plus, which can really make a big difference in a career. The surroundings, the entourage, of a football player are so important.<br /><br />I know his family well. His father was my coach when I was 13 years old at AS Bondy. Kylian was always following us at matches and tournaments, and I remember that he always had a ball with him. Already at that age it was easy to see that he had a great talent with the ball. Now everybody can see that<br /><br /><b>[Coupe de France]</b> The cup is different. It is our chance to play more freely, since we have nothing to lose and everything to win in a game like this against Monaco. They have had a fantastic season whereas we can only surprise - and that is exactly what we intend to do<br /><br />We found ourselves in a position where we suddenly had to tackle the pressure of a relegation battle. I think we responded well to that unexpected challenge. The away win against Bastia was another important step forward, and as a defender I was happy to help securing another clean sheet. It was a good win for us, and in my opinion we showed great fighting spirit in our performance - like we have done recently, when we have finally been getting a better string of results</p>

  <p><b>[France international Sebastien Corchia has revealed that he is looking forward to a successful spell with Benfica]</b> Benfica is a club with big ambitions - and I have big ambitions. It is a top club, and I have come here to give everything for the club with the mission to win titles. It is an honour and a pride to wear the jersey of the biggest and most successful club in Portugal - and a club with a superb history in Europe as well. I want to win titles and do great in Europe - and Benfica is the perfect club for that. Winning is a part of the club’s DNA, and I felt that from the first moment. Lisbon is a beautiful city - and Portugal a beautiful county. I am looking forward to living here with my family.<br /><br />I also see Benfica as a way back into the French team, or, who knows, maybe the Italian team, since I am half Italian and half French. I was proud to be captain for France U21 years ago, but I won’t rule out anything. Actually, it is an advantage to have dual citizenship, because the fact that I now speak French, Italian and Spanish will help me to adapt very quickly to Portuguese as well<br /><br />I can’t believe how unlucky I am right now. I have arrived 100 percent fit and with a huge appetite to play for my new club, and then I was so unfortunate with my knee. I am frustrated and sad because I want to help the team. But I will turn my emotions into extra energy, and I will work hard to get back very soon. The doctors say about four weeks, and I can’t wait to play for this great club. It is really not typical for me. Last season I was also injured in Sevilla and missed half of the season, but I have never been injured like this before in my entire career. Normally I play every game. The season before I played all 38 matches for Lille in Ligue 1 - so now I just want to get back to full power and show everybody, that I can help this great club</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> star Sebastien Corchia has admitted that he does not know where his future lies next season]</b> I am in a situation now where <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> has told me that I can look for a new club, and my agent will take a look at the opportunities. Otherwise my contract with <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> runs for two more years. I have heard rumours about interest from clubs from France, Spain, Italy, England and other countries, but to be honest I have not paid a lot of attention to that - just kept my focus on working hard every day in <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>. So right now, I don’t know where I will play next season. My appetite for football is huge. At 28, I have just entered the best age for a footballer, and right now I am so excited about the future. For sure it will be a summer of interesting opportunities to look at - and some big decisions for me to make. My agent and I want to find the perfect club, where I can play week in, week out and perform at my very best<br /><br />We won the title, and I can be proud of some very good performances especially in the Europa League, but in general it was obviously not a very lucky season for me. Two frustrating injuries were not good for my rhythm. The first one was a minor knee injury just three days after arriving in <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> - what a terribly unlucky start that was, it’s crazy. And again at the end of the season, in the Europa League quarter-final against <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Frankfurt</a>, I was unlucky again with an injury, that kept me out for the rest of the season<br /><br />After the first injury, I was 100 per cent back, but I did not play enough games in a row to build up the maximum power. You need that consistency. I could play a difficult Europa League away game on a Thursday and make a great performance, but then I would not play the next games in the Portuguese league. That was too much stop and go for me. At one point I asked the club to be allowed to go to the second team to get a couple of matches, simply to feel the consistent match rhythm again. It is natural for me to leave <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> after my loan, because I did not play enough games, and that was not perfect for the club or for me. I still believe, that it could have been very different and a start of a great relationship between <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> and me, because the club’s style of play is perfect for my style of play<br /><br />In <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> things have changed a lot since I arrived two years ago. It is a completely new situation. Coaches have changed, sports directors have changed. People come to a club with new ideas about what kind of players you want to use, and what style of football, you want to play. That’s football<br /><br /><b>[Capped once for France, when he featured against Ivory Coast in 2016, he is eager to win his spot back for the national side]</b> I have so many ambitions for the future heading into my best football years. Of course Les Bleus are always in my heart, but I only concentrate on hard work every day at training and in the matches</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastien Corchia is eager to impress in Espanyol’s Europa League clash on Thursday away to Ferencvaros to make a point to coach Machin and earn a regular place in the club’s starting XI]</b> I have enjoyed some super performances in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, and I can see that from the stats. I have been doing a fine job in defence, with interceptions and blocks, and in attack I have been delivering crosses and key passes. So I am happy with my stats, which prove my qualities - and the rest is always up to the coach. That’s football<br /><br />I feel that the season started really well for me with good performances in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> for my new club, and as a team we have also had a lot of success in the Europa League games so far. Now we have to make sure that we win the group with our away game against Ferencvaros. That would be ideal. With our qualities, I believe it is only natural that we must win the group and qualify for the knockout stage of the competition. The level of the clubs in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> is so superior to other leagues that we must go far in the Europa League. We have shown that strength so far and we deservedly lead the group. We could go far in this tournament. I have played more in the Europa League than in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, but as a player you always want to play every game, and I work hard every day at training to convince the coach to use me more in La Liga<br /><br /><b>[Since Machin, who loaned Corchia to <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> from <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> last term, arrived at the club, there has been a switch in system from a back four to a back three]</b> I see myself both as a right-back in a four-man defence as well as the right wing-back or right midfielder in the new system, so that is no problem for me. I can play both systems. Some of my best qualities are in defence, and some of them are in attack, which the stats show quite clearly. So this change in system is not a problem for me. I actually believe that the new system fits me well</p>
