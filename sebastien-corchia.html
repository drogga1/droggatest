  <p><b>[<a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> star Sebastien Corchia has admitted that he does not know where his future lies next season]</b> I am in a situation now where <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> has told me that I can look for a new club, and my agent will take a look at the opportunities. Otherwise my contract with <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> runs for two more years. I have heard rumours about interest from clubs from France, Spain, Italy, England and other countries, but to be honest I have not paid a lot of attention to that - just kept my focus on working hard every day in <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>. So right now, I don’t know where I will play next season. My appetite for football is huge. At 28, I have just entered the best age for a footballer, and right now I am so excited about the future. For sure it will be a summer of interesting opportunities to look at - and some big decisions for me to make. My agent and I want to find the perfect club, where I can play week in, week out and perform at my very best<br /><br />We won the title, and I can be proud of some very good performances especially in the Europa League, but in general it was obviously not a very lucky season for me. Two frustrating injuries were not good for my rhythm. The first one was a minor knee injury just three days after arriving in <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> - what a terribly unlucky start that was, it’s crazy. And again at the end of the season, in the Europa League quarter-final against <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Frankfurt</a>, I was unlucky again with an injury, that kept me out for the rest of the season<br /><br />After the first injury, I was 100 per cent back, but I did not play enough games in a row to build up the maximum power. You need that consistency. I could play a difficult Europa League away game on a Thursday and make a great performance, but then I would not play the next games in the Portuguese league. That was too much stop and go for me. At one point I asked the club to be allowed to go to the second team to get a couple of matches, simply to feel the consistent match rhythm again. It is natural for me to leave <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> after my loan, because I did not play enough games, and that was not perfect for the club or for me. I still believe, that it could have been very different and a start of a great relationship between <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> and me, because the club’s style of play is perfect for my style of play<br /><br />In <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> things have changed a lot since I arrived two years ago. It is a completely new situation. Coaches have changed, sports directors have changed. People come to a club with new ideas about what kind of players you want to use, and what style of football, you want to play. That’s football<br /><br /><b>[Capped once for France, when he featured against Ivory Coast in 2016, he is eager to win his spot back for the national side]</b> I have so many ambitions for the future heading into my best football years. Of course Les Bleus are always in my heart, but I only concentrate on hard work every day at training and in the matches</p>

  <p><b>[Sebastien Corchia is eager to impress in Espanyol’s Europa League clash on Thursday away to Ferencvaros to make a point to coach Machin and earn a regular place in the club’s starting XI]</b> I have enjoyed some super performances in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, and I can see that from the stats. I have been doing a fine job in defence, with interceptions and blocks, and in attack I have been delivering crosses and key passes. So I am happy with my stats, which prove my qualities - and the rest is always up to the coach. That’s football<br /><br />I feel that the season started really well for me with good performances in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> for my new club, and as a team we have also had a lot of success in the Europa League games so far. Now we have to make sure that we win the group with our away game against Ferencvaros. That would be ideal. With our qualities, I believe it is only natural that we must win the group and qualify for the knockout stage of the competition. The level of the clubs in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> is so superior to other leagues that we must go far in the Europa League. We have shown that strength so far and we deservedly lead the group. We could go far in this tournament. I have played more in the Europa League than in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, but as a player you always want to play every game, and I work hard every day at training to convince the coach to use me more in La Liga<br /><br /><b>[Since Machin, who loaned Corchia to <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> from <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> last term, arrived at the club, there has been a switch in system from a back four to a back three]</b> I see myself both as a right-back in a four-man defence as well as the right wing-back or right midfielder in the new system, so that is no problem for me. I can play both systems. Some of my best qualities are in defence, and some of them are in attack, which the stats show quite clearly. So this change in system is not a problem for me. I actually believe that the new system fits me well</p>
