  <p>[Yann Sommer not worried about transfer speculation over Gladbach stars Thorgan Hazard and Alassane Plea] Thorgan is a player who can always surprise. He is able at any time to create a new situation by dribbling, can use his team-mates and is fast. Because of his creativity, he is very hard to defend and therefore very important to us.<br /><br />Football is a business and a lot is spoken and written. It is normal for rumours to be spread. We do not deal with such things within the squad, these things only rob energy. These are things that we do not need during the season. If you are successful as a team and the individual players perform well, other clubs automatically become aware of you. That’s how the business works<br /><br />Such a rumour only arises if the player and the team are working well, so I would by no means label such reports as negative. I have a contract until 2021 and a lot can happen by then. I have not thought about things that come afterwards</p>

  <p>[Speaking alongside <a href="vladimir-petkovic.html">Vladimir Petkovic</a>, Borussia Monchengladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer said Switzerland could be proud of the exploits of <a href="xherdan-shaqiri.html">Xherdan Shaqiri</a> and <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a>] For us as a team it was great to have so many players who have such great experiences. That <a href="xherdan-shaqiri.html">Shaqiri</a> was able to win the Champions League was fantastic. We are very proud. It’s excellent to have him and Granit on board - playing the Europa League final is also something special. All of those experiences strengthen us as a team. <a href="xherdan-shaqiri.html">Shaqiri</a> came back and there was a lot of euphoria. Now we are focusing on the game tomorrow.</p>
