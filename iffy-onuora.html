<blockquote>
  <p><b>[PFA sees spike in reports of racist abuse since lockdown]</b> They are thick skinned and resilient, so they are not going anywhere. Let’s face it, whatever abuse is sent out we have got to call it out, of course. These guys are role models, incredibly capable and talented guys. They are going to continue doing their jobs. That is their message. There has been a massive spike <b>[in abuse]</b> and maybe the lockdown has only exacerbated that. You have people stuck at home alone in doors, with just a computer to while away the time. And I am aware some of the data that has led to a spike of online hate crimes … we have just got to try and react to that better and quicker than we do at the moment<br /><br />They have this power that has come into them now, through the way we all conduct our lives, which is fine. No one would want to turn the clock back. But with that power comes responsibility and we have to push the social media companies. I am pleased that the government are talking about OFCOM or certainly a regulatory body monitoring the work of social media, like other media have the same.</p>
