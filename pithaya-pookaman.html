<blockquote>
  <p>On the May 7 and 8, the Election Commission (EC) certified 95 per cent of the election results on constituency MPs and party-list MPs respectively. The remaining 5 per cent will be tabulated when the cases involving possible disqualification of some candidates are settled.<br /><br />As expected, the Puea Thai party, linked to former prime minister <a href="thaksin-shinawatra.html">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> who has lived in self-exile since 2008, won most lower house seats with 136 MPs, followed by the junta-aligned Palang Pracharat Party with 115 seats and the youthful Future Forward Party (FFP) with 80 seats. The Democrat Party, Thailand’s oldest political party, has had to swallow its pride with only 52 seats<br /><br />The delay in the official announcement of the results stems from the flawed election tallies by the EC which, being plagued with poor management and inefficiency, subsequently failed to explain several allegations of irregularities in vote tabulation as well as report 1.9 million invalidated ballots. The ballot cast in some provinces far exceeded the voter turnout<br /><br />The constitution was crafted by the junta-appointed drafting committee, with the prime intention of maintaining junta’s stranglehold on power for a foreseeable period. It was hurriedly bulldozed through a referendum without free public debate or opposition scrutiny. The main thrust of the constitution was to weaken the fully elected 500-member legislative branch and strengthen the judicial branch, particularly the Constitutional Court and ‘independent’ organs such as the EC and the Counter Corruption Commission, which are anything but truly independent<br /><br />The Palang Pracharat Party, of which <a href="prayuth-chan-ocha.html">Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> is the candidate for prime minister, only needs 125 votes in the lower house to secure the top job, with the Senate widely expected to vote en masse for the current leader. This minimum electoral requirement can easily be achieved with the help of allies the Democrat Party and Phumjai Thai Party. As an added bonus, Palang Pracharat could well bring the Democrat Party, the Phumjai Thai Party, the Chart Thai Pattana Party, and other smaller parties into its fold to form a razor thin majority in the lower house, affording some measure of stability for the government.<br /><br />The junta’s attempt to rig the election did not end with the writing of an undemocratic constitution and the election laws. Armed with the arbitrary power provided in Article 44 of the interim constitution of 2014, the junta made good use of the state apparatus during the pre-election campaign to harass opposing politicians, mainly from Puea Thai, and intimidate those who supported pro-democracy political parties running against pro-junta parties, such as Palang Pracharat, the Action Coalition for Thailand, and the People Reform Party.<br /><br />The pro-military parties even had a head start in campaigning before the general election was announced in late January 2019. Electioneering by Prime Minister <a href="prayuth-chan-ocha.html">Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> was in full swing long before the announcement, often guised as ‘roving cabinet meetings’ in provincial towns with state funds pledged for local development projects, including the ‘Pracharat Project’ from which the junta’s nominated party derived its name.<br /><br />… It is generally believed that the court’s decision <b>[to dissolve the Thai Raksa Chart Party]</b> was done at the behest of the junta and the ‘establishment’ of Thai oligarchy and big business conglomerates, which favour authoritarianism over democracy. The loss of its sibling party dealt a considerable blow to Puea Thai and the pro-democracy front in their effort to prevent the pro-military political parties from winning the election.<br /><br />… There were widespread accusations that the military regime was giving free handouts just days before the election and that state-run agencies had ‘purchased’ polling stations outright to bring about the victory. Furthermore, local authorities were ordered, with cash incentives, to coax people to vote for the junta-nominated party. Although the EC had assigned local representatives to oversee the ballot counting, it is believed these officials turned a blind eye to the above-mentioned malpractice by local authorities.<br /><br />To most Thais, this 2019 March election is but a charade that owes little to the principle of parliamentary democracy</p>
