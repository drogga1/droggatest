  <p><b>[Striker Nadim said the Danish first half performance was not good enough to be left unpunished by the talented Dutch team]</b> We played a very poor first half. We were afraid to play football. Holland are too good for us to give them so much space there. We came back well in the second half and created chances, but we weren’t clinical enough</p>

  <p>It was impossible for us to be there, so we left the country – or actually escaped, smuggled out of the country. We had to buy fake passports and all that. Faith brought me to a refugee camp where football was there, and football saved my life<br /><br /><b>[What will be the lasting impact of the Women’s World Cup?]</b> This World Cup brought the sport to a wider audience, and seeing these amazing athletes become role models – hearing their stories, hearing their struggles – that young girls can relate to … was the biggest thing for me. That’s going to have a huge impact in the coming generations. You have to see <b>[the female athletes on television]</b> before you can believe it. Growing up, I didn’t have any female football role models. I had <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>, people that I love, but now you have the choice of who your role model is<br /><br /><b>[What was your favorite Women’s World Cup moment]</b> The Argentina-Scotland game was so exciting and so emotional. People were cheering for Argentina and I was wearing the wrong jersey because I had friends on the Scottish team, and then I started cheering for Argentina as well. I’ve been to a lot of big games at Old Trafford, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>, Etihad – you name it. This was the first time that I was having goosebumps watching a game. I lost my voice because of the penalty retake. That’s the one my favorite moments in football, period<br /><br />Also, when Thailand scored their first goal in Nice … looking at the reaction of the Thai fans going crazy and then their manager crying, it was cool to see how much it meant to all of them<br /><br />The England against U.S. match was electric. You could just feel the atmosphere and the intensity. I don’t know how to put it, but this World Cup has been just different. I’m going to be sad that it’s over, but also on the other hand, I’m a tiny bit happy because I’m going to have some time to rest a bit, because I feel as a fan I’ve been through so much emotions watching all these games. It’s almost as if I have been in camp with the national team for an entire month because of my job on television</p>

  <p><b>[Nadia Nadim on Visa help her on documenting her journey to Kakuma’s refugee camp]</b> <b>[This summer]</b> I was going to Kakuma <b>[in Kenya]</b> to this refugee camp. There’s 200,000 people there, most of them under the age of 18. I went there because of football, because that’s how you unite, that’s how you teach, that’s how you bring joy and hope to <b>[people’s]</b> lives. When I spoke with Visa, they were like, ‘How do you want us to help you?’. They sent an entire camera crew to document what’s going on. I thought that was pretty amazing and I know for a fact it’s going to have an impact</p>

  <p><b>[Two decades after fleeing Taliban-ruled Afghanistan with her family, Nadia Nadim is ready to go home]</b> I don’t know if it’s ever going be safe. But I’ll take the chance. The message I want to deliver to these kids is that everything’s possible and then telling them what they’re doing is not wrong. Playing football is not a sin. You’re not doing anything wrong. It’s a sport. It’s something that makes you happy. And the people around them, if I can try to teach them or show them that if you love these girls, they can become people like me<br /><br />Growing up in a country where there is war and where girls weren’t really allowed anything, it was extremely hard. Having my dad killed when I was young and escaping the country was no joke … and I’m just happy that I got a second chance and I made the best out of my second chance<br /><br />I saw the game and I was like, ‘I like it’<br /><br /><b>[After spending 2016 and 2017 at Portland Thorns, Nadim spent the following year in England’s top league at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> before securing the move to <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, which is challenging <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> for the French title]</b> I play in one of the world’s best teams, have people who support me, have brands who support me. I couldn’t really imagine this when I was younger and one of the reasons is because I’d never seen it before … until I became 15, 16, I realized that’s something I could do. But I want this to be something that girls realize that it’s a possibility or have that possibility. It’s not even about being a professional, but about playing football. That’s the day I’m going to be really happy<br /><br /><b>[A pay dispute in 2017 with the Danish soccer leadership led to the women’s national team going on strike and forcing the cancelation of a World Cup qualifier. The pressure secured a four-year collective bargaining agreement]</b> You have to fight for the things you believe in, even though that’s going to cost you. That’s what happened with the strike … and us not qualifying for the World Cup. I don’t think we would have done anything differently. I think if you had a chance to redo it, I’ll try to do the same thing, but then try not to miss the World Cup<br /><br />But I think the change we made has been crucial not for me, not for us, but the generations after us. I think everything starts at some point. You have to take a stand and try to change it. I think that’s what we did and I hope that in 10 years, the girls playing are going to be benefiting from it<br /><br /><b>[In her homeland, the struggle has been to bring the Afghan soccer leadership to justice after players spoke out about facing repeated sexual abuse]</b> They should be proud of themselves, that they came forward and told these stories and took a stand because that’s going to change and help the next generation of girls. If they didn’t say anything, the cycle would just continue. That takes a lot of courage. And, for me, they’re really, really brave<br /><br />It’s disgusting that some people would use or abuse their power. Sometimes achieving your goals are not supposed to be easy. And I hope in the future I can do something for them as well<br /><br />I’d love to go back and see how everything is, to try to help some of the kids. I want this to be something girls realize … you have the access to the game equally as all the boys and then it’s up to you if you want to play or not</p>

  <p><b>[Denmark and <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> forward Nadia Nadim, who is nearing graduation as a reconstructive surgeon]</b> When they ask me: ‘How does it feel to score?’ I’m like: ‘It’s really wonderful.’ But I experience similar emotions or adrenaline rush in the operating room. Not so long ago I played a game and I was really tired but soon after the game I assisted one of our doctors in a kidney surgery. I was standing there for two hours, in the same position, holding an instrument so he could see better. I was hurting everywhere because of the match but I still was feeling so great and my pulse was racing. I had this this rush of adrenaline, thinking: ‘Holy s—, this is so cool. I’m literally looking inside someone’s stomach</p>
