  <p><b>[Manchester City’s Kelechi Iheanacho has labelled Wayne Rooney and Didier Drogba as players he looks up to]</b> I think I was watching Didier Drogba and his team at Chelsea, and Wayne Rooney at Manchester United as well. They are great players that I am looking up to as well, pick up lessons from them and put in my football in the Premier League.</p>

  <p><b>[Kelechi Iheanacho about scoring in the Manchester Derby]</b> Four years ago, I could not afford to watch this match on the television. Now people in the game centre back home were watching me score this goal. Maybe the kids who could not afford the 50 naira were waiting outside, kicking a ball or a balloon around. Maybe somebody came outside after the match was over and told them ‘Manchester City won. Kelechi scored’</p>

  <p><b>[Kelechi Iheanacho has been urged to leave Manchester City by his advisor after being treated unfairly by Pep Guardiola. Olumide Olowu said]</b> Iheancho needs to leave Manchester City and he will find a better place to continue his young career. Guardiola seems to have his own players that he wants to play and you can’t expect a young player with huge potential to be wasting away on the bench. Kelechi had already shown his quality before Manchester City signed Gabriel Jesus, he had already proven himself. I’m not speaking for Iheanacho, but as someone who is involved in advising him, I don’t think he has been treated fairly by Guardiola and I think his career will be better elsewhere. For whatever reason, he has not been given the opportunity to continue his progress at City.</p>

  <p><b>[The time is now for Manchester City striker Kelechi Iheanacho to part with Pep Guardiola]</b> You need to do more. You need to help the team do more. You need to press high, help your team-mates back and covering. And of course score goals. We have lots of quality players so you need to keep up. Everyone is doing great and bringing their best. You need to be on the same level, be at your best and help win the things that we need</p>

  <p><b>[Leicester City have announced the signing of Nigeria international Kelechi Iheanacho from Manchester City]</b> It feels good and I’m happy to be part of this team. I know the ambition of the team and speaking with the manager, he let me know what I need to do - to help the team achieve what they want. I was convinced and I’m happy to be here. I was happy speaking with the manager, knowing what the team wants. It gives me more confidence that I will fit in this team and hopefully I’ll achieve a lot.</p>

  <p><b>[Nigeria striker Kelechi Iheanacho is hopeful Lionel Messi’s disappointing World Cup will continue when the Super Eagles face Argentina on Tuesday]</b> I like Messi but against us I hope he stays quiet. It’s going to be a boost for us to play against a big team. The win today will give us confidence to go against them.<br /><br />There was a bit of confusion and we didn’t get it right in the first half. It was much better after the break and we came out strong to fight until the end to get the result. We’re happy with the result. It was a fantastic result for us heading into the next game</p>

  <p><b>[Kelechi Iheanacho, <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> City’s hero in a vital 2-1 win over <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> has given himself a new nickname]</b> I’ve been waiting for this opportunity. I knew one day it’s going to come. I’m happy today to get the goal and assisting Jamie. You can call me Mr.VAR! I knew it was a goal. I was onside. Happy that VAR gave me it<br /><br />We’ve had decisions go against us at the other end and we deserve it. We were having a few chances but they were coming from a bit further out. <a href="kelechi-nwakali.html">Kelechi</a> caused a few more problems for the defenders, he got us into space and he got the winner which he deserves.

The first thing is to get each game out the way and get the three points. We have to enjoy this and go again on Wednesday night. We have lots of attacking threat and we’re putting it all together. We’ll just carry on doing what we’re doing</p>

  <p><b>[Kelechi Iheanacho on battle for Champions League qualification]</b> The race is on. Anyone can get into the top four, anyone can get into the top six. Bruno <b>[Fernandes]</b> is a top player. They’ve got <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> and <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> back in the team now. They’re flying. But that’s not what we need to worry about. We just need to focus on our games<br /><br /><b>[A spate of injuries to key players <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a>, <a href="ben-chilwell.html">Ben Chilwell</a> and Ricardo haven’t helped the cause]</b> <a href="james-maddison.html">Madders</a> <b>[Maddison]</b>, Chilly <b>[<a href="ben-chilwell.html">Chilwell</a>]</b> and Ricardo are fantastic players. They have a big impact in the team. I love playing with them. But everyone can fill the gaps as well. Everyone knows what to do when you’re taking someone’s place.<br /><br /><b>[A fifth-place finish might be enough for Champions League qualification - if <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s ban from the competition is upheld and their appeal is unsuccessful]</b> I don’t know what’s going on with that but we’re just focusing on our games. We’ve worked really hard to get to this stage, so it would really be a dream.<br /><br />My <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> debut was against <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> in 2015. I got a few minutes or so. It was truly heart-warming. So nice, being young and then scoring goals. There are young players doing well now and I’m happy for them, like <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> and <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a>. You never know how it really feels until you start getting older and understand more. Game time was hard to come by at City and the lure of regular starts led to his £25m move to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> in 2017. Everybody wants to play. No one wants to sit on the bench.<br /><br /><b>[Regular football has come in fits and starts at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>]</b> First and foremost: that’s a moment that will be in my head for a long time<br /><br /><b>[Iheanacho on his goal and assist against <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> in December]</b> We’ve been training at home and the coaches have been giving us work to do. It’s gone well. I was just keeping fit and training every day. I like cooking as well and spicy African dishes have been on the menu.<br /><br /><b>[Iheanacho started on the right of a front three, in a 3-4-3 formation - a position he’s happy to occupy in the future]</b> It’s not the first time I’ve started there. It’s not really right wing. It’s two strikers and one behind me and Jamie <b>[<a href="jamie-vardy.html">Vardy</a>]</b>. Sometimes I drift off to the right, so I’m more inside. Playing with Jamie is an honour. He’s a top finisher, so whenever he plays and scores he inspires me, because I want to repeat that.<br /><br /><b>[So does he fancy emulating the likes of <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> in that right-sided role?]</b> <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a> is <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>! If I find myself in that position, I’ll just crack on. We just need to play according to the plans. I’m happy here. Everyone at the club has been fantastic. I’m scoring goals, have a good family, good team-mates. We want to win every game. We just keep working. We’re getting ready to go there. They did well in the last game against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, so we just to be focused, do our job and get the points we need.</p>
