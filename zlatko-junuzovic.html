  <p><b>[Red Bull Salzburg midfielder Zlatko Junuzovic has lifted the lid on his failed summer move to Brighton]</b> I have always thought about switching to the Premier League because it is the best league in the world for me. I do not know a player who could not imagine playing there. In my free time, I like to watch the Premier League. But as you get older you can not even think of yourself as a footballer anymore. I have a family how and I need to include them in my decision-making. From an early age, it was my biggest dream to become a professional and to play in the German Bundesliga. I’ve done that, so I can be more than proud of my career so far. At this point, the Premier League just did not fit into my life.<br /><br />For me, it was a landmark decision, because I asked myself the question of how I want to shape my life in the future. In terms of handling, language and philosophy of the club at Red Bull Salzburg everything just fit. The standard and the conditions are outstanding here. With the current constellation in Salzburg I could not refuse<br /><br />Their joy in playing is simply incredible. Especially Samasseekou is always laughing. The boys have a lot of talent, they do not think anything of each other and just start playing. They differ a little bit from the playground and their position</p>

  <p><b>[Salzburg team-mates Zlatko Junuzovic on <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a>’s performance]</b> His goalscoring run is incredible. I’m so happy he scored three today. People said: ‘okay he’s scoring for fun in the league, but wait until he comes to the big stage’. Then he goes and scores another hat-trick!</p>
