  <p><b>[Belletti was asked whether he saw <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> back at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a>, and he responded]</b> Not right now, because everything that is happening is very complicated. There is a lot of talk, but he says nothing, we read a lot about this topic but all we know is that he is training with <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a> is planning this season without him. <a href="ernesto-valverde.html">Valverde</a> is playing his friendly matches, looking for the best team to start the season, now the players who were in the Copa América are back … so you have to plan the season with the players who are here and not be worried about whether <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is coming or not. Well, if you plan the season with him and in the end he doesn’t come … you have to work thinking as if you’re a company and, right now, it’s time to work with the employees there are.<br /><br /><b>[Is Belletti hinting that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a> want <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> to make a public plea? This idea was rumored a few weeks back, but it never came to pass. However, notice Belletti’s language here]</b> He says nothing</p>
