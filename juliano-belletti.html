  <p><b>[Former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> defender Juliano Belletti says The time is now for Neymar to make a decision over his future with Paris Saint-Germain]</b> A lot has been said about Neymar. I know hardly anything about this. For him, it is the moment to decide. He has to be very calm with his family to take the best decision.<br /><br /><b>[Speaking on whether he would prefer a return to Camp Nou for the Selecao star or for Barca to make a move for outgoing <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> forward <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Antoine Griezmann</a>, Belletti admitted that his fellow countryman was his personal pick]</b> I am Brazilian and I have played during all my life with the best Brazilian players of my generation: Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a>, Rivaldo. So, imagine, I am more about these kind of things<br /><br /><b>[A return to Catalonia could see Neymar link up with international compatriot <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Philippe Coutinho</a>, who has struggled since making a big-money move from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> When he gets more confidence, he will do much better</p>

  <p><b>[Belletti was asked whether he saw <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> back at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a>, and he responded]</b> Not right now, because everything that is happening is very complicated. There is a lot of talk, but he says nothing, we read a lot about this topic but all we know is that he is training with <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a> is planning this season without him. <a href="ernesto-valverde.html">Valverde</a> is playing his friendly matches, looking for the best team to start the season, now the players who were in the Copa América are back … so you have to plan the season with the players who are here and not be worried about whether <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is coming or not. Well, if you plan the season with him and in the end he doesn’t come … you have to work thinking as if you’re a company and, right now, it’s time to work with the employees there are.<br /><br /><b>[Is Belletti hinting that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barça</a> want <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> to make a public plea? This idea was rumored a few weeks back, but it never came to pass. However, notice Belletti’s language here]</b> He says nothing</p>
