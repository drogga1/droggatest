  <p><b>[Legendary Milan defender Franco Baresi can’t imagine the <a href="ac-milan.html">Rossoneri</a> without <a href="alessandro-nesta.html">Alessandro Nesta</a>]</b> I can’t imagine Milan without <a href="alessandro-nesta.html">Nesta</a>. He is getting older, but I think Milan will take into account his importance to the team. Alessandro can still give so much to football. He is a player of high standards and I don’t think he will seek other accommodations. Anything is possible, the club will assess the situation. I repeat - I cannot see Milan without <a href="alessandro-nesta.html">Nesta</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[The final, at a packed <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>, against a very useful Steaua Bucharest side]</b> When we went out for the warm-up, we saw the huge numbers of supporters on the terraces. And we understood that there was no way we could go home without the trophy<br /><br /><b>[For Baresi, he couldn’t quite believe how things had changed in a few short years]</b> We used to look around and sometimes marvel. With the arrival of <a href="silvio-berlusconi.html">Berlusconi</a>, things really changed at the club. When he told us we would go on to be the best club in the world we were all sceptical. But within a couple of years we’d won everything with an amazing style of football</p>

  <p><b>[Franco Baresi says he enjoy High-scoring, high-octane matches. For example, he particularly enjoyed last September’s absorbing Uefa Champions League clash between <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, when the sides traded heavy blows before the English club finally triumphed 3-2]</b> A spectacular match. I like to watch teams where there is a confrontation; I love open matches where anything can happen at any time. <b>[laugh]</b> I’m not Italian. But I think they should be afraid of playing against me as well<br /><br />There was more offside when I played. There are still great defenders, and perhaps there is a better organisation also. You always have to be very attentive, so you have to focus a lot, always on guard for the whole 90 minutes. And you have to have very talented colleagues, of course<br /><br />I’m proud to say that I played with extraordinary and talented players. We had <a href="arrigo-sacchi.html">Sacchi</a>, and I also played with three very talented Dutch players. That for me was the real and biggest Milan. I’d find it extremely difficult again to find three Dutch players playing together with their qualities and their skills, and to have them together again with another group of very talented Italian players. So the combination of these players made the team what it was: an unforgettable one<br /><br /><b>[Baresi talks about current <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>. Manager <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gennaro Gattuso</a> has found his groove, while recent recruits in <a href="krzysztof-piatek.html">Krzysztof Piatek</a> and <a href="lucas-paqueta.html">Lucas Paqueta</a> have excelled almost immediately]</b> The team is growing a lot. In January, a lot of talented players arrived and so we have more trust. We must manage to keep this level of excellence because we have to reach our targets. Our objectives today must be to get back into the Champions League<br /><br /><a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gattuso</a>’s doing a pretty good job right now. It always depends on the results the coach gets. When you’re the coach of such an important football team, it’s an honour, but it’s also a burden. He certainly has a lot of qualities; he just needs time. Only time will tell<br /><br /><b>[Baresi on Juventus’ domestic dominance]</b> It’s true that <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> is the protagonist today, there’s no doubt about that. Milan and Inter made some mistakes in the past; they didn’t invest a lot. And of course <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> took advantage of this situation. But I still think that the Italian championship needs Milan and Inter to raise the bar and make the competition even more interesting<br /><br /><b>[Baresi on <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s European dominance]</b> There is going to be more balance in the next few years because it’s true that there is a lot of competition. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> lost something when they lost <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. And I think, because they have won so many matches, they are no longer hungry<br /><br /><b>[Baresi on The Italy national team]</b> After the great disappointment we had in not qualifying for the last World Cup, our national team is getting better and better. We were not ready for the generation change, so we had a lot of talented players who were at the end of their careers and we weren’t able to replace them. Now we have a lot of gifted young players, who are growing little by little. <b>[Manager Roberto]</b> Mancini is doing whatever he can to make this possible</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus’ signing of Aaron Ramsey has been hailed as a great coup]</b> I’ve seen him play. He’s obviously a great player. I think Juve has really landed a great coup there and I’m sure he’ll be able to adapt to Italian football.<br /><br />Juventus has owned Serie A in the last few years so it’s important to see what the other teams can do in terms of growing. Teams like Inter Milan, As Roma, Ac Milan, Lazio and Napoli are definitely all growing at the moment. Champions League qualification will be very important for Milan this year. It brings in money, it brings in opportunities for investment and chances to progress so it’s important</p>

  <p><b>[Franco Baresi says he believes in the new ownership and the club will become great again under them]</b> One step at a time. First let’s think about beating <a href="bologna-fc.html">Bologna</a>, because we have to run on ourselves and if we win the games that remain the fourth place it is still possible<br /><br />Milan has the good fortune to have a large audience that has never abandoned us. I am convinced that with this new ownership, the fans will return to see a great Milan again. And one who has been two years in B says it, but then he won everything. Because the light always comes back after dark. Just be patient, as Liedholm would say</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chris-smalling.html">Chris Smalling</a> dubbed Smalldinis as Italian legends Baresi explain why <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> defender is shining for Roma]</b> At Milan, I was a team-mate of <a href="ray-wilkins.html">Ray Wilkins</a> and Mark Hateley but I think it is easier when you come to this country and are playing in midfield or attack. Smalling’s not my favourite defender in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> but I like his determination to try to improve.<br /><br />Before he came, I didn’t know too much about Smalling. I was not sure an English defender could get used to Italian football as it is so different to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Smalling’s attitude and approach has been good. But I think we have to wait until the end of the season to make any judgements</p>
