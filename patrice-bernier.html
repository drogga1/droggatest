  <p><b>[Montreal Impact re-sign team captain Patrice Bernier]</b> I am very excited to be able to finish my playing career at home with the Impact. I am proud that this will be my 18th professional season, including nine with the Impact. For my last season, I will give everything for the club and the city, with a hope that we finish with the MLS Cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Montreal Impact ready for life after Didier Drogba]</b> The personality of the player, that you can’t replace. But he left a lot of good things and the team is still very strong in terms of the nucleus and the leaders that are here, so we’ll carry on.<br /><br />In the past, players didn’t necessarily want to stay here or we didn’t keep them. Guys are wanting to stay. The plan of the club is structured now. You’re looking at the same team for the last two, three years. At least some of the core players</p>

  <p><b>[Mauro Biello frustrated after Impact blow two-goal lead against Sounders]</b> I don’t want to be too negative because we did do a lot of good things. Compared to last week it was night and day. In the first half we had possession, we created a lot of chances, we worked hard, we were intense, but it has to be for 90 minutes plus.</p>
