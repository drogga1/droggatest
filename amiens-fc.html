  <p><b>[Amiens to appeal <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> relegation after season cancelled due to coronavirus]</b> This decision is for our club, all our players, coaches, administrators, volunteers and supporters extremely fraught with consequences. Pending the publication of the minutes of board of directors’ meeting, Amiens reserve the right to contest this decision, since sporting merit, in this particularly difficult period for all, should on the contrary have led the various decision-making bodies not to pronounce any relegation</p>

  <p><b>[Amiens call for fans’ help in petition against relegation from Ligue 1]</b> Following the decision to demote Amiens SC to Ligue 2 after only 28 games played out of 38, Amiens SC is launching a petition to seek justice in the face of this decision fraught with consequences that goes against fairness in sport. Amiens SC is asking the Ligue de Football to review its position and make the fairest choice a <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> with 22 clubs for the 2020-2021 season. Supporters from Amiens and football lovers, support our initiative that would make football and sport grow</p>
