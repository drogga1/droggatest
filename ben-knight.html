<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Meet Ben Knight - the latest Man City starlet tipped for the big time]</b> Getting into the first team. I don’t want to be a player that goes through the 18 system into the Under-23s, I want to be the one that goes above stages, that jumps stages. That’s what I want to do<br /><br />I’m a confident lad so nothing really fazes me like that<br /><br />The quality of players I’m playing with is so much better. It’s harder because at Ipswich I was one of the big players but there are so many big players you have to up it even more to stand out. That’s the challenge I wanted to take<br /><br />Nah, I don’t accept that. I always try to be the best player on the pitch. I don’t care who’s there, I always try to be the best. I’m a big player. If I come here and think there’s Tommy Doyle or people like that around me, I’m not going to get anywhere, so I have to think ‘I’m Ben Knight, I’m going to be the best player on the pitch<br /><br />I don’t score enough goals. I probably should have scored another one <b>[on Monday]</b>. In terms of improving, just staying grounded and don’t think I’ve done anything yet. We haven’t really done anything in the Youth Cup yet because we’ve got to win it yet. <b>[We’ve got to]</b> be level headed and always want to be better than you were<br /><br />They still live there. I miss them every day and I hardly see them but I’ve got to do what I’ve got to do to get to where I want to be. You have to sacrifice certain things. They come up to every game, literally every game. It’s five hours but they don’t mind doing it.</p>
