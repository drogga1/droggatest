<blockquote>
  <p>[Ashley Barnes has revealed that Jurgen Klopp sent him a well-wishing text message ahead of Burnley’s clash with Manchester City] I’ve had a few messages yesterday from Liverpool fans making a joke of it but it’s all good. It would mean everything [to win against City]. Klopp has even given me a sly text to say that if I score he might sign me for next season - so I might be on the move! But look, for something so silly, it would be a massive thing if I was to score and we were to win. All of us would probably go down in Liverpool history if we helped them out.<br /><br />These are the games I relish. The ones I want to be playing in. As long as I train well and get selected I can’t do any more. I love playing against big teams especially. Ten of my 31 goals in the Premier League have come against the big teams. It’s a great stat for me personally. I thrive in any game, you just try to hit the back of the net. Lucky for me a lot of my goals have come against big teams. You just want to show what you’re capable of and hopefully I have done that, shown how good I am.</p>
