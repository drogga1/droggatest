  <p><b>[Ricardo Oliveira on his time at Milan and the kidnapping of his sister]</b> My head was all over the place. My sister practically dates me. She lives in my house, she works for me, I look after her. She’s like my mother. We’re so close. One day <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> came to me and said, ‘Ricardo, I can’t take you to the games. If you want to keep on training, I think it’s good for you because you’ll be with your team-mates - we’re here to give you total support. But you already had enough pressure on you inheriting the No7 shirt of <a href="andriy-shevchenko.html">Sheva</a>, who made so much history here - I don’t think it’s fair to put extra pressure on you by selecting you to play.’ I said, ‘Carlo, this is what I want.’ It was impossible to play football. She was kidnapped forfive months- the longest in the history of Sao Paulo at the time. But what was worthwhile at Milan was to be part of such a successful team, who won the Champions League with <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a> dazzling, the best player in the world. To share a dressing room with <a href="clarence-seedorf.html">Seedorf</a>, <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Maldini</a>, <a href="alessandro-costacurta.html">Costacurta</a>, <a href="alessandro-nesta.html">Nesta</a>, <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a>, <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gattuso</a> - a constellation of stars</p>
