  <p><b>[As more clubs gain an interest, Moussa Dembele’s price has inflated from a reported £15 million to £40m]</b> But before Celtic fans start on me, here’s a simple question I’d ask anyone who raves about the Frenchman: why is Dembele in Scotland? He was up for grabs and available in the summer, so why didn’t one of the big clubs snap him up at that point?</p>

  <p><b>[Kris Boyd has slammed the performances of Celtic so far this season]</b> Are they really that bothered to be playing in a Celtic jersey right now? Not for me. I know there was a meeting after the Champions League exit. And, when you look at that, there is a divide in the dressing-room, there is no doubt about it. It was quite clear<br /><br /><b>[Boyata and Olivier Ntcham]</b> When a club wants to play £14m for him, that guy’s wages are going through the roof when he goes there. He wants to go. Boyata, the exact same. Ntcham was excellent up to the first four games. Since the transfer window shut and Moussa Dembele has gone, he looks a shadow of what he was.</p>
