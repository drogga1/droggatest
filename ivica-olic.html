  <p><b>[Former team-mate Ivica Olic says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> midfielder Kevin De Bruyne will find it difficult to take his game to even greater heights because he is already one of the best in the world at his position]</b> I think he’s been one of the best in the world at his position for several years now. He has a strong character and winning mentality - when you combine that with all the qualities he has, which are substantial, you get a world-class player who is performing at a high level year by year. There’s not much room for improvement - he is already at a top level physically, so he covers a lot of ground during the game, and if you look at the goals and assists, he’s doing great every year. For him, it’s only important to stay healthy and he can continue performing at this level, which is being one of the best midfielders in the world.<br /><br />He showed his qualities really quickly. As a forward, I can vouch for that - his passing, through balls and assists were off the charts good. Maybe at the beginning it was not easy to look at him as a star, but all of us who trained with him knew what he was a fantastic, rare talent who could only be stopped by injuries, God forbid. He showed his quality in every game, he was a difference maker</p>
