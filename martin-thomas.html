  <p><b>[The former <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> and Wales keeper Martin Thomas on lack of depth of english keepers]</b> I’ve been working across the England development teams since 1992 and if you look now across all age groups I believe there is a deeper pool of talent, so long-term I think the state of English goalkeeping is healthy<br /><br />The problem is people tend to focus on the very top of the game and their perceptions become skewed as they assume the ratio of English goalkeepers should be higher. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is a world league, which means our very best are competing against what the rest of the world can offer. At that top end, there is a reluctance to go with inexperience, which is where the issues occur for our young English players, including goalkeepers, to be given the opportunity</p>
