  <p><b>[Aidy Boothroyd insists that he and the rest of his staff will do whatever is necessary to facilitate Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s potential switch from Crystal Palace to Manchester United]</b> It seems like it’s been going on for a long time. We had a similar situation in Poland last time with Jordan Pickford, a lot of speculation. Everton agreed the deal they worked very closely with us, they were very respectful in terms of not getting involved in our training and our build-up and in the end it was done - with the medicals in a hotel down the road away from everybody else. If that was to happen we certainly wouldn’t be blocking anybody, we’d be talking to people and seeing if we can help out in any way provided both clubs were happy with it. If that happens we’ll oblige. and if it doesn’t suit us then we’ll find a time when it does.<br /><br /><b>[Wan-Bissaka hit the headlines for the wrong reasons in England’s Euro bow after a late own goal gifted France a 2-1 victory]</b> He’s disappointed obviously with the way that the own goal turned out. With all the noise that’s surrounding him at the minute you can imagine if you and I were in that position we’d probably be a lot different to what he is. He’s very calm, he’s very measured, he doesn’t say a great deal but if he plays tomorrow night I’m expecting the same sort of focus, the same sort of energy and I expect him to bounce back</p>

  <p><b>[Aidy Boothroyd believes Manchester City starlet Phil Foden will remain with the junior team for now, rather than making the step up to the full international side]</b> I think his next three to six months will be an indicator of where he gets to and what he is ready for internationally. But, right now, September-time, I’d imagine he’ll be with me.<br /><br /><b>[Despite the disappointment of an early exit in Italy Boothroyd believes his team is functioning well in terms of developing a culture and style of play]</b> We are asking <b>[the players]</b> to take the ball off the goalkeeper in World Cup finals in front of millions of people. We have got to grow them and allow them to have their say. The job of the reserve team coach, me, is to get players into that team and to try to win games. The Under-20s, Under-19s, Under-18s, because their teams have done well have been pushed up to me. Gareth Southgate has obviously taken the best players that he wants and he needs. There is a lot of thought that goes into it</p>

  <p><b>[Wan-Bissaka is scoring a late own goal to hand France victory in the <a href="fa.html">Three Lions</a>’s European Championship opener which prompted manager Aidy Boothroyd to drop him for the final two group fixtures]</b> When that speculation is flying around it is bound to turn your head. For a young player who all he knows is Crystal Palace academy, Crystal Palace first team it would be daft not to say that in some way he must think about it</p>

  <p><b>[Aidy Boothroyd has included <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> youngster <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> in his England Under-21 squad for fixtures against Turkey and Kosovo next month]</b> I’m really excited by this new group of players and when I look at the squad we have put together, it’s very encouraging to see that so many of them have been playing regular football in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> already this season. The more English players that we see playing regularly in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the better, so all of the England coaches are really pleased about that. Of course our biggest priority is player development and getting them ready for the senior side. It’s been particularly pleasing to see three of the players that were with us at the Euros this summer be called up into <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>’s squad and we’ll work with every individual in this group to give them the chance of doing the same</p>

  <p><b>[Aidy Boothroyd sees <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> is not as good as he can be yet]</b> He’s probably not played as well as he can do actually. He’s obviously happy with his goals and that’s a mark of a good player, always wanting to be better. He took his goals really well and the more he plays for us, hopefully it can be a little showcase of what he can do for his club. If Phil keeps doing what he’s doing and keeps learning. That’s the great thing about him, he wants to be better. He knows he’s not as good as he can be yet and that to me is the most exciting thing about him</p>
