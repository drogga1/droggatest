  <p><b>[Aidy Boothroyd has included <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> youngster <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> in his England Under-21 squad for fixtures against Turkey and Kosovo next month]</b> I’m really excited by this new group of players and when I look at the squad we have put together, it’s very encouraging to see that so many of them have been playing regular football in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> already this season. The more English players that we see playing regularly in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, the better, so all of the England coaches are really pleased about that. Of course our biggest priority is player development and getting them ready for the senior side. It’s been particularly pleasing to see three of the players that were with us at the Euros this summer be called up into <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>’s squad and we’ll work with every individual in this group to give them the chance of doing the same</p>

  <p><b>[Aidy Boothroyd sees <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> is not as good as he can be yet]</b> He’s probably not played as well as he can do actually. He’s obviously happy with his goals and that’s a mark of a good player, always wanting to be better. He took his goals really well and the more he plays for us, hopefully it can be a little showcase of what he can do for his club. If Phil keeps doing what he’s doing and keeps learning. That’s the great thing about him, he wants to be better. He knows he’s not as good as he can be yet and that to me is the most exciting thing about him</p>
