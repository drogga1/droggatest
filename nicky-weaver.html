  <p><b>[Former Blues goalkeeper Nicky Weaver says Manchester City’s experiment from May 2005 which saw them stick <a href="david-james.html">David James</a> up front will never be repeated]</b> I don’t think we’ll ever see a goalkeeper get put upfront for the last 10 minutes of a game. It was an unbelievable thing, that! That was the first thing I did at the stadium so that was my debut there! I didn’t know what was going on. The only three that knew were <a href="stuart-pearce.html">Stuart Pearce</a>, <a href="david-james.html">David James</a> and Les Chapman - the kit man. The first thing I knew, it was about eight or nine minutes to go and the goalkeeping coach told me to get ready. Then <a href="stuart-pearce.html">Stuart Pearce</a> says: ‘Get ready, you’re going on’ and I didn’t know what was going on! And then the next minute, the kit man pulls David James’ shirt out as an outfield shirt. Jon Macken is sat next to me - we paid £5 million for him! God knows what he must have thought but it nearly worked! James caused a little bit of carnage and <a href="robbie-fowler.html">Robbie Fowler</a> missed the penalty which would have put us into Europe. I very much doubt we’ll see it again. It was a bit of a corny thing at the time. Everyone had a laugh about it but it nearly worked. If it had have worked and we’d have won, <a href="stuart-pearce.html">Stuart Pearce</a> would have called it a masterstroke but we haven’t seen it since and I doubt we’ll see it again<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether he would have fared any better than James, a keeper who took in 207 appearances for City added]</b> Probably not! I’d have probably have been as bad as James! When I look back, it was my girlfriend’s first game and she said afterwards: ‘Does that happen all the time?’ and I said: ‘You’ll never see that for the rest of your life!’ It was an unbelievable day. Looking back now, I can’t stop laughing about it really!</p>
