  <p><b>[Stevenage defender Ben Wilmot was withdrawn from the club’s squad to face Newport County in League Two amid reported interest from Manchester City, Tottenham and Chelsea]</b> Ben came back from international duty with England last week and we have had developments that suggest a deal will be agreed shortly for him to move when the window opens<br /><br />We have had interest from Premier League and Championship clubs, which is not surprising when Ben is recognised by England as being one of the top four centre-halves at his age level, with the other three coming from Man City, Chelsea and Spurs. We have made public our valuation and the closer we are getting to that the more likely it is that Ben will move</p>

  <p><b>[Meet Ben Wilmot, the League Two defender, tracked by Spurs and Liverpool]</b> Ben has had a lot of interest after his recent appearances and will no doubt move up to a higher level in the summer, if not before. His England U19 cap recognised the fact that he is one of the best young centre-halves in England after playing just 15 games for the Stevenage first team. His potential to become a player at the top level is exciting.</p>

  <p><b>[Former England Women’s manager <a href="mark-sampson.html">Mark Sampson</a> has been charged by the <a href="fa.html">Football Association</a> (FA) for allegedly using racist language]</b> Like every professional club, no matter where the complaint comes from, we follow strict procedures, which were followed to the letter.<br /><br />The claimant was offered the chance to make a formal complaint but declined this opportunity, instead choosing to call <a href="fa.html">the FA</a>. Nevertheless, CEO Alex Tunbridge acted immediately to interview and take statements from two individuals the claimant said were witnesses, as well as others that were present in the same meeting, but not mentioned by the claimant</p>
