  <p>[Jim Curtin predicting the Patriots’ top-rated defense will be too much for Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan] I’m pulling for Atlanta and the Philly boy Matt Ryan, but I don’t think their defense will hold up with Brady and [Bill] Belichick getting two weeks to prepare for them.</p>

  <p>[Philadelphia coach Jim Curtin is facing a make-or-break season with the Philadelphia Union] You could go two ways there. I could have probably chased it, and went around the country and been a guy who signed with different MLS teams for different salaries, chasing it a couple more years. It was at a time when I didn’t think it was fair to my family - I had young kids at the time. Philly was home, and it was always where I wanted to be. It was where me and my wife both are from. The idea was I could sulk about it and cry, or I could move forward with my career and life and get into coaching, and that’s what I chose to do.<br /><br />For any great job, and I would consider being the head coach of your hometown team a great job, no one is actually ready until you’re in it. I wasn’t ready, but at the same time I wasn’t going to say no. It’s like an astronaut’s first launch. Is he really ready when he’s never done it before? Once you get in it though, you learn that there’s a lot that goes into it. Any coach who says they were ready to be the head coach the first time is full of it. You can never really be prepared for something like this when you start, but I feel comfortable with it now and now that we have stability and clarity in the organization it’s pretty powerful<br /><br />We all do look around now and we see with the group that we have that it’s not good enough just to get in the playoffs. The bar has been raised. We have a group that is capable of getting in the playoffs and winning that first series, which the club has never accomplished. We had the two heartbreaks of getting to two [U.S. Open Cup] finals, we had the taste of the playoffs last year, and now we have to take that next step, which is to win big games, and I think we have the team to take that next step<br /><br />It creates real competition, not just to be in our 11, but to make our 18 each week is going to be a real challenge. There are going to be good, solid pros who aren’t going to make our 18. That’s healthy. That means our club is moving forward. I think under Earnie, initially when he came in he said he wanted us to be two deep at each position. In just over a year’s time, when you look at our second group we really do have really solid players at one and two all over the field, and a good mix of academy kids coming up too and that’s exciting<br /><br />What happened in a lot of games is we got caught up in these end-to-end games, and we’re not built for that. We don’t have a David Villa or Kaka to pull off a play and win a game by himself, we have to do it with all 11 guys. We got caught trying to play end-to-end with teams, and we got punished. We’re focused on keeping our team compact, and not let ourselves get stretched. Yes, we want to high press, but we want to do it all together, where everyone’s attacking and everyone defends. In that sense we’re a true team because everyone has to be good, not great, and we can play with anybody<br /><br />I want [Bedoya] to now embrace the role of being our leader, and our engine. I feel like in his career he’s always been on great teams, whether it’s FC Nantes or the national team, and I feel like he kind of maybe sees himself as a role player. With the Philadelphia Union I want him to be the guy, so it’s a different role in some ways. We want him to take that leadership role, not just on the field but in the locker room. He’s worn the captain’s armband all preseason and he’s really embraced it<br /><br />It was a tough decision, it always is tough to walk away from playing. There are guys, and some of them are close friends of mine, who are struggling right now because there’s nothing like the rush of playing every week, and being kind of important and a big deal, and then it’s just gone. Some guys can’t handle it. It’s a tough time, and I feel like our league needs to do a better job of bridging that gap for guys. I’ve been lucky, and I know I don’t have all the answers, but I think am getting better as a young coach. I’ve been able to navigate some tough situations and I think it made me a better coach, and a better leader. I’m going to keep relentlessly pursuing ways to get better because you have to. If you’re not doing that then you’re in this for the wrong reasons</p>

  <p>[Vancouver Whitecaps 0-0 Philadelphia Union] Basically our entire… not entire, but the vast majority of my weeks leading up to this was spent on how to shut down a 16-year-old kid [Alphonso Davies]. That’s a compliment. He’s a heck of a player, to see him run in person, how effortless it is, how powerful he is, and then to have the feet that he does. I don’t want to get carried away, but he does have a heck of a future.</p>

  <p>[On Anthony Fontana] Great for Anthony to get the goal, great for Auston to play as well as he did, but overall a team effort from every player on the field. All 11 guys attacking, all 11 guys defending.<br /><br />There was a 40 x 40 patch of AstroTurf where this young group of nine-year-old kids were on the field that had a dream of maybe someday playing for the Philadelphia Union. You think Auston Trusty being there as well, with Ian Munro, Phil Karn with myself, and to see them now take this step in Talen Energy Stadium under the bright lights is something that is special</p>

  <p>[Red-hot David Villa and full-strength squad has NYCFC looking like a contender] It’s a team that can beat anyone in our league certainly. And obviously the home-field advantage they have here is the best in the league. It’s a tough place to play and somebody’s got to come here and play them.</p>
