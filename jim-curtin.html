<blockquote>
  <p>[On Anthony Fontana] Great for Anthony to get the goal, great for Auston to play as well as he did, but overall a team effort from every player on the field. All 11 guys attacking, all 11 guys defending.<br /><br />There was a 40 x 40 patch of AstroTurf where this young group of nine-year-old kids were on the field that had a dream of maybe someday playing for the Philadelphia Union. You think Auston Trusty being there as well, with Ian Munro, Phil Karn with myself, and to see them now take this step in Talen Energy Stadium under the bright lights is something that is special</p>

  <p>[Underrated Tim Parker has helped transform Red Bulls defense into the toughest in MLS] Tim Parker, for me, has been the best centerback (in MLS) this year, and it’s not really close. He eats everything up.</p>

  <p>[Red-hot David Villa and full-strength squad has NYCFC looking like a contender] It’s a team that can beat anyone in our league certainly. And obviously the home-field advantage they have here is the best in the league. It’s a tough place to play and somebody’s got to come here and play them.</p>
