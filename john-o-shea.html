  <p><b>[John O’Shea speaks about the team’s desire to get to the World Cup for captain <a href="seamus-coleman.html">Seamus Coleman</a>]</b> But now we have to, for him, for <a href="seamus-coleman.html">Seamus Coleman</a>, get to that World Cup. For everyone in the country, but for him now after what has happened it will be a big thing, you know?</p>

  <p><b>[Former Man Utd defender O’Shea announces retirement]</b> I would like to acknowledge the support I have always received from Sunderland and, prior to that, Manchester United, in particular, Sir Alex Ferguson. I’ve never taken anything in life for granted and the passing in the last year of my dad, Jim, and my friend and team-mate Liam Miller has shown me that every moment in life (not just football) should be cherished<br /><br />Off the pitch, one of the nicest, most humble and genuine people you’ll meet in any walk of life. Happy birthday and thank you for all your efforts during your time at Madejski Stadium, John! We wish you well in the next chapter of your career!</p>

  <p><b>[John O’Shea says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> is not a disruptive influence at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> There are definitely good signs. Obviously <b>[Bruno]</b> Fernandes has had that desired impact and <b>[Odion]</b> <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a> seems to have found his feet. There are good signs but there’s still a lot to do, a lot to improve on. You bring <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> back into that mix and there are good signs ahead. He’s had a couple of operations and he’s back on the training pitch now, and he could hopefully play a big part in United closing the gap on <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to get to the top four, and that would be a huge impact. I remember Paul in the youth team and coming into the first team, and he’s a decent fella. Behind the scenes he works brilliantly in the gym, he’s a good character, he drives other players on.</p>

  <p><b>[John O’Shea says <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> has given <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> a huge lift]</b> He’s had that initial burst when the run was incredible and he went through a few injuries to key players, but <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> coming in seems to have given everybody a huge lift. That has coincided with the team going on a fantastic run, looking very threatening again and that is without <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>, who has proven to be a big player. Unfortunately the unforeseen circumstances have hindered everyone a little bit, especially Ole, but it’s a chance for some of the boys who are missing to get back in and be available. That will be a boost for everyone and hopefully, we can push on for that top-four spot<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether he expected the 1999 Treble winner to become a top boss]</b> It didn’t surprise me. He was always very analytical. He was always analysing everything and that is why he was quite successful coming off the bench, because he was that type of lad. The couple of injuries really made his mind up that he wanted to go in that direction, too, so it didn’t surprise me that he went into coaching or management. The type of personality that he is lends itself more to the current generation, that he can be that bit more relaxed but also very serious and a fierce competitor like he was as a player. He has that side to him as well, when it is needed</p>
