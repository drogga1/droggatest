  <p><b>[Sunderland defender John O’Shea will start in defence against the Netherlands at the Aviva Stadium]</b> Obviously competition for places is key, and that’s what we need, to make sure performances stay high, so that’s something I’ll be looking to do if I get the chance to play. It’s always a case that when you play, you want to play well, but ultimately when the squad is announced everyone knows that they’re fighting for that. If you’re named in the 23, when the final squad is announced, then it’s a battle to get into the starting XI so it’s case of wait and see, but look, I’ve played plenty of games throughout my career and I know that I’ll be ready when needed and if called upon<br /><br />It’s a major tournament and they’re very exciting times. Everyone wants to be a part of it and the whole country is looking forward to it, not just everyone in the hotel in Castleknock. I think the atmosphere and enthusiasm around the group has just gotten stronger and stronger throughout this campaign but has probably gone up a notch as well. There’s massive enthusiasm building and everyone is looking forward to it, especially the other day at the stadium, it was a great turnout, the momentum is definitely building</p>

  <p><b>[John O’Shea conceded that the Republic of Ireland contributed to their own downfall against Belgium]</b> I think the big thing for us was to make sure we started the second half quicker and we didn’t do that. Belgium are a good team, don’t get me wrong. It’s not just a case of keeping 10 men behind the ball, we did that. But when you’re attacking you’re at your most vulnerable, so we’ll have to work on that. We helped them out at times with some of our play</p>

  <p><b>[John O’Shea is adamant that Shane Duffy had to foul Antoine Griezmann and take a red card]</b> Shane had to make that decision <b>[to foul Griezmann]</b>. It kept us in the game. Tonight he was outstanding - he relished the situation. Himself and Richard - not only the centre-backs but across the pitch - the effort and quality they showed at times was brilliant to see.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he would make himself available for the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign]</b> I’m not going to get involved in that now. I’m going to enjoy tonight with a special group of players and a special backroom staff and coaching staff. It’s very different, especially when we had that moment with the fans in the corner - that’s something I’ll cherish for a long time.</p>

  <p><b>[The Irish management team and players tried to play down Gareth Bale’s importance]</b> You have to just get on with it. When you’re playing in the Premier League, whether it’s against <b>[Sergio]</b> Aguero, <b>[Harry]</b> Kane, <b>[Romelu]</b> Lukaku, <b>[Diego]</b> Costa, there are top players there. The team has to get on with it. If you focus too much on one player, you forget about their other good players and they come to the fore. You respect him - obviously he’s a very good player, he’s playing for Real Madrid - but you forget about that and you get on with it to do your best against him.</p>

  <p><b>[The Republic of Ireland must ensure their place at the 2018 World Cup in Russia for the sake of stricken captain Seamus Coleman]</b> It’s on your mind without a doubt, then the game kind of naturally takes over if you know what I mean. It’s obviously such an important game to win, if we had gotten the three points, not that it’s going to make up for Seamus, but it would be fitting for him if we were able to get a win. But now we have to, for Seamus, get to that World Cup. For everyone in the country, but for him now after what has happened it will be a big thing, you know?</p>

  <p><b>[Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has returned the enjoyment factor to Manchester United]</b> He’s <b>[making]</b> a hell of an impression to get the job, that’s for sure. To bring that freedom of expression and enjoyment; they’re at Manchester United because they’re good players. That’s the big thing. Knowing Ole, the type of player and person he was, you can see why the board and the club decided to go that way. It’ll be that enjoyment factor, and that professionalism and killer instinct he had. That’ll have been the key. The enjoyment and maintaining the standard of what the club and fans hope and expect to see.<br /><br />They’ve had a run of games where they’ve really put their foot down and go on and finished teams off as well. Everything he seems to be doing at the minute… he makes a sub and 40 seconds later, the sub scores. Everything’s going in his favour at the minute, but I hope he stays unbeaten in the league and gets knocked out of the cup. If he keeps that run going, if he has success in, hopefully not the FA Cup, but the Champions League, and carries on the run in the league, he’ll be putting himself as a frontrunner for the job.<br /><br />He’ll want to carry on that momentum he’s created early on, and he’ll definitely be under consideration. He’s been brought in until the summer, but that can all change very quickly.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Man Utd defender O’Shea announces retirement]</b> I would like to acknowledge the support I have always received from Sunderland and, prior to that, Manchester United, in particular, Sir Alex Ferguson. I’ve never taken anything in life for granted and the passing in the last year of my dad, Jim, and my friend and team-mate Liam Miller has shown me that every moment in life (not just football) should be cherished<br /><br />Off the pitch, one of the nicest, most humble and genuine people you’ll meet in any walk of life. Happy birthday and thank you for all your efforts during your time at Madejski Stadium, John! We wish you well in the next chapter of your career!</p>

  <p><b>[John O’Shea says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> is not a disruptive influence at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> There are definitely good signs. Obviously <b>[Bruno]</b> Fernandes has had that desired impact and <b>[Odion]</b> <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a> seems to have found his feet. There are good signs but there’s still a lot to do, a lot to improve on. You bring <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> back into that mix and there are good signs ahead. He’s had a couple of operations and he’s back on the training pitch now, and he could hopefully play a big part in United closing the gap on <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to get to the top four, and that would be a huge impact. I remember Paul in the youth team and coming into the first team, and he’s a decent fella. Behind the scenes he works brilliantly in the gym, he’s a good character, he drives other players on.</p>

  <p><b>[John O’Shea says <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> has given <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> a huge lift]</b> He’s had that initial burst when the run was incredible and he went through a few injuries to key players, but <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> coming in seems to have given everybody a huge lift. That has coincided with the team going on a fantastic run, looking very threatening again and that is without <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>, who has proven to be a big player. Unfortunately the unforeseen circumstances have hindered everyone a little bit, especially Ole, but it’s a chance for some of the boys who are missing to get back in and be available. That will be a boost for everyone and hopefully, we can push on for that top-four spot<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether he expected the 1999 Treble winner to become a top boss]</b> It didn’t surprise me. He was always very analytical. He was always analysing everything and that is why he was quite successful coming off the bench, because he was that type of lad. The couple of injuries really made his mind up that he wanted to go in that direction, too, so it didn’t surprise me that he went into coaching or management. The type of personality that he is lends itself more to the current generation, that he can be that bit more relaxed but also very serious and a fierce competitor like he was as a player. He has that side to him as well, when it is needed</p>
