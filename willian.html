  <p><b>[Chelsea star Willian has insisted there is no bad blood between Diego Costa and Antonio Conte]</b> The relationship between Costa and Conte? It’s good, good. Their temperaments are both a bit difficult, but they are great guys<br /><br />For those who don’t know him Diego Costa comes across as a tough guy, who wants to fight, but that is only on the field. He always tells us: ‘On the pitch I am like that, I cannot change. If I had to play against my mother I’d be the same!’. So, he’s a guy who wants to win, wants to fight, he fights for every ball, he wants to score goals - and I think that’s great. Off the field, he’s a guy who is always joking around and talking to us. There is no problem between the two</p>

It was from Manchester United, because Mourinho is there too. From other clubs I don’t know but there are always some things on the internet. I’m glad to hear that there are clubs that admire my work. I do not know if I would go or not. What I can say is that I’m happy at Chelsea, I feel very good there, like it’s my home<br /><br />We <b>[the team]</b> had a difficult start, but then we got it right. He is coaching, coaching, helping all players. It is worth mentioning the group of players also, who managed to understand his philosophy of work, take ideas into the field and do a good job.</p>

But it is also important to keep humble, realistic, be conscious that we haven’t won anything yet. And that our biggest aim is the World Cup. I guess we can celebrate for being qualified. We’re almost there or we have just sealed our passport, but everybody knows which celebration we want to make the most</p>

I have a great relationship with all the people that work at Chelsea and the fans too. They have been great to me since I joined. Chelsea are back in the Champions League next season and I am looking forward to playing in it again. It is a big, big target for us and we have to look to win that trophy next year.<br /><br />We want to end the season with the double. We have the Premier League but we want the FA Cup too.

  <p><b>[Chelsea star Willian has backed Neymar in leaving behind Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain]</b> Messi, Neymar or Ronaldo? The three of them are exceptional, they have a lot of quality and they have their differences. I like all three, but I think Messi will still be the best of the world a few more times. I know Cristiano Ronaldo is close to winning another one Ballon d’Or, but I really like Messi’s style. I really like Neymar too, but I really like Messi<br /><br />I think every player thinks in a different way. I think it was not easy for him to make that decision to leave Barcelona and go to PSG, but I hope he can do what he was already doing in Barcelona and playing with the same joy in PSG.<br /><br />I hope he can be happy in PSG and play in the same way he played in Barcelona. If he’s going to be the best in the world or not, it depends on him winning titles in PSG and reach the Champions League. If he gets that, he will be closer to the title of the best in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Willian reveals failed talks with Manchester United]</b> There were a few conversations with my agent. I worked with Mourinho and I became his friend as well. He likes me a lot and I like him a lot as a coach and as a person. He has put his trust in me and in my work, and I was very grateful to him. Manchester came to me, they talked with my agent, but nothing happened, because Chelsea would not negotiate me in any way and I’m very happy at Chelsea.<br /><br /><b>[On Antonio Conte and Jose Mourinho]</b> They are very different. Everyone has their way of working. Mourinho is a coach who likes more the ball practice, works the ball possession and makes short games. Conte likes to work the tactical and the physical part. Every coach has his way of working. Mourinho is a fantastic coach and won everything wherever he went.<br /><br />Conte is a fantastic coach too, because he won everything at Juventus and has already won the Premier League in his first year with Chelsea. Each one has his merits. <b>[Conte]</b> is a coach who works hard every day, works a lot of tactics and the physical part. In the last season, he transformed our team when he changed the formation to 3-4-3. We managed to assimilate very well what he asked us in the training sessions and things worked out<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on what he aspires to in the future]</b> I dream of winning more titles with Chelsea, win a Champions League and Fifa Club World Cup with Chelsea and be one of the best players in the world, as well as win titles with the Selecao <b>[Brazil]</b> and a World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Morata can replace Diego Costa’s Chelsea goals]</b> Everyone knows about Diego Costa’s quality, the striker he is, and I am sad because he is leaving.<br /><br />He has not yet go to any club, but Morata, who has arrived, has quality and knows how to score goals too. Me and the other players are here to give all the support to our new players, for they can earn at Chelsea what they have been doing in their previous clubs.<br /><br />Matic and Diego <b>[Costa]</b> are two great players. I am sad to see them leave, but I expect Matic to be happy in his new club. But Chelsea have signed Bakayoko, who made a great season at Monaco, to reinforce our team.<br /><br />My relationship with Diego is very good. He has a way on the pitch, but he is a super good guy and very humble. He is a great friend who is unfortunately no longer with us. I only wish good things for him and all the luck in the world.<br /><br />I have great friends in Chelsea, like Diego and David Luiz. We <b>[Willian and Luiz]</b> are neighbours and we are always together in and out the field. Kenedy is also a great friend, and apart from the Brazilians, I have a lot of affinity with Hazard. I get along well with all the players. The atmosphere at Chelsea is very good<br /><br /><b>[Asked who are Chelsea’s main rivals for the trophy]</b> I think all of them are rivals in the battle for the title. Of course, the battle for the title is always against five or six teams, but Premier League is a very difficult championship because you cannot predict any result. You know that the last placed team is as very tough opponent as the leader. This season is gonna be very different than the last season. The Premier League always gets better year after year. This year we have more games and the Champions League, so we need to be more attentive, because this season will be more difficult than the last</p>

  <p><b>[Willian concedes that losing Diego Costa and Nemanja Matic is bad for Chelsea]</b> These players are great players, we miss these players, but Chelsea always try to bring players with quality. I think the players that arrive have the quality to play here and the squad and the team are still strong. And we have to push till the end of the season. It is difficult to talk about that because of course when you lose players like that, it is bad. But we have great players here and we have to be happy if you are here, or in Manchester or Madrid. You have to try and always play the best football on the pitch.<br /><br />It is the same, nothing changes. Of course, the players change, but the way we play, nothing changes, we always train in the same way, we always have a plan to come to the game, nothing changes. We have to look forward. There are more games coming and we have to be ready.</p>

My relationship with him is the best I can hope for and I always say that he cares about all the players equally, giving the same level of attention to first-team players and reserves. Throughout my competition for a place with Coutinho, he was always very honest, insisting that we are two great players and he will play whoever is in the best form.<br /><br />It’s an important test for us, against a different school of thought, a style which we are not used to facing. England are an always strong team, they have great players and they are in good form after a great qualifying campaign. They have a lot of technical quality, too. We will have to be very focused</p>

It is totally different to play in the Premier League to the Champions League. I think we can stay at this level and we can go to Old Trafford on Sunday and play another great game. We have to play in a similar way. Against Manchester United, I think we can do a great job. Against Manchester City, it will be like the game against Barcelona - they like to have the ball. We have to stay compact and use the same plan as we used against Barcelona. We can win these games. We will go there to try to win<br /><br />To score a goal in a match like that you feel a lot of emotion, it’s normal. I was thinking about my family, the people that stay with me all of the time and support me. Of course, it was a good moment and I was really happy at this moment, but I have to continue. I almost had three against Barcelona and I almost had three against Hull City<br /><br />Of course, it was a great game, we played very well, we had a plan to come into this game. We were unlucky because we made a mistake and then we suffered an away goal but I think the result is still open. We can try to go there and win the game. It will be a completely different game, to play there is different. But if we go with the same mentality as we did against Atletico, we can go there with great spirit and win the game</p>

That is why we are in this position now. There’s no reason why. It’s football. We have been unlucky. We are doing the exact same job as we did last season. But football is like that. For example, we were in control during the last game against West Ham and could have won 4-1 or 4-0 but we drew<br /><br />My performances have been good but not enough. When we started the season I was playing games then I went to the bench and now I’m back starting again. For me it has been good. We are Chelsea. We always want to win titles but of course we have to win the FA Cup to finish the season well. If we win this title it will not make up for this season. I think our target was to stay in the top four and we are fifth. The only title we can win is the FA Cup so we go for that. Next season we will be back stronger to try to win again</p>

  <p><b>[Willian is excited at the prospect of trying to win Brazil’s first World Cup since 2002]</b> I’ve learned a lot in my time England. I have been here for five years, so I’ve learned many things. English football is not simple and it is very different to others. I think it’s one of the strongest leagues in the world. There’s no doubt that to play there you can’t just arrive and play with ease. You must also understand how English football works, understand the Premier League. I already liked the Premier League before playing for Chelsea, and there’s no doubt that it has been a huge learning curve to me over these five years.<br /><br />I followed the 2002 World Cup and watched every game. They were players of great quality, players that had already been the best in the world back then. Players like Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Ronaldo as well the likes of Kaka, Gilberto Silva, Roberto Carlos, and Cafu. They are all players who were successful with the Brazilian national shirt, so we also try to mirror ourselves in them so we can find success and we hope to do the same thing they did, which is to win the World Cup. Tite’s arrival was definitely important. He’s a very intelligent manager who brought us many ideas; someone of great ability. I think to me he’s one of the best coaches in today’s football, both for what he has done and for what he’s doing right now with Brazil. He’s definitely a coach that has changed our game style, our game patterns, both with and without the ball. So, this is all helping us a lot on the pitch<br /><br />It’ll be very interesting to play at Anfield, a stadium that is very beautiful after being refurbished, and with the atmosphere of playing in England, which is also very different. It’ll be different with the Selecao, so there’s no doubt that it’ll be an important game, and we’ll keep our mentality of being able to play well, with the knowledge that it’s a game to prepare for the World Cup. There’s no doubt that the importance is to prepare us well with every game by maintaining the same game style and same game philosophy and to keep mentally strong during those games, which are all very important for us to be able to arrive in form at the World Cup</p>

We are playing at home but they are a good team who are full of confidence so we have to pay great attention in every type of situation. We want to win the game and we have prepared very well.

It’s hard to pinpoint favorites. There are four or five teams, including Brazil, that can reach the same level.

I have always been clear about enjoying playing for Chelsea, I have never <b>[said]</b> that I wanted to leave the club, but some situations that have happened with the other coach left me upset. But now it’s a new cycle. I had a nice conversation with the new coach. I hope this can be a year of victory for us. I have no doubts, it is a game style that we like. Not just me, but all the players. So we have everything to improve and keep working. At the beginning it is a little more difficult until we get the new style of play and its changes. But we have it all to start well in the league.</p>

  <p><b>[How Willian went from the streets of Sao Paulo to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>. On Wednesday evening in <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a>, Willian made his 300th appearance for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> My dad was working in the street and my mum was working every day as a cleaner. My life was like that. Growing up was very difficult. Sometimes we didn’t have money to go to training so they asked somebody to give us some. My parents gave everything. They sacrificed, they went to work. Sometimes they worked 24 hours, so they called friends to help us. They did everything for me to become a football player. <b>[When I got my first pay cheque at Corinthians]</b>, I got an apartment for my family and I bought a car for my dad as well. I also got my first car. I had seen players buy a Land Rover but my first car was only a Celta. But I was still so happy<br /><br /><b>[For Willian, then, the app is an attempt to provide a helping hand to those less fortunate than himself]</b> I started to play at four years old. I went to Corinthians at nine years old. Then, it started to become more serious. I was actually playing against Corinthians at the time but, at the end of a game, the manager from Corinthians came to me and said that they liked me. ‘Where are you parents? Are they here?’ they asked. I said yes, so they had a conversation with my dad. They said, ‘We want your son to come and stay with us for a week so we can see him play more.’ I went there and stayed for nine years before becoming a professional. In my head, it was like ‘I want to become a professional player.’ I had a dream and I went for it but I couldn’t do it alone. That’s what people have to know, especially parents. The dad and mum, they can’t do it alone. If something bad happens, you can’t give up. You have to push, like my mum did with me. She never gave up in difficult situations. My parents wanted me to live my dream<br /><br /><b>[In October 2016, Willian was left devastated when his mother, Donna Zee, passed away in hospital after battling a brain tumour for two-and-a-half years]</b> It was a difficult moment but I had people that supported me and helped me a lot. It was very hard and thanks to God I turned the situation around to continue my career</p>

  <p><b>[Willian offers <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> future hint as contract runs down towards free agency]</b> I always believed I could play so many games. I had to believe. It’s difficult to achieve this number, especially when you play for a big club like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because there are many, many players that are fighting for the same position. It was a challenge for me. In football you have to prove yourself every day, in every game. When you stop doing that you have to stop playing. You have to prove it to yourself as well. I have done that.<br /><br />I have been here already for six years, I have had different managers, different players in the squad, and I was proving every training session, every game, that I can play many, many years for this club. I think I have improved a lot. Every game you can learn from. Then after every game you ask yourself ‘What have I done well, what have I not done well?’ I always want to continue improving. Now I’m very proud to reach this number, and I hope for 300 more to come!<br /><br /><b>[Willian, who joined <a href="chelsea-fc.html">the Blues</a> from Anzhi Makhachkala in 2013]</b> To achieve this number for this club is unbelievable.

I had this affection with this club since they made an offer for me when I was at Shakhtar. I started watching the games and supporting this team. I loved the name, ‘Chelsea’. The colour blue. And then I had the chance to play at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> for Shakhtar. When I stop playing, my name will be there. No-one can cross it off. I feel proud of that</p>

However, this is a question that I still don’t know the answer to, if I will stay at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, move to another team from London, or leave England.<br /><br /><b>[Willian went on to deny that ex-Chelsea boss <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> has been in contact over a possible reunion <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> No, no. I did not get anything from <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> even though I have a good relationship with him. He is not only a great coach but also a great friend of mine. Sometimes we talk but regarding this situation, he totally respects it. I learnt a bit from each of them <b>[my other managers]</b> but I identified myself more with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> for sure. He trusted in my potential, liked my football, gave me full confidence to play. He is the best coach I have worked with</p>

  <p><b>[Willian says Majority of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players uncomfortable about returning]</b> Majority of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> players uncomfortable about returning. We’re really keen to return, we really miss playing and doing what we love. But it needs to be safe for us to do so. That’s how we’re looking at it. Our health has to come first. So right now, players don’t feel comfortable with the idea of returning until it’s totally safe to do so. Our squad has spoken a lot over the internet, via different apps, and we’ve had some meetings too. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> has sent us information about what <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> wants to do. We still don’t know how things are going to play out, moving forward. Hopefully, we’ll know in the next few days. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is going to have a meeting and then they’ll inform us about the next steps.</p>

  <p><b>[Willian open to temporary <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> deal but long-term future remains in doubt]</b> It’s a difficult situation because <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> offered me two years and they are not going to change what they offered. I said I wanted three more years. The situation is difficult because of this. I really don’t know if it will be possible <b>[to stay]</b>. My goal is to continue working and focus on the remainder of the season, so that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> can continue winning games. I have a clear head and I’m focused for the rest of the season that we have left. I think it’s difficult <b>[to stay]</b>. Let’s see what happens</p>

  <p><b>[Willian, like most modern footballers, has seen his fair share of criticism on social media]</b> In terms of social media, I remember the back-end of my playing career I had a couple of moments of viewing of what fans thought of me, either <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> or outside. And it kind of stopped me wanting to look at it again because if you were to view social media, you’d never pick a team, you’d change it every two seconds. And I suppose that’s the beauty of football in one way, that everyone has opinions. My opinion, fortunately, is the important one here at the moment, at the club. And I get to see what the players are like, how they train day to day, so when you make a selection people might comment on from the outside, they don’t see what you see. And I have a huge value on training, how players behave and work in training in the week. I knew Willian had it as a player because I’ve played with him. I think we’ve all seen it on the pitch this year, his work ethic off the ball, his creation and his work on the ball, and you saw it against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> as well. So I think, generally, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans hold him in real high regard. It’s difficult in the modern day to take a view on what social media says from all over the world. I think people who are in the club know the value of him, and no matter what happens at the end of the season, he’s been a fantastic servant for the club</p>
