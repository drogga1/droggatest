  <p><b>[Willian speaks after Brazil’s 3-0 win over Paraguay and the South Americans became the second team, after hosts Russia, to qualify for the 2018 World Cup]</b> The way we are playing is being watched all over the world. People are saying that the champions are back. I think this is really important, to play with confidence. But it is also important to keep humble, realistic, be conscious that we haven’t won anything yet. And that our biggest aim is the World Cup. I guess we can celebrate for being qualified. We’re almost there or we have just sealed our passport, but everybody knows which celebration we want to make the most</p>

  <p><b>[Willian speaks about the mood in the team’s camp ahead of the World Cup]</b> I think we will get on well in the World Cup. It’s hard to pinpoint favourites. There are four or five teams, including Brazil, that can reach the same level. The World Cup is a tournament that practically does not allow errors, especially in the final. From the last World Cup, we’ve learned the good and the bad sides of the tournament, which was the moment we were eliminated. This time my expectation is that we can experience only the good side</p>

Yes. I wanted him to score the first goal today. But it will come soon. We have a great relationship, we know each other inside the pitch.<br /><br />We know the quality of the players we have in front, a lot of quality players, technical players so it’s great when you have players like <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a>, <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Hudson-Odoi</a>, <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a>, <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>, <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a>.

  <p><b>[Willian says the only way the club’s season can be deemed a success is if <a href="chelsea-fc.html">the Blues</a> return from Baku with the Europa League trophy next week]</b> I know that it has not been my best season. It was okay, but it wasn’t top. I know I can play much better. Not only me, but the whole squad, it wasn’t our best season. We all know we can do better. But at the end we set some targets and we reached some of them. We reached the Carabao Cup Final, reached the third position in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and now we have the Europa League Final to play. If you see at the end and we win the trophy, then I think it’s been a good season. We have qualified for the Champions League and can win a European trophy which is a good season, even though we always want more.<br /><br />We have to be strong and do everything possible to win this game. We are already motivated because it’s always good to win finals, always good to win trophies and this group of players has done that for many years. We want to win this trophy so much and we have to go there and make sure we come back with the trophy. It’s a derby game against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, who have a great team with great players, and we have to do everything possible to win. It’s always difficult to play against them. We want to win another trophy, a European trophy. It’s going to be a very good game and we believe we can do it. We have to play the same way, stay focused all of the time and go there to win. That’s what we want. A London derby in Baku will be a bit strange, but we have to go there with the right mentality to win this game and I don’t think it matters where we play</p>

  <p><b>[Willian believes he and his team-mates were underestimated this season as they reached two finals and secured silverware with a dominant victory over <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in the Europa League final]</b> We don’t listen in this situation, we just focus on our training, on the game. We leave this part for the club to resolve and we have to focus on the game. I think that we are underestimated. I think so. A lot of people, they think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have no chance to win anything this season because they don’t play well or something like this, but today we win this important trophy. Now we have to enjoy the holidays and prepare for next season. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> want to win titles. Every year <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fight for titles - something important. This year was the same. To finish the season in this way is amazing. I think we did a great job. I think there were a lot of ups and downs. At the end we took the third position in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, we went to the Carabao Cup final and now we win the Europa League final, so if you think about that, you can say it was good. Now it’s time to enjoy.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> also said that he believes the final]</b> Of course, it is difficult to lose players like him.

On Wednesday evening in <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a>, Willian made his 300th appearance for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> My dad was working in the street and my mum was working every day as a cleaner. My life was like that. Growing up was very difficult. Sometimes we didn’t have money to go to training so they asked somebody to give us some. My parents gave everything. They sacrificed, they went to work. Sometimes they worked 24 hours, so they called friends to help us. They did everything for me to become a football player. <b>[When I got my first pay cheque at Corinthians]</b>, I got an apartment for my family and I bought a car for my dad as well. I also got my first car. I had seen players buy a Land Rover but my first car was only a Celta. But I was still so happy<br /><br /><b>[For Willian, then, the app is an attempt to provide a helping hand to those less fortunate than himself]</b> I started to play at four years old. I went to Corinthians at nine years old. Then, it started to become more serious. I was actually playing against Corinthians at the time but, at the end of a game, the manager from Corinthians came to me and said that they liked me. ‘Where are you parents? Are they here?’ they asked. I said yes, so they had a conversation with my dad. They said, ‘We want your son to come and stay with us for a week so we can see him play more.’ I went there and stayed for nine years before becoming a professional. In my head, it was like ‘I want to become a professional player.’ I had a dream and I went for it but I couldn’t do it alone. That’s what people have to know, especially parents. The dad and mum, they can’t do it alone. If something bad happens, you can’t give up. You have to push, like my mum did with me. She never gave up in difficult situations. My parents wanted me to live my dream<br /><br /><b>[In October 2016, Willian was left devastated when his mother, Donna Zee, passed away in hospital after battling a brain tumour for two-and-a-half years]</b> It was a difficult moment but I had people that supported me and helped me a lot.

And I have a huge value on training, how players behave and work in training in the week. I knew Willian had it as a player because I’ve played with him.
