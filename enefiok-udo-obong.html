<blockquote>
  <p>[Olympic gold medallist Enefiok Udo-Obong has thrown his weight behind Usain Bolt’s desire to become a professional footballer] He’s a sportsman who has reached the highest level of his career and all he is looking for is a new challenge. Bolt is someone who is known to honour new challenges. He ran the 400 metres, 200 metres before he dominated the 100 metres. At each time he got a new challenge, he loved it; he conquered it and did very well. So going into football is not something that is going to be difficult for him.<br /><br />He is probably not going to be Ronaldo [Cristiano] but he’s somebody who can cut his way across for the next three to four years as a footballer. In terms of training, it’ll be easier for him because training for individual sports requires more from you than team sports. In terms of match fitness and game-play situations, I think it’ll be more challenging because you learn football when you’re younger when you’re 20 and in your late teens. That might be one or two problems he might have. In terms of actually playing the football, if he’s skilful and he’s good, he’ll probably be a good footballer</p>
