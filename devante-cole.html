  <p><b>[Devante Cole has the art of goalscoring in his blood, as the son of Manchester United legend Andy]</b> When I trained with him <b>[Aguero]</b>, I would look at him and feel that’s the level you have to get to ultimately. He’s different class. The things he does in training, the finishing and touches, that’s the level. He’s very special. He almost does what he wants. He can just turn it on and that’s the level he’s at.<br /><br /><b>[On his mentors at City]</b> There was <b>[Edin]</b> Dzeko and <b>[Alvaro]</b> Negredo, and another one I learned a lot from was <b>[Emmanuel]</b> Adebayor, who was there when I first went up <b>[to the first team]</b>. Not a lot of people realise how good he is, because for me he’s one of the best I have seen. He’s got everything<br /><br /><b>[On Jamie Vardy]</b> I think you look at his story and everyone thinks ‘that’s a great success story’, so that can’t not inspire you. I feel like, what he is and what he’s done, if I could do that or another player could do that, I think that’s the aim<br /><br />I’m not so much a Sturridge type, it’s about making your own way. I’m making mine now. Sturridge did the same, he moved to a few different places before he got in and started doing the business. Hopefully I can do the same<br /><br />Any player’s aim is to do well while you are in the team and if that leads to moving on, then you take it. But I just need to focus on the next game, do well against Leicester, score goals. Ultimately it is my ambition to get there, I just need to work hard and see what happens. Everyone is different and I have done it my way. I’ve had to take a step backwards to go forwards so hopefully now I can really kick on, step forward again and get back to where I really want to be<br /><br />We’re trying to approach it like any other game. Obviously it’s the biggest game for Fleetwood for a while, and probably for a lot of us, but I think we’ve just got to treat it like any other game. When it comes to matchday, we have just got to go out and play like we can and see what happens. It’s a massive platform - it’s against a Premier League side and they won the title a couple of years ago. It’s huge and there will be a lot of people watching. It’s one of those where if the club performs well or you perform well, it’s good for everyone<br /><br /><b>[Cole will, however, be denied the opportunity to test himself against title-winning centre-half Wes Morgan, with the Leicester captain having suffered an untimely injury]</b> I would have loved that challenge. As a player you always want to test yourself against the best players, or whoever the best players are for that team. I would rather he would be in the team</p>
