<blockquote>
  <p>[With Brazil set to take on Juan Antonio Pizzi’s side in Riyadh on Friday] This tournament will provide an opportunity to the less experience but talented midfield line-up of Otayf, Bahebri and Kanno, offering them the chance to get some good playing time against quality sides. The defence has always been a challenge for the Saudi set-up. While the squad has physically strong players at the back, it will be interesting to see how they fare against the pace and technical abilities of the likes of Neymar and Gabriel Jesus. They tend to get easily disoriented in the first 15 - 20 minutes of the half, given the pressure from playing against a team like Brazil. However, the good news for them is the inclusion of 41-year-old Hussein Abdul Ghani, who was recalled after being away for two years. He is among the top-three most consistent players with decent performances in the current season of the league. The team will be looking to his experience both on and off the pitch. He is only one in the squad who knows what it’s like to play against Brazil, given he had faced them twice earlier</p>
