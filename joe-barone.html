It’s the city of art, of love, he already speaks Italian pretty well and his wife loves Florence. He was offered a lot of money elsewhere, but he chose <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> for a club that is growing and he saw at the airport how important the fans are in that choice. He is training, is very eager and today is a very important moment for <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>. It’s exciting fans throughout Tuscany and the world, I saw so many people at the airport and hope there will be many more at the stadium tomorrow to celebrate <a href="franck-ribery.html">Ribery</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> Chief Executive Officer Joe Barone has confirmed that several English clubs are ‘knocking at the door’ to sign Federico Chiesa]</b> Chiesa is a <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> player. There are clubs knocking at the door for Chiesa, some of them who speak English … We’ll see. For the moment, we just need to finish the season and he is very concentrated on doing well for us. As for Gaetano Castrovilli, he still has much to give for us and for Italian football, so he will remain in Florence<br /><br />Castrovilli is one of the Italian talents we are betting on. He has a great margin of growth and is convinced of our ambitions. Chiesa has overcome his physical problems and has returned to being what everyone has already seen. Federico is happy, he has a contract. We’ll see at the end of the season</p>

He is a very well-known player of a high level <b>[but]</b> that is all at the moment</p>
