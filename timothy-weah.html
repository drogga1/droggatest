  <p>At training I see <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> do crazy stuff. <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>, he’s closer <b>[at 19]</b> to my age, so I relate more with him, and when I see him doing the stuff he does in training, it pushes me to go out there and try hard and also be myself and show what I can do with the ball at my feet. I’m getting there. I’m a late bloomer. It’s taking time. But I try to just take it day by day. I train hard. Even after training, I stay two hours behind and try to work on my passes and finishing. It’s getting there</p>

  <p><b>[Timothy Weah has made the move from Paris Saint-Germain to Lille]</b> For me LOSC is the best choice to progress and earn playing time. It’s a young and ambitious team, I know that <b>[head coach]</b> Christophe Galtier and his staff are very professional and appreciated by the players. Joining LOSC is a big deal, this team had a great season last year, finishing second is a great performance, playing in the Champions League is also a dream that I will be able to achieve. I want to score goals in my new colors and help this club to win games and trophies.</p>

  <p><b>[New Lille signing Timothy Weah says he wants to follow in the footsteps of some of the club’s most notable luminaries, with former players such as Eden Hazard and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang giving him all the incentive he needed to join LOSC]</b> I’ve known this club since I’ve played in France, and I want to discover its history. Great players have come here like Aubameyang, Hazard and (Nicolas) Pepe, and I am very happy to be here. I know that if I work well, I’ll improve. Now the work begins, and I cannot wait to play in front of the fans. For me, LOSC was the best club - they were second in the championship (last season) and qualified for the Champions League.<br /><br />I know that Eden Hazard played here. It boosts me to be in his old club. Scotland was a very physical championship, but I gained confidence and learned a maturity of the game. I scored some goals too, so it prepared me to come here</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT striker Timothy Weah set for spell on the sidelines with torn hamstring]</b> Felt amazing to be on the field again with my team-mates after six months, and thank you to our beautiful supporters who came out and cheered us on. But unfortunately for me, things didn’t go as planned and I’ve injured myself again. Better days will come and I know that God is watching over me. Small setback for a major comeback</p>
