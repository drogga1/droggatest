  <p><b>[USMNT youngsters Tim Weah and Josh Sargent shake off nerves to score in friendly romp over Bolivia]</b> I’m always nervous coming into these games because obviously it’s my first start, and it’s Josh’s first start, and we’ve come such a long way, we just want to impress our fans. We just want to play with our hearts and play for our fans, and I think we did that today, but there’s always going to be a little nervousness coming out here. We’re still young, and we played in front of about 11,267 fans, so that’s insane for a young guy.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether he felt more nervousness on Monday or when he started for PSG]</b> I think I was more nervous here, because with PSG I’ve already played two games. It was my first start, but it’s also the end of the season, you’re kind of just relaxing. I wasn’t that nervous, but here, I was nervous on my debut, and I was nervous here because now I’ve got the chance and I’m on the stage to start the game and show the United States what I can really do. That was going through my mind at the moment even though it’s just a friendly. but I take pride in games like this and I just wanted to do well<br /><br />I’m super happy, but I don’t want to get too ahead of myself and too happy because I know there’s other games that we have to play. Tomorrow’s a new day and I have to go back in the lab and just keep working and keep working to hopefully have a great performance against Ireland and France. That’s my goal, scoring against <b>[France]</b> would be great. I have some teammates on France so that would be great, scoring against them</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Weah planning PSG stay after scoring first goal for USA]</b> It’s an incredible club, an incredible bunch of players, incredible coaching staff, I’m learning so much from playing with them each day at such a young age and I’m maturing in a way that I really wanted to. I’m seeing my game really develop for the better. I’m really happy to be at PSG, I want to stay there and learn and hopefully get some playing time. I feel like a loan is a little too early. I still want to be with them, get some more minutes and maybe at the end of next season or in the middle of next season, I’ll go out on loan. Who knows? It’s the coach’s choice. When I meet the coach <b>[Thomas Tuchel]</b>, we’re probably going to have a talk and discuss the future.</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain forward Timothy Weah can’t wait to see what the future has in store]</b> Despite the defeat, we worked very well. We had a very young side and to play against a side like Bayern Munich is a great opportunity for us. Now we have to keep on working hard. I can’t wait to see what the future has in store for us, but I’m sure we’re going to win a lot of matches. Coming here and working hard and playing well is a great feeling.<br /><br />We came here with a very young and inexperienced squad. Lassana <b>[Diarra]</b>, Christopher <b>[Nkunku]</b>, Gigi <b>[Buffon]</b> and I had the role of guiding the others a little. I’m very happy with the work we’ve got done here. The coach gave us orders to avoid being overrun against a far-more experienced side. We did what he said and we enjoyed a very good first half and showed our quality. It was tougher after the break, with the fatigue. But overall, it was a very positive friendly match. We need to build on this now. The coach is very happy… the final result is not important. We can be very proud of our young players tonight</p>

Of course I watch videos of my father’s goals from time to time, while I also receive a lot of advice from him, but what you see on the pitch is the result of my own hard work.</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Weah hits USMNT camp sporting new look and boosted confidence]</b> I am Tim Weah. I was just sitting in the <b>[barber’s]</b> chair one day and I was like, ‘wow, I need a change,’ so I just cut it off. And it’s getting hot.<br /><br />As you saw against Bolivia <b>[in May]</b>, coming in as a young 18-year-old playing against professionals and playing with professionals that I used to watch. I came in with a little bit less confidence, and a little bit less swagger because I was kind of holding back. I wanted to play simple. I’m more confident now. I’m training every day with the best players so in this camp I really want to show the world and show our supporters what I can really do on the ball. Build plays, spark plays, create plays, score goals. That’s my main goal, racking up on stats. Once I get that no matter what age, 18, 19, 20, I’ll always have that confidence<br /><br />I was supposed to go on loan earlier this season and I chose not to go. I chose to stay and work on my game because I feel like under <b>[PSG manager Thomas]</b> Tuchel and the players that we have it’s going to be great for me. My game is going to develop so much and I’m going to mature and I feel like that was the best decision for me. I don’t want to rush anything. I’m only 18. But in the future we’ll see. Maybe a loan takes me. Maybe after this year I’ll be a little more comfortable playing professional soccer<br /><br /><b>[On Thomas Tuchel]</b> Amazing. One of the best coaches I’ve ever worked with. Tactically he’s amazing, technically he’s an amazing coach. Without his coaching staff I feel like he wouldn’t be the coach he is. He’s a great person. I love him so much. With the young guys he really shows us that he cares about us. With all the guys he shows us he’s a team guy and he loves his players like they’re his children. He’s really there for us, and he pushes us to be the best we can be. He gets angry at us sometimes but we all know it’s for the better. I can’t wait to get more games under Tuchel, and hopefully next season I’ll have a great spot and I’ll be in a good position to eventually take a path like Cavani<br /><br /><b>[On Neymar]</b> He’s super talented. A great guy. Super confident when he’s on the pitch. You’ve just got to keep your eyes on him and just watch everything that he does because he’s one of the best players in the world and it’s super hard to play against him. I feel like with the group of guys we have here, with Tyler Adams helping in with the defense from the midfield, and John Brooks, Matt Miazga, <b>[Cameron Carter-Vickers]</b> I feel like, as young guys we can really get the job done<br /><br /><b>[1-1 draw with France in June]</b> These games, they build confidence. Playing against World Cup winners, we didn’t know they were going to win the World Cup, but we played our buts off like it was a final for us and we tied France 1-1. These games are completely important to this group because it’s something to build on, and it’s growth, and that’s what we need. We need to really jell together because we do have new guys coming in each camp. The squad is getting younger each camp. Games like this, playing against Brazil, if we do get a result - and I really feel that we will - it’s going to be a huge confidence builder and it’s going to be great going to Nashville to play Mexico</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain forward Timothy Weah revealed his mother played a big part in convincing him to remain with the Ligue 1 champions]</b> It was a family decision. My mom, she thought I am still really young and tender. There’s still some stuff to work on. She thought if I did go to a lower team in the same league, there would be so many expectations to carry that team or potentially fight for a league winning spot. I don’t feel that I’m ready for that.<br /><br />I’m always ready for a challenge but right now I feel like training with PSG, training with Neymar, Thiago Silva and getting better each day - I feel like that’s the way to go. That’s the choice we made<br /><br />Playing with one of the best teams in the world, it gives you huge confidence coming to international camp. I wouldn’t say on the same level but you feel more confident when you’ve played like guys like Neymar, Thiago Silva. You know how they play. You’re with them every day and they’re like your brothers. Coming into these games you’re super confident. I felt with the touches that I had, I showed a confidence. It’s just right now, I’m super young and I’m still learning. I still had a bit of jitters playing against Brazil but it’s something to work on and the future is really bright for us<br /><br />There’s still so much time. I’m only 18. So who knows? In January, when the transfer market is open again hopefully look see where it is</p>

It’s going to be interesting to see what they are really like when you’re not watching them on TV and you’re playing against them.

He’s looking to play me as a nine and I can’t wait. I’m so excited to be here. I feel like the coach has a great plan for me and I think he’ll help me develop as a man. The little bit of experience I have will benefit me but I feel that by being here, learning from all the other guys and the coaching staff, combined with hard work and dedication, then I’ll be able to give the fans what they want.<br /><br />I went there knowing I had to put the work in to get where I wanted to be. A few years later, I am playing alongside Neymar and <b>[Kylian]</b> Mbappe. It is an awesome feeling, but I know that is not even half the work done. I have so much more to give and improve on. It is really hard to impose yourself with such great players in front of you. I feel like being at Celtic now is the place for me. My father has played at Celtic before. He has told me it is really intense and it is good to grow as a footballer by playing for this club<br /><br /><b>[Celtic return to action after their winter break with a Scottish Cup fourth-round tie against Airdrieonians]</b> It is a wonderful moment for me, and such a blessing with such a great coach like Brendan Rodgers to lead me in the right direction.

It’s all about experience and coming into a late game where the game is tight and the other team is playing really well, you know the coach is expecting something from you. At such a young age, it was great to have a game like that for my confidence. All credit to the team. We played 100 per cent for the whole game.<br /><br />I am proud of the guys and I thank the coaching staff for having the confidence in me to put me on. I didn’t even realise that Odsonne <b>[Edouard]</b> had got injured. But the manager called my name and Kolo <b>[Toure]</b> spoke to me before I went on. He said, ‘This is your opportunity, you are a young kid but go and make a difference’. The gaffer then told me the same thing and that’s what I tried to do. It worked out that way and God helped me get the win. It was amazing. I will play wherever the coach wants me to. If he wants me to play defensive mid or centre-back, I would do it. I am just here to provide for the team.<br /><br />I have settled in really well because of the team-mates I have around me. There are no egos. I have gelled with the guys and the fans, and everyone has accepted me. The coaching staff tell me things I need to develop but it’s amazing to have this kind of support. I don’t know much about Celtic but I am getting there. It’s just a great feeling to be accepted in this way by everyone. I have embraced the club, the atmosphere and I have a lot of love for the guys. They are my brothers now and I am so happy to get the experience with such an amazing club. To be out there in every game with this group of players…I couldn’t ask for any more.</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic’s Timothy Weah says life in Glasgow has lived up to his expectations]</b> Whisky. I’d say you guys just drink all the time in general, not only whisky. There’s some people that speak really fast and you tend to get lost in their accent. Some of the guys I do understand though, it’s like a 50/50 thing. Mikey, Mikey Johnstone by far <b>[is the hardest to understand]</b>, because he speaks so fast.<br /><br />Oh, 100%. 100% <b>[the weather is poor]</b>. There’s not been one day I’ve been in Scotland it’s been sunny and nice here. It’s always been cold and raining. I guess I can give you guys a break as today at training was pretty good, but overall that one is true.</p>

  <p><b>[Timothy Weah has conceded that his future may lie away from Paris Saint-Germain]</b> You never know, we’ll see after the season. We will talk about it with Badou <b>[Sambague, his lawyer]</b><br /><br />Frankly I do not know. Everyone has their life. I think it was good for them. For now, I’m not sure what I’ll do, we’ll discuss it<br /><br />No, there is no problem with the PSG. Never. Paris did everything for me, I stayed four years. I loved and I still love PSG. The president is amazing and the players are my brothers. It’s like that in football, sometimes you come across things you do not control<br /><br /><b>[When asked if it is possible for him to make an impression in a star-studded PSG]</b> Yes, it’s still my goal. I think that if I play, I can find my place. For the moment, it’s a little hard, because there are the big names, but I still think about it. I will never let go. It depends on the confidence of the coach. If there is none, I will not find my place, so we’ll see</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Weah’s time with Celtic may not come to an end when the season comes to a close]</b> It was an amazing feeling to get that celebration in and was great to see Ryan Christie back on the field and also scoring another goal. It was an amazing night<br /><br />Obviously, because I wasn’t getting game-time where I was, being here at Celtic and getting the experience has been awesome. Being in a different league has been great. The physicality in this league has been great. It’s taught me a lot and made me stronger. I’m just taking it step by step and maturing in my game, learning from the other guys in the team<br /><br />I feel like it’s a possibility. It’s something me and my family have to go over at the end of the season. I am loving it here so far, so we just have to see what happens. I’m really positive about the situation, happy to be at the club and making the most of these opportunities. When I do get game time I just try to help the team and be positive, and I try to get a goal and help the team when I can. ‘That’s been my mentality from the start and it’s going to be my mentality until the end of the season. I am really happy and just blessed to get the opportunities I’ve got so far</p>

  <p><b>[Timothy Weah says it is his goal to return to Paris Saint-Germain next season]</b> I hope to return to PSG next season and meet the expectations of the club and the coach in me. My ambition has always been to be a PSG player. I developed at the club and it has always been a dream. And it still is; to have the level to evolve in such a strong team with these incredible players. It remains my goal. I like this club and I have been there for four years. Why not more?</p>
