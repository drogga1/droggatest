  <p><b>[FC Koln confirm three positive coronavirus tests after return to training]</b> Three people tested positive, all are symptom free. After an assessment of the cases by the responsible health authorities, the three people who tested positive will go into a 14-day quarantine at home. FC Koln will not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those affected. FC Koln’s training can continue as planned, according to the hygiene and infection control measures that have been in place since April 6th in group training</p>

  <p><b>[Second round of coronavirus tests at Koln are all negative]</b> On Sunday, 1. FC Koln had the entire team, as well as the coaching and backroom staff, tested for Covid-19. All tests from the independent laboratory were negative. On Monday morning, Markus Gisdol’s team will continue to train in groups. Training is not open to the public. The medical concept from the <a href="dfl.html">DFL</a> <b>[German Football League]</b> sees the regular testing as a prerequisite for the possible continuation of the league. Only players who have been tested negatively twice in succession are allowed to train and play</p>

  <p><b>[Koln plan quarantine-like training camp]</b> This form of voluntary quarantine extends the existing infection control and hygiene concept and is intended to further reduce the risk of infection from COVID-19. The measure will be/has been taken regardless of the results of the COVID-19 tests at FC. The concept of the ‘Task Force Sports Medicine/ Extraordinary Matchday Operation’ of the <a href="dfl.html">DFL</a> already provides that all teams go to quarantine-like training camps one week before the games restart. FC, however, prefer to start this period at the beginning of team training</p>

  <p><b>[Koln created a display from shirts provided by fans for their <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> home game against Mainz on Sunday]</b> We asked #effzeh fans if they wanted to hand over their lucky scarf or kit to be placed in the stadium for the upcoming games. It’s not the same as you being there and it never will be, but thank you</p>
