  <p><b>[Jurgen Klopp would be a good fit for Bayern Munich]</b> He is under contract until 2022 and I don’t think his work is finished <b>[at Liverpool]</b> yet. But you have to bear in mind many factors. When you move to England, you cannot underestimate the lack of a winter break. This reduces your lifetime.<br /><br />Coaching one of the big clubs in Europe isn’t something that is unattractive, but everything has to suit. Yes, Bayern are looking for a coach in the summer, but Jurgen has a long contract. At the moment, Jurgen isn’t thinking about coaching another club than the Reds. No coach in the world is bigger than any club. Generally, the club is always bigger. Jurgen isn’t too big for Bayern Munich and Bayern Munich isn’t too big for him. He definitely could do a very good job there. Bayern and Klopp would be a good fit, but it isn’t something that is an option at the moment<br /><br />I have to say that Bayern was often an option because Jurgen knows Uli Hoeness very well. But it was never the right time and nothing definite came of it. Back then Franz Beckenbauer was president and the pair worked together as TV experts during the 2006 World Cup. They get on well and are still in contact. But Jurgen can definitely end his coaching career without having coached Bayern Munich</p>

  <p><b>[The agent of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>, Marc Kosicke, has claimed <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are keen to tie the German down to a new contract at the club]</b> Jurgen himself once said that in the event that <a href="joachim-low.html">Joachim Low</a> someday no longer wants to be the national coach and it would be possible for him do that <b>[job]</b>, this is an option for him.<br /><br /><b>[However, he added that <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has no plans to leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> before his current deal expires in 2022]</b> <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would even like to extend it. <b>[Jurgen]</b> felt again at the recent celebrations <b>[after winning the Champions League]</b>, what a great club <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is, and that he is in the right place at the right time<br /><br /><b>[Kosicke also implied that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would not allow another side to speak with their current boss]</b> Jurgen is currently not affordable. But it is difficult to measure the transfer fee in his case anyway. How is this going to work for a coach who has increased the club’s value from nearly £900 million to just under £2.8 billion? That is not how it works</p>

  <p><b>[Jurgen <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s agent, Marc Kosicke, has suggested that the success of any contract extension talks at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> may be influenced by the British weather]</b> Jurgen’s contract is still valid until 2022 and it is an open secret that the club would like to extend. We still have a little time for that. We must wait and see how everything develops and whether climate change will bring better weather to England or only to Germany. One should not underestimate <b>[the bad weather]</b>. I remember that in November or December, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> first asked for a contract extension. I said: ‘Let’s wait’.<br /><br />Ulla <b>[<a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s wife]</b> and Jurgen get up in the morning and it’s dark. When they meet again in the evening, it is also dark or it is grey and there is drizzle. During the winter break in Germany, if the weather is really bad, the clubs go on vacation for two weeks, then come back and fly directly to the training camp in the sun for several days. During this time, the coaches in England sometimes have to prepare for up to 13 games. They are already exhausted and it’s not so easy<br /><br /><b>[Kosicke added on <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s drive, which may also see him opt to walk away and take a break]</b> Jurgen is not just interested in the win next Saturday. It is also about how the club is perceived and that everyone has a good working environment. The joy of daily work is the basic requirement for this. He always says: ‘If we are already there, then we must still give 100 per cent’. So I think it’s this mix. Without taking into account the fact that his work is evaluated publicly every day. A CEO of a DAX board does not have that, they are judged by quarterly figures. The fact that every day something is written about you, how you work, how you look and he still gets on with things so well, that’s what attracts the leaders of clubs to him<br /><br /><b>[<a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s CV also offers obvious appeal to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and any other suitor]</b> He is not only proud of the process that is going on, but also very happy that titles are back in the closet. Therefore, winning <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> would still be a goal for Jurgen. There are these six top teams in the league. Jurgen has recently said his biggest problem in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is Manchester City</p>

And he doesn’t know either. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is currently positioning itself in the long term. It’s also about planning security. Players like <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>, <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, they should all extend or already have it.
