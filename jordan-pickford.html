  <p><b>[Everton and England star Jordan Pickford considers himself to be a better goalkeeper than David de Gea was at the same stage of his career]</b> De Gea has been unbelievable for the last two or three seasons and is probably the best in the world at the minute. This is only my second season in the Premier League. It took De Gea a while and I don’t think it has taken me that long to get to this level.<br /><br /><b>[Manue]</b> Neuer is one I really admire because he plays the role in his own way. You have got to play it your own way but he takes it to the next level the way he plays. But when I was younger, it was always <b>[Joe]</b> Hart I looked up to. They’re the ones who have got experience but I am always learning and always wanting to improve<br /><br />I have always been confident but never arrogant. Knowing I am capable of doing it, and it is what the manager wants, does not faze me. It is all about game management as well and if you watch the games, I always play out at the right times. I would not take unnecessary risks and I would never try to overkill the players I am passing to. Against Nigeria, I played some balls out that were nice but then a couple of times I played a few longer ones which were better. That is the way we are going to play in the World Cup and I am very suited to that style, very capable of doing it, so I am going to do it. But it’s about when you do it</p>

  <p><b>[England’s penalty shoot-out hero Jordan Pickford has rubbished claims he is too small to be a world-class goalkeeper]</b> I have got power and agility. I don’t care if I’m not the biggest keeper because it’s about being there in the moment and making the save, and I was. It is all about the set position and I got a hand to it. I did all my research. We knew we had this game, even if it had to go to penalties, we knew we were capable of winning.<br /><br /><b>[Pickford appeared to have chosen the wrong side as Bacca’s penalty flew down the middle]</b> I was in a massive whirlwind but I saved it with my left hand. I’ve been criticised for going with my top hand, but as long as you save it, that’s all that counts. I might be young but I’ve got good mental strength and experience and I used that today. It’s a great night to win a penalty shootout. Ideally we don’t want to be going to a penalty shootout but we are delighted for the fans and the whole country. It gives us belief to go into the Sweden game and we will get straight back to business tomorrow</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Pickford laughed off a hand injury sustained on Saturday, declaring himself ‘a man, not a mouse’]</b> It was a daft injury by myself. I went to punch the floor and punched my knee, I hurt my thumb. But I’m a man not a mouse. I’m fine. I’ll live another day - it’s only a thumb.<br /><br />It’s a different type of game. We don’t want to be going into penalty shoot-outs every game. My job is to help the team and make them saves. As long as I’m in the right position, I give myself every chance to save them. So long as you’re set in the right position, you’ll give yourself best opportunity. That’s what we work on - making these saves come a bit easier. It’s about being in the right position at the right time and that’s what we’re focus on. We do 600 saves a week just to make one save on a Saturday and that’s what it’s all<br /><br />It’ll go on my mantelpiece! It’s about keeping performing and getting better and the more you play the better you become<br /><br />We’re young but we’re an experienced young side. We know how to work and play for each other, we know our strengths and we know how to win. Gaffer always said step by step - first thing get out the group stage, tough opponent versus Colombia then another against Sweden, so now whoever it’ll be we’ll plan and recover well before Wednesday</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Pickford has reflected on a highly successful World Cup campaign with England]</b> The reaction was amazing. We did our bit and put smiles on people’s faces. That’s what international football should be about. I want to play for England for as long as I can. There is no better feeling. The gaffer believed in me. But you only get one chance in football. I had to grasp it. I felt ready. We had done our homework. Every penalty I had the same routine and I did it exactly how I wanted to do it. I felt very relaxed and felt like I could make it happen for the country. I would think there is less pressure on the goalkeeper than the taker. But I was quite high up in the queue to take one. I would be confident. I know exactly where I would go… but I’m not telling you!<br /><br /><b>[He reflected on a stop from Mario Mandzukic in the semi-final]</b> I spread myself really well for that Croatia one. I grew up watching Peter Schmeichel videos, so there may have been some of that there. As a Sunderland fan, I loved Tommy Sorensen. I watched football but I was a kid who really preferred being out on the street with my mates playing hide and seek! That’s me - a bit daft! I was out playing football every day on the tarmac, diving to make saves. As a keeper, you need every tool in the box. You can be technically great but it’s all about keeping the ball out the net. You need guts<br /><br />My mental side of the game is really strong. It doesn’t affect me. Anyone can slate me if they want to. I know if I have played well or badly. I always ask my dad and he tells me straight. Other people don’t affect me. It’s just about me becoming better. I still call my old goalkeeper coach, Mark Prudhoe at Sunderland, and he’s very honest with me. On Adnan’s goal, it’s instinct. You have a split second. It’s like boxing. If you go with a left hook, he might come over the top and surprise you with a right hook. My reactions are good. It was such a small margin and if I had saved it, everyone would have been saying: ‘What a worldy save!’. People will criticise me because I am on the top stage. But that’s where I want to be. It was an unbelievable effort by Adnan… it’s just a pity he couldn’t do that when he was at Sunderland!</p>

  <p><b>[Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has vowed not to take the kind of risks Liverpool rival Alisson has paid the price for of late]</b> I try not to <b>[do tricks]</b> because I don’t want to be caught with the ball. It’s a risk - if it comes off it looks good. But if it doesn’t … It’s a style of play and I think that’s the way Liverpool want to play as well, but it’s going to happen. It’s just that the goalkeeper’s mistake is always a crucial one. Mistakes will happen and it’s about not making the next one. I’m going to try not to put myself in that position to make those mistakes. It’s the timing of the game, really. You don’t want to get too comfortable if you’re winning and start trying to be a No. 10. If it’s on to do I’ll do it and if it’s not we’ll manage the game. That’s where I learn more. The more games you play the more game management you learn. It’s all about decision-making, doing it at the right times, and I never put myself in too much risk.<br /><br />You can play out when there are options and the way the gaffer sets us up, with three at the back, there’s always that option. But the gaffer never hides away from getting the ball up because you see H <b>[Harry Kane]</b> and the aerial threat he’s got. The gaffer is open to going long - and it’s not a kick up the pitch any more, it’s a ‘long pass’. Look at Ederson getting the assist a few weeks ago <b>[for Sergio Aguero in Manchester City’s 6-1 win over Huddersfield]</b>. It’s about game management and what works at the right time. You might have had a spell of five minutes where you’ve been under a lot of pressure and you need to calm the game down. The last thing you want to do, if a team’s pressing, is to play out, they win the ball and their crowd’s going up. It’s about getting the right balance</p>

  <p><b>[Everton’s Jordan Pickford has reduced his social media presence]</b> It was a great craic. But I don’t think I’ll be putting some of the tweets about Nando’s and Sky up again any time soon! I still think The Courteeners are good, though. I’m devastated I can’t go when they’re playing next month. It’s at the Echo <b>[Arena]</b> as well. All that’s part of the craic. I wish I could do stuff like that now, but I don’t think it would get taken the same way.<br /><br />I’m just a normal lad from where I grew up. All my roots are where I’m from. You’re grounded and you stay level headed where I’m from. My mam and dad have brought us up well. I’m just a normal lad from Washington. I have got Sky in a couple of rooms now though! I was new to Twitter then, so I didn’t know what the hell I was tweeting. At least everyone’s laughing about it<br /><br />Obviously playing at the World Cup has changed my life. That was my dream, to play at the World Cup, and I knew that if the opportunity came my way, I would take it. I hope that’s what I’ve done. But obviously, it changes your life. There’s a lot of expectation on you to perform week in, week out. That just makes me want to grow, and become better and better, because people put more pressure on you now. If you deal with that pressure, which I’ll do, then you become a better person and a better goalkeeper</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Pickford has signed a new six-year deal at Everton]</b> Getting the opportunity to become England’s No.1 was down to being at Everton, I believe, and being able to put in solid performances week in and week out. When I made the move last year I thought Everton would be a great club to come to and the right step in my career. Coming to Everton, a massive club with a massive history and seeing how passionate and determined the fans are, it’s inspired me to perform week in and week out and it’s moved my career on, without question<br /><br />I want to play as many games as I can for the club, that’s my goal now. Hopefully, I can continue to progress, become a better goalkeeper each and every day and keep that England No. 1 shirt as well. That’s another aim. This is a great club for me and, hopefully, we can get the success for the fans to earn the right to be a legend at Everton one day, each and every one of us<br /><br />I don’t feel any pressure from the World Cup. I just want to become the best goalkeeper I can be. My focus is on the team here and we want to be pushing right up the table as high as we can be. There is a lot of strong competition out there but in the next year or two, if we can get into a final of a cup and perhaps win a trophy, that would be a great step forward. I am still learning but I hope I am giving the team something, too</p>

But now we’ve got a ‘no fans in the stadium’ ban; but I think going away from home you’re up against hostile crowds so hopefully this can give us the upper hand. I think it will feel a bit different, but it’s how you react to it<br /><br />I think we just want to go over there and show the quality we have got and the improvements hopefully we’ve been making. If you win it is a bit of revenge, but the main aim is to get that win and we want to get the momentum going again</p>

I just want to be a normal lad, but you have got to realise in certain situations that you can’t be. You learn from everything, how to become a man and grow.

I thought I was rock solid and I dictated the game from my point of view, I showed my character and my maturity as well<br /><br /><b>[q: What is <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s next step to improve?]</b> It’s definitely got to be into Europe. The talent and the ability we have in the squad, there’s massive depth in there, and I think Europe’s the next step. We had a chance a couple of years ago when we were in there when I first signed, but it was tough<br /><br /><b>[q: What is your thought process on saving a penalty?]</b> When I’m standing on the line I’m just mentally thinking I’m going to save it. I do a lot of research on them and I just make sure I’m going to save that penalty. It’s a lot of luck, but if you do your research you might get that other edge and I always believe that I can save those penalties<br /><br /><b>[q: What position would you be if not a goalkeeper?]</b> I’ve got to say centre-midfield. When I was a kid playing in school I was always playing in central midfield, I love a tackle, I love heading the ball and I try to spray a few diagonals from there as well<br /><br /><b>[q: Which outfield player would you put in goal for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> for one game?]</b> If I had to pick one outfield player at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> to play in goal for one competitive game it’s got to be <a href="seamus-coleman.html">Seamus Coleman</a>. With his Gaelic background, sometimes after training he likes to go in goal as well, he’s definitely got a bit in goal as well!<br /><br /><b>[q: Who is your best mate in the locker room?]</b> For me it’s got to be Mase. When I first came to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, we were in the U21s setup at England and he told me a lot about the club. Going to a club and being new, not knowing many people - Mase was the only lad I knew. We’re very close now still, we always have a good bit of banter between us!</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has backed his team to beat <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in the forthcoming Merseyside derby]</b> We want to win every game we play and any sort of derby match is massive for the fans and for players. We want to show how good we can be and we have an opportunity to beat them. We know they are a good side, they are top of the league. We just want to do our best and try to beat them. We know we have the ability in the squad to beat them. We just want to do it for ourselves and our fans.<br /><br />Obviously it’s been difficult but it’s nice to spend time with your family and get a nice big break. I’ve not had a break from football since I was probably a 16-year-old - I’ve been in the England set up since then - so it’s nice for my mind and body to have a reset. We’re getting ready to go again but it’s been a nice eight or nine weeks off, in the sense of giving your body time to relax.<br /><br />I love constant football matches and I’ve been brought up on playing football every day. From that side of it, it’s easy for me. The biggest challenge will be making sure we get looked after well between the end of this season and going into next season</p>
