  <p><b>[On <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Mario Balotelli</a>]</b> I don’t know if my equal at <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> (Mario Balotelli) has committed theft on a train, drove without headlights in the night, or constantly ran away and withdrew from the U-21 squad. These were the sins of my youth. I recently turned 27 and if I do certain things in Germany that I used to do, I’d get arrested immediately! I’ve always been against taxing diets. Once a Dinamo Zagreb coach saw me while I was eating a pizza and severely scolded me, saying I would get fat. In response, I ordered ten pizzas and managed to eat five!</p>

  <p><b>[Mario Mandzukic has been ruled out of Croatia’s Euro 2016 qualifying fixtures with Bulgaria and Malta due to a hamstring injur]</b> Unfortunately, he has picked up a hamstring injury. Today <b>[Wednesday]</b>, we have reviewed it and conducted an ultrasound and according to the finding he will not be able to play in these two games. I think he needs another two weeks to begin full training, with a high percentage of certainty that there will not be a relapse. Of course, he was not happy with such news, but his health has to come first.</p>

And in that case, even if we lose, no one could blame us.<br /><br />Where do I find strength? I really don’t know. I remember some ‘expert’ ahead of World Cup saying this is not good old Mandzukic… Well, he was right, this is a new, even better Mandzukic! I always give my best for my club and my country</p>

At that point, everyone turned around stunned. I’ve won the Champions League but I’d never dare say something like that. We shouldn’t even have thought about the possibility of defeat.<br /><br />Then Leo grabbed Dani by the throat and, as he was about to punch him, Max (Allegri) divided them and took a decision of a real leader: he said he didn’t care who started it, but at the end of the game they’d both get kicked out.</p>
