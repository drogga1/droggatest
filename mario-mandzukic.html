  <p><b>[Mario Mandzukic on Mario Balotelli]</b> I don’t know if my equal at <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> (Mario Balotelli) has committed theft on a train, drove without headlights in the night, or constantly ran away and withdrew from the U-21 squad. These were the sins of my youth. I recently turned 27 and if I do certain things in Germany that I used to do, I’d get arrested immediately! I’ve always been against taxing diets. Once a Dinamo Zagreb coach saw me while I was eating a pizza and severely scolded me, saying I would get fat. In response, I ordered ten pizzas and managed to eat five!</p>

At that point, everyone turned around stunned. I’ve won the Champions League but I’d never dare say something like that. We shouldn’t even have thought about the possibility of defeat.<br /><br />Then Leo grabbed Dani by the throat and, as he was about to punch him, Max (Allegri) divided them and took a decision of a real leader: he said he didn’t care who started it, but at the end of the game they’d both get kicked out.</p>

Manchester United’s interest in Mario Mandzukic has been cooled following the end of talks between the club and Juventus over a swap deal involving Paulo Dybala and Romelu Lukaku. Mandzukic was being offered by Juve along with Dybala as a makeweight in their bid to usurp Serie A rivals Inter to the signature of Belgium striker Lukaku.</p>

I’m sorry because two important players were left out. However, these difficulties demonstrate the strength of our squad<br /><br /><b>[Asked if he expected the reaction from Can, who was reportedly furious at his omission Sarri]</b> It’s normal that when a player suffers from a strong and impactful choice that there’s an emotional aspect involved. We must give him the opportunity to let out how he is feeling. I’m of the right age to understand these kinds of reactions</p>
