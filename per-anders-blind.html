<blockquote>
  <p>[CONIFA inspiring football’s great unseen] When that organisation collapsed in 2013 I was asked to help create something new, something better. I spent several months writing a new constitution, based on democracy and transparency, which was run and governed by the members rather than the board.<br /><br />We want the board to serve the members, not vice versa. When it comes to voting, members have the highest number of votes - a normal CONIFA member, an IFA, has 10 votes, but as president I have one vote. So, the president and board are always in a minority<br /><br />We are more open, and give ethnicities and indigenous people from around the globe the opportunity to present themselves to the world for the first time. Often, these groups have been bullied or abused by their governments and other regions or peoples, and consequently lack self-esteem. CONIFA allows them to have pride and find strength in their identity<br /><br />For me, lack of knowledge is very dangerous. It creates fear. People on the outside looking at CONIFA often have preconceptions about certain groups or ethnicities - but now we can show them the real thing, that these groups are not scary. In my mind, we have a vision to show everyone that we are one people on this planet, even though we have different traditions<br /><br />We will continue to grow, but we are not chasing members as we were before. We need to take care of the ones we currently have. We don’t have a headquarters, but we’re trying to build up representative offices around the world. It’s important to have a presence on each continent. Even if you’re global, you need to act local</p>

  <p>[The CONIFA 2018 World Football Cup will take place in London] We are thrilled to be taking CONIFA to England - the spiritual home of football. The World Football Cup just gets bigger and bigger. After hosting our inaugural tournament in Sweden in 2014, we reached new heights in Abkhazia last year with an event that received media coverage on every inhabited continent. We are confident 2018 will be our best tournament yet, and London will be the perfect host.</p>

  <p>[2018 CONIFA World Cup] I think my Saudi Arabia experience is going to help [during CONIFA]. I’ve now sampled Asian football which is completely different to European footy and I’ve also had the luxury of refereeing South American football. Getting all the experience from all the continents certainly helps.<br /><br />For me, CONIFA is a big peace mission. Our mission is all about creating a better world but by using football and culture as a tool for that. If you come and watch our games, what you will feel is a different kind of atmosphere. You can’t find it in traditional football</p>

  <p>[CONIFA World Football Cup wrap up] We are still in the early stage of an adventure that will last for many years. CONIFA has grown from zero to representing 334 million people in five continents with four years; work done solely by heroes from all over the world who have contributed their volunteer skills and their spare time.<br /><br />Football is a tool for a higher purpose</p>
