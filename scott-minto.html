  <p><b>[N’Golo Kane can become like a Michael Essien for Chelsea]</b> I’m a little bit against the grain <b>[on Kante]</b>. I understand what Sarri is trying to do and what he did at Napoli with Jorginho playing as that playmaker. Kante for me is the best defensive midfielder in the world in that destructive role, stopping teams counter-attacking, trying to win the ball back and protecting the back four. No-one can deny that Kante is, if not one of the best, the very best at it. But that’s not what Sarri is trying to do in terms of his team. I actually think Kante, if you look at how he played when he played for Leicester, he wasn’t just a defensive midfielder. He went everywhere. If you look at the heat maps, he was that cover-every-blade-of-grass kind of player. He wasn’t sitting in front of the back four and protecting them. That’s what he did when he went to Chelsea. I do think he’s got more to his game. I don’t think we’ve seen the best of him in this role but I do think he can become like a Michael Essien, who can be fantastic in that role but also going forward, using his energy as a box-to-box midfielder.<br /><br />I think in the back three when Chelsea won the title, he was the central of those three. I’ve always said Luiz is probably the best ball-playing centre-half in world football but I wouldn’t even put him in the top 20 for defending centre-halves and that’s basically what you want a centre-half to do. I thought he should have taken David Luiz off, seeing what type of form he was in. It’s going to be very interesting to see whether David Luiz can play in a four. He needs to make that decision quickly and David Luiz needs a rocket up his backside because if he carries on playing like that… he cannot play like that. After 10 or 15 minutes, there should have been a switch - either move Kante in front of the back four or take David Luiz off because he was a liability. There are definitely question marks over Luiz in a back four. Can he defend? The jury is still very much out</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham and England midfielder Declan Rice is wanted by Real Madrid]</b> I’m hearing that even Real Madrid are knocking on the door and speaking to his family. That’s what I’m hearing<br /><br /><b>[When pressed on his where he had heard this information]</b> I’m not going to say. But it’s a reliable source<br /><br />West Ham I’m sure know about the potential he has. Man United will be knocking on the door. The big boys of the Premier League and world football will be saying this is a young lad at a club that could sell for the right price. He could become one of the stars in that particular position</p>
