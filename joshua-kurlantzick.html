<blockquote>
  <p>In the run-up to Thailand’s elections, to be held on 2019 03 24, there was an initial burst of media attention around the possibility that Princess Ubolratana, the older sister of Thailand’s <a href="king-rama-x.html">King Rama X</a>, briefly put her name forward as a candidate for the pro-Thaksin Shinawatra Thai Raksa Chart Party. She would have been Thai Raksa Chart’s prime minister candidate, but her brother, the king, essentially quashed her candidacy<br /><br />Future Forward expects to be especially strong in thai urban areas, and one poll showed it actually had the most support of any party running in the thai election 2019<br /><br />Bans on anti-military parties and party leaders, often on charges so minute it seems hard to believe they could bring down a political career, are tried and true strategies for the Thai military and its allies in Thai politics<br /><br />Future Forward is facing dissolution allegedly over comments about the Thai monarchy, and Thai prosecutors could bring a criminal case against Future Forward leader <a href="thanatorn-juangroongruangkit.html">Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit</a>, a dynamic young politician, allegedly for offering criticism of the military in a speech in 2018. If prosecutors charge Thanathorn after the election, and proceed with a case, they could strip Future Forward of its key actor; in announcing the possible charges before the election, the Thai judiciary - usually now aligned with the armed forces - is also signaling to potential Future Forward voters that their party may be dismantled or crippled, just a few days after elections<br /><br />The junta now appears to be pursuing criminal charges against Future Forward’s deputy leader, utilizing what is essentially Thailand’s anti-‘fake news’ law for sharing an article that was incorrect but that he quickly deleted. He could be slapped with five years in jail. The junta also appears to be pursuing charges against another person running for prime minister in the election, claiming that he defamed the army chief<br /><br />Even if the anti-junta coalition wins control of the lower house on 2019 03 24, the army, likely with support of the palace, will probably use these looming charges, against people like <a href="thanatorn-juangroongruangkit.html">Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit</a> and possibly other leaders of the anti-junta coalition, to bar them from politics for long periods of time and possibly put them in jail as well. Thanathorn’s alleged offense, for instance, carries a twenty year ban from politics if he is found guilty. In so doing, the military would quickly defang an anti-junta coalition that won control of the lower house of parliament, rendering it unable to function: unable to deliver on promises like cutting military spending, creating more effective oversight of the armed forces, boosting social welfare spending, and bringing <a href="thaksin-shinawatra.html">Thaksin Shinawawtra</a> and Yingluck Shinawawtra back to Thailand, albeit to face new trials<br /><br />An anti-junta coalition losing key players, fighting constant threats of bans or other actions from the thai judiciary, and likely with a slim majority even if it wins control of the lower house: the scenario would be ripe for a repeat of the late 2000s, when the military allegedly maneuvered behind the scenes to bring down a pro-Thaksin government, and reportedly strong-armed thai politicians into forming a new coalition, in the lower house, led by parties far more amenable to the Royal Thai Army</p>
