  <p><b>[Paulo Dybala has admitted that he would like to be reunited with good friend Paul Pogba]</b> It was great to see to see Paul again because we’re good friends. The first game <b>[at Old Trafford]</b> was amazing for me, and the second for him. But it was just nice to play against him. We have remained in touch since he left <b>[Juventus]</b>. We’re still very close and who knows, maybe in the future we can play together again on the same team….<br /><br />We have a good chance this year because Cristiano is a great player and now we have more options. But we have been playing well for years. We have lost two finals in the past four years and last year we played a great game against Real and were unlucky to lose. So yes, I think that we can do it this year. But the goal every year is to win every title. Obviously this year it may look like the Champions League is an obsession but we’re also focused on domestic trophies. We want to win another Scudetto<br /><br /><b>[On Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> We’re happy working together and have scored a lot of goals. We already knew how he plays and we have to adapt a little bit and work to improve our partnership. But we’re doing well. I think we’re going to score a lot more goals together!<br /><br />I’m hoping that Higuain will play because we’re good friends. He’s had a little injury but I know he’s recovering well, so I hope to see him out on the pitch<br /><br />I’m looking forward to seeing Rino again too, although I’m happy that he won’t be on the pitch to kick me!<br /><br />Wednesday was my first game with the Copa 19+ boots and it was an amazing sensation. I was very comfortable with the ball and I thought I played well. The touch and feel of the boot was incredible, so it was a great experience. I’m really happy with the boots and I can’t wait to wear them again on Sunday</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus forward Paulo Dybala insists he didn’t insult Jose Mourinho]</b> I just told him that there was no need to make that gesture. There was no need to create more tension than there already was, sometimes you get insulted and it’s bad, but to create more tension than there already is … I told him there was no need, I didn’t insult him. I just told him that and left.<br /><br />The boss has given us a little more freedom to move around and I think that way we can do more damage to our opponents. Cristiano Ronaldo is a player who moves to the left more, but he moves around a lot and in fact the goal I scored in Manchester came from his cross from the right. When Mario <b>[Mandzukic]</b> plays he’s more of a reference point, and then there’s also Douglas and <b>[Federico]</b> Bernardeschi, so we have a lot of options in attack. I think the coach definitely finds it difficult to put all of us in, because we’re playing really well and there’s a really good level in attack. I don’t think it’s easy for him</p>

I think we have been doing well. We have scored really important goals for Juventus together. Cristiano arrived only recently, but we all know the importance that he has on everyone and we knew his style from before. We know how he plays and how he works. Of course, you have to make small changes, but we are happy and we are going to score a lot of goals together</p>

  <p><b>[The mere presence of Cristiano Ronaldo in their squad gives Juventus a great chance to win the Champions League]</b> At Juventus, it’s always the same objective - to win titles. It’s true that this year, from the outside, the Champions League looks more like an obsession. But the focus is, as always, on the domestic title as well. We will have a great chance to win the Champions League this year. Ronaldo provides us with another option and is a very good player and this year we have been playing really well. Last year we played against Madrid… and we almost won! In four years we have played in two finals. I believe in previous years we have proven that we are capable to win, but we have had a bit of bad luck, especially what happened last year against Madrid. We haven’t had the luck of winning the competition, but hopefully we do this season.</p>

  <p><b>[Dybala mask creator Zhijun Wang on designing <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> Asia Trophy badge]</b> When I was a child I loved football. In the 1990s, I started to watch <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> when they started broadcasting in China. I was born in Beijing and I lived in Beijing all my life. I think in my city a lot of people loved football but we only had one or two teams at that time. All the families, all the children, we gathered to watch the game. I could not afford a jersey, I just watched the games and collected some magazines and cards from the markets<br /><br /><b>[Zhijun saw some of the league’s best talents - including <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>, <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> and Kevin De Bruyne - wearing shirts with his artwork proudly stitched on]</b> I could not imagine I would work on a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> project when I grew up. That’s a dream to a designer and also to a super football fan. As a fan of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> I think the logo is classic, it cannot be changed. But this is also a challenge to a designer. Because I got the project, I got the mission, I needed to create something based on the classic logo. I knew <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> before. I had memories. I needed to break the rules in my mind. It’s a challenge. I had to balance the emotion in myself. If I failed to create a logo for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> Asia Trophy, it’s a shame to my childhood memories. It’s my honour to succeed in this project<br /><br /><b>[Zhijun’s story began with practical face masks made out of the uppers of trainers]</b> It’s my reaction to the environment. Because I live in Beijing I know the environment surrounding me. I was running for years, especially at night. After I finished running, I walked slowly under the streetlights. I noticed some smog or haze up there. It would be harmful to my lungs. I tried to find a solution to protect myself at that time. Maybe I needed a mask for myself. But at that time, because I am a designer, I wanted to make something different to other people. I wanted to find a special material. I noticed my sneaker collection. Maybe I could use running shoes. I use the upper instead of the normal material for masks, the white masks.<br /><br />Different people have different perspectives. For me I just wanted to protect myself. This is the beginning of the idea. I didn’t think too much about protest or any other sensitive issues. I just focused on the environment that surrounded my life. I just want to warn people to be careful of your behaviour. Every single person, we can change our behaviour. Everyone can stop the environment changing. It’s a warning to the young generation who love sneakers as well. It’s an art piece but it can warn the people<br /><br /><b>[NBA superstar James Harden wore one warming up for the All-Star game in 2017 while One Direction singer Liam Payne has his very own New Balance - Hypebeast mask collaboration.

He wants to be a superhero to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> fans, to prove his emotion and his ability. We talked about the idea, I showed him the mask and all the processes and he got the idea very quick<br /><br /><b>[Working with iconic American brands and the biggest, most recognisable football league, Zhijun bridges the divide between Chinese and western culture]</b> I want to explain our native culture to people all over the world. It’s not easy to explain to people from different countries. Art is the best way. People love art more than text or some boring translations. They will touch the idea by themselves. We have some other ways to cross the divide. It’s not a problem to the young generation, we can do some changes ourselves. We don’t make big protests, we just change ourselves</p>

  <p><b>[At the end of a long conversation comes the inevitable question, if only for a laugh. Which, by the way, it gets. So, about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> again]</b> I’m the only player who shares a dressing room with both and people only see the tip of the iceberg, not the work beneath; they haven’t won all they’ve won because they’ve been lucky. And, yeah, I know people have to ask but they must know what I’m going to say<br /><br /><b>[Go on then, who’s better? Dybala makes a play of looking out of the window at the Alps]</b> I can’t answer that<br /><br />A lot of the time, you have difficult moments and you have to go out there and fight anyway: not just in football, in life. Bad things happen, to me or anyone, difficult times in life, but you have to keep going: put the mask on like gladiators do, and fight. Every battle. That was the idea I tried to transmit. People liked it, understood it. And that’s pleasing because the messages you send aren’t always interpreted the way you’d like<br /><br />I’d like to go, although there’s no family left. It’s a tiny place, eight or nine houses. Some Polish journalists put me in touch with my grandfather’s daughter but she passed away. There are cousins in Canada and we’ve spoken but not met. I want to. I tried to get a Polish passport but we couldn’t find some of my grandfather’s documents and we got Italian passports from my mother’s side instead. One day, I will. I feel maybe more Polish than Italian. Personality-wise, my dad was more Polish; my middle brother, exactly the same. All of us, a bit. Maybe a bit colder, Polish blood. Italians tend to be more emotional<br /><br /><b>[Dybala’s grandfather died when Paulo was four. His father, Adolfo, died when Paulo was 15. A football fan, Adolfo drove his son to Córdoba every day, a 70-mile round trip, to train with the second division side Instituto until, at 14, Dybala went permanently, living in the home of Faustino and Orlando and their grandchildren. But when Adolfo developed a tumour, Paulo asked to return to Laguna Larga]</b> I was young and it was very hard. My mother suffered a lot, my brothers too. You see the pain but you continue. I’m not the first to go through that and won’t be the last. Sadly, that’s the circle of life. Now we have someone helping us from above. I thought: ‘I’ll ditch <b>[football]</b>.

I would have kept playing in my town but I wasn’t going to chase that dream any more.<br /><br />My refuge was my family. When Instituto called, I didn’t feel like going. I was 15, I couldn’t hide how hard it was: football was no refuge. I went back because it was my passion and my family pushed me. If not, my mindset was to leave it.<br /><br /><b>[My refuge was my family. When Instituto called, I didn’t feel like going. I was 15, I couldn’t hide how hard it was: football was no refuge.

  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and Dybala confident of agreement over €12m-a-year contract renewal]</b> Renewal? For now there is nothing. I have a year-and-a-half left on my contract, it is not so much, and I understand that since what happened with the coronavirus it is not easy for the club, but other players have renewed. Let’s wait, it depends on Juventus<br /><br />I am happy to be here, people love me very much and I love people very much. I have a great appreciation for the club and the people who are here, I have a good relationship with my president and we will certainly talk at some point</p>
