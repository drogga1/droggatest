  <p><b>[Dybala mask creator Zhijun Wang on designing Premier League Asia Trophy badge]</b> When I was a child I loved football. In the 1990s, I started to watch the Premier League when they started broadcasting in China. I was born in Beijing and I lived in Beijing all my life. I think in my city a lot of people loved football but we only had one or two teams at that time. All the families, all the children, we gathered to watch the game. I could not afford a jersey, I just watched the games and collected some magazines and cards from the markets<br /><br /><b>[Zhijun saw some of the league’s best talents - including Raheem Sterling, David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne - wearing shirts with his artwork proudly stitched on]</b> I could not imagine I would work on a Premier League project when I grew up. That’s a dream to a designer and also to a super football fan. As a fan of the Premier League I think the logo is classic, it cannot be changed. But this is also a challenge to a designer. Because I got the project, I got the mission, I needed to create something based on the classic logo. I knew the Premier League before. I had memories. I needed to break the rules in my mind. It’s a challenge. I had to balance the emotion in myself. If I failed to create a logo for the Premier League Asia Trophy, it’s a shame to my childhood memories. It’s my honour to succeed in this project<br /><br /><b>[Zhijun’s story began with practical face masks made out of the uppers of trainers]</b> It’s my reaction to the environment. Because I live in Beijing I know the environment surrounding me. I was running for years, especially at night. After I finished running, I walked slowly under the streetlights. I noticed some smog or haze up there. It would be harmful to my lungs. I tried to find a solution to protect myself at that time. Maybe I needed a mask for myself. But at that time, because I am a designer, I wanted to make something different to other people. I wanted to find a special material. I noticed my sneaker collection. Maybe I could use running shoes. I use the upper instead of the normal material for masks, the white masks.<br /><br />Different people have different perspectives. For me I just wanted to protect myself. This is the beginning of the idea. I didn’t think too much about protest or any other sensitive issues. I just focused on the environment that surrounded my life. I just want to warn people to be careful of your behaviour. Every single person, we can change our behaviour. Everyone can stop the environment changing. It’s a warning to the young generation who love sneakers as well. It’s an art piece but it can warn the people<br /><br /><b>[NBA superstar James Harden wore one warming up for the All-Star game in 2017 while One Direction singer Liam Payne has his very own New Balance - Hypebeast mask collaboration. But it was Paulo Dybala who put Zhijun’s work into the football realm]</b> They asked me whether I could create a gladiator mask. He wants to be a superhero to Juventus fans, to prove his emotion and his ability. We talked about the idea, I showed him the mask and all the processes and he got the idea very quick<br /><br /><b>[Working with iconic American brands and the biggest, most recognisable football league, Zhijun bridges the divide between Chinese and western culture]</b> I want to explain our native culture to people all over the world. It’s not easy to explain to people from different countries. Art is the best way. People love art more than text or some boring translations. They will touch the idea by themselves. We have some other ways to cross the divide. It’s not a problem to the young generation, we can do some changes ourselves. We don’t make big protests, we just change ourselves</p>

  <p><b>[Dybala has claimed that he always wanted to stay and fight for his place at Juve]</b> I have not experienced an easy summer. Obviously hearing your name linked with every team you don’t want to go to is not a nice thing, but this is football. Before the market started I had already done an interview in which I said I wanted to stay in Turin, then I never spoke again, not even at the Copa America. I think it’s more important to talk on the field, with facts. You never know how the market goes until the last day, but I wanted to stay here, I wanted to continue my career at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>.

I heard Luis Scola <b>[Argentinian basketball player]</b> said both Leo and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> enter the field convinced that they are the best and that is why they are the best. And I am sure that is so. My friends used to tell me: ‘You have the best in the national team and now they bring you the best one at your club’. I replied: ‘It is an advantage for me.’<br /><br />I can study them every day. Who doesn’t want to play with the best? We are talking about two phenomenal players; two players who are one or two steps above the rest. They are at the top on a football level and also at a mental level. It is not easy to keep going and score 40 goals every year. It is crazy. In the history of football, great players have played at great teams and have not achieved what they did.

  <p><b>[At the end of a long conversation comes the inevitable question, if only for a laugh. Which, by the way, it gets. So, about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> again]</b> I’m the only player who shares a dressing room with both and people only see the tip of the iceberg, not the work beneath; they haven’t won all they’ve won because they’ve been lucky. And, yeah, I know people have to ask but they must know what I’m going to say<br /><br /><b>[Go on then, who’s better? Dybala makes a play of looking out of the window at the Alps]</b> I can’t answer that<br /><br />A lot of the time, you have difficult moments and you have to go out there and fight anyway: not just in football, in life. Bad things happen, to me or anyone, difficult times in life, but you have to keep going: put the mask on like gladiators do, and fight. Every battle. That was the idea I tried to transmit. People liked it, understood it. And that’s pleasing because the messages you send aren’t always interpreted the way you’d like<br /><br />I’d like to go, although there’s no family left. It’s a tiny place, eight or nine houses. Some Polish journalists put me in touch with my grandfather’s daughter but she passed away. There are cousins in Canada and we’ve spoken but not met. I want to. I tried to get a Polish passport but we couldn’t find some of my grandfather’s documents and we got Italian passports from my mother’s side instead. One day, I will. I feel maybe more Polish than Italian. Personality-wise, my dad was more Polish; my middle brother, exactly the same. All of us, a bit. Maybe a bit colder, Polish blood. Italians tend to be more emotional<br /><br /><b>[Dybala’s grandfather died when Paulo was four. His father, Adolfo, died when Paulo was 15. A football fan, Adolfo drove his son to Córdoba every day, a 70-mile round trip, to train with the second division side Instituto until, at 14, Dybala went permanently, living in the home of Faustino and Orlando and their grandchildren. But when Adolfo developed a tumour, Paulo asked to return to Laguna Larga]</b> I was young and it was very hard. My mother suffered a lot, my brothers too. You see the pain but you continue. I’m not the first to go through that and won’t be the last. Sadly, that’s the circle of life. Now we have someone helping us from above. I thought: ‘I’ll ditch <b>[football]</b>. Ditch it’ in the sense of <b>[not]</b> leaving my family to play in Córdoba. I didn’t want to. I would have kept playing in my town but I wasn’t going to chase that dream any more.<br /><br />My refuge was my family. When Instituto called, I didn’t feel like going. I was 15, I couldn’t hide how hard it was: football was no refuge. I went back because it was my passion and my family pushed me. If not, my mindset was to leave it.<br /><br /><b>[My refuge was my family. When Instituto called, I didn’t feel like going. I was 15, I couldn’t hide how hard it was: football was no refuge.

Football has become a huge business. We’re on the inside but a lot of the time you can’t do anything. I was very young<br /><br />But I was very happy. From the second division to <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> was an enormous change but I was convinced. My family came and the adventure began in Palermo. The first year didn’t go well.

After about five minutes I felt really tired and my body felt heavy, my muscles hurt and I had to stop. But luckily both me and my girlfriend feel much better now</p>

I didn’t have many minutes at the World Cup or the Copa America but, at the same time, I always respected the decisions of the coaches because Argentina is very prestigious</p>

I need to put my boots on and run, score a goal… As I always say, when you are passionate you make everything twice as important. It’s been too long without training. We don’t know exactly when we’ll be back. It’s not like a holiday, when you know you’ll be resting for a certain amount of time.
