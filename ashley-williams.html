  <p><b>[Once more for Speedo: Wales can honour their tragic fallen hero by beating Russia]</b> Given the amount of work the boys put in, we shouldn’t be too hard on ourselves. This is football, and sometimes these things happen. We’ve done ever so well to get here, we’ve done well in the tournament so far and we’re a tight group, so we’ll stick together, be proud of what we’ve achieved so far and move on really<br /><br />Speedy’s always in my thoughts, but not because of football. I knew Gary since he was 10. It’s not just because I’m at a tournament that he’s in my thoughts, he’s in my thoughts constantly as a friend. I don’t need a game of football to remind me of <a href="gary-speed.html">Gary Speed</a>. He’s always there</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Williams hopes Wales’ Euro 2016 exploits would be a source of pride to Gary Speed]</b> I was thinking about him on the plane coming over. I hope he’d be proud of us. He saw us grow up, and you see what we’ve achieved today. He’s always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him.<br /><br /><b>[Williams is likely to find himself head-to-head with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> superstar <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> at various points in a keenly anticipated match, but the 31-year-old also paid tribute to Portugal’s collective threat]</b> He’s one of the greatest players in the world, but they have other weapons in their team. We are not obsessing over that. We’ll try and nullify them as a team, as we have all tournament</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Williams wants <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Ronald Koeman</a> to stay at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> as he urged the Dutch manager to ignore speculation linking him with <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> giants Barcelona]</b> For me personally and the lads, we obviously hope he stays. He’s started building a team here and we’re all confident the future looks good for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> so from our point of view we’d obviously want him to stay. But he might have his own ambitions. I can’t speak for what he wants from his managerial career but just from our point of view, definitely we enjoy working with him. You can see form the way we’ve been playing of late that it’s working<br /><br />I think we’re building a team, the gaffer is building a team to what he wants. They’re <b>[Tottenham]</b> a bit more settled than us, they play the same 11 most games and they know each other very well so that’s where we’re trying to get to. We saw it as a good test to see where we are as a team because they’re clearly one of the best teams in the league. The gaffer is trying to build a team he wants and we’ve done well in the last couple of months. It’s about kicking on now and trying to take that into next season.</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Williams is shown a yellow card after pushing Anthony Lopes and causing a mass brawl]</b> It’s what happens, it’s football. It is what it is. It’s high emotions. We want to win the game, they want to win the game and stuff happens. That was just one of those times</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Williams undergoes surgery after suffering collapsed lung against Mexico]</b> Crazy couple weeks.. great to be back in a FA Wales shirt &amp; with the lads, however after coming off after 20 mins with multiple breaks on two ribs, I went hospital &amp; found out I had punctured my left lung which led to it collapsing. I would like to say a huge thank you to all the staff at Ronald Reagan UCLA hospital in Beverley Hills for looking after me and making sure surgery went as comfortable as possible. Look forward to flying home &amp; resting up now before the new season!</p>
