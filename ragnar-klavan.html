  <p>[Former Liverpool defender Ragnar Klavan has revealed that the counsel of Mohamed Salah and Alisson was vital in his decision to swap Anfield for Cagliari] I had offers from several teams, including in other countries, but Cagliari really wanted me. Darijo Srna advised me to come here, as I talked to him via Dejan Lovren. Other Liverpool teammates like Alisson, Salah and Lucas Leiva all spoke highly of Serie A. I’m certain we’ll do great things here and I am really fired up. The city is wonderful and so are the fans, I can’t wait to get started.</p>

  <p>[Former Liverpool defender Ragnar Klavan has revealed that he never wanted to leave Anfield] I honestly did not intend to leave Liverpool. I had received several offers from other European clubs, but it was not my intention to change clubs. But then Cagliari’s offer came and I had little doubt. I could measure myself in an important league like Serie A, which is a bit like the university of tactics<br /><br />I spoke with Lucas Leiva and Mo Salah about this opportunity, my former team-mates at Liverpool, and they both described the championship as very interesting and competitive. In addition, here you live very well, the Italian lifestyle is fantastic and you eat very well! Injury aside I must say that these first few months have been wonderful<br /><br />[Stopping Cristiano Ronaldo and Juventus will be a difficult task] It would be wrong to focus all the attention on Ronaldo, because Juventus has so many champions that it is a risk to stop just him. But I think we can stop Ronaldo and whoever will play in attack with him, but only if we manage to play as a team</p>
