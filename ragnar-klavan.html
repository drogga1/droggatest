  <p>[Ragnar Klavan says that Liverpool’s performance against Arsenal was exactly the kind of response they needed after losing to Leicester City] It was really important for the team to come back straight away and to play [well] here at Anfield in front of all those fans. [There were] a lot of emotions today in the game, [it was] a great game from our side. Of course, we’re a little bit disappointed that they scored and we didn’t have the clean sheet, but, all in all, 3-1 against Arsenal is a good reaction. We were spot-on, everybody was focused, and this is how it [was] especially first half. Second half, we [had] maybe not the best start, that’s why we let them back into the game and they scored [for] 2-1. But after that, we defended well, we were compact and in the end Gini [Wijnaldum] scored the third goal and that was it.</p>

  <p>[Former Liverpool defender Ragnar Klavan has revealed that the counsel of Mohamed Salah and Alisson was vital in his decision to swap Anfield for Cagliari] I had offers from several teams, including in other countries, but Cagliari really wanted me. Darijo Srna advised me to come here, as I talked to him via Dejan Lovren. Other Liverpool teammates like Alisson, Salah and Lucas Leiva all spoke highly of Serie A. I’m certain we’ll do great things here and I am really fired up. The city is wonderful and so are the fans, I can’t wait to get started.</p>

  <p>[Former Liverpool defender Ragnar Klavan has revealed that he never wanted to leave Anfield] I honestly did not intend to leave Liverpool. I had received several offers from other European clubs, but it was not my intention to change clubs. But then Cagliari’s offer came and I had little doubt. I could measure myself in an important league like Serie A, which is a bit like the university of tactics<br /><br />I spoke with Lucas Leiva and Mo Salah about this opportunity, my former team-mates at Liverpool, and they both described the championship as very interesting and competitive. In addition, here you live very well, the Italian lifestyle is fantastic and you eat very well! Injury aside I must say that these first few months have been wonderful<br /><br />[Stopping Cristiano Ronaldo and Juventus will be a difficult task] It would be wrong to focus all the attention on Ronaldo, because Juventus has so many champions that it is a risk to stop just him. But I think we can stop Ronaldo and whoever will play in attack with him, but only if we manage to play as a team</p>
