  <p><b>[Emmanuel Amuneke tells he believes Egypt and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> winger <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> can be The Best]</b> Why not? Already, he is being compared to <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>. And I believe that those that are comparing him have gone through to check statistically. The last person that won it was George Weah and if someone else from Africa can win it, then it’s a blessing and it shows that our <b>[African]</b> players are really growing</p>

  <p><b>[Emmanuel Amuneke writes about his decision to take charge of the Tanzania national team]</b> As a coach you always want to take on new challenges and keep improving. Honoured to be given this opportunity to develop Tanzania football</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Emmanuel Amuneke explains role change at Egypt’s El-Makkasa]</b> I’m still with the team, there is no sack involved as reported because Makkasa is a massive group and the past year has seen them trying to create projects across the continent<br /><br />When I was still working in Tanzania, they came to the country to discuss with the government about investing in the east African country. They plan to invest in Tanzania, Mali and possibly in Nigeria in the future.<br /><br />We’ve been discussing about the academies, we are still looking at the contractual options because this is a long-term project and I wouldn’t want it to affect any other coaching opportunities<br /><br />The decision to bring in a new coach is only logical because accepting to work on this big project means it will be difficult for me to combine both roles. We’ll see how things pan out but I am still here working with Makkhasa</p>
