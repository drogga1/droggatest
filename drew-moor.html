  <p><b>[Toronto FC embraces second chance after nightmare start]</b> I think that we played into their hands a little bit. Our response was unbelievable. <b>[It was]</b> obviously not a good start to the game, but we set ourselves up extremely well for the return leg.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC’s depth shines in Eastern Conference final]</b> I think we showed all season how deep we are. We’ve had a couple of teenagers out on the field a couple of times this year. We battled some injuries, and some international absences. You have to be deep to get this deep into the playoffs. We’re going to have to do it again here in 10 days but, to get goals from guys that don’t always score was a huge boost and they were monsters tonight</p>

  <p><b>[For the past 13 years, Chad Marshall and Drew Moor have shared a steady bond]</b> He’s somebody that I’ve looked up to. We’re about the same age, but he’s been in the league a little bit longer than me. He’s a big, strong guy, and he’s somebody that I hope people compare me to because he does everything right.<br /><br />Certainly I saw Toronto as a team that would compete for championships in the relatively near future. would have been in this first season<br /><br /><b>[On Chad Marshall]</b> It’ll be fun to see him before the game and say hello. And then whoever wins, I know the other one will be ready to give him a big hug and congratulate him.</p>

  <p><b>[On Will Johnson]</b> He’s one of those guys you absolutely hate to play against, you can’t stand playing against, but that’s why you love him so much when he’s your teammate. He’s battle tested, he’s a grinder, and those are the kind of guys you need in the locker room.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC aims to go one step further in 2017]</b> I think there’s a lot of confidence within the group. This has been a work in progress for over a year now, so any time you have the same group of guys with the same mentality and kind of the same way of going about things … the more confident you become.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto, Sporting KC take different lessons from scoreless draw]</b> We’re a very difficult team to break down. We have a group of guys that defend very well and are difficult to break down. Other than that there are times when we enjoy going forward but for some reason tonight we didn’t have that timely pass, that final ball just wasn’t there.</p>

  <p><b>[Toronto FC defender Drew Moor will miss at least one game after being diagnosed with a heart condition]</b> As precaution, Moor will not travel to Columbus for this weekend’s match against Columbus Crew SC</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Higuain]</b> Not a lot of people talk about him as one of the league’s better forwards, but the few times we’ve played against him I’ve been impressed with him. That said, I still think a lot of the Crew’s success goes through Higuain. he’s somebody that we’ve got to keep an eye on, and not give him too much space.<br /><br />With Berhalter and Vanney you’re going to have two teams that are very smart, that have a method of how we want to play, how we want to line up, how we see the game going, but can also adapt at times if needed. Not just physically, but tactically as well. Whether it be formations, whether it be field position. Whatever it is, I feel these two coaches watch video any time they’re at the training ground. It’s unbelievable the amount of work I can tell these two coaches put into studying the game.<br /><br />It should be a lot of fun because these two teams I feel like will really play good football and try to play the right way. It should be a fun matchup for neutrals, and as a fan of this league I’m excited for it</p>

  <p><b>[On Alex Bono]</b> He’s confident, but he’s not overconfident. He’s not cocky. He’s a very good shot-stopper. He talks a lot, his communication is great. He’s a lot better with his feet than he’s been given credit for up to this point of his career. He’s just a confident young goalkeeper.</p>

  <p><b>[MLS Cup win would make Toronto FC the best team in league history]</b> It’s been an amazing season so far, and to cap it off with MLS Cup would mean the world to us. The Supporters’ Shield is great - it’s not what teams ultimately want to win. The Canadian Championship is great, a U.S. Open Cup is great - we play in this league to win MLS Cup.<br /><br />We would love to be the first team to win a treble, and we’ve put ourselves in pretty good position, but we’re not thinking about what we did previously this year. We know we’re coming off a very good regular season and have found a way in the playoffs to get ourselves back to MLS Cup</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Can TFC-Sounders be the Lakers-Celtics rivalry of MLS?]</b> There will be a lot of eyes on it - there always is. MLS Cup is very important to this league, and to have two big-time teams in it should be great. I hope it’s not a 0-0 penalty kicks game - I would love to see some goals for both sides. I’m a fan of this league, and obviously I want to win the game ultimately, but to have two model franchises that seem to just do absolutely everything right, I think it’s great for the league.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[MLS Cup crown caps Toronto FC’s transformation from joke to juggernaut]</b> I’ve been in this league since TFC’s been around, and it’s an organization that seems like it’s always tried to do the right things. They had a bit of learning curve.</p>
