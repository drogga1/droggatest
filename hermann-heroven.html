<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Schalke’s academy director, Hermann Heroven, on <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a>’s family]</b> They are a family of real sporting prowess. The dad was a powerful and speedy footballer. His mother was a gymnast, refined and delicate. When you bring those two together, it is clear the genetics can produce something rather special. Leroy is clearly magical. He would score 50 or 60 goals a season here. He was extremely good. But he is a fighter, too. The whole family are.<br /><br />When the father Souleymane played here, he suffered the most terrible racist abuse. If we played away at Hamburg or Frankfurt, there would be bananas thrown on to the pitch, monkey gestures and the ‘ooh-ooh-aah-aahs’ directed at him. Souleymane never confronted the fans and was extraordinarily tolerant. He did his talking on the pitch. The Federation at the time did very little, immigration was a new thing. It would never be allowed to happen these days and, thankfully, the boys have never had a problem</p>
