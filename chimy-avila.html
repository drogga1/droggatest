  <p><b>[Osasuna ace Chimy Avila claims that he has not been thinking about the rumours linking him with the likes of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> or Sevilla]</b> I was only thinking about achieving survival with Osasuna. I didn’t think about those things. Maybe when I’m back my agent he will tell me things<br /><br />Everyone would like to play with him because he’s the best in the world. But it’s not a dream, as such. All of this has to be overcome first, but it could happen with the national team as well <b>[as at Barcelona]</b><br /><br />It had to come sometime given the intensity that I always play with. I play every game as if it’s my last. I’ve been hit with this injury and now I have to keep a cool head. <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a> wrote to me, <a href="sergio-ramos.html">Sergio Ramos</a> called me to offer help in the recovery… players that I used to watch as a child on TV. That has given me even more strength. God gave me an opportunity to be here and I cannot blame him for my injury. It’s a sad situation but there are people who are missing an arm or a leg. Sometimes when I’m tired of going to rehab I think of people who have to go to cancer therapy and realise that mine is a crumb compared to the bread others have had to eat. So every day I get up with more strength and desire to come through this</p>

  <p><b>[Chimy Avila says <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is the only person you can’t compare]</b> Any player would like to play with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, or have a coach like <b>[Atletico Madrid boss]</b> <a href="diego-simeone.html">Cholo Simeone</a>. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is the only person you can’t compare. I always say <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> because <b>[Diego]</b> <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> I only saw on video and I’ve played against Messi<br /><br />After a while I finished the exercises, trying to get through the days and I’m happy with the progress of the injury. I’m very happy at Osasuna, I hope to recover and play. One hopes to do things in the best way possible to return the love and affection the fans have shown me. The first thing is to get my knee back. I have a three-year contract. Who would not like to play in Atletico, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, ​​Real Madrid or Seville, but today I am an Osasuna player. Everything has its process, you have to comply with the club that pays you, no one has their fate marked out</p>
