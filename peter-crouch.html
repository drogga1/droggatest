  <p><b>[Peter Crouch admitted his relief to score his 100th Premier League goal]</b> I’m really pleased obviously. I’m glad it came quite early. I was on 99 for not that long. It was nice to get it out of the way. It’s a proud moment. You look along that list and there’s top players among it. I’m very proud and privileged to be among them.<br /><br />I was under a lot of pressure to pull that out. I don’t think the fans have seen it in club football. It was a bit rusty, but it was a nice feeling to score and bring it back for nostalgia purposes</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch says there was never any strong interest shown in him by Chelsea before attention switched to Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud]</b> So there I was, sat at home a couple of weeks ago, when my phone started to beep and I heard I was trending on Twitter. I didn’t expect to see my name linked with Chelsea but that was the situation. It was all speculation, I suppose. Of course it was nice to get linked with a club of that stature - particularly as they were the club I used to watch when I was a kid - but I didn’t think much more about it. There was never any strong interest. I heard Antonio Conte quite likes me as a player but I was only ever concentrating on Stoke. I didn’t expect anything to happen and, as it turns out, Chelsea have gone on to make a great signing.<br /><br />I’ve always admired Olivier Giroud. He is France’s No. 9, he’s been to the World Cup and the Euros and worn that shirt with distinction. He’s a top striker and maybe he didn’t get as many chances as he deserved at Arsenal. I’d go as far as to say they got themselves the division’s second best looking target man!</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch on <a href="robert-prosinecki.html">Robert Prosinecki</a>]</b> Playing with him was amazing. He was a real character, but what a player. He didn’t really move very much, although he didn’t need to. I think I scored about 19 goals that season and he put pretty much every single one on a plate for me. He didn’t speak much, but you knew he understood far more than he was letting on. You could speak to him one-on-one and he’d answer in perfect English, but as soon as you told him to track back, he would reply: ‘I don’t understand’. He’d smoke before the game, at half-time in the showers, and after the game as well. Red Marlboros, too. The real heavy stuff</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch has jokingly offered assistance to Real Madrid icon Cristiano Ronaldo if he wants to improve his overhead-kick goal technique]</b> Only a select few of us have successfully executed a bicycle kick in the Champions League and while his goal against Juventus was good, I am happy to impart my wisdom if he wants his next attempt to be better!<br /><br />Watching Real Madrid against Juventus, I started thinking about an England Under-21 game in which I was involved, away to Portugal, in March 2003. That was the night Cristiano Ronaldo opened my eyes to a different way of playing football. We had a decent team then - Gareth Barry, Joe Cole, Michael Carrick and Jermain Defoe all started - but we knew we were coming up against a special player. The talk before the game, though, was not about Ronaldo. We were more worried about Ricardo Quaresma. Nobody had heard of Ronaldo.<br /><br />Quaresma did not disappoint. He was magnificent and kept hitting these 50-yard balls across the field, but Ronaldo was ridiculous. He was so good. He would control those sweeping passes from Quaresma from the opposite flank - with his back! - before setting off towards goal at unbelievable speed. You could only feel for Jlloyd Samuel and Paul Konchesky, who were our full-backs. They were run ragged and by the end, we lost 4-2 and Ronaldo scored. So when he arrived in the Premier League later that year, I knew from that night what to expect from Ronaldo, with all the tricks and flicks</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch hopes Marcus Rashford’s confidence has not been dented ahead of England duty]</b> We can’t forget he’s only 20. He was playing up front for Manchester United at 18 so what he’s achieved so far isn’t really normal. Jack Butland always comes back to Stoke after international games raving about the quality of his finishing. He’s had a hard season and I just hope his confidence hasn’t been dented. He is such an exciting player - the type who will get you out of your seat<br /><br /><b>[On Jesse Lingard]</b> He never fails to impress me. He’s got so much pace and that terrifies opponents. I played in England teams that had midfielders with great technical ability but this squad has a different dimension with its speed. I like the fact he is a home-grown Manchester United player: we need these characters</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch has heaped praise on England manager Gareth Southgate for his cut-throat culling of veteran players]</b> I think he deserves a hell of a lot of credit. He made some cut-throat decisions with Joe Hart, with Wayne Rooney before the tournament even started. They were difficult decisions because they are big characters in the dressing room and I think he’s done that, he’s made it a youthful side. We’re full of pace, full of energy. It’s very young, it’s exciting and I think a lot of that is down to Gareth, who’s made those decisions.<br /><br />I’ve been very, very impressed. I love the energy, I love the style of play, and I think the manager has got everyone believing again. Coming in to the tournament I don’t think many people gave us a chance, I think it’s amazing after two games everyone now thinks we can win it so it’s a big, big turnaround. I think he’s given the nation hope. They were two games that we expected to win <b>[versus Tunisia and Panama]</b>, but I just don’t think we expected to win so convincingly. We’re very pleased with the way it’s gone, I think the substitutions have been spot on and formations and tactics so, hopefully we can go far. You couldn’t ask for more</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool finally have the proper goalkeeper required to mount a Premier League title challenge]</b> Liverpool was only my home for three years but I’ve never lost my affinity for the club and their start to the season has me excited. I’d love to see them win the title one day. It will go through the roof if they make the final step - and they have got a fantastic chance to do that this year. Alisson, the new goalkeeper, was so impressive at Selhurst Park <b>[against Crystal Palace]</b>. His range of passing was outstanding and he made some great saves, too. Liverpool have got a proper goalkeeper to go with their two proper centre-halves. Virgil Van Dijk got a lot of plaudits but I was just as impressed by Joe Gomez, who has so much assurance. I always thought he was a full-back but Joe Allen told me that his future was always going to be in the middle. He showed that at Crystal Palace on Monday night with a tremendous performance</p>

I have to thank Roy, I don’t even know if he knew it was me or some idiot stopped at the lights, but after he took off and left me in his wake, I looked at myself in the mirror … and sold the car that week, and took a big hit on it.

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch has divulged a revealing anecdote about how a naked Cristiano Ronaldo used to boast he was better looking than Lionel Messi in front of Manchester United’s dressing room mirror]</b> Rio Ferdinand would tell us stories about how Cristiano Ronaldo would stand in front of the mirror naked, running his hand through his hair, and say, ‘Wow. I’m so beautiful!’. The other United players would try to wind him up. ‘Whatever. Leo Messi is a better player than you’. And he would shrug his shoulders and smile again. ‘Ah yes. But Messi does not look like this…’.<br /><br />On signing for Liverpool I stayed at the Hope Street Hotel. On reception was a girl so good looking I couldn’t quite believe she was smiling at me all the time. I told the lads in training. ‘Honestly, she’s beautiful. I think I’ve got a shout here.’ Jamie Carragher called a few other senior players over. ‘Tell them again, Crouchie.’ So I did. ‘She’s all over me. I’m on fire’. Carra again, all interested. ‘What does she look like?’. ‘Amazing. Dark-haired. Spanish-looking. I’m in there’. It turned out she was Xabi Alonso’s partner. She was doing a bit of work to practise her language skills. He was nice about it. So was she. Carra less so</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Southgate has penned a new contract as England manager]</b> If I was in charge at the FA and had to appoint a new manager, I always thought the last thing I’d do is hand out a four-year contract. In the modern game - particularly international football - four years is too long. Most nations now operate from tournament to tournament, awarding short-term deals to make sure there is an escape route if something goes wrong or results are poor. Despite that, if it had been up to me to renew Gareth Southgate’s deal, I’d have done exactly what FA chief executive Martin Glenn did on Thursday. If ever a man deserved to buck the trend for short-termism, it is Southgate. He deserved four years. Here is a contract that gives his grand plans the best possible chance of coming to fruition.<br /><br />I genuinely believe this is the start of something thrilling for England and the announcement of Southgate’s squad on Thursday confirmed as much. The inclusion of Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho put my place in football into perspective - he was five months old when I made my debut for QPR in August 2000 - but he is just one of several young talents. Sancho is clearly thriving at Dortmund and I have heard so many good reports about Mason Mount that I cannot wait to watch him play. James Maddison is another who deserves his chance. I have spoken about him a few times on these pages and apart from being skilful, he is also fearless. Some people were obviously surprised when Southgate was put in charge of the England team two years ago but, honestly, he has not made a decision yet that I have disagreed with. It should be enjoyable following England and what happened in Russia is the perfect starting point</p>

So I got him a new leather and I also got him Jose Mourinho’s book! It was ‘Jose Mourinho: How to Win The League’. And I thought, ‘This is not going to go down well, this’, and he had a look at it, he opened it up and he was actually genuinely interested.

  <p><b>[Ruling Tottenham out of the Premier League title race would be madness]</b> It’s madness, given there is so much football to play. It is also madness to rule out Tottenham, who are right in there as well.<br /><br />I know bookmakers have them as third favourites but, for the points they have racked up, you simply cannot take them out of the discussion. There is a trait about modern football that I don’t particularly like - the need to make instant and definitive predictions. I say I don’t like it, but I also have to admit it’s something of which I have been guilty<br /><br />The title race is the subject that is prompting everyone to put their necks on the line and the past fortnight has been especially revealing for rash judgments. Manchester City lost at Newcastle and the title was Liverpool’s to lose. Then Liverpool drew at home to Leicester, City beat Arsenal and West Ham took points off Liverpool. Now we are in the position, following City’s win at Goodison Park, when everyone is saying it is over to Pep Guardiola’s side again. The Premier League is the best league in the world because anyone can beat anyone and you have to keep this in mind</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool do not want to get burned again in a Premier League title race]</b> It’s one of the biggest regrets of my career that the Liverpool team I played in never made a proper title challenge. The three years I spent at Anfield were brilliant and I can imagine what it would have been like had we been in with a chance. The city - well, half of it - would have been insane. When I left, the title drought had been 18 years. The fact it is now 29 has only heightened emotions. The prize they want most might be shimmering in the distance but nobody will get carried away; nobody wants to get burned again.<br /><br />With 10 games to go, I have to be honest - regardless of my affinities - and say it is still 50-50. Manchester City are fabulous and they will exploit the slightest slip-up. They will watch Sunday’s Merseyside derby and see the potential for Liverpool to take a false step. If Liverpool manage to win the fight, they will have cleared the biggest hurdle remaining in their way. I’ve studied the run-ins of both clubs and Liverpool’s looks more favourable than City 9484afd5836d307b314a404d745a9a68, especially when you get to the middle of April. To set themselves up for that, though, they need to take care of the Merseyside derby. Win this battle and they really can start to believe</p>

  <p><b>[Callum Hudson-Odoi’s breakthrough with England echoed Wayne Rooney’s first start]</b> Fearless. It’s the only word to describe the young players who are lighting up our game. It’s fine to talk about skill and ability but it’s their lack of nerves that stands out. I watched <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>, for example, play in the Champions League final last May at just 19 and it seemed like he’d been on that stage all his life. Marcus Rashford is leading the line for Manchester United and you have to remind yourself he is 21. Jadon Sancho, just turned 19, has slotted into the England squad without fuss and now Callum Hudson-Odoi has done the same, with an attitude that echoed Wayne Rooney’s first start for England against Turkey in April 2003. Hudson-Odoi is going places. You may say that is obvious but, believe me, I have seen enough kids who break through and play a few good games and fade away in the years that follow. When you work and play alongside them, you can see the ones who are different.<br /><br />He is different. Last November, I went to Stamford Bridge to watch a Europa League game against PAOK Salonika. Chelsea won 4-0 and Hudson-Odoi scored one of the goals. The energy in his game meant you couldn’t take your eyes off him. Maurizio Sarri played him from the start in that match yet, so far, he has been reluctant to let Hudson-Odoi loose in the Premier League.<br /><br />It’s difficult to work out why he has only played 84 minutes from the bench. Willian and Pedro have been brilliant for Chelsea and I’m not being disrespectful to them but Hudson-Odoi will be looking at them and becoming increasingly impatient. It’s something every teenager feels: you’ve had your go, it’s my turn. Sarri has defended how he has used Hudson-Odoi this season and it is true that he has given him chances but it’s getting to the point where it is almost impossible to keep him out of his league plans. If he doesn’t play now, the fans will demand to know why<br /><br />I look at Chelsea and see a squad that could thrive with a young English heart. I’m a huge fan of Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Ross Barkley looks to have rediscovered his confidence and, in years to come, they could have Mason Mount, who is on loan at Derby, making an impact too. To see Hudson-Odoi running at Montenegro with boundless confidence was fabulous. I thought back to what it was like when I was 18. I wasn’t anywhere near ready for the Premier League but you can see he most certainly is. Chelsea fought to keep Hudson-Odoi out of Bayern Munich’s clutches in January but I expect the Germans to return this summer, along with some Premier League clubs. Should he play regularly in the coming weeks, holding on to him will be easier</p>

  <p><b>[Crouch says ‘feel-good factor’ is gone for <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> <b>[The game on Wednesday]</b> was a mismatch. City are so far clear you wondered how it had come to this. United are a shadow of what they once were. It is open season on them following seven defeats in nine games. I have watched events at Old Trafford this season with an increasing sense of frustration and disbelief; the performance against City was a tipping point. I questioned why there was a rush to appoint <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> on a permanent deal. I didn’t say he shouldn’t be manager, he had absolutely earned the opportunity, but there was no pressure on United to do it. Since his position was formalised on March 28 they have only beaten Watford and West Ham and the feel-good factor is gone.<br /><br />The situation doesn’t reflect well on the players. I have played in enough dressing rooms to know when things turn sour. It’s a privilege to play for a club of United’s size and it should mean something in every appearance. You don’t get to pick and choose the games you perform in. Getting to that level is the pinnacle but I wonder whether some United players truly appreciate that. Why did Romelu Lukaku talk this week about wanting to play in Italy? Why is Paul Pogba not silencing rumours linking him with Real Madrid? Things like that wouldn’t have been able to happen before, so why are they now? I don’t want to be seen as jumping on the bandwagon but they have serious issues to address. When they play Liverpool or City, I want to see United going toe to toe. I don’t want them to become just another team</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United are considered to be the wrong fit for Gareth Bale]</b> Gareth Bale’s position at Real Madrid continues to confuse me and the misuse of such a talented player is ridiculous. We share the same agent and, as far as I know, he is determined to stick it out in Spain. He is happy living there and wants to force his way back into the team, regardless of the speculation that continues to follow him. But if he is not going to be used regularly next season, I would love to see him return to Spurs.<br /><br />I saw reports earlier this week of him going back to the club on loan, with a £10million loan fee suggested. I know how Daniel Levy operates and that certainly wouldn’t be the kind of deal he’d like to do! It would make a lot of sense, however. Could you imagine his searing pace alongside Harry Kane? I think it would pay a lot of dividends. He keeps being linked to Manchester United, but I just don’t see that club suiting him at the minute. When Gareth is fit and healthy, he is one of the most exciting players in the world. I hate seeing him sitting on the bench, without being appreciated. I’d love to see him back here reminding everyone just how good he is.</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> won’t win Champions League with current defence]</b> <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> are a wonderful team. I could happily sit and watch them play all day every day, and those feelings were reinforced on Wednesday. Winning in the Bernabeu was a magnificent achievement but let’s not kid ourselves and pretend that this <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> team are comparable with any of the giants that went before. However, it is still huge to beat them in their backyard - City are only the third English side to do it, remember. City gave <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> its best European result of the season in Madrid but they didn’t convince me that they are going to go all the way to the final in Istanbul<br /><br />The reason is simple. They may have Kevin De Bruyne - who, I believe will go on to surpass <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>’s impact at City if he remains at the club for a few more years - and <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> and <a href="ederson.html">Ederson</a>, who is such a wonderful goalkeeper, but they do not have a defence to match<br /><br />There comes a point in Europe when you win because of the goals you prevent rather than the goals you score and City are always susceptible to conceding. Watching the Madrid game made me wonder what would have happened had they, rather than <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, signed <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> two years ago. They would have been so far ahead of the rest and I’m sure they would have conquered Europe by now. This, it must be stressed, is not a criticism of <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a>. He is terrific but he cannot do it all on his own. When he is not around, City look vulnerable and his absence, which <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> has put down to hamstring damage, will be felt over the next month. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> must hope that does not prove to be the case, particularly when Madrid arrive for the second leg in the middle of March.

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch has had podcast listeners guessing about the identity of a mystery teammate known only as Parched]</b> There’s a couple of instances (where a player will constantly talk to a manager). There’s one player that will remain nameless - I’m not saying the club, when I say remain nameless they always try to get it out me - we decided to call him Parched.<br /><br />When we were doing pre-season training it was intense, really intense, and after you’ve done your running or training everyone would go over for a drink, knackered, and drink loads of water. It was roasting hot, you’d done a load of work. We’d look over and Parched would be sitting with the coaching staff. He’s not had a drink. Every drinks break we’ve had he’d be around the manager, chatting to him about tactics or just getting him on side.<br /><br />So the nickname Parched really suited him. Everyone knows it. I think Parched knows who Parched is. You could trust him. He was a great lad, a top man and the only real reason he got away with it was because he was a good lad and everyone liked him<br /><br /><b>[<a href="jermaine-jenas.html">Jermaine Jenas</a> and Jon Walters ruled themselves out and Crouch has previously confirmed it is not Joe Allen, <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a>, Glenn Whelan nor Steve Sidwell. He added this week]</b> I’ve had voicemail after voicemail from people constantly asking me who Parched is and having a guess - and this is footballers included. There are a select few who know, probably three, four or five players - and the rest of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has just been all over it, it’s like Who Shot Phil? I just need to get it off my chest now<br /><br /><b>[Special guests making guesses included <a href="sean-dyche.html">Sean Dyche</a>, <a href="pepe-reina.html">Pepe Reina</a>, Lucy Benjamin - who shot Phil Mitchell in an EastEnders whodunnit - and <a href="rio-ferdinand.html">Rio Ferdinand</a>]</b> <a href="darren-fletcher.html">Darren Fletcher</a> is a strong shout and Rio has been in the dressing room with him at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> and thinks he has Parched-like tendencies. I completely get the guess … but it’s just not right<br /><br />I know people in various dressing rooms and I’m at the age where I know various managers too. People talk in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> - and 100 per cent, Parched is a marmite character. He’s happy with that. He would tell you straight, now, if he was here, he’d say, ‘You either love me or you don’t’<br /><br />Jack Butland is Parched in the making. There’s potential</p>

Every time he finished his drink, the supermodel who was with him brought him another. The chance to have a picture with him was too good to turn down, so I went over.

  <p><b>[Crouch admits he regrets leaving <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> The one thing that niggles away at me is leaving <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in 2008. <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafa Benitez</a> was happy to let me go and I was only ever going to be a Plan B.

For emotion and an adrenaline rush, scoring against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> to put <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> into the Champions League was incredible. If I think about it now, I can still see the away end going mental.

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch has admitted that he just wanted to hide during his first few months at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, after failing to find the net in 18 successive appearances]</b> I went 18 games before scoring for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> back in 2005 and I’ve been asked if I ever worried I’d never get a goal and if my team-mates were giving me stick. Frankly, it was the worst time in my football career. I remember my dad saying ‘you’re going to a massive club, European champions at the time, just get your first goal and your confidence and you’ll be fine’. I thought ‘yeah I’ll get in there, get one early, get the monkey off my back and then bang’. But it just wasn’t happening. In my defence, I felt like I was trying to do too much. But not too many clubs would have stuck by me. I went 18 games without scoring. Everywhere I went people knew, it was on the back of the papers. I think the total time without a goal had clocked up to 24 hours, and on the front page one of them had Jack Bauer from 24 mocked up with different pictures of my face looking in anguish, and I thought it just couldn’t get any worse. I stopped watching TV and just wanted to hide in my house. It was horrible. My dad had to keep dragging me out after games and have a few beers with me because I just didn’t want to leave the house. Then thankfully the first goal went in - which in truth probably wasn’t even my goal - against Wigan. It went about 40 yards in the air and the keeper Mike Pollitt inadvertently helped me out by trying to tip it over the bar but instead it went in. At that moment, the whole ground was shaking. It was an electric atmosphere at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> for that first goal. I got a load of stick. Loads and loads. But you know what, the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans stuck with me and I’ll always remember that to this day.</p>
