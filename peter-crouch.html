  <p><b>[Peter Crouch on <a href="robert-prosinecki.html">Robert Prosinecki</a>]</b> Playing with him was amazing. He was a real character, but what a player. He didn’t really move very much, although he didn’t need to. I think I scored about 19 goals that season and he put pretty much every single one on a plate for me. He didn’t speak much, but you knew he understood far more than he was letting on. You could speak to him one-on-one and he’d answer in perfect English, but as soon as you told him to track back, he would reply: ‘I don’t understand’. He’d smoke before the game, at half-time in the showers, and after the game as well. Red Marlboros, too. The real heavy stuff</p>

I have to thank Roy, I don’t even know if he knew it was me or some idiot stopped at the lights, but after he took off and left me in his wake, I looked at myself in the mirror … and sold the car that week, and took a big hit on it.

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch has announced his retirement from football at the age of 38 having represented England, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and many other clubs across a distinguished career]</b> I have had 23 years to prepare for this moment but, now it is here, you realise nothing can prepare you at all. The time has come refer to myself as a ‘former footballer’; this incredible journey I have been on since I was 16 is over. My ambition was to play until I was 40, so it is scary saying the word ‘retirement’. To go from being a regular starter to someone whose role is limited to 10 or 15 minutes off the bench has been hard to accept. I will be 39 in January, but I am physically fit and could have carried on. What I didn’t want to be was someone who was thrown on to have balls smashed up to them<br /><br /><b>[During his first <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> spell, Crouch was loaned out to non-league Dulwich Hamlet and Swedish minnows Hassleholm - and he acknowledges he has come a long way since then]</b> Let’s be honest - you would not have taken odds on me making it then. If you had told me at that point I would go on to play for England 42 times and score 22 goals, play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in a Champions League and FA Cup final and score the goal that put <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> back in the European Cup for the first time in four decades, I would have had you locked up.<br /><br /><b>[Seven-and-a-half years at Stoke took Crouch into the twilight of his career and he closed things out at Burnley - the perfect club to bring things to an end]</b> Burnley, really, was the ideal place to finish. I didn’t make the biggest impact after I went there in January, but I was so glad I went. <a href="sean-dyche.html">Sean Dyche</a> is a top manager and the boys are quality.

He doesn’t need to spend £30m on someone if they don’t fit the bill - so why waste money? There is a good arrogance about the European champions. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> knows he has got a quality team, his players know they will progress again and the competition on the training ground will guarantee improvement. It’s the perfect atmosphere to improve in. How they stayed with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> last season was remarkable. I hope the shootout for the title is another fantastic battle between two teams I love to watch. If City falter, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s team will take advantage.

Forget about some of the erratic results they had last season when they struggled with fatigue and injuries - <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are a brilliant side and will comfortably finish third again.

Everyone knows about Harry Kane, who will be desperate to win the Golden Boot again, but I want to stress the importance of Son Heung-min. He is a top player, one of the best forwards in Europe and I think he will be even better again this season. Dele Alli will also be fired up.

He has performed miracles so far against richer rivals but the Argentine needs some silverware to show for all his fine work<br /><br /><b>[Crouch went on to say of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> when pressed to pick a key man for the upcoming campaign]</b> Harry Kane - there’s so much more to his game than goals but few better strikers around.

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch warning the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> contract rebel <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> that the grass isn’t always greener]</b> Harry Kane scored the goals that ultimately defeated Villa <b>[on the opening weekend of the 2019-20 campaign]</b> but it was only when the Dane came on that they really went through the gears. But as he has shown no indication that he will sign a new contract, you cannot rule out the idea that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> will sell him before the window closes. Real Madrid is the club he wants to join but I wonder whether it would suit him. I moved many times during my career and you realise occasionally the grass isn’t always greener. Would Madrid suit him? He wouldn’t be the main man there and could end up lost. Eriksen is talented and professional but that doesn’t guarantee anything in Madrid. Look at Gareth Bale.</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch on <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>]</b> <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> is the best thing that has happened to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in 20 years. I say that as someone who was at the club in the late 1990s and, again, 10 years later when <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> took charge: I’ve seen good and bad times first hand and I know what I’m seeing now. This is a blip, nothing more. I was at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> seven days ago and I didn’t see too much wrong with their performance.

If <a href="serge-aurier.html">Serge Aurier</a>’s goal had stood, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> would have gone into today’s game with <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> in third place.

Not ideal, of course, but not any reason for people to believe the relationship between club and manager has run its course<br /><br /><a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> will finish in the top four again and I have absolutely no doubt about that. <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> might not be happy with certain aspects of his squad but not to the point that he has lost faith in them. If anything, it looks to me that he is frustrated that they are not getting the ‘glory’ they deserve. If they need some change to the personnel, they don’t need it in the dugout. <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> is one of the best managers in the world and has many admirers - the work he has done to make <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> Champions League regulars should not be taken for granted.

And then the second half, I don’t even know where to begin. 3-3, I just couldn’t have seen it, and then <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a> pops up with the winner.

He can make a difference. My issue when he played at Stoke was that while, obviously, he could look brilliant, there were times when there was a lot of tactical ill-discipline.<br /><br />If you’ve got a specific role to play that involves tracking back, just going and doing your own thing doesn’t really work.

Winning in the Bernabeu was a magnificent achievement but let’s not kid ourselves and pretend that this <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> team are comparable with any of the giants that went before. However, it is still huge to beat them in their backyard - City are only the third English side to do it, remember. City gave <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> its best European result of the season in Madrid but they didn’t convince me that they are going to go all the way to the final in Istanbul<br /><br />The reason is simple. They may have Kevin De Bruyne - who, I believe will go on to surpass <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>’s impact at City if he remains at the club for a few more years - and <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> and Ederson, who is such a wonderful goalkeeper, but they do not have a defence to match<br /><br />There comes a point in Europe when you win because of the goals you prevent rather than the goals you score and City are always susceptible to conceding.

  <p><b>[Peter Crouch has had podcast listeners guessing about the identity of a mystery teammate known only as Parched]</b> There’s a couple of instances (where a player will constantly talk to a manager). There’s one player that will remain nameless - I’m not saying the club, when I say remain nameless they always try to get it out me - we decided to call him Parched.<br /><br />When we were doing pre-season training it was intense, really intense, and after you’ve done your running or training everyone would go over for a drink, knackered, and drink loads of water. It was roasting hot, you’d done a load of work. We’d look over and Parched would be sitting with the coaching staff. He’s not had a drink. Every drinks break we’ve had he’d be around the manager, chatting to him about tactics or just getting him on side.<br /><br />So the nickname Parched really suited him. Everyone knows it. I think Parched knows who Parched is. You could trust him. He was a great lad, a top man and the only real reason he got away with it was because he was a good lad and everyone liked him<br /><br /><b>[<a href="jermaine-jenas.html">Jermaine Jenas</a> and Jon Walters ruled themselves out and Crouch has previously confirmed it is not Joe Allen, <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a>, Glenn Whelan nor Steve Sidwell.

Frankly, it was the worst time in my football career.

I thought ‘yeah I’ll get in there, get one early, get the monkey off my back and then bang’. But it just wasn’t happening. In my defence, I felt like I was trying to do too much. But not too many clubs would have stuck by me. I went 18 games without scoring. Everywhere I went people knew, it was on the back of the papers. I think the total time without a goal had clocked up to 24 hours, and on the front page one of them had Jack Bauer from 24 mocked up with different pictures of my face looking in anguish, and I thought it just couldn’t get any worse. I stopped watching TV and just wanted to hide in my house. It was horrible. My dad had to keep dragging me out after games and have a few beers with me because I just didn’t want to leave the house. Then thankfully the first goal went in - which in truth probably wasn’t even my goal - against Wigan. It went about 40 yards in the air and the keeper Mike Pollitt inadvertently helped me out by trying to tip it over the bar but instead it went in. At that moment, the whole ground was shaking.
