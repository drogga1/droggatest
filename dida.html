<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Alisson is one of the strongest goalkeepers in Europe]</b> I could see his qualities from the very beginning. He was very agile and quick to read the offensive schemes. It was very clear to me that he would become a top player. I did not give him any particular advice, but when you train together I think everyone tries to get something from the other to improve. The only advice I gave him is to be always focused and always participate in the game even when the ball is far away. This helps team-mates to be more relaxed and to trust you<br /><br />Liverpool have conceded only 15 goals in the Premier League - they have the best defence. Clearly, it’s thanks to the whole team but certainly Alisson’s personality gives more confidence to defenders and consequently to the whole team. Alisson is one of the strongest goalkeepers in Europe. You could already see his huge potential when he was a kid<br /><br />Klopp is doing a great job with Liverpool. He has qualified for the Champions League in the past two seasons and the journey to the final of the competition last May was fantastic. He is a coach with a great degree of enthusiasm for his job and I think the team perceives it. They are doing great this season and competing for trophies. It’s a team that entertains and it is amazing to watch them play</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> keeper Dida on <a href="gianluigi-donnarumma.html">Donnarumma</a>]</b> <a href="gianluigi-donnarumma.html">Gianluigi Donnarumma</a> doesn’t need any advice. He grown up in the last year and now he is very mature for his age. In the past he had some misunderstanding with Milan fans but now you can see he is very focused and is doing great things for Milan. He made some great saves this season, he always approach the game with the right attitude. You can see he is matured. He just need to keep working as he is doing</p>
