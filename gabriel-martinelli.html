  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have completed the signing of Brazilian youngster Gabriel Martinelli, with the 18-year-old arriving at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> in a £6 million deal]</b> It is a dream since I was a child and also my family’s dream for me to be playing in Europe and playing for a big team like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I am going to take this opportunity. I am a player who gives his all at all times, I play as a team and always looking to win games and win trophies<br /><br />I model my game on <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, he is a player who works hard, pushing himself to the next level. Always in the run for titles and individual trophies. I look up to <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> as they are players who can decide games and are very professional, who dedicate themselves to the whole game<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s Samba stars of the past]</b> I know a few. I know <a href="edu.html">Edu</a>, <a href="denilson.html">Denilson</a> and I know that they have a lot of history at the club. <a href="edu.html">Edu</a>, in particular, I had a little contact with him at Corinthians as I had a spell there and I know they had a lot of success here but also for the national team.

  <p><b>[<a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> have also looked at him - with the latter having invited the young forward over to spend some time training with them in Spain]</b> It was one of the best experiences I’ve had in football. Besides being one of the biggest clubs in the world, the level of training is very high and it made me grow a lot in football.<br /><br /><b>[Describing himself, the teenager said]</b> I play as an attacker, but not necessarily a forward. I consider myself more of the modern style, with speed and a lot of movement without the foot. I really like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, because I also don’t like to play with my back to the defender holding the ball, as in the old fashion forward. But if I have to, I also know how to play like that</p>

  <p><b>[Martinelli reflects on <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> training sessions before <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> move]</b> There was a project between Ituano and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, and they always took a player. And I always came for these trips. I could neither speak English nor French, but he <b>[<a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>]</b> said ‘tudo bem’ (a common Portuguese greeting) and took the picture with me nicely, he was super humble. Those training days were super important for me to adapt to the style of play, the players and how fast the game is here<br /><br /><b>[And the player himself admits that he wasted no time in agreeing to join the beaten Europa League finalists despite there being other offers on the table]</b> I remember we played against Guarani, we won 2-1, and my agent called me. He said ‘you have to decide, so what?’. Then he said it was <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. Then you think, one of the best clubs in Europe. I said yes, I couldn’t refuse. There were some approaches, but <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> came in strong, and I made the right choice to be here<br /><br /><b>[But Martinelli - who spent time training with Brazil’s squad ahead of the 2019 Copa America - insists he is yet to make a decision on his international future, though he suggested that it would be a ‘dream’ to represent the country of his birth]</b> I’m Brazilian, of course everyone wants to play with that yellow shirt, listen to their people singing. But I can play for Italy too. I have nothing decided. Of course I want to play for Brazil, but I haven’t defined it yet. It can be one or the other</p>

  <p><b>[Gabriel Martinelli says that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> blocked a call-up to Brazil’s Under-23 squad despite the attacker’s desire to represent his country]</b> I said that if it was up to me I would play. But we knew it would be difficult. It was a time when I was a starter at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and people preferred not to let me go. He (Brazil general coordinator <a href="juninho.html">Juninho</a> Paulista) called me, spoke to me and congratulated me on what I’m doing. I haven’t been called up yet, but I’m very calm about it. We talked a little after he went to the national team. He called me, said that this was the opportunity of my life, that I should give my best because things would go well<br /><br />I have Italian citizenship from my father. So I have the option of playing for Brazil or Italy. But that’s just a consequence. I have to keep working here at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, and only then we will see what lies ahead</p>

He pays a lot of attention to moves and keeps pushing me to improve my game; not only in attack but defence, too. The boss is very wise tactically and incredibly helpful. He’s not an angry guy at all, but likes showing you exactly what to do on the pitch: ‘If the ball goes that way, don’t stay here, go there and turn your body that specific way.’ He has a keen eye for detail</p>
