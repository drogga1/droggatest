You have to make mistakes, you have to learn from them, you have to obviously build a team from your core. There are still a lot of pieces from last year and the years before, but obviously this year we brought in a lot of new players and we believe that the pieces we brought into the team this year are some of the very important pieces that we were missing last year<br /><br />What we did is in our spine we believe we brought leaders, we brought guys who can deal with high pressure and with the challenges of the league, the stress, the results, the competition. That’s very important<br /><br />Tolerance is very important for building. When there is frustration, when there is whatever happened in the season, in our daily life, we are ready to deal with that and we have to set the rules, set the hierarchy and at the same time put everyone on the same page and treat everyone the same - I mean the same in a way where the rules are the rules<br /><br />I believe that this year we’re in a better spot for sure, and the experience we had last year will help us to, in my opinion, have a better season this year</p>

We had to create assets to make our offers more until we got to the point where Red Bull opened the door for negotiations and we got him. He was our target. We said this is the player we need because he’s a competitor and a leader. He knows the league, has very good qualities as a midfielder and everything that comes with his character.<br /><br />I’ve been happy with his readiness and competitiveness. He really adapted very well and very quickly, which was the only challenge we had. His adaptation, going through the frustration with the trade, he did very well</p>

If we can match that, we for sure have the quality in our team, and are confident in our game plan that we can score goals and win. They’re a very hard opponent when they play at home. They’re high-pressing oriented, very good on set pieces, have a lot of talent and are a very diverse team. They’re all on the same page when it comes to effort, commitment and willingness to win, so we have to match that if we want to win.<br /><br />We have to change our mindset when we play on the road, and be more consistent. That’s right now the challenge the team has in front of it. If we want to be successful this year, and reach the playoffs, we have to get points on the road. We have to be more solid defensively as a team</p>

He brought a lot of attention to our club. We were brought on the world map of soccer with him here. That’s something actually that really helps, to be challenged to work toward the goals we have as an organization, as a club. With him, it’s easier to work. We still have to look forward to get more from him, and give him everything he needs in order to continue our relationship as it is so far, a successful and enjoyable experience.</p>

  <p><b>[On Matt Polster]</b> We always knew we’d have to be cautious because you never know how he’s going to accept that. But obviously, the other issue we had at that point was his injury because in the last game in Toronto, he got hurt and we knew he was going to be out several months.<br /><br />When he came back he re-injured himself in the preseason and it delayed the process of conversion, from midfielder to right back. And with all that delay we also had to manage his new position and new role in the team but also his body, his fitness, which was an added difficulty to our job..<br /><br />I think with his help and his openness to learn, to get back as soon as possible to the field - together we did a great job. And now we’re just trying to give Matt more tools and support so he discovers the benefits of the new position and new role for him and for our team too<br /><br />I think more experience and maturity in not only his game but also his behavior and understanding this profession and the way it should be. I also think that he improved his game, especially this year when he is playing a different position.<br /><br />He learned to play very quickly, which proves the talent that he has. And still being a young player, showing that he’s capable of learning a different position means a lot in terms of what value he may have for our team - and obviously American soccer for the future</p>

  <p><b>[FC Dallas dominates draft, LAFC didn’t rely on combine and more]</b> When the trades started to happen, it makes you start to think diferently and see the possibilities. I didn’t want to leave with a bad taste in my mouth because we didn’t get <b>[Bakero]</b>.<br /><br />He fulfills the role and the style of playing we’re playing now, which is competitive, good on the ball, mobile, unpredictable. That’s who we are as a team, and want to be, and he will get better. All that makes him the perfect profile for us, and he has something that we didn’t have, at least not productive in attack. He has good size, which is something we were missing<br /><br />It’s not easy to deal with the international spots, but we want good players in the draft, and we can figure out the international spots later. Knowing that he’s international we knew that he could slip, but we also knew there were teams like us that would be willing to take that risk<br /><br />What we want is to give Jon the opportunity to create his own legacy, make his own name in this world. And <b>[the Fire]</b> is the place for him to be, and the opportunity he was probably looking for</p>

We have to figure it out to help him to have a better game in front of him. It’s going to take some time, and I’m very grateful that he stays confident and very reliable and helpful.<br /><br />We are fixing things, and I think fixing the defense, which <b>[on Saturday]</b> looked better, but we still conceded a lot of opportunities. We still have to do a better job there, and just build on top of this important win that gives us some confidence, but there is still a long way to go</p>

  <p><b>[Former Serbia youth coach Veljko Paunovic has described new <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> signing <a href="luka-jovic.html">Luka Jovic</a> as one of the greatest talents he has ever seen]</b> He’s one of the greatest talents I’ve seen, and I’ve played with killers like <a href="christian-vieri.html">Christian Vieri</a>, <a href="jimmy-floyd-hasselbaink.html">Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink</a>, <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a> and Lyuboslav Penev. After Pedja <a href="predrag-mijatovic.html">Mijatovic</a>, <a href="davor-suker.html">Davor Suker</a> and all that generation, there has been some great players - but not an attacker like <a href="luka-jovic.html">Luka Jovic</a>. We’ve had him in the Serbia set-up practically his whole career so far. Back in 2014, due to his great development and physical power that was superior to his age, we promoted him <b>[to the Under-19s]</b>. He was born in December 1997, so he was almost three years younger than the entire generation that formed that team. We reached the semi-finals of Euro U-19 (in 2015) and in that team we had Nikola Maksimovic, <a href="sergej-milinkovic-savic.html">Sergej Milinkovic-Savic</a>, etc - players who are having great careers now, but we were missing a striker like him. We had <a href="luka-jovic.html">Jovic</a> in the national team in an important tournament like that one and it was enough time to see all the potential he has and the player he is going to be.<br /><br /><b>[It is a job, says Paunovic, that he is more than qualified to do]</b> <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> have bought a player with lots of potential to develop. He’s a great player. A killer. We still have a while to go to see, for me, probably the greatest talent Serbia - or any region in former Yugoslavia - has produced in the last 20 years. Luka has a showreel of first-touch shots, inside the box, outside the box, on the head, both legs … it is a spectacular repertoire. He’s so precise and ice cold - and that’s key for him. He keeps his head cool and focused on scoring goals. His coach must keep developing his confidence, but he’s one of the greatest talents Serbia has ever had</p>

  <p>Sometimes I had to walk for four hours to get to training, because there wasn’t any petrol for the buses to take you. But not even that was hard for me. Going without food and going to train, not eating until after school. For me, it was normal. I didn’t even realise what was happening. Looking back now, with the benefit of hindsight, you can tell the war in Yugoslavia had a huge impact on the direction a lot of people took. But being young, you always view the future positively. And football was, without me even being conscious of it, my escape route. My refuge. A subconscious bubble for me to go into<br /><br />I never saw my father play. When I was born, he was 30 and his career was coming to an end. But if you mention his name in my country, everybody knows who you are talking about: Blagoje Paunovic. Partizan Belgrade. Yugoslavia<br /><br />He talked a lot about playing in the final of the European Championship in 1968, when Yugoslavia lost to Italy. He told me that when he came back from Rome after the tournament, there were 10,000 people waiting to welcome him home, shouting his name. He and his teammates were proud of what they had done, of coming so close to winning gold. He said he hoped that, one day, I could feel that<br /><br />My father was a defender. He played as a sweeper, read the game well from the back, passed with great precision into midfield. I was more of an attacking player, more creative. I liked to join up the attack, overtake players. He didn’t talk much about my position, though. He only demanded one thing from me. ‘Son, run like a horse on the pitch, and eat like a horse off it’<br /><br />When I was 17, my father told me he was going to get me out of Yugoslavia. He was the one who took that decision. He contacted the right people and took the right steps, and eventually I signed for <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a><br /><br />The people at the club, led by <a href="miguel-angel-gil-marin.html">Miguel Angel Gil Marin</a> and Radomir Antic, gave my family and I the opportunity to change our outlook. Football had been a decision before I moved to Spain, but it also now became a blessing. I think I simply followed that blessing, and am a better person and professional because of it. My family’s future is secured thanks to my father’s vision, to the decision he took back then. If he hadn’t done what he did, I’m sure I would have had to stay in Belgrade and fight to survive the situation there<br /><br /> You have to understand, though, that we never changed our national team, our flag. It was always Yugoslavia, and when Yugoslavia disintegrated it was Serbia and Montenegro, and now Serbia. My father always spoke to me of Yugoslavia. He died feeling Yugoslavian, but he was also very proud of being Serbian and that is now my country. I was born in Macedonia, but I am 100 per cent Serbian<br /><br /> When I was given the chance to work with the national team, then, it was an honour. I had always known I wanted to be a manager. I completed the first level of training when I was 29, and by the time I was 34 I had all my badges. Then, when you start, you realise if it is for you or not. In my case, it was a definite yes. I still remember when I finished my first training session as a manager. It felt impressive. I felt good<br /><br /> …<br /><br /> After the semi final, we were euphoric. We were in the final against Brazil, and it felt like we had nothing to lose. But I remember, when everyone went to bed at about 4am, I opened my computer, looked at my notes and said to myself: ‘No. We are going to win this final. We will beat Brazil’.<br /><br /> That is what we had come for, and I was sure we would win. Before the tournament, I had asked for everything to be recorded, for a cameraman to follow us throughout. Even in the build-up to the final. We didn’t include the technical bits, but the motivational stuff is all in there. In it, you can see me tell the players that we were born for this moment<br /><br />We scored the winning goal three minutes from the end of extra time. The whole bench was in a state of euphoria, but I told everyone to stay calm. There were still three minutes left. We could still score a third goal<br /><br />At the final whistle, I pointed to the sky. My father had hoped that, one day, I could feel what he had felt all those years ago. It is a shame he couldn’t live to see it - he had passed away in December, six months before - but of course I thought of him. My whole life has been about football, and that is thanks to him<br /><br />Back in Belgrade, in the main square where big events are celebrated, we were welcomed home by more than 50,000 people. And these kids? I think, at the World Cup in Russia, at least one of them is going to play an important part. Things are changing, and if not now, I do believe that this generation will have an important role in future tournaments<br /><br />Sooner or later, I am sure Serbia will win a tournament. It’s our turn</p>
