  <p><b>[<a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a> cameo lasts just seven minutes as <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> striker earns rapid red card]</b> It was an unfortunate incident, as we all thought the initial yellow card was harsh. He jumped for the ball and didn’t see the defender coming up behind him. It’s a pity, as we were down to 10 men for the final 10 minutes and were unable to count on the resource that is having <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a> in the team.

He didn’t train on Tuesday or Wednesday because he was unwell.

  <p><b>[Eugenio Corini’s charges are now winless in six <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> matches]</b> It is very hard to digest. We will take the good from what we have done so far and must continue. It is easy to be frustrated, but inside the pain we have to find some motivation - the season is not over. The fact is that until we are dead we will continue fighting</p>
