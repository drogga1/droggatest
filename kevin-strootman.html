<blockquote>
  <p>[<a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> have told Kevin Strootman they will have to sell him in the next transfer window after they failed to qualify for the Champions League] We didn’t get European football, while at <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> they went out for the Champions League. So the president said in an open and fair conversation: ‘You are an expensive force and without the Champions League it’s difficult for us’. They want to get rid of me, is the message. But I signed a five-year contract last summer and <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> have paid a big transfer fee to Roma, so it’s not like clubs can take me for a very low price. We have to wait to see what happens in the market and how it will go.<br /><br />In principle I still have four years of my contact to go. You do not sign somewhere for five years with the intention of leaving again after a year. I want to repay the trust and stay and have a better second year, but then again, you have to get the chance. <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> also has to deal with <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s Financial fair play rules<br /><br />[Strootman has already been linked with a return to former side <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>] I have not thought of the Eredivisie yet. My preference is not in a loan move. A sale is preferable</p>
