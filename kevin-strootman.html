  <p><b>[Kevin Strootman admits that Mohamed Salah has the potential to be a nightmare for Roma]</b> I’m not surprised at how well he’s doing but just at how easy he scores the goals and how confident he is in front of goal with the ball. Here he did a great job and did a lot of great assists and goals but he missed a lot of chances, especially one-on-one with the goalkeeper. I am surprised by how many goals he has scored so far but not how he plays. Here he was a nightmare for opponents and in England he is doing the same.<br /><br />Now he has so much confidence and he just creates the chances himself and finds it easy in front of the goal. I think it is confidence which is the main difference. It did a lot when he played here but now you see if he has a chance and he misses it, the next time he knows he will score. He is doing amazing also with the national team, he did a great job, I think he is the king there now and they want to vote him for president and everything. I just hope in the two games against us he loses his confidence. We have special tactics <b>[for Salah]</b> but I’m not going to share it! Italian defence, that is what I’m hoping for</p>

  <p><b>[Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman has denied he was ever close to joining Manchester United]</b> I never talked with anybody. No, no. There was a lot of speculation but to be honest I only spoke with Roma. There were some clubs who showed interest but it’s always like that. They always say they are interested but at the end they don’t do anything so it’s nothing and I’m really happy that I chose Rome.<br /><br />Even during my time with Rome before my injury they talked about other clubs but I never talked about leaving Rome. They said some club was really close to signing me and they want me really bad but I’m good here</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[<a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> have told Kevin Strootman they will have to sell him in the next transfer window after they failed to qualify for the Champions League]</b> We didn’t get European football, while at <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> they went out for the Champions League. So the president said in an open and fair conversation: ‘You are an expensive force and without the Champions League it’s difficult for us’. They want to get rid of me, is the message. But I signed a five-year contract last summer and <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> have paid a big transfer fee to Roma, so it’s not like clubs can take me for a very low price. We have to wait to see what happens in the market and how it will go.<br /><br />In principle I still have four years of my contact to go. You do not sign somewhere for five years with the intention of leaving again after a year. I want to repay the trust and stay and have a better second year, but then again, you have to get the chance. <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> also has to deal with <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s Financial fair play rules<br /><br /><b>[Strootman has already been linked with a return to former side <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>]</b> I have not thought of the Eredivisie yet. My preference is not in a loan move. A sale is preferable</p>
