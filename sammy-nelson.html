<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Sammy Nelson says <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> praised for bringing respect back to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> after Emery ‘upheaval’]</b> Because <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> played for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, he knows the culture of the club and understands the fans. He knows what he wants, and although he didn’t get the call for the manager’s job when <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> left, I think he gained a lot of valuable experience working with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> for another 18 months.<br /><br />He’s his own man and certainly he’s trying to shape the team the way he wants it. It’s only been a couple of months and it’s a slow process. It’s not easy. You have to take your time, especially being between transfer windows. There will be players he wants to sign and to get rid of. But considering the upheaval of the <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> period he has been doing well. The <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a> result the other week was a setback, but we look as if the team wants to play again.<br /><br />He’s trying to bring the confidence back but also the relationship with the supporters. They want to see the players really trying all the time. If they see that, they’ll support you even if you lose. <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> is trying to instil that respect for the club, the staff, the supporters, everybody - and respect for yourself.<br /><br />But while Nelson believes <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> has <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> on the right track again, he also feels that his other former side, Brighton, shouldn’t be written off ahead of Saturday’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> showdown. You never know. Results like <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>’s against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> show that anything is possible. Nothing changes. But it’s horses for courses. Brighton had a good result against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> just before Christmas and nothing’s impossible. It could go either way depending on who turns up on the day</p>
