  <p>[Ryan Mason has been discharged from hospital following treatment for a fractured skull] The number of messages offering support during Ryan’s recovery has been quite overwhelming. It is certainly true to say that the football family rallies around at times like this and we would like to thank everybody that has been in contact with us in recent days. We would also like to say a special ‘thank you’ to Julian Redhead and Kevin Tsang, two consultants who have been instrumental in Ryan’s recovery to this point.<br /><br />Their calmness and professional manner enabled us all to have absolute confidence that Ryan was in good hands. A&amp;E departments in many towns and cities nationwide have had some criticism recently but I have nothing but admiration for all of the staff who cared for us last Sunday.</p>

  <p>[The National Football League will increase the number of games its teams play in London in 2019] The games in the past few weeks have once again demonstrated the incredible passion of NFL fans in the UK. The support of our stadium partners, the Mayor of London and the Minister for Sport gives us a great foundation for further development of the sport and the ability to give our fans even more NFL games in the coming years.</p>
