  <p><b>[one angry commenter on Chinese social media fumed, rightly trashing the permissive attitude of Lavezzi’s employers that led them to go public with such a clearly inappropriate image]</b> How could it be possible? Why Hebei China Fortune allowed Lavezzi to exhibit such racist behavior right under their noses? China made Lavezzi the highest paid footballer in the world. In return, he happily mocked and denigrated the Chinese people. What a decent man!</p>

  <p><b>[Racism storm means £36m-a-year Lavezzi is a joke that’s no longer funny]</b> The picture was taken by three Spanish photographers when the whole squad was in Spain for winter training. As requested by the Chinese Super League, apart from the squad photo, a light-hearted portrait of every individual player is also needed. Every player, including Lavezzi, was demanded by the photographers to pull some funny poses. All those present knew that nothing untoward happened. Since joining the club in 2016, Lavezzi gets along well with every teammate and staff. He is also deeply admired by our fans. Meanwhile, he has expressed, on several occasions, his love for China.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and Argentina forward Ezequiel Lavezzi has announced his retirement from football]</b> They were amazing years of this story. Years marked by learning, unique moments and lots of memories that will stay in my heart for good. I am forever grateful for those who have stayed by my side throughout this journey. With lots of joy, I say goodbye to the most amazing phase life has given me. I’ve been extremely happy!</p>
