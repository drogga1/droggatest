  <p><b>[Philipp Lahm talks about adaptation as full-back]</b> I quickly realised that I couldn’t have <a href="mehmet-scholl.html">Mehmet Scholl</a> as my role model any more. So I changed it to <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Paolo Maldini</a> instead<br /><br /><b>[When he turned down <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in 2008 the most important thing to Lahm was not his salary but his standing in the <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> hierarchy. Not long after declining the Catalans’ offer, against the advice of his adviser, he said]</b> It could be that my personality had been underrated. For me it was important to know how <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> see me. And there were times when I had the impression that my opinion wasn’t 100% appreciated all the time. Now, after several good discussions, I have the feeling of being an important part of the <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> puzzle. And that was very important to me<br /><br /><b>[After the defeat against Croatia in the group stage of Euro 2008 he was asked whether he spoke at the team meeting following the game]</b> Of course I said something. And when you get the feeling that you are listened to by the team you notice that you slowly grow into the role of a leader. And as luck would have it we improved<br /><br /><b>[He was asked whether a player grows into the role of the leader or if he suddenly decides he wants to be captain]</b> Both. I came into the national team when I was 19 and I didn’t have the experience to be able to be part of the discussions then. Now I am still quite young but am quite an experienced footballer and when you always perform then you have to somehow look after your own interests as well. I am ambitious and I want to achieve things and I want to do that with the team. I want to contribute more<br /><br /><b>[Lahm is fiercely protective of his leadership style, batting away comparisons with the notion that a captain has to be a certain kind of Führungsspieler (leader), in the way that <a href="michael-ballack.html">Ballack</a>, <a href="stefan-effenberg.html">Stefan Effenberg</a> and even <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> were. Outspoken players with big personalities]</b> What is a Führungsspieler? I don’t like the term. For me there is not a clear definition of the term. Why was <a href="stefan-effenberg.html">Stefan Effenberg</a> a leader, because he was outspoken? Or because he had a certain presence on the pitch? When that’s the criteria, OK, then maybe I have a different definition of what a leader is. Was <a href="stefan-effenberg.html">Effenberg</a> a leader because he projected presence or because he had a presence? There is a difference. Today there aren’t any players that single-handedly lead their teams. Today you share this responsibility. Every single player has to take responsibility for what they do. Look at the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> team that won the Champions League in 2008, they didn’t have a ‘leader’ like <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> any more</p>

  <p><b>[Philipp Lahm on delivering a half-time chat, with Germany 5-0 up, en route to a 7-1 win over hosts Brazil in their <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup™ semi-final]</b> We talked about continuing to play properly and showing respect. Everybody in the team took that attitude for the second half. We didn’t want to showboat or take the mickey out of the opposition. If it ended in a bigger margin of victory, then that wasn’t all we wanted. We aimed to show respect to the opposition and the fans</p>

  <p>Football as a whole has changed. Look at the top teams and you see a lot of midfielders on the pitch. You don’t really have traditional full-backs any more. I have played as a right winger at times but this season (2015-16) I’ve also played more in the middle of midfield and right back. It depends on the tactics used against the different opponents<br /><br /><b>[Philipp Lahm talks about flexibility and creativity]</b> I’ve always placed great value on tactics. Secondly, I was always smaller and more slightly built so I had to adapt my approach and I learnt a lot through that. Pep then added ideas that made it more fun and put me in midfield and that gave me a different perspective</p>

If we are 13 points clear after 25 games, it means that other well-positioned clubs like Schalke or Wolfsburg haven’t performed consistently well. <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> are an unbelievably talented team who could have made the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> title race a lot closer.
