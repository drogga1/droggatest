  <p><b>[Dheeraj Singh’s journey to India U17 World Cup team]</b> First of all, I never thought of playing for the national team. I never thought of playing in the World Cup. Whenever I would get time, I go out and play on the field and in court. I used to play badminton primarily. I studied in a residential school - Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya. There were many students and the football ground was always crowded. That was one of the reasons why I preferred playing badminton.<br /><br />The goalkeeper is the most important part of the team. We have been especially training hard for the last two years. We have had many experiences, I keep on learning from the exposure which I got in the last two or three years. I have been working with the coaches - the goalkeeping coach, the assistant coach, the head coach. We are mentally and physically prepared for the World Cup. The time has come to deliver and I am more focused than ever<br /><br />First of all, I have done many negative and positive things in my journey. I have learned so many things. I have been in many situations in the last 3-4 years and the experience will help me give my best in the coming matches<br /><br />Different coaches have different thinking &amp; different methods. It is good for me that I have worked with many good coaches. He <b>[Norton]</b> has been working on keeping the ball, letting the players take the risks with more touches<br /><br />I have watched videos of matches of USA, Colombia and Ghana, They are technically very good. The United States are much superior to both the other teams. They are the strongest side in our group in my opinion. Ghana is more about physicality. But Colombia is also a strong side</p>
