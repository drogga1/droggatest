  <p><b>[Aaron Wan-Bissaka reflects on impressive year with Crystal Palace]</b> It started with the chance I was given to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I was shocked when it happened, but it was a chance I had to take, and I feel I’ve taken it. It started on the Friday I went into the Analysis room, and checked the board - and my name wasn’t on the bench. I looked up and saw it in the right-back position. I was shocked, nerves kicked in. I was playing against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> the next day. It’s a big thing for me, Palace are my local team.

If you lose the ball, you can go quiet - but he’s like ‘keep your head up’. He keeps pushing me, which helps me go again. I’ve got two leaders in Mamadou Sakho and James Tomkins. Having them next to me, I don’t feel afraid. I know they’ve got me in all situations. The back four, we’re a team together. Our aim is just to defend<br /><br /><b>[Palace travel to the Etihad Stadium to take on champions <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> on Saturday and the defender assured he will not be under pressure playing against <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s men]</b> It’s the same as other games, it makes no difference to me. I just play my game, put the effort in and work hard. I know I’ll learn something from <b>[playing versus <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> et al]</b>, to help me in the future. They’re smart players, we’ve got to be smart as well.

That has helped me a lot. When <b>[Zaha]</b> knew that I joined he just told me to play without fear. I have come here as a new signing he said ‘just play your game and do what I did last season’.

I was not focused on <b>[the speculation]</b> really. I do not focus on speculation, I just keep my head down and keep doing it on the pitch. It is easy for me to block out, the main thing is just playing football. Over the summer there was a lot to go through. I am here now and that is my main focus.

  <p><b>[Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s first match for Manchester United at Old Trafford went as well as he could have hoped]</b> It was a great result to beat Chelsea and I couldn’t have been much happier with how it went. I had been waiting for my first game at Old Trafford as a United player and it felt great to get it done and for it to go so well<br /><br />I wasn’t nervous, that’s not me, but I think a lot of eyes were on the new signings to see how we got on. I just tend to block out that stuff and focus on my own game but at the same time I was really excited about it. I got a lot of playing time in pre-season matches, which I needed because it helped me get to know the team. The games all went well and the players were all great with me from the first day onwards. They are all good lads and they helped me a lot when it came to settling in, but even so your first league game at Old Trafford is always going to be a landmark. Thankfully I was happy with my performance<br /><br /><b>[Wan-Bissaka thinks his side have everything they need to carry on winning, with the confidence of having beaten Chelsea providing an early season boost]</b> It will be a tough game, obviously, but there are a lot of positives from the Chelsea match we can take into it and there are a few areas where we can probably improve as well. What we have at United now is a good mix of young and experienced players and, speaking as one of the younger members of the squad, I think that’s important. We need people to set the standards to live up to, to set the tempo in games when we need it and the more experienced players in the dressing room are capable of doing that</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron-Wan Bissaka has set himself the target of putting in the most tackles for Manchester United each and every time he takes to the field]</b> I love tackles, man. I want to come out with the most tackles from each game; that’s my aim. I’m not really happy when I come out of a game without many tackles. At the same time, when I look back at it, it doesn’t mean anything negative, necessarily - it might mean that the winger’s not confident to keep on coming at me, for me to have the chance to tackle him. Wingers hate it. When I was a winger, I hated being tackled! When I attempted to beat a player and he slide-tackled me, I’d just think: ‘I don’t want to go down there again,’ and change the route, change my play, you know?<br /><br />I just like to play my game, play without fear, do what I’m capable of doing. Was I nervous before my debut? Nah. Me, I block it out. I know what nerves can do. Nerves keep you quiet. I’m just waiting for the game to start. I’m in the changing room, just waiting, thinking: ‘Can this game hurry up and start?’. The longer it takes, that’s when the nerves could come in, so I just want to get the waiting over and done with. I just want to get into the game, get the ball as much as possible. That stops the nerves. Then I like to get the tackles in, because I get a lot of confidence from tackles. The fans help as well, cheering them, so, after that, I want to get into the next one, then the next one. That helps</p>

We had a team bonding night, which was great. I’m not usually the type to interact, but that was definitely needed on my part. It was great to see a bit more of people away from football.

  <p><b>[After only making his <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> debut in 2018, it has been a whirlwind year for the 22-year-old - and he says the shift backwards from a right-wing position was key]</b> It has gone so quick, such a short space of time, but I’m happy with the chance I was given in that position. I don’t regret it. But the change hasn’t been massive to me. I always had that defensive mindset when I was an attacker. I used to love tackling as well. When I played right wing, left wingers would beat the right back and I’d be recovering and getting the tackles in. That’s where it really started. Because I’ve been in a winger’s position I know how to think at times. Where you see space down the line you take it. That’s what I like to give them. I don’t like anything going past me. Anything. And I like to keep it that way<br /><br /><b>[Up against City’s <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>, Wan-Bissaka shackled the England winger effectively throughout]</b> I knew it was going to be a long game. He is one of the best wingers in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and I knew I had to step up my game. It’s a good feeling, especially a player like him with his ability. It took real concentration because he can go in or out and has got pace. He’s probably faster than me so that was a game I had to really focus on and actually go hard at it. Was that the toughest battle of my career? Yes, but since my debut with Crystal Palace <b>[against Tottenham]</b> no winger is going to be easy. It’s going to be a challenge every game and they are only going to get harder with the better players you come up against</p>

You can see it in the clean sheets. That’s always the main aim: to get the clean sheet, then the team can get the win. I think it’s down to better communication. Sometimes the formation changes, so we’ve been getting used to both five at the back and four at the back, and the communication has helped.

He keeps going, just keeps on coming at you. Doesn’t matter if he doesn’t get past you in one challenge, he keeps coming back for more every time. That’s what I like. I’ve been happy with my performances in both league derbies and the results both times were just what we needed. The second one was just before lockdown, and that was an incredible afternoon. We were prepared for that game and we showed that as a team on the pitch. When <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> scored the second goal, the whole stadium just went off and you could see what it meant to everyone.</p>

  <p><b>[Wan-Bissaka names his toughest opponent in <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> training]</b> He’s just so unpredictable. When I first joined United and came up against him in training, he was doing things that I just really didn’t expect. I thought he’d go a certain way and he’d go the other way, or I thought he was about to do one thing and he did another, so he’s really tricky to play against. I enjoy that though; it’s been really good for my own development to test myself against him and the other attackers we have at the club<br /><br /><b>[Wan-Bissaka also revealed which United star of the past he most wished he could play alongside]</b> There have been a lot, but I’ll say <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a>. I always enjoyed watching him, particularly his technique and his composure on the ball, but his finishing was special. I always used to really like watching him playing for United and he’d be great to play alongside<br /><br />I only became a defender quite late in my own development, and it took a lot of patience. You have to keep working on yourself non-stop, you have to keep testing yourself, even if it doesn’t go right. It took time for me to get success as a defender so, if you stick with it, eventually it will go right. Push yourself, always have faith and believe in yourself</p>

  <p><b>[Aaron Wan-Bissaka has revealed the lengths his parents went to keep him on track as a young footballer]</b> I loved matches but I wasn’t really enjoying training. I came home from school one time and my friends were out at the green. It was time to leave for training and I just didn’t want to leave them. He ran and chased me until I went! It’s funny to look back at now. But I understand why he did it. I’ll never forget that<br /><br /><b>[The 22-year-old has donated £10,000 worth of medical equipment, including 20,000 protective gloves for health workers, to be sent to Kinshasa to help fight the virus in the central African nation]</b> I’m fortunate. There are those who aren’t able to protect themselves as well or have access to certain things during this crisis. It’s been great to give back. I know it’s not easy out there for them so it’s only right for me to help<br /><br /><b>[Wan-Bissaka has quickly settled in at Old Trafford]</b> We all get along. I didn’t expect it. I thought because I was new, not many would engage with me, but as soon as I stepped in, everyone wanted to help me, showed me around, had conversations with me. They made me comfortable. The manager’s intentions have been to build this squad together and you can see the difference after the New Year. Every game we were getting better</p>
