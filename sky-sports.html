  <p>[Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has been suspended by Sky Sports after a video emerged of him spitting at a Manchester United supporter] Sky takes this matter extremely seriously and strongly condemns Jamie’s actions, we have made that clear to him in person today and suspended him from his duties. It falls well below the standards we expect of our people.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Former Liverpool player Jamie Carragher has been suspended from his role as a pundit on Sky Sports until the end of the season] Following an internal review, Sky has suspended Jamie Carragher for the remainder of the football season. Jamie has taken full responsibility for what has happened and we will ensure he gets the help he needs to guarantee something like this never happens again. Before the start of the next season we will sit down with Jamie to discuss whether he is ready to return to his role.</p>
