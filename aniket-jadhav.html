<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Aniket Jadhav - The India U17 star-striker who is creating a buzz already]</b> I played at a good level and was happy to go to Munich. I played against some top players at the tournament in Munich. It was really good to be recognized by a legend like Paul Brietner back then.<br /><br />The team has undergone several changes since the change of coach. We are progressing and I’m happy with the work done. We are playing more as a team and do more work on the ball now. Certainly, our confidence levels have gone up<br /><br />When I gave the trial in Mumbai, I played as a left winger. The reason being that left-footed players in attack are a rarity and I knew that Indian team needed some players who have a good left foot. Thankfully, I caught the attention of Nicolai Sir and Abhishek Sir and got selected as a left winger<br /><br />We know we will give our best. This is the first time India will participate in the World Cup and it’s time to show that India also has some talent. We have to put on a show.<br /><br />I felt really good to see my posters at the Ganpati pandals. I was surprised and to be frank and was taken aback. When I was five years old or so, I remember visiting a Ganpati pandal where Lord Ganesha was dressed in a Brazil yellow jersey<br /><br />There was also a poster of one of the famous Brazilian players. Now to see my poster at the pandal, it was very good. One of my friends from Kolhapur shared the pictures with me and I am thankful to those who decided on this idea<br /><br />To be honest, India has a lot of talent. There are many players like me who deserve a chance and who haven’t yet got their opportunity. The more trials we will have, the more talent and newer players will get a chance to come to the top level</p>
