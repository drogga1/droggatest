  <p><b>[Real Sociedad are set to sign Spanish striker Sandro Ramirez on loan from Everton]</b> We are close, quite close, there is agreement with him and with Everton. Today they play a cup match and can come tomorrow if all goes well. If it is done, it will be done tomorrow.<br /><br />Surely no one else will come. Only Sandro and maybe a central player</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a> president Jokin Aperribay says he don’t know if <a href="willian.html">Willian</a> Jose will join <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> We haven’t had any conversation with anyone. I don’t know what will happen. I have read about it, but it is true that the market has closed. I can’t comment much. <a href="willian.html">Willian</a> Jose is a player who has attracted interest from several teams in the winter <b>[transfer window]</b> and we all know that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are looking for a striker. I don’t know if they’ll call us, but they haven’t done it yet. He is an important player for us and we would definitely miss him. We have many games left and we need everyone</p>

  <p><b>[Jokin Aperribay believes <a href="martin-odegaard.html">Martin Odegaard</a> will stay at the club rather than returning to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> ahead of next season]</b> I think Odegaard is going to stay at Real. It is what I believe and the hope we have. When you stay at Real, if you stay, you have to be convinced, like when he came last year. Convinced that it is the best option for next season. The decision is up to him and I think he will stay<br /><br /><b>[<a href="martin-odegaard.html">Martin Odegaard</a> helped Sociedad reach the Copa del Rey final, in which they are due to face Basque rivals Athletic Club, but Aperribay is unclear when the decider could be held]</b> It is not easy to organise a final in a short time. I see that as impossible. We have no knowledge of any date. It is not easy to imagine that scenario now - that of a final with an audience before the end of the season</p>
