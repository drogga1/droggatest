For our owners to have faith in Jurgen from the start, giving him a six-year deal. That helps with the trust, to build. Big compliment for our team, because without success the individual prizes will never come. Then of course a big compliment for Jurgen himself. I’m really proud. It says a lot. He is not only the face of the team, he’s the face of the club and not many foreign managers in a different country made the impact he has made. An example I always say is that <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> had an impact in that it’s not only about now, but about the future also.

  <p><b>[Pep Lijnders has talked up the importance of <a href="naby-keita.html">Naby Keita</a> and <a href="alex-oxlade-chamberlain.html">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> after their performances against Genk in the Champions League last week]</b> In the start of the season, we had not as many games and we could create a real stability around the team and many times keep, not the same XI, but the same core group. You saw already what it did for Ox, by playing game <b>[by]</b> game, in how he contributed in Genk. That’s why it’s really important. As I’ve said before, from the bench we want players who can come in and really make an impact and so far we’ve had that. We want to keep that. By making a bigger impact in games, they need rhythm, they need consistency and this is a perfect moment again to change a few things<br /><br /><b>[Asked about <a href="alex-oxlade-chamberlain.html">Oxlade-Chamberlain</a>’s long journey back from injury]</b> Ox, of course, is a very sad story with the injury. He was very important for us just before <b>[it happened]</b>, as everybody knows. We want to give him time and we know it will come. If he keeps his aggression offensively and defensively, <b>[we know]</b> how he can play - that real offensive aggression - and then everything will come, but that needs time after an injury like that. We’ve seen glimpses already and we’ve seen really good phases and for him and - he said it himself - he wants to do it now for 95 minutes and two times 95 minutes. That will be the next step, but he’s very important for us because he gives us a completely different dynamic to create.<br /><br />Naby was unlucky with his injury this season. A first year at a club like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> with a new style in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, we all know that takes time, but we can all see what a magnificent player he is and what he can do to our team. Especially in how he brings the ball into the final third and how he disorganises opposition. It is important for both, like every single player, to stay fit and gain regularity and gain consistency</p>

  <p><b>[Pep Lijnders says A lack of discipline at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> could be to blame for <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a>’s outburst towards fans at the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> on Sunday]</b> In life in general, in the football club, good relationships are best to evolve a club or to evolve a team. As we say at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, it’s about the three things, the ‘holy trinity’ we call it. It’s the fans, the manager and the squad. These three have to be really connected, they have to have one idea, they have to understand each other. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Football Club knows much better than me how to deal with this, but if you have Jordan <b>[Henderson]</b> and <a href="james-milner.html">James Milner</a> as your captains, you don’t have to discipline others.<br /><br />If you have <a href="james-milner.html">Millie</a> (Milner), Henderson, <a href="adam-lallana.html">Adam Lallana</a>, <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Georginio Wijnaldum</a>, <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>, <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Roberto Firmino</a>, <b>[they are]</b> all examples in different ways. Players who never whine, never complain, never make excuses. In the hardest moments they never give up, and they never give up our ways, and they always put the team above themselves. For a young player, it’s hard to have a better environment to grow and develop. For me, that makes us, or any other team, from a good team to a top team, a good team to a successful team</p>

  <p><b>[Lijnders, though, would prefer to see <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a> continue to make an impact at both ends of the field]</b> He plays as a playmaker on the right. I said already a few times I’m not sure how the game will evolve, the only thing I know is they close the centre better and better, and defensive stability is becoming better in teams, with five at the back or with four at the back, they defend the centre of the pitch much better. So the wings become more interesting and become more important, to have a good positional play there and a good offensive idea there. Trent is one who gives us that from that position, he plays like a central midfielder there, how he puts passes. Of course, from the centre of the pitch you can reach many more positions. He has that in him, he did that before. But in this moment, why would you think about it if you have a midfield like that and Trent as a full-back like that? But, of course, he can do that<br /><br />I don’t like him…I love him! A Ferrari without fuel is nothing. But he has so much fuel, so much energy and will power to develop and make his game better, and to make our game better. I saw that when he was 15 and 16, but to see it still in a player - in the eyes and in training - I think it’s the reason why he takes the game further and further and sets a new benchmark for an offensive full-back. It’s good, it’s important for the club and for the fans. For us as a coaching staff, it’s important as well because it’s always nice to see players, if we give them the opportunity, they take them and take it to the next level. He’s a good example of how the process should work</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> assistant Lijnders reveals the key to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a>’s success]</b> The passion and ambition of these players is from another planet. Their self-confidence, their self-criticism, that is what makes us consistent. These boys have the ability to make even a simple rondo competitive. People talk about going game to game - no, we commit session to session. Small things make big things happen. You have to focus on doing the small things right constantly. The passion and ambition I see, especially on the rainy and windy days here, that for me is what separates us from the others<br /><br /><b>[Victory in the Champions League in Madrid last June has underpinned their recent run]</b> Winning something big puts more conviction, more trust into everything; subconsciously you feel stronger. There’s a real hunger to fight for more prizes. But for me it’s about the journey and how the team developed. The trust I got from keeping things simple, never giving up on our way, believing in training and video meetings to improve, clear messages with a lot of conviction from Jurgen or myself, repeating that process over and over again.<br /><br />Trusting the players to always look at our best games and think about what steps won us those games. Was it our full-backs being constantly ready to jump? Was it the centre-backs coming in front of offensive players rather than stepping back? Was it our midfielders being really together and always connected rather than just searching for it? It’s about doing it our way again, becoming better and searching for perfection. We know it doesn’t exist but you still have to search for it</p>

He’s inspirational and motivational. He still surprises me every day with something he says. His brain works differently to a lot of other brains! He sees through situations and processes. There is a saying that people don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care. And I think everyone who works with Jurgen has the feeling he really cares about you and your development. There is no ego, he purely searches for the right thing to do<br /><br />When Jurgen speaks to the players, he speaks from the heart and it goes directly into the hearts of the players. He has this remarkable capacity to touch people with the words he selects. That’s not easy, especially with this level of players. I find that intriguing, how it’s possible, the convincing way he has and that ability to touch people. You are dealing with a lot of egos in football but in our club, it looks like there are no egos.<br /><br />Jurgen has created an environment where everyone has bought into it. He solves problems before they arise. He has this capacity of making sure that certain things won’t happen because he speaks about them. The level of respect the players have for him is huge.<br /><br />No written word, no spoken plea, can teach our team what they should be, nor all the books on the shelves, it’s what the coach is himself. Do you know what I mean? The character of the coach becomes the character of the team. You can see it throughout the club. That’s the power of Jurgen’s personality</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s ‘perfect’ midfielder <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Wijnaldum</a> would be near impossible to replace]</b> I would say that Gini and Bobby <b>[<a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a>]</b> represent ‘our way’ in the best way possible. Because we want players who are responsible for everything. Gini is a player who can drop and create three at the back for a short period of time, bring the ball out, and at the same time turn in midfield and find somebody straight away in between the lines. And then he can pass and move into the last line or even over the last line. He can arrive in scoring areas, he can head, he can score<br /><br />He’s also still learning. Football is a game where you never stop learning and becoming a better player. I think he represents what we want in a player, really well</p>

The departments, how they evolved over the last four or five years, they all search for perfection knowing that perfection doesn’t exist. See how our pitches are prepared each day by our ground staff <b>[…]</b> these things make us consistent. Each department is searching for and has the ambition and passion. I believe that only comes first from your leader and second, that it’s trust and everybody wants to give one per cent more, so the team is better prepared for the next game. I think we made big, big steps in this. A big compliment for each department<br /><br />He is very intelligent. His brain works differently to many others, that’s for sure. Each day he surprises me - and we worked how long together? Four-and-a-half or five years. He changes perception in five minutes. We really feel that we are a team. We prepare together, we plan together, we act together, we coach together. It’s what I say constantly: three brains can do much more than one brain, if the three brains think in a common way and have the same messages and same passion and same dedication. That’s the secret if you are working with a team, that everybody wants the same and understands the way we want to play and the way we want to develop on the training pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Pep Lijnders says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have to earn everything all over again]</b> The period with the small groups was to prepare our boys for a ‘normal’ training week; from the first day, we tried to give them a mental landscape. I never thought you could do so much with only four players, we made it as specific possible. But to be honest, it was all about energy, energy and energy again, because I really think in the end energy wins from each tactical idea. Combining both you become unstoppable! It’s great to have them all back, with their jokes, their attitude and their character. This is one of the most special groups of players we will ever work with. But we will have to prove ourselves again and earn everything again. If we all stay humble, that’s the first step. If we all stay hungry and passionate for the ball, it will be step two till step 20<br /><br />We have intense sessions <b>[…]</b> our identity is intensity! Our identity is unpredictability. It’s about dedicated specific team training. We control the timings. This is so, so important. All the training days are connected. The relationship between the training days makes it so that we can play in our way, a quality game of football and at the same time we reduce the injury risk. We train each day in the highest intensity, in the highest concentration and with full freedom to attack. It’s how Einstein said it: logic gets you from A to B, imagination will get you everywhere. That’s hopefully where we stay different. A quality game will stimulate this aspect and that creates development. If we showed one thing in the last seasons, it is that we always made the next step. Let’s try again</p>
