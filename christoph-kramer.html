  <p><b>[Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder Christoph Kramer has reiterated his feelings on playing matches without fans]</b> They’re sh*t. Even when you watch them on TV. These days, though, it would be stupid not to play at all. That’s why ghost games are welcome – they’re the only solution. Of course, it doesn’t feel like a real game, but if there’s one thing we have learned recently it’s that we have to enjoy the little things<br /><br />Footballers are no different to anyone else who misses their job. Two months ago it would be unthinkable that you missed going out and going to work. We appreciate those things now and I think that’s very, very nice. As a footballer, sometimes you don’t want to do positional exercises in Training every day – but now we just look forward to it. Hopefully we’ll learn after the coronavirus crisis is over that normal life is actually beautiful<br /><br /><b>[Germany will always be his preferred destination]</b> I love travelling and immersing myself in other cultures. But there is no better feeling than coming home. I’m satisfied – that’s something very underestimated and precious</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder Christoph Kramer has revealed how he had to force himself to ask <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> for his jersey after a Champions League clash as they both waited for a doping test]</b> I asked <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> about his jersey during a doping test, that was after a Champions League game with Leverkusen against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I was sitting next to him and had to force myself to ask him for his jersey at that moment, but then he just nodded and took it off. I said ‘thank you’, he said ‘please’ - that was the jersey exchange with Messi<br /><br />I didn’t even notice that in the game. Only after, when it was extensively reported in the media and made waves. I think that with such important issues, the popularity of a single player - but also of football - is put to good use. If statutes and rules were violated, I could understand <b>[the <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a> investigating]</b>, but the action by Marcus and the message on the shirt by <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> are not politically questionable statements, they are on issues that currently affect the whole world. In our Borussia Park, we also show our attitude against racism with a large banner under the stadium roof. But the control committee of the <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a> has now also declared that there will be no proceedings regarding the statements of solidarity and anti-racisms</p>
