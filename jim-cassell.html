<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Manchester City’s Phil Foden has been likened to Barcelona star Lionel Messi]</b> Philip was a unique talent at six. He was a natural, Messi-like the way he covered the ground. He had <b>[a low centre of]</b> gravity, in and out of things. I look at him now and think, ‘Come on Philip’. We are just waiting for the next growth thing. After that, he will fly. City haven’t seen a fraction yet of what he has. Once he grows again and goes on a run he will be going past three or four players with the ball. Just like he did as a kid, just like Messi. He will be in an England squad in 18 months for certain.<br /><br /><b>[Cassell is now working outside of mainstream football having been eased out of the City set-up]</b> I loved it there and will never criticise them. I have no axe to grind. That club did more for me than I ever did for them and someone like Philip Foden couldn’t be at a better place. I hear stories about how good the food is at academies and how good the facilities are. You know what I want to talk about? How good our players were. I didn’t want money, I just wanted people to think I was good at my job. People ask me what I did for a living and I say I created millionaires. Sadly I’m not one!</p>
