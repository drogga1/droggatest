We are all professional here. Everyone has played with transfer problems. He is not the first and will not be the last. We are not busy with his transfer. He knows what to do. He has to work for a few more days and then he also has a vacation. Then he has enough time to arrange everything. If the transfer comes, it won’t be in the next four or five days. Why would he do that? Why would he take that risk? Now everyone is watching him.<br /><br /><b>[Opening up on his own switch from Wolfsburg to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in 2015]</b> We worked on it for months, but I waited until I was free to go there.

He is now the story, so he will wait a while<br /><br /><b>[De Bruyne does not necessarily see the Hazard’s chances of winning the individual accolade improving should he leave Stamford Bridge]</b> I do not know if he will be a leader <b>[at Madrid]</b> immediately. There are other leaders there already, so he will not immediately become a captain. His Ballon d’Or hopes remain the same.

  <p><b>[Kevin De Bruyne is confident the fitness problems that plagued him last season are in the past]</b> I’m fine. What happened last year happens to everybody. I have been a professional for 11 years now and had one season where I had some injuries. But by the end of the year I still played 32 games while a lot of players only do that every year. I just get on with it. Now I feel good. I’m happy I could play a whole pre-season. I’m doing well.<br /><br />It’s always a tough ask because you travel a lot and you need to do a lot of commercial activity and in another sense you need to prepare yourself physically. August is a little bit quieter. It starts really in September for us, when all the European games come. Obviously next week is a game when we can win a trophy, so we want to be ready to play a good game against Liverpool<br /><br /><b>[<a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> said that Yokohama had ‘incredible quality’ and De Bruyne praised the J-League club too]</b> It was a really good game. I was very impressed with how Yokohama played. They gave us a good game and I’m happy with the way we performed.

  <p><b>[Kevin De Bruyne says having a break from the game will allow him to return to the Premier League champions mentally refreshed and free from the injury problems that blighted his 2018-19 season]</b> I ran the first week after national team and then I did nothing for three weeks. I just wanted to be away. I run a lot with the kids anyway, so I burn a lot of energy, but I just wanted to be away from football. I have been playing for two years straight. I just wanted to enjoy myself a little bit. I did some trips with family and friends. I knew I had enough time to prepare myself for the season, so that’s what I decided to do<br /><br /><b>[De Bruyne’s goals and assists have made him virtually undroppable for <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>]</b> Physically you can be always okay but I think it’s more mentally. It’s tough to go two straight years for everybody and not have a proper break. That is what happened the last two years.<br /><br /><b>[De Bruyne scored and assisted in the final tour game, a 3-1 win over J-League side Yokohama F Marinos, and he believes providing team-mates with a chance to score is the key to his game]</b> It is my job. My main objective is to put my team-mates in the position where they are able to score a goal. It went well a couple of times</p>

I think the way that we did transfers the last years add up. You see a lot of young talent coming in willing to play our style. I think that’s what they’re looking for and he’s a perfect fit for us<br /><br /><b>[He won all of his aerial duels against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and gained possession nine times - again the highest figure in that metric]</b> I think he’s the perfect <b>[defensive midfielder]</b> for the way we want to play.

A lot of people talk about that but I just don’t think I played the best game. It’s one of those games, August, for me, I’m just trying to find a rhythm and then September is easier. I think the first two games we played better, yesterday was more tough, but I think it’s normal when you play against a team that plays 5-4-1, it makes it more tougher, you need to be more patient but in the end you need to win games in different manners and I think that’s what we did<br /><br />It’s always nice to have something like that in the books. It doesn’t really matter but maybe in 20 years back I can look back and say I accomplished something. This one was very lucky but they all count. It makes me happy because I tried to find my team-mates and if they score I get the assist, so it’s like a co-operation, I try to provide them and they score it!<br /><br /><b>[Kompany is trying to implement a new playing style inspired by three seasons working under <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>, and compatriot De Bruyne has backed him to be a success long-term]</b> I spoke with him a few times, he’s enjoying it. The games that I saw I think they’re playing really well, they’re missing a striker for the moment but I think he had a very tough job. I think he had like 50 players at the beginning of the season and had to let 25 players go, and he gained 10 players, it’s nearly impossible. And then put another philosophy into it, it’s very difficult. Obviously he didn’t start well in terms of points but I can understand it a little bit because he is trying to play a style that we did and obviously we had growing pains, so I can understand that. Football is a business where you get points but I think he will get time. In Belgium only one is relegated so I don’t think he needs to worry about that! If he gets the time that will be nice<br /><br /><b>[De Bruyne insists it will take time for Kompany to turn things around]</b> He’s been a manager for like two months, so what do you expect? To go there and win every game? It’s not like this in football. I think there’s a lot of people who want him to fail, because to do this job, to be player and a manager, some people don’t like it but I know Vinny pretty well and he probably won’t care what people say about it.</p>

I really got to know Raheem, and I recognized what a smart and genuine person he is. He couldn’t be more different from what the tabloids were saying. This is the real truth: Raheem is one of the nicest, most humble guys I’ve met in football</p>

  <p><b>[De Bruyne recommends voiding <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> season amid injury fears following coronavirus disruption]</b> I have no idea when we will be playing again. We haven’t played for six weeks. Normally you’d need a preparation of three to four weeks. If we restart immediately then everybody will be injured after a few games. I know that there’s lots of money involved. But I think that waiting so long to make a decision can cause issues next season. There won’t be a long summer break and you can just postpone everything. I would feel sad if the season is stopped after such a good year, but if it avoids issues for next season, it must be done<br /><br /><b>[De Bruyne has also said he will extend his career by an extra two years before hanging up his boots]</b> I told my wife I’m going to play a little longer. After this lockdown, I cannot stay at home. I told her I’m going to take two years more. It’s time to play football again. I miss it and it’s difficult. But we are not important, football is not important. People love football, but you need to stay safe</p>

That’s my main focus<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he was close to winning the award]</b> Probably not too far. But who am I to decide that? I just try to be the best I can be.

  <p><b>[De Bruyne reveals he may have suffered from coronavirus]</b> At the beginning of the lockdown my family was sick for eight or nine days. It started with my little boy, then my older boy and then my wife, but I don’t know if we had <b>[coronavirus]</b> or not. Luckily we are out of it and the last two or three weeks has been really good and we are finding a routine and everything so we are fine<br /><br />Well, the first two weeks was a little bit weird because I don’t know what’s going on. Then I managed to get a treadmill. I was swimming a little bit because I’m lucky to have a pool downstairs. I was doing a couple of lengths but now mostly I’m doing a run and I would say every other day I would choose between swimming and doing some exercise, so I’m keeping fairly good for what we can on our own, I guess<br /><br /><b>[He also revealed <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> were doing their bit to help guide the players in their fitness regimes]</b> They send us like a fairly big programme. I think at the beginning of lockdown some of the gym physios went to the club and made videos of what we can do, different types of exercises. But there’s a few things that I like to do, obviously it’s more the running and the swimming exercise. I do a little bit in-between but I’m not one for sitting like an hour or two hours in a gym. I get bored of doing stuff on my own anyway so I prefer to do running, where I keep busy for myself and listen to some podcasts and all that stuff</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> star De Bruyne believes financial concerns will force <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> to finish season]</b> My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks. The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something. Everything will be finished without fans I think. That is not really interesting for anyone, but this season will be finished. The financial aspect is far too important in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems<br /><br />You are in a rhythm and you have to stop suddenly. When the league resumes, I don’t really see this as an extension of the season. This feels more like the start of a new season.

It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too. Whatever comes, comes. But it’s not that I’ve tried to leave City in these past five years. I have also remained calm over previous transfers. I have never had any problems and have always waited for my moment. With respect, because I think you get most of it back.

I don’t know, I can understand sometimes he explains so much to some people when we have a meeting. In football, you have tactics, but it’s not like the NFL. I think there’s players when they come in and they have a few meetings and he explains so much in the beginning. Like football, you don’t think so much; you just do it. You know a few things that you need to do but then in the beginning, people are just wondering, ‘Oh, my head is blown off’.<br /><br />I think first of all is tactical. I think player relations, sometimes it’s difficult because you have 25 players, and to have a personal relationship with everybody is difficult. On one hand, I think also because you’re the boss there’s always going to be a certain distance. Maybe in 10-15 years when I’m done, you’re gonna have a different relationship. But for us, it’s impossible to have like a real close relationship with a coach because otherwise you’re going to ask 24 other people who are saying, ‘Oh yeah, you only play because, because of the coach,’ and all that stuff, so that that’s not possible</p>
