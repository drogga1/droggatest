  <p><b>[Kevin De Bruyne considers Manchester City team-mate Fernandinho to be one of the best players he has ever worked with]</b> I think Ferna’s one of the best holding midfielders I’ve ever played with and its worth remembering that he’s 30 years-old - incredible that he has so much energy - you don’t see that everywhere in players who are 30 so we are very lucky to have him.<br /><br />Obviously we’ve missed him. He’s been an important player throughout his time at City and he plays a pivotal role for us in midfield and helps keep everything organised - plus he’s also very good on the ball. Now he’s served his ban and is available for us again so it’s a big boost for the team because he’s missed seven games this season through suspension<br /><br />If you get a red card in England you’re banned for three or sometimes four games, which is unbelievable, but there’s not much you can do about it. I think one game is enough but those are the rules, I suppose</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin De Bruyne has hinted that he will be signing a new contract at Manchester City]</b> I made the right decision in coming to City and my family feels the same, so everything is good. The team is going in the right direction and that is also important. I always say in football that a lot of things can happen very quickly but I’m very happy here and the people at the club know that. I’ve no feeling to go anywhere else and I enjoy being part of the project here and playing the kind of football we are playing.<br /><br /><b>[On that challenge, with Roberto Martinez’s side set to face England in the group stage]</b> I feel good and it makes a difference having a good break before the season starts. I don’t ever really remember having a good break before a new season. This time, I had four weeks, which was massive for me. That helps you feel re-energised. You don’t get a lot of downtime as a footballer and before this season, I’d only been having two weeks in the summer to rest, so that was good</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne is tired of comparisons to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> It is impossible to compare me with them. Our positions are completely different. They are much higher on the pitch and score ten times more than me. If I make 10 in a season, they score 100. But then I have other tasks on the pitch<br /><br />I do not feel really targeted by the opponents. Tackles are part of football. I do not cry when I’m hit. I bite my teeth and I continue, with or without pain. Football is simply a contact sport</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin De Bruyne has revealed that he voted for Mohamed Salah to become PFA Player of the Year!]</b> I voted for Salah. He deserves it. If it’s no-one from our team, I think he deserves it. I don’t look at what happened before, I wouldn’t know how to choose anybody else, outside of Salah, if it’s not our team.<br /><br /><b>[De Bruyne also reserved special praise for Tottenham’s Harry Kane and his City team-mate, David Silva]</b> I’m fair. If he wins, he wins. I think he’s up there with Kane, me, and Silva, they’re the four best players of this year, constantly. I’m honest about voting. I vote for him if he deserves it. If other people don’t do it, I don’t mind</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin De Bruyne admits to having endured a distant relationship with Jose Mourinho during a forgettable stint at Chelsea]</b> I would say, distant. I’m not really somebody who speaks a lot with coaches. I think if the coach wants to speak with you, then you just do it. He’s the boss, you can be good with each other but there’s still a distance between a coach and a player. I only spoke with him twice, that’s when I wanted to leave to Dortmund at the beginning of the summer and the second meeting I just said: ‘For me it’s better to go, I want to play football’.<br /><br /><b>[On the consistency he has found in his game]</b> I feel very happy about it. My feeling is that I’ve constantly been playing good. In my feeling, this year there’s not been a lot of games where I’ve been a little bit down. It’s always been a seven out of 10 or sometimes a little bit better. It helps when you win that many games with a team and you only lose one</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin De Bruyne is expecting Premier League champions Manchester City to dip back into the transfer market this summer]</b> Of course it’s important for the club to add new players and to keep getting stronger. That’s true for all teams. We have a great group of players right now and with a few additions here and there hopefully that will take us on to another level. Competition will be even tougher next season, not only in the Premier League but in the Champions League and cup competitions. If we want to keep achieving, I think competition for places is a good thing and only makes you try to improve.<br /><br />Of course, the club has planned for this <b>[by signing young players]</b> and we want to make that <b>[sustained success]</b> happen now. It’s no coincidence the type of players brought in over the last year or two have all been of a similar age and we’ll look to build as a group together. The feeling amongst the squad is great. We’ve enjoyed the season a lot but there’s work to do if we want to achieve more in the future. That can be the trickiest thing in football, to not only win but keep winning. Having such a young squad will hopefully help us to achieve that<br /><br />That’s the next step for us. We’ve played some great games in the Champions League and we’ve not been too far away. Maybe we haven’t gone as far as we would have liked, but there have been performances along the way that show we could do something special. It’s great to play at the highest level and success doesn’t come easy when you’re playing against teams who’ve been around it for so many years. But we improved a little on last season and we’ll look to do the same again next year. It’s what we all want</p>

That’s why I asked him in a friendly way: please let me go! At the beginning Mourinho opposed a transfer. He wanted me to fight for my place. But I told him I had a feeling I would never get a fair chance. That’s when the club started looking at a transfer too.</p>

  <p><b>[De Bruyne pushing for full fitness as Man City embark on crucial run]</b> That’s why you invest in the team and put all that money in to have a full squad. The investment is the beginning. They did really smartly by buying young players who can get better. We’ve a squad of 21 or 22 players and it doesn’t matter who plays - they have regular games in the team. We are fully there for the four trophies. You know you are going to get injuries, but you hope to keep them as few as possible. If you want to try to win the lot, you need players to do that.<br /><br /><b>[The likes of Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez have stood up when required for Guardiola this season]</b> They did brilliantly without me. But I’m sure they’ll be happy that I’m back. It’s just how it is. They have had to manage with the players who are there and unfortunately sometimes players are out. The guys did brilliantly and now I’ll try to be at my top level to help them out<br /><br /><b>[De Bruyne played around 20 minutes in the weekend victory over Everton]</b> I just need some game time. I came in and I just ran for 20 minutes. I’m not looking to play a good game, just run without stopping. That gives me a good boost physically and lets me get my lungs open for the next game. We’ll see, it’s difficult to say, I’ve not been out that amount of time before. I’ll work hard to get back as soon as possible but I don’t put pressure on myself<br /><br /><b>[Guardiola claimed that De Bruyne was exhausted]</b> I’m not sure I agree with that. I played the most of anyone last year - in the whole world. And I played the World Cup without a problem. I think the most important thing is having a summer break - if you have that you can feel OK but there is always a time in someone’s career where you feel a bit less. But I felt all right, it was just a shame that when I came back after one week I was out for two-and-a-half months. I was happy to come back and worked really hard but after three games it happened again. So I think it’s part of your career and in the end it’s just the way it is<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he could have taken a longer break after Belgium’s run to the semi-finals of the World Cup]</b> No - it was not possible. I wasn’t exhausted. I think in general people need a good summer break, sometimes we play for 11-and-a-half months at a time and there is not enough time to rest. I had a rest of about three weeks - after 12 months of playing. Is that short? Probably, yes. But I felt OK to come back. It’s not a lot to say, I came back and trained and was out after one week - it’s just the way it goes. There’s nothing I can do - it was two accidents. I’m happy with my body because I know I have no problems with muscles. They were both just accidents, the second time also. I felt my knee and it pops, so you just work hard and try to be back as soon as possible.<br /><br />There’s always many games from September onwards - unless you get out of some cups. It’s two games a week. that doesn’t really change. It’s a busy period because everyone plays. Then, after Christmas, it’s just people who are playing Europe. At the moment it’s just busy for everyone<br /><br />It’s just the same, we do what we always do. We’ve won the most of the games like we did last year and we are there with the top teams. The others have been better than last year so that’s why it’s closer</p>

He made some great saves - he’s got veins of ice! He did what he had to do, but in the end I think it’s just a beautiful moment for him.<br /><br />It’s difficult to start when you’re injured for five months. But it felt good, you know? I played 70 minutes, and to do that after being out for so long is a really good sign for me personally. I feel a little bit stiff, but I’m happy to contribute again. And, obviously, we want to win titles - so we are in the semi-final, we know it’s two more games, and we can battle for another trophy again. That’s our goal</p>

But sometimes my body just says ‘no’ and I have to take that in my stride. I don’t feel anything in my knee now, but we play so many games sometimes I feel better and sometimes a little bit less. You just feel that in the game and it’s normal.<br /><br />I didn’t have a pre-season and I am trying to physically get to the level of last year. I always play the same style.

  <p><b>[Manchester City playmaker Kevin De Bruyne believes that the Premier League champions are not on the same level that they were last year]</b> This year it is a little more difficult because teams are more compact, and their plans are probably better than they were last year. Last year we would have won or drawn these games with late winners, but we were not able to do that this year. That’s just the way it is, the level is so high from every team that the margin of error is so small. If it was last season with the points we have now, we would be first, but somebody is better than us at the moment, so you have to say congratulations. We know how hard it is. We try to do our best but sometimes the best is not enough, and you have to take it. If Liverpool win the title with 98 points, congratulations, they will have done well. But there is still a lot of things to fight for. People may be down but there is still the FA Cup, League Cup, Champions League, plus we are still fighting in the league - that’s an amazing position to have at the beginning of February.<br /><br />I think Liverpool will be under some pressure because they have not won it for that amount of time <b>[29 years]</b>. But we have pressure because we were the champions last year and everybody expects us to be one of the title challengers. I’m not sure who has more pressure, but there is pressure on both teams. I don’t think knowing how to win the Premier League is an advantage, last season most of us didn’t know how to win a league but sometimes that makes you hungrier if you haven’t won it. We are trying to repeat what we did last year and try to win as many games as we can. We will see where we are in two months, if the gap is close it will be a tight race and if it’s not, it’s not.</p>

We’ve been busy and we’re doing well! Last year, the standard was so high and it had never been done before. To repeat that would be almost impossible - we only lost 14 points in 38 games, which was unbelievable. Liverpool are probably at the same place as we were last year. We are a little below that but if we win every game from now on, we will have 98 points, which would also have been a record last year. That says enough about how we’re doing but obviously, when another team does better than you, you look a little bit worse. When the title race is closer, big games come to the front. Last year, if you won most of the ‘lower’ games - so to speak - you had won it. This season, the level and standard is so high of every team. It’s more tight so the games against the direct opponents will make the difference.</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin De Bruyne has warned Manchester City’s Carabao Cup final opponents Chelsea]</b> We want to win everything. We want all four titles. It is nearly impossible to do that, but that is our aim. We want to set new standards. We want to win every game and see where we end up. But the closer you get to finals and the end game, then you want to win the titles.<br /><br />In the bad moments, we have shown that this team is mentally and physically strong enough to come back from anything. Now we are in the most important part of the ­season, we are happy to be competing on all four fronts because it takes a good team to get to where we are. We are trying to be ­relentless. In games where we are winning 2-0 or 3-0, we want to still score one, two or three more goals. We want to score as many goals as possible. It makes it more fun for everyone because we all look at our statistics and if you have chipped in then it gives you a good feeling. For 99 per cent of the time we are favourites to win every game we play. But that’s why we don’t talk about what we want to win - because at the end of the day we want to win everything<br /><br />I didn’t like it. I don’t like to sit ­outside. I can’t stand it. When you’re on the field you’re in control. You ­always feel like you can do something. Sitting on the sidelines makes you feel like a fan. You’re not used to it. You want to be part of the team. But I was injured. There was nothing I could do. I had to just do whatever I needed to do to get myself as fit as possible. I worked hard and I am happy to be back playing football again</p>

We are a little bit below points-wise what we did last year, but still the points we have now - 71 I think - its unbelievable, So we just try to keep going and in the end we will see how much we need</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne has written about his experiences with Jose Mourinho at Chelsea]</b> When I arrived for preseason <b>[at Chelsea]</b>, the vibe was good. I started two of the first four games of the season, and thought I played OK. Not brilliant but pretty good. After the fourth game, that was it. I was on the bench and I never really got a chance again. I didn’t get an explanation. I was just out of favour for some reason.<br /><br />Jose called me into his office in December, and it was probably the second big life-chaging moment for me. He had some papers in front of him, and he said, ‘One assist. Zero goals. Ten recoveries’. It took me a minute to realise what he was doing. Then he started reading the stats of the other attacking forwards - Willian, Oscar, Mata, Schurrle. And it’s like - five goals, 10 assists, whatever<br /><br />José was just kind of waiting for me to say something, and finally I said, ‘But … some of these guys have played 15, 20 games. I’ve only played three. So it’s going to be different, no?’. It was so strange. We had a bit of a conversation about me going back out on loan. And Mata was also out of favour at the time, so José said, ‘Well, you know, if Mata leaves, then you will be the fifth choice instead of sixth<br /><br />I was completely honest. I said, ‘I feel like the club doesn’t really want me here. I want to play football. I’d rather you sell me’. I think José was a bit disappointed, but to be fair to him, I think he also understood that I absolutely needed to play. So the club ended up selling me, and there was no big problem at all. Chelsea got more than double the price they paid for me, and I got into a much better situation at Wolfsburg</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin De Bruyne was no different to any Manchester City fan in the final weeks of the season]</b> I hate watching my team. I just can’t, especially at the end of the season when there’s so much at stake. I just think you’re not in control. You know, when you’re on the field, you’re in control. If you lose, you lose, but you know what you can do. On the sidelines, you can’t do anything. You feel more like a fan. Obviously I watched all the games, but it’s not something I really enjoy<br /><br />Last year was way better for me. It feels different, but I still felt important. It’s more difficult but when I’ve played I’ve done a really good job. March and April were really important, and I helped the team when they needed me. Last year was unbelievable: I played every game<br /><br />I’m fine. For me, this season, mentally, has been over since the Tottenham game. It’s good to be back with the team for the prizes, the Brighton game and now the final. But in other ways it was just a bad start, being unlucky with the two knee injuries<br /><br />It’s more about being there mentally. If somebody needs you or asks you for advice, you just make sure they are sharp. On the field you can’t do anything, but before the game you can say something if you need to. I’ve tried to do that a couple of times, but mostly they’re fine. I wouldn’t have done that four or five years ago. I’m an older player now and I take more responsibility for myself and the team. I think when you’re younger you’re just focused on doing your thing, but now, the older you get, you take more responsibility and more care with what is happening to the others.<br /><br /><b>[Jurgen Klopp’s side recorded 97 points]</b> No. It’s a remarkable effort, but it means that we were just better than them in the end. I don’t feel sorry for them, because I don’t think they’d feel sorry for us. I don’t think anybody felt sorry about the way we went out of the Champions League. You take it. I know how they feel, because you’re going to feel disappointed. We’d feel the same if it happened to us. But we’re still competitors. We want to win as much as they do, but I can understand the feelings they have.<br /><br />It’s the general view of athletes. You feel compassionate with other teams, but in the end the most important thing is, if you play an individual sport, it’s yourself, and when it’s your team, it’s your team. It’s been a great battle. But to feel ‘sorry’ for them is maybe going a little too far<br /><br />I don’t know. Pep rarely says it up front. Except maybe three or four games out of the 60 it’s always the meeting before the game. I’m fine <b>[with that]</b>. Maybe sometimes he doesn’t even know until a few minutes before - I can believe that. I’ve no idea where we’re going with the gaffer sometimes! That’s good<br /><br />It’s not like he speaks about it. It’s hard because some players - like Nico - played everything, even when he was injured. This year you play less. You feel bad for somebody really because there isn’t really a reason why they don’t play, it’s just that he chooses somebody else. You have to accept it as a player and I’ve had to do that for different reasons too. It’s not always nice because you come into a season thinking it’ll be the same as last year. Everybody knows what the goal is. You can be angry and disappointed about it but when you come on the pitch you have to show your worth. Everybody has done that. They all perform. That’s why we’ve gone so far<br /><br /><b>[Guardiola is concerned he cannot play enough]</b> We’ve spoken about it a few times but he says the main thing is he wants to play as much as possible. It’s not easy at our club with the players we have. The last six weeks have helped his case. But I don’t know. I don’t think you can replace Vinny. I’m hoping that he stays for another year. I can understand his situation but when I see him play he’s maintaining the level. For me, if you can play at the highest level as possible then I want to stay. But I can’t speak for him. He does so many things at the club. Not just for the team but around the club. He knows everybody, he’s been here 11 years. It is impossible (to replace him) but every team has an evolution. When Vinny finally steps down then maybe others will step up. That’s the way it goes … when you get too old you get replaced<br /><br />I’ve no doubt in my mind that after a good summer break and preparation everything will be fine</p>

You can’t really think about ‘what if’ or what should happen. We lost in the Champions League, you take it on the chin and go further. The response we did afterwards is the way you should react. By winning the title and winning the FA Cup. I don’t think in the start of the year you have the goal of winning three titles. You set up to be the best you can and in the end you have to reflect on what’s going well and what’s not. This year we can reflect on that we won three titles and got to the quarter finals of the Champions League and that’s an incredible feat in itself.<br /><br />Luckily, I don’t ever have to debate that. It’s great to be in contention to be named with other teams. For me personally, it is impossible to compare generations, it is impossible to compare style of football. Football changes all of time like every other sport. It is great to be there, it means you are part of one of the best ever teams in the Premier League and that doesn’t happen to a lot of people</p>

And the way he acts is really good, you know he’s not like somebody you hear about all the time. He just plays football and for the rest he keeps himself to himself, so that’s nice. People know about Henry. He was also my coach in Belgium so I know him a little bit personally but it’s so difficult to compare but the records for both of them speak for themselves. It’s not always necessary to compare people, just be happy and maybe be grateful that these guys play there. To come and do this on a consistent basis for nine or 10 years is unbelievable</p>

It feels a bit like the first season with Pep where we were playing good football but we were making too many errors. There are games where you think you are fully in control and then the last five or 10 minutes, we basically gave it away and in this period where <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are not dropping any points, every point you drop is too much.

I know people say it’s the smallest competition but at least if you don’t win anything else, you’ve won something. There are a lot of players who play a lot of games in their career and haven’t won one competition, even the Carabao Cup.<br /><br />You have to respect every competition because we play in big games and sometimes against teams from the lower leagues but even then, we show the dedication to do what we need to do as professionals and show that we’ll do everything to win this cup</p>
