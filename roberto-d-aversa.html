  <p><b>[Gialloblu boss Roberto D’Aversa on Dejan Kulusevski]</b> If you analyse the data, you can see that he is a boy who in every game covers 13-14 kilometres. If he learns to manage himself, to be less frantic and more decisive, he can really become an important player. I have no fear of saying that he can become a top player</p>

  <p><b>[Roberto D’Aversa says <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> defender Bruno Alves is just as obsessed with fitness as <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> star <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and drinks quail eggs after training]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">CR7</a> is the emblem of the champion who got to the top through work and I am intrigued by his story. It also intrigues me because I often hear about it from Bruno Alves, one of his best friends. Rather than reveal anecdotes, he follows the example. Bruno is as obsessive as <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> in body care and nutrition. An example? If it is sunny, even if we are in December, Bruno goes down to his bare chest to get vitamin D. At the end of training he drinks quail eggs, selecting them with great attention - he discards those that float and chooses only those that are full. We are talking about an intact 39-year-old athlete. In fact, when he arrived at <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a>, I immediately said to Dr. Tindaro, our nutritionist, that it would be difficult to change Bruno’s habits. Like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, with whom he shares all these traits, he seems much younger than his age.<br /><br /><b>[D’Aversa has been spending time with his children and reading books]</b> <b>[My kids]</b> are different ages: 10, 12 and 4 half years. So, I alternate between football-tennis on the balcony, board games and cartoons. I could have done without this health emergency like everyone else, but I’m taking the opportunity to be a dad and husband full-time. And when I don’t play with my kids, I read. I am a fan of sports books</p>
