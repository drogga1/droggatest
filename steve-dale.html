  <p><b>[Current owner Steve Dale bought the club for £1 from property developer Stewart Day in December 2018. Dale has hit back at accusations that his asset-stripping is the reason for the club’s trouble, placing the blame on the EFL]</b> We are in a position now where clearly anything I say they don’t believe. The media, present company excluded, have made me out to be the bad guy. I saved this club. How can you strip from something that’s got nowt?</p>

  <p><b>[Bury FC on the brink after potential buyer pulls out. C&amp;N Sporting Risk have now pulled out of the deal following a period of due diligence]</b> As part of our due diligence, we set ourselves a list of key criteria regarding the CVA, the ground, and the overall financial state of the club that had to be met in order for us to be satisfied that we have enough knowledge to proceed with the takeover. The complexities involved in each of these matters escalated and continue to do so. It is therefore with regret that we will be unable to proceed with the takeover of <a href="bury-fc.html">Bury FC</a>. This decision has not been taken lightly. We fully understand the importance of the club to the community, and it is with this in mind that we have informed the EFL of our decision at the earliest possible opportunity</p>
