<blockquote>
  <p>[That is something that Messi did not initially experience; he left Argentina at the age of 13. Five years later, at the 2006 World Cup, he was given a crash course in the Argentine way of seeing football, of seeing life] What you have to understand is that we shaped and educated him to arrive at where he is now. That’s the most useful thing, because of the maldad there is in Argentina when you play football. Messi came to me with the ‘light’ feeling that they had taught him in Barcelona, we taught him what it means to play in Argentina<br /><br />[Solario clearly saw this learning curve as a necessary evil] Maldad is very cruel, I do not have it in football, my rival is a colleague, not an enemy, but that’s how it is in Argentina. It’s a way of understanding football. We understand football in a different way. Here, football is life. We play as we live. If you are generous in life you are generous on the pitch, if you are miserly off the pitch, you’re miserly on it. For us, winning is an important part of life. Messi had to understand that, we taught him to have the hunger. You either die on the pitch or you die on the pitch. You only understand it if you feel it</p>
