  <p><b>[Carlos Valderrama on <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-17 World Cup 2017]</b> The <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-17 World Cup in India will be a milestone in the history of football. I look forward to joining the Trophy Experience, which will bring the excitement of this landmark event even closer to Indian fans. There are great expectations in Colombia ahead of the first participation of our team since Nigeria 2009</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Valderrama said he will cut his famous hair if Colombia win the World Cup]</b> If we are world champions … it’s yes. We don’t qualify for World Cups very often, you know. So, we have to use this opportunity and if we reach there, we live it in the flesh<br /><br />For me, personally, it’s an opportunity to show what happiness means to us, the Colombians. Besides, all our country will be able to see our national team play and have all the information live and directly from RT</p>

  <p><b>[Colombia legend <a href="carlos-alberto-parreira.html">Carlos Alberto</a> Valderrama Palacio, also known as El Pibe, says a local coach is better to lead the La Tricolor]</b> Without a doubt, the coach must be Colombian. We have trained coaches to lead the national team.<br /><br /><b>[Asked him about possibility of appointing <a href="carlos-queiroz.html">Carlos Queiroz</a> as the next coach]</b> I’d rather look for the names like Luis Fernando Suárez and Alberto Gamero.</p>

  <p><b>[Carlos Valderrama says <a href="james-rodriguez.html">James Rodriguez</a> has to find a way out of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> this summer]</b> James? He should go to another team. The coach doesn’t want him and he won’t play if he stays in <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. He should leave, that’s just how it is. When James signed for Madrid the fans were excited and so was the president, but the coach just doesn’t want him<br /><br /><b>[Valderamma wants to see a fellow countryman find the recognition he deserves elsewhere]</b> The problem here is that he is not going to play if he stays in <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. It would be better for him to leave, given that the coach is the one in charge of the starting lineup. Considering his skills he can play in every club</p>

  <p><b>[Colombian legend Carlos Valderrama says <a href="james-rodriguez.html">James Rodriguez</a> needs to leave <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and could play for any team in the world]</b> James is big enough to make his own decisions now. If it was me, I’d be running away from Madrid. He’s good enough to play for any team. I wouldn’t doubt for an instant. He’s a great player, he’s already proved it. He can start for any other team, he’s got the quality to play anywhere in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Colombia had hoped James would go on to succeed Carlos Valderrama as the country’s greatest ever player. Speaking this week to Caracol Radio, the man himself]</b> At Madrid, he was the best player in the team during the first year. Then a coach came and he didn’t like it. Then he went to Germany and he was fine. If I were him, I would go to England.</p>
