  <p><b>[Werner given farewell mosaic of <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> moments ahead of £47.5m <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> move]</b> What annoys me is that Timo is now being put in a corner and portrayed as a bad sportsman who lets his team-mates down. I have to contradict that very clearly and I can only agree with what <b>[RB Leipzig managing director]</b> <a href="oliver-mintzlaff.html">Oliver Mintzlaff</a> said yesterday before the game! It would have been anything but a good start for Timo at his new club if he had to return to Leipzig for the preparation and the Champions League after the break. It was the joint vote of all parties involved - and not just Timo’s decision - that he should move to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> on July 1, and not wait until mid or late August</p>

  <p><b>[Timo Werner’s agent has defended the <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> star from criticism over his £47.5 million ($59m) move to Chelsea]</b> What annoys me is that Timo is now being put in a corner and portrayed as a bad sportsman who lets his team-mates down.

He’s more of a player who lives on continuity and trust. English football is good for him. He’ll have a good development there. I see him there more than in a team that works purely with technical football. He is a player who needs space, who needs depth and who plays out his speed. Maybe that was also a thought when changing. Timo always wants to play. Maybe there are also financial aspects. For example, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> said: ‘We cannot take the risk that he will start with us injured or tired’. I believe that there has been pressure on Timo from various sides.</p>
