  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>’s Hamit Altintop says he will move abroad this summer]</b> My future probably lies abroad. However, it’s difficult to really say anything about it as long as I haven’t signed anything. I hope that I will be able to announce my decision somewhere next week. I don’t want to wait too long as I want some time to mentally prepare for the next step in my career.<br /><br />There has always been a lot of speculation about my future and there was some truth in it most of the time. I was never really sure though whether I wanted to leave or stay put. I can now confirm that I will move abroad though</p>

It will be nice to face them.<br /><br />There are no easy games at this level. It may seem easier than it could have on paper but I know the German culture: they will be a team high on discipline. An interesting couple of meetings lie ahead. I know all about their stadium and the atmosphere. Almost every match is a sell-out. In my first year there we were playing in the Intertoto Cup and there were 55,000-60,000 people there.<br /><br />sEven if the excitement is not what we have in Turkey, there’s substantial support. The Turkish community in Germany will be an advantage for us. We need to prepare well</p>

  <p><b>[Who needs <a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a>? <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> have <a href="caglar-soyuncu.html">Soyuncu</a>, the Turkey centre-half with super-human strength]</b> We had meetings with Caglar to discuss his development and he was a little bit nervous <b>[about his lack of game time]</b>. Young people always think that, if they aren’t playing, they are bad players or that they need to join another team. But it’s all part of the learning process. I think <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> is a good team for the development of players like Caglar. The time when you use these players is important and Caglar is now ready. <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> deserves thanks for <a href="caglar-soyuncu.html">Soyuncu</a>’s development. I think this is a career that other Turkish players need to understand. A career is not only highs but highs and lows. The important thing is not to lose passion or love for the game in this tough business<br /><br />He can almost break your hand with a handshake!. It is a problem for you! He is very strong physically but he is very comfortable on the ball now too. He likes to play football. Some teams in English football like to play long balls but he doesn’t like that. He always passes the ball well and he can dribble too. I think he could go to a top team, why not? I like him. He can be a big player for the national team. He is working hard. I wouldn’t want to face him. I would be scared of him. And I know he has got a good character too.<br /><br /><b>[It’s obviously an exciting time for Turkish football, with Altintop pointing out that <a href="caglar-soyuncu.html">Soyuncu</a> is just one of a plethora of promising young players starting to make a name for themselves]</b> In the Turkish Football Federation, I have responsibility for the youth teams and coaching education and it is busy at the moment because we have a lot of talent. We have a lot of work to do and it is a heavy responsibility but I am happy. We have a good generation of players in the current national team. We started well in our qualifying games for Euro 2020. We beat France at home and this was great for our confidence. We want to qualify for more tournaments. These players need the experience and challenges that come with playing in major tournaments. With qualification, we can then see what level they are at. But we have quality, like Caglar, we are going the right way about things, and are working professionally</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> man Hamit Altintop has labelled the ongoing debate over who should start in goal for Germany as a ‘luxury problem’ as <a href="marc-andre-ter-stegen.html">Marc-Andre ter Stegen</a> continues to stake his claim to be the country’s number one shot-stopper]</b> It’s a nice problem for Germany to have when you have goalkeepers at that level. It’s a nice problem - a luxury even. <a href="manuel-neuer.html">Manuel Neuer</a> is maybe the better goalkeeper but the second choice is very good too. It’s good if there’s a positive fight for the shirt but we must respect what <a href="joachim-low.html">Joachim Low</a> says, he’s the manager. We have to respect his choices but the media likes to play with <b>[the situation]</b>. They like debate and controversy. I think the atmosphere in the team between the two goalkeepers is good<br /><br /><b>[36-year-old <a href="franck-ribery.html">Ribery</a> has already begun a new chapter of his own after joining <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>]</b> He’s always surprising. I played for four years with him and he’s a street footballer. He loves it, his passion for football is unbelievable. He has had difficult times but his love for the business of football was always intense. He’s more responsible now. He understands that he’s 36 and has to show a good example to the younger players around him. That’s a positive thing for him after changing teams. It’s a good motivation. The mentality in Italy might be slower and allow him to enjoy life but it won’t stop him working hard. He’s made some mistakes but he’s human, we all have. He has always played well and worked hard. We have to respect his career - he’s a legend<br /><br /><b>[<a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> has a plethora of Turkish fans due to his roots and Altintop is keen to see the World Cup winner return to action sooner rather than later]</b> <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> is a good guy who has had an unbelievable career. He is always respectful and serious and that’s the base for a good sportsman. He’s a young man and he’s allowed to make mistakes. That’s important. His current situation at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is not good but this is part of life and his career. He worked hard for 10 years for his passion so I think he will come back</p>

  <p><b>[The Turkish midfielder was brought in by <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> in 2011, however the Portuguese coach did not react well when Altintop begged him to let him leave, stating that he could take it no more]</b> <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> was very important to me. It was a decisive step in my career. I love the club, the city, the president <b>[<a href="florentino-perez.html">Florentino Perez</a>]</b>, Jose Angel <b>[Sanchez]</b>, but I couldn’t go on<br /><br /><b>[As such, Altintop gave up his three-year contract and salary in order to become a free agent and leave the Estadio <a href="real-madrid.html">Santiago Bernabeu</a>]</b> I arrived and you see yourself there with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href="iker-casillas.html">Iker Casillas</a>, <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Gonzalo Higuain</a>, <a href="karim-benzema.html">Karim Benzema</a>, <a href="sami-khedira.html">Sami Khedira</a> … and you start to feel the responsibility to do well. You’re in a hurry and my back did not let me. For three months I was just looking to train without pain<br /><br /><b>[The problem for Altintop was that the pressure of being a <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> player began to affect him mentally, which led to him isolating himself from the rest of the squad]</b> Who did I get along with? I had a good relationship with everyone, the dressing room was very good, but for a long time I shut myself up in order to forget the problems. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. I couldn’t be the real Altintop. I didn’t read the press, but I knew what they were saying<br /><br /><b>[Despite having a bad experience in the Spanish capital, Altintop was full of praise for <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> He’s great. I really like him as a coach, he’s one of the best. In the dressing room he’s different. Nothing to do with what he seems like. He gets along with the players, defends them and gives a face to the group. I know that it seemed different from afar, but he knows how to handle everything around the team very well, which he forces to compete all the time<br /><br /><b>[Altintop then sent a message in order to avoid confusion]</b> <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> did a great job, but I have great respect for <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a>. He’s great and what he has done there <b>[is incredible]</b>. He’s <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s coach and I hope he’s doing very well. It would be best. The pressure is very high and you have to win every game. He’s made history. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are doing very well, signing young players, but it will take three or four years for this team to take shape<br /><br /><b>[One of Altintop’s best friends at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> was <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>]</b> It is logical that a team suffers when a player like that leaves. The same will happen to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> with Lionel Messi</p>

He is able to get <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> one step further. I will follow it closely and we are still in contact. I wish him all the best. Last year they played really well and with this squad they can do it this year. I think he is able to separate the business from personal stuff. He is really good at that. I believe he was one of the first ones to transform football into show business, what many people love. You need a little bit extra for that and it shows how intensely he is living that. He is able to - as a friend, as a coach - to praise your strength and to motivate you. That is what the young people need</p>
