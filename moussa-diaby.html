  <p>[Bayer Leverkusen have confirmed the signing of young striker Moussa Diaby from Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain] The move abroad into one of the best and most balanced leagues in Europe is extremely exciting. I am very curious about Germany, the special football here and the great stadiums. And of course it’s great to be in the Champions League as well</p>

  <p>[Former Paris Saint-Germain youngster Moussa Diaby has defended Neymar amid criticism over his attitude and celebrity status at Parc des Princes] I met Neymar as a normal guy. He did not show any celebrity and did not want to kick every ball on the pitch. He sometimes gave tips to young players. You can see he’s got a lot of experience, but he treated everyone the same way. Nobody had a problem with him. I do not think that he has become another person on the pitch. Of course, a lot is spoken and written about him, but there is always a part of it that’s a lot of nonsense. How can you judge him as a person if you only see from the outside?<br /><br />[When asked to address reports of clashes between young and old players at PSG] No. There was a good mood in the locker room and we laughed a lot together. There was no discussion in this regard. When the experienced players talk to the younger ones, they listen and try to take the advice. I never saw that one of the boys did not want to listen<br /><br />I’ve heard that, but I cannot comment on it because I do not know who he meant exactly and what message he wanted to send out. I know that I’m a young player, but I do not think he’d necessarily talk about me. That’s why I cannot and do not want to comment on that.</p>

  <p>[Bayer Leverkusen signing Moussa Diaby​ has credited Paris Saint-Germain boss <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a> with his rapid rise to the Bundesliga giants] <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Thomas Tuchel</a> wanted me to stay. He promised me that I would develop well under him and that he would give me enough playing time. Everything has finally arrived, even with many other young players too. It was not enough for everyone to be a regular starter, but it has still been quite different under Unai Emery before. <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a> believed in me from the beginning. Without him, I would never have made it to Leverkusen and the Bundesliga so fast<br /><br />[Despite leaving PSG for Germany, Diaby believes that <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a> has what it takes to lead PSG to glory in the near future] I was and am enthusiastic about <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a>. He is a very nice and friendly, but also extremely ambitious coach. He obviously enjoys working with young players and making them better. He always approached the boys, every day. I liked the way he led the team. He puts a lot of emphasis on technical training and has introduced great training exercises and teaching methods which have previously not been known in Paris. That gave us a lot of fun and helped the club a lot in my opinion. He still wants to achieve a lot with PSG in all competitions, that’s for sure. I can only say good things about him<br /><br />[Diaby says that he would have liked to stay with PSG, but he felt he had reached an age where he needed to play more regularly to continue his development] I would also like to have stayed in Paris - but then my chances would have had to improve significantly. I am a young player who urgently needs to play regularly. I want to improve as fast as possible. Therefore, I have looked elsewhere and did not want another loan. I wanted to go to a team that, like PSG, has a lot of attacking possession, has strong players and gives me the opportunity to become a regular starter soon. I would have had to wait for that in Paris - probably too long. Leverkusen offers me great opportunities in this regard, and at a top German club that plays in the Champions League.<br /><br />The transfer fee makes me proud, because it is also for Leverkusen a very big transfer. I hope that I can justify this amount with good performances, so that one day the club and its fans can be proud of me. I feel no pressure. Also, I am not a PSG super talent, but one of many who have been trained in Paris. But I understand that when a player changes from PSG to Leverkusen, that’s something special and may trigger some hype in the media. Simply because you usually change from Paris only to an even bigger club. But as I said, I am a young player, I am convinced of this path and believe that Leverkusen was the best choice for me</p>
