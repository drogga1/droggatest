  <p><b>[Photo shows injury to Tigres star Jurgen Damm’s face following firework incident]</b> First of all I want to thank God because it really was a miracle that all this wasn’t even worse. Hopefully, what has happened to me will help so we all learn that fireworks don’t bring anything good in our lives. Sadly, I’ve learned the hard way, but I honestly hope that this message serves so that you don’t go through something like this. Thanks to everyone that has shown me their support.</p>

  <p><b>[Tigres winger Jurgen Damm says he hoped to take part of March’s Mexico national team camp]</b> I’m sad because of the injury situation. I came in with a lot of hope, with a big feeling of happiness to be able to return to the national team. I’ve always said it’s my biggest pride. My biggest dream is to represent Mexico, but, well, those are things that happen in soccer and now I’m going to recover as quickly as possible. I’m very thankful with the manager because he’s always had a lot of support for me, right now the situation was an injury thing. They’re things that happen in soccer. My hope was to stay here in the national team with the group and rehabilitate myself there, but they came to an agreement and as Tigres is the one that has the ultimate decision, you have to return and do recovery as well as possible and return as soon as possible.</p>

  <p><b>[Grande? Not a grande? It’s time to put a tired Liga MX debate to bed]</b> Tigres has become much more of a grande as the years have gone by, it’s become a bit more of a grande because of what it has achieved, the titles, the players it has and because it has played in finals.</p>

  <p><b>[Tigres UANL winger Jurgen Damm - <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> and Wolfsburg were interested in me]</b> My agent had close contact with <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> and Wolfsburg - they were the two teams from Germany that were interested. The issue was the release clause, which was very high. As I have said on many occasions, the price of Mexican players is very inflated. Of course, Borussia or Wolfsburg can pay 10 or 15 million <b>[euros]</b>, but it’s not a matter of having it but of what you are really worth.<br /><br /><b>[Atlanta United have been credited with an interest in Damm]</b> It is an option that we manage for my future. <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is a very attractive league that has grown a lot in recent years. I do not shut off any options, I just wouldn’t want to play for River and <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a>, because I am a Tigres fan<br /><br />In Argentina I like Boca a lot more, aside from us losing the Copa Libertadores final <b>[to River]</b>. Tigres is the team of my heart, the one I love, the one I appreciate and will be a fan off all my life</p>
