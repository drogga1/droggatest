<blockquote>
  <p>[Wolverhampton Wanderers have secured the signature of Paris Saint-Germain defender Raphael Nya on a three-year deal from the Ligue 1 champions] He’s a player we’ve been monitoring for quite a while. We’re lucky enough that he was looking for something new and we were in a position to offer him a fresh challenge. The appeal of coming to Wolves and England is massive. As a player, he very much fits our style. He’s a centre half who is excellent in possession of the ball, is a good reader of the game and anticipates well, so he’s got real potential. Like a lot of the lads, we’ll try him in different positions and see where he fits best in our system. From meeting him and watching him train over the past couple of days, you can see he’s a leader and a communicator, he’s been really impressive<br /><br />[Wolves will face an abbreviated pre-season tour to China for the Premier League Asia trophy against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> and <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>. Sellars admits that the club’s smaller-than-average first team will present chances for youngsters to shine] All the Under-23 lads will be hoping to be involved. <a href="nuno-espirito-santo.html">Nuno Espirito Santo</a>’s said how he’s not going to have a massive squad and there’s an extra games programme this year, so in terms of supporting the first-team, hopefully a lot of the boys will get opportunities</p>
