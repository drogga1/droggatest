  <p><b>[Pablo Zabaleta on <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>]</b> Kun is a very decisive player. He has the ability to change speed with the ball and start and stop with incredible velocity. He has impressive balance in his lower body, speed to slalom, and his finishing is incredible. Every year we see him score surprising goals and it’s very rare to find a striker who can do that. Guys like <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and Di Maria are very fast and can change a game, but nobody can match Kun at what he does best</p>

  <p><b>[Pablo Zabaleta admits to missing all the rain in Manchester]</b> This place has definitely changed me. When I go on holiday to Spain for a month in the summer with the family, or somewhere with more sunshine, I find that I miss all the rain in Manchester. It sounds crazy, but it’s true. I’ve been here for many years. In terms of playing football in another country, like Spain, and training in a hot climate - I think I’d find that hard. I love playing games in the rainy weather when the ball runs fast on the pitch.<br /><br />My commitment and loyalty has been there on and off the pitch from day one - that’s why I think I have lasted. At the beginning everything is new and you have to adapt to a new style of football and life off the pitch, which isn’t easy. Sometimes you struggle a bit, but I’m happy to still be here. The Premier League was always my dream. It’s amazing. I thought: ‘Let’s go to England’ - Manchester City was a different club to what it is today but it’s still the same in many ways. It’s been a big challenge every year to prove that I’m good enough to be here as big money and big players come to the club</p>

  <p><b>[Pablo Zabelata remains convinced that Claudio Bravo will be a success at Manchester City]</b> We know Claudio. It’s not easy when you come to England - it’s a different league. We are a team, we support each other. We know exactly what he can do for the team and that’s it. We know how good he is and sometimes it is just about confidence. His distribution with the ball was really good.<br /><br />I think if you look at the whole game, we were the better team. Maybe in the first 15 minutes we gave the ball away cheaply and maybe our play was a little bit sloppy, but once we equalised and then scored the second goal I think we were a different team and we looked very dangerous going forward</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi may have gone two years without winning the Ballon d’Or]</b> Messi today is much better than when he won the five Ballon d’Or awards. He’s a unique player, a type of player that we’ll probably never see again. Seeing him develop is something that’s difficult to believe.</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi could retire from international football after the World Cup following Argentina’s shambolic display against Croatia]</b> I just feel so sorry for Lionel Messi. This was his last chance to win something with Argentina - so I wouldn’t be surprised to see him retire from international football after this. He’ll be so disappointed and it’s another four years until Qatar.<br /><br />The people in Argentina will be so angry now. You expect more from those players. They were so close to winning it in Brazil then they lost two Copa Americas in a row. The people in Argentina are so hungry for this World Cup, and they will not accept this. The manager has to sit with the players and have a real conversation about what’s going on. I’ve never seen a performance like this by Argentina. Never before. There was a lack of spirit and it’s very strange to see.<br /><br />In the second half we weren’t good enough. I think after the Willy Caballero mistake it was mentally very difficult for the players to come back and win the game. All Argentina’s players play for big clubs - they should have done much, much better. I’ve never seen Nicolas Otamendi look so uncomfortable in a game - he was making all sorts of mistakes - at Manchester City you never see him miss a pass. And Marcos Rojo has been playing for Manchester United - in a back three - so I can’t see why he was left out today</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi is unhappy at the World Cup]</b> The happiest I saw Lionel Messi when I played alongside him for Argentina was in 2012 - he scored a hat-trick against Brazil in New York, and he played the whole game with freedom and a smile on his face. His body language was completely the opposite before the Croatia game on Thursday. To see Leo looking so stressed and unhappy at this World Cup was a real worry. He is my friend as well as my former team-mate and I felt really sorry for him. It is very unusual to see him like that, but it was a sign of what was going on in his head. At times like this, there is a huge pressure on him because people expect too much, and for him to do everything for the national team. I was not surprised he struggled, in what was a disastrous defeat for us. As a player myself, I know that if you go into a game and you don’t really enjoy it then it is very difficult to play well.<br /><br />I think it is getting harder for Leo to play for Argentina. He turned 31 on Sunday so he is getting older and sometimes, mentally, you can feel tired as well. Part of that is down to his history with Argentina. This team has lost the past three finals they have played - the 2014 World Cup and the Copa America in 2015 and 2016. In Argentina, that is not enough. For some people, and for parts of the media, you have to win - just reaching the final is not acceptable. So losing three finals in four years has been tough mentally and psychologically for everyone in that team, especially Leo. It is hard when people in your country treat you like a loser. They see him winning trophies every season with Barcelona - so they expect him to do exactly the same in the national team</p>

  <p><b>[Pablo Zabaleta admits West Ham must improve if they are to avoid relegation this season]</b> For the first time maybe Manuel Pellegrini doesn’t have the same quality in the team like he had before. So maybe it’ll take more time than at other clubs for him to get everything right. At Manchester City, there was so much quality, we won games easily. Here it’s not the same. But he’s a great man, a good manager and will try to find the best way to get the results.<br /><br />It’s similar to last season when we didn’t start well and it was tough but we don’t want that. We’ve seen good teams going down before so we must fight. We’ve got the quality in the team but the players need to put in good performances… you trust in the way he <b>[Pellegrini]</b> works because of the teams he’s worked with before</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester City full-back Pablo Zabaleta says Pep Guardiola pulled the plug on a potential switch to Roma]</b> I came close to joining Roma in the past. They offered me a three-year contract and I thought that could be a positive experience for me. However, Guardiola took over at Manchester City and he told me that he needed me to stay so, in the end, I didn’t join Roma. It’s a decision I took with my heart even though I’ve always thought that I’d like to play in Italy one day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta has admitted that he feels sorry for Manchester United attackers Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford]</b> I think this is Mourinho’s philosophy. We’ve seen this at Inter Milan and Real Madrid. When a manager has to convince players to play in the way the manager wants to play, it’s simple. Some players will enjoy it more and others will enjoy it less. When you look at Martial, when you look at <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford, they’re just always tracking full-backs rather than just attack and they just couldn’t in one-on-one situations. And I think if I’m in their position it must be hard not to be an attacking team and play in the final third and always tracking back full-backs.<br /><br />Of course, when you play City, who dominate possession, you’ll suffer, but when you play against other teams with less quality then maybe it’s different. We’re West Ham and we played Man Utd a few weeks ago and we felt this. I was making overlapping runs and Martial was just tracking me back and at some point he went ‘How old are you?’ - I felt like I can play another 10 years! He made me feel young but I felt bad for him because he was just tracking me back all the time</p>

  <p><b>[Man City legend Zabaleta waiting on West Ham offer but has no plans to retire]</b> No, I’ll be 34 in January and I love football so much. If I continue playing in every game it means I can go for a few more years. When you are in your 30s you cannot think about long-term, that is the only thing, but I’m not thinking about retirement. If I can go for another few years I do will 100 per cent because I’ve got so much love for football.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about fresh terms at the London Stadium]</b> I don’t know. The main thing for me is to keep enjoying my football, I’m so happy to be part of the West Ham family. I know I’m not getting any younger but I still feel alright, I’m playing in every single game and physically I feel good. We will see at the end of the season what the best decision is for me, the club, for everyone, but at the moment I don’t want to think about this, I just want to enjoy playing games. The main thing is to have a good season with the team</p>

I spent one season with him, the first season for Pep in England. We did some amazing stuff, but also we made a few mistakes that cost us winning the Premier League or the Champions League. For a club like Manchester City finishing the season without trophies is something that, as a player, hurts. When you’re there, you play to win trophies</p>

  <p><b>[Pablo Zabaleta says Kevin De Bruyne has to play every game]</b> Good to see some of the players like Kevin De Bruyne. You see what he brings to that team, he was just absolutely outstanding. We usually see two or three assists from him or maybe goals but what he brings on the ball and off the ball is just fantastic so he really makes a difference. He has to play every single game at the moment.<br /><br /><b>[Zabaleta, who spent nine memorable years at City before leaving in 2017]</b> Normally when they play a 4-3-3 formation, he <b>[De Bruyne]</b> always plays on the inside but in this game it looked at times like it was a 4-4-2. The picture is just perfect and you see <a href="kevin-de-bruyne.html">Kevin de Bruyne</a> playing like a striker. Normally we see him play deeper and just play through balls and that but I think he was in a different position, further forward on the pitch. He’s a player who can adapt to different positions. And with all the runs he does, his work-rate off the ball is fantastic</p>
