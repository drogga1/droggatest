  <p><b>[Francis Coquelin, the ‘police officer’]</b> As soon as I cross the line and get on the pitch, I know I’m ready - anyone who wants to come, I’m ready for them. I don’t mind looking at people in their eyes and thinking ‘today you’re going to have me on your back and it’s going to be tough’. We used to have a manager in the national team who said the game starts in the tunnel, even the way you shake hands. You send them a message when you shake their hand and it’s true</p>

  <p><b>[Ozil is right - he is being made a scapegoat for Arsenal crisis]</b> The former Schalke and Werder Bremen star is the perfect scapegoat in a country that has traditionally rewarded outward signs of aggression and passion. If you’re not ‘putting your foot in’, shouting at a team-mate or sprinting down the pitch for 90 minutes then your performance will almost certainly be questioned by the masses.</p>

  <p><b>[Lacazette has been brought in to aid that trophy quest and his compatriot Francis Coquelin has billed him as a goalscoring machine]</b> I’ve known him for a very long time. We played together for the youth national team so I know him very well. I’m really happy he’s come to the club. He’s a real asset and a goalscoring machine. He scored 37 goals in all competitions last season, so he’s shown that he’s a very, very good goalscorer. I think he’s the fourth all-time leading goalscorer for Lyon, after scoring about 130 goals for the club. I’m really happy to have him in the team.<br /><br />He can do pretty much everything because he’s someone who likes to get on the ball too. He likes to run in behind the defences, that’s something he’s good at and, like I said, he’s a goalscorer. Even in Europe, it’s very difficult to find someone who can score 25 or 30 goals. If he can do that, it will be very special for the club and for the team. I’ve never seen someone coming on and scoring so many goals. I’ve seen him come on and score a hat-trick in 20 minutes. He shows that he doesn’t joke in front of the goal, he does the business and that’s what we need</p>

  <p><b>[Alexandre Lacazette is ice cold in front of goal]</b> There is always a little question mark but I’m not scared. When you are a goalscorer, you are a goalscorer. Even at 17, he was always the same. In front of goal he’s always ice cold, he always scores a lot of goals. When we played with the national team, he finished top scorer when we played the under-20s World Cup. His record for Lyon is incredible. He’s scored so many goals over there. He scored 140 goals for the club so he’s shown that in front of goal he doesn’t mess around and that’s what we need.<br /><br />He scored 37 goals last season in 45 games, so I don’t know why he cannot score for Arsenal. It is just whether he is going to put them away and I’m sure he will. He will probably get even more chances than he did at Lyon and it is down to him to score them but I’m pretty sure he has come here with his confidence high. In front of goal, he’s someone who likes to score goals. He doesn’t need many chances to put them away. I hope we will see that this season<br /><br />We had a tough season last season but it was good to finish on a high, the FA Cup was massive for everyone. For the team, the fans, for the club as well. It’s good to start the new season fresh, we finished on a high and we’re now really focused on the games coming up</p>

  <p><b>[Valencia have announced that they have reached an agreement to sign Francis Coquelin from Arsenal]</b> Valencia have agreed terms with Arsenal on Thursday for the transfer of Francis Coquelin, who joins the club until June 30, 2022, with a release clause of €80 million</p>

  <p><b>[Francis Coquelin says that he almost regrets not taking the chance to leave Arsenal sooner]</b> It’s true that there was interest in the summer but in my head I wanted to continue at Arsenal and do well there. It wasn’t to be and now this opportunity has come up. I almost regret not having come before. I think it’s an excellent opportunity for me and I’m very grateful. It’s a big challenge, and a new start in my life for me, which I’m very excited about</p>

  <p><b>[Francis Coquelin has rubbished talk of a crisis at Arsenal]</b> It’s not a crisis, they just need a couple of results to get going again. People tend to forget what Wenger has done for the club. I understand the frustration but everyone should stand by him, everyone should be behind <b>[him]</b>. That’s the only way results are going to turn around.<br /><br />If they let Sanchez go, what I am sure of is they will have to strengthen the team, because he will be a big miss. For fans, they demand a competitive team. They will be upset if no-one comes in the transfer market and they let Sanchez go</p>

  <p><b>[Valencia’s Francis Coquelin is relishing his first derby in Spain as they prepare to face Levante on Sunday]</b> I’m really looking forward to it. It’s a big derby you know. We are at home to Levante, who are also a good team. The atmosphere will be pumping because it is a derby, a derby is a derby, not like any other match. I played in the North London derby for Arsenal against Tottenham, so I know exactly how a derby feels. The most important thing is obviously to win this game to bring the joy back to Valencia, it is a vital game for us to win, we are at home, therefore, we will have the 12th man, the fans on our side pushing us to take all three points.<br /><br />We played tough fixtures. As Valencia we should have won a few of those games but at the same time you are playing against top side in La Liga and sometimes it can be difficult. Against Real Madrid I played at centre back, which alone shows you that all our defenders were injured or suspended for that fixture. Sunday’s game is a big game so this is a good chance for us to turn things around by winning this local derby</p>

  <p><b>[Francis Coquelin is hoping to see Valencia secure a Champions League place at the end of the season]</b> If you come to a big club such as Valencia, you want to win stuff. Copa Del Rey was a big chance for us to pick up a trophy as we got to the semi-finals of the competition, but unfortunately we were up against a great Barcelona side and in the end, they won the game. This season, a Champion’s League place is our main target. Hopefully next season we can push on from there. But for now, we need to focus on finishing the season strong and in a champion’s league position</p>
