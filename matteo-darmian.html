  <p><b>[<a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> have completed a deadline day deal to sign Italy defender Matteo Darmian from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> on a five-year contract]</b> <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> can confirm that defender Matteo Darmian has signed for Italian side <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a>. The full-back joined the Reds from <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> in 2015 and went on to make 92 appearances for the club. In four years with us, Matteo scored one goal - a sublime volley against Crystal Palace in 2016, in a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford. Everyone at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> would like to thank Matteo for his service and wish him all the best for the future</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Darmian snubs Ole Gunnar Solskjae by moving out of Manchester United]</b> Van Gaal and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> are two great coaches, they have won a lot, you know them. They are two great coaches who have left me something positive and I thank them<br /><br />The choice to go to England at the time was easy. Playing for such an important club was a source of pride and a great responsibility for me, because wearing a glorious shirt always gives great responsibility. It was an experience that I would do again, very important for my career, I went to confront myself with a different culture and football, and it certainly made me grow both on and off the field. The first two years I played more, then the last year-and-a-half I played less but my desire to play pushed me to leave <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Darmian is now looking forward to reacquainting himself with Serie A]</b> Between the English and Italian championships, the English league is more physical and less tactical. When I had the opportunity to play in the past, I always looked after the tactical aspect in Italy and I don’t think much has changed</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Darmian says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> has received a lot of unjustified criticism]</b> Paul is my friend and I have an excellent relationship with him. First of all: we are talking about a real champion here, a great footballer, but even they can have some periods when they don’t do as well <b>[as they would like]</b>. The real ‘problem’ with <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> at United, I think, was the price the club paid for him and that conditioned the way people perceived him. There has been a lot of unjustified criticism towards <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, for example, that he doesn’t work hard enough, but he always gave his best, I can assure you, in every training session. In my opinion, his performances were good in recent years, they talk about him too negatively <b>[in the UK]</b>. Did I see <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> unhappy or willing to leave? No, I honestly didn’t see him sad or unhappy, quite the opposite, for all the time I was in Manchester, Paul was absolutely happy with his decision to go back there. He really cares about doing well at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.<br /><br />I was lucky I could join <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a>. Their sporting director Daniele Faggiano called me and enable me to return to <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, a league I knew well. I joined a good group of people and that always helps with everything. At the moment we are still focused on avoiding relegation, that is the main objective, but it’s an ambitious club and that’s what convinced me to pick <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> so who knows what we can achieve. As for the national team, playing in the Euro in 2021 for Italy is something I want to do at all cost</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Darmian says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> is capable of becoming a Ballon d’Or winner]</b> I still remember <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>’s first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday. I immediately thought: ‘Wow, this is an incredible player’. He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me. If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d’Or winner. I’m convinced of this. He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he’s very young and can still improve. For me, he can reach the level of <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> and compete for the Ballon d’Or for years to come<br /><br />I can only speak well about <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>, believe me. I would give him a long-term contract. He’s a very prepared coach and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> has started this project, this journey, with many young players, many British players and they will continue with this project. Because of the person I got to know, I hope <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> has success at the club</p>
