  <p><b>[When asked who would be the best stand-in goalkeeper]</b> Probably Wayne Rooney. Sometimes at the end of the training session, he goes in goal and someone shoots and he saves it.<br /><br /><b>[Darmian himself has been in and out of the team during Mourinho’s first season]</b> It’s good. When the new manager came in, everything changed. But next season the manager will be the same and it’s good for everyone. Everyone can see the progression of the team. We want to win every game, we deserve to win a lot of games but sometimes we didn’t win. But now we want to finish the season well, to win a trophy is always a pleasure so we will fight for it <b>[the Europa League]</b> and next season we’ll fight for every title</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus are interested in securing the signing of Manchester United defender Matteo Darmian]</b> I made a choice <b>[to come to Manchester United]</b> and I don’t regret it. Of course it’s normal that any player wants to play as much as possible. I work hard every week and I’ll keep doing it. I don’t always watch Italian football and I don’t know what will happen in the future, maybe there will be a chance to come back one day</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Darmian has welcomed the interest being shown in him by Juventus]</b> I’m living a great experience here in England. I’d say yes to United again. It’s one of the best clubs in the world. I won several trophies here but I miss Italy. Let’s see what happens at the end of the season. Now the priority is to end the season in the best way possible. Juventus? I have not decided yet. I am happy Juventus are interested in me. Juve are a great club and I am happy for that. I will think about a possible move when it will be the right time.<br /><br />It has made me stronger. Footballers always want to play, it’s not always possible because of injuries or manager’s decisions. I’ve always worked hard and I think my sacrifices will be repaid</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Matteo Darmian is aware of the challenge his side will face against Cristiano Ronaldo and Juventus]</b> I think Juventus are a very big club, one of the biggest clubs in the world. For sure, they are the biggest club in Italy and they have won the last seven Serie A <b>[titles]</b> so everyone wants to beat them. They are a very good team and it will be a difficult game. They have good organisation and are a compact team so it’s difficult to score against them, so we have to be focused and try to score and win the game.<br /><br />Cristiano was the biggest signing of the summer transfer window. We all know the quality of Cristiano, but he’s not the only one we have to look out for because they have a lot of good players, not only up front but also in midfield and defence</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Darmian insists there are no problems between Jose Mourinho and his players]</b> Between us, <b>[there are]</b> no problems - between the manager and the players. So we have to keep working. Try to work harder and try to do what we are doing to try to win as many games as possible.<br /><br />I think that it was not the result that we wanted before the game. But today was a tough game. We started very well but we conceded two goals. I think we had two good reactions after their goals and at the end, it was a draw. Now we have to think game by game and try to win a lot of matches because this period is very important. A lot of games are coming and you have to be ready. Everyone who played did very well. It was not enough today but now we have to be focused in the next game. You know that when results are not what we want the feelings are not very good. But we have to keep working</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United full-back Matteo Darmian has hinted at a move back to Serie A]</b> I must say, I really do miss Serie A and Italy now. I know that I am at one of the best clubs in the world and I am proud to be at Manchester United, but I do miss Italy. I love my country<br /><br />Returning to play for Italy is my objective. Roberto Mancini hasn’t called me up yet, but I hope he will in future.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> have completed a deadline day deal to sign Italy defender Matteo Darmian from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> on a five-year contract]</b> <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> can confirm that defender Matteo Darmian has signed for Italian side <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a>. The full-back joined <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> from <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> in 2015 and went on to make 92 appearances for the club. In four years with us, Matteo scored one goal - a sublime volley against <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> in 2016, in a 2-0 victory at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>. Everyone at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> would like to thank Matteo for his service and wish him all the best for the future</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Darmian snubs Ole Gunnar Solskjae by moving out of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> Van Gaal and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> are two great coaches, they have won a lot, you know them. They are two great coaches who have left me something positive and I thank them<br /><br />The choice to go to England at the time was easy. Playing for such an important club was a source of pride and a great responsibility for me, because wearing a glorious shirt always gives great responsibility. It was an experience that I would do again, very important for my career, I went to confront myself with a different culture and football, and it certainly made me grow both on and off the field. The first two years I played more, then the last year-and-a-half I played less but my desire to play pushed me to leave <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Darmian is now looking forward to reacquainting himself with <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>]</b> Between the English and Italian championships, the English league is more physical and less tactical. When I had the opportunity to play in the past, I always looked after the tactical aspect in Italy and I don’t think much has changed</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Darmian says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> has received a lot of unjustified criticism]</b> Paul is my friend and I have an excellent relationship with him. First of all: we are talking about a real champion here, a great footballer, but even they can have some periods when they don’t do as well <b>[as they would like]</b>. The real ‘problem’ with <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> at United, I think, was the price the club paid for him and that conditioned the way people perceived him. There has been a lot of unjustified criticism towards <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, for example, that he doesn’t work hard enough, but he always gave his best, I can assure you, in every training session. In my opinion, his performances were good in recent years, they talk about him too negatively <b>[in the UK]</b>. Did I see <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> unhappy or willing to leave? No, I honestly didn’t see him sad or unhappy, quite the opposite, for all the time I was in Manchester, Paul was absolutely happy with his decision to go back there. He really cares about doing well at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>.<br /><br />I was lucky I could join <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a>. Their sporting director <a href="daniele-faggiano.html">Daniele Faggiano</a> called me and enable me to return to <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, a league I knew well. I joined a good group of people and that always helps with everything. At the moment we are still focused on avoiding relegation, that is the main objective, but it’s an ambitious club and that’s what convinced me to pick <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> so who knows what we can achieve. As for the national team, playing in the Euro in 2021 for Italy is something I want to do at all cost</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Darmian says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> is capable of becoming a Ballon d’Or winner]</b> I still remember <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a>’s first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday. I immediately thought: ‘Wow, this is an incredible player’. He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me. If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d’Or winner. I’m convinced of this. He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he’s very young and can still improve. For me, he can reach the level of <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> and compete for the Ballon d’Or for years to come<br /><br />I can only speak well about <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>, believe me. I would give him a long-term contract. He’s a very prepared coach and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> has started this project, this journey, with many young players, many British players and they will continue with this project. Because of the person I got to know, I hope <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> has success at the club</p>
