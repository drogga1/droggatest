  <p><b>[Claudio Pizarro when asked how he scored three goals in Werder Bremen’s 4-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen]</b> Very simple: Pow, pow, pow!</p>

  <p><b>[Claudio Pizarro has confirmed the forthcoming season, his 20th in the Bundesliga, will be his last before retirement]</b> This is my last year, for sure. I have discussed it with everyone. I feel fine, but it’s enough. The big difference to previous years is the recovery. It’s not like it was five years ago, my body needs more time for regeneration now<br /><br /><b>[Pizarro made 26 league appearances on his return to Werder last term - 23 of them as a substitute - and contributed five goals]</b> The general goal is to get into Europe. I would be happy with that. It’s possible</p>

  <p><b>[Claudio Pizarro confirms interest in Bayern job]</b> Bayern would like it to happen and I have told them I’m interested. But for now I still have a job to do here and I will make a decision when it’s all over</p>

  <p><b>[Claudio Pizarro says <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s the best manager he’s played for, still weighing Bayern’s ambassador offer]</b> Pep broadened my footballing horizons even further. He has a completely different vision of football compared to other coaches, he’s the best I’ve had. Tactically speaking, and in terms of how he thinks about football, I believe there is no better coach than Pep Guardiola<br /><br /><a href="jupp-heynckes.html">Heynckes</a> was also great, he’s a fantastic human being. He helped the team so much, and the fact Bayern brought him back so often shows just how good he is</p>

  <p><b>[Claudio Pizarro states desire to work with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> boss Jurgen Klopp]</b> Unfortunately <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> is missing from the list, I have never been allowed to work with him. That would have appealed to me very much. I hope that I can get to know <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> in the future and that I can also see his training sessions. Without a doubt, I would have liked it very much to work with such a trainer. I find <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> totally exciting from a player’s perspective
<b>[…]</b> I don’t think there is a better coach than <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> in terms of tactics and all the dimensions he thinks about football. He’s the best I’ve had</p>
