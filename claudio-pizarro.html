  <p><b>[Claudio Pizarro when asked how he scored three goals in Werder Bremen’s 4-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen]</b> Very simple: Pow, pow, pow!</p>

  <p><b>[Gnabry and Coman can replace Bayern legends Robben and Ribery]</b> I think they <b>[Gnabry and Coman]</b> are able to replace them. You reach a certain point where you’ve got to stop <b>[talking about Robben and Ribery]</b>, and new people arrive. This is normal and these two are very good players. They will have a good development and do good things for Bayern.<br /><br />I would like to play with them <b>[Robben and Ribery]</b> but I don’t know what they are going to do. I wish them all the best for their future, as I said. I hope they find something they really want to do after Bayern. I know Arjen a bit better to be honest, because I was at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for one year together with him. Since then we had a very good relationship on and off the pitch. I was very happy when he returned to the pitch again after his injury. Both are special players on the wing. They would be important for any team. They are good at one-on-ones and how they score goals is essential for any team. It was an honour for me to play with them and I wish them all the best.<br /><br /><b>[Florian Kohfeldt’s side able to finish as high as seventh in the table]</b> Kohfeldt is very good in leading the team. He is a coach that can speak very well to a player. He gives a lot of confidence to the player. I think the player returns this confidence on the pitch. He is very good in tactics, he does that really well. And I think he will be a good coach, he is heading in the right direction. With more experience he will become one of the greatest coaches in Germany<br /><br /><b>[Asked if Kohfeldt, 36, is a potential successor to Germany coach Joachim Low]</b> It could happen. We will see. Now he is still at Werder. He still has some years here at Bremen where he can gain more experience. This is very important, I think. In the end he will decide on what’s best for his career</p>

  <p><b>[Werder Bremen have confirmed 40-year-old striker Claudio Pizarro will remain with the club next season]</b> I have always said that my future plans would depend on what my body was telling me. I still feel good, so I’m glad to be staying here for another year. We have developed really well as a team this season and I’m sure we’ll carry on improving. I’d like to be a part of that too</p>

  <p><b>[Claudio Pizarro has confirmed the forthcoming season, his 20th in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, will be his last before retirement]</b> This is my last year, for sure. I have discussed it with everyone. I feel fine, but it’s enough. The big difference to previous years is the recovery. It’s not like it was five years ago, my body needs more time for regeneration now<br /><br /><b>[Pizarro made 26 league appearances on his return to Werder last term - 23 of them as a substitute - and contributed five goals]</b> The general goal is to get into Europe. I would be happy with that. It’s possible</p>

  <p><b>[Claudio Pizarro says <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s the best manager he’s played for, still weighing <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>’s ambassador offer]</b> Pep broadened my footballing horizons even further. He has a completely different vision of football compared to other coaches, he’s the best I’ve had. Tactically speaking, and in terms of how he thinks about football, I believe there is no better coach than Pep Guardiola<br /><br /><a href="jupp-heynckes.html">Heynckes</a> was also great, he’s a fantastic human being. He helped the team so much, and the fact <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> brought him back so often shows just how good he is</p>

That would have appealed to me very much. I hope that I can get to know <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> in the future and that I can also see his training sessions. Without a doubt, I would have liked it very much to work with such a trainer. I find <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> totally exciting from a player’s perspective
<b>[…]</b> I don’t think there is a better coach than <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> in terms of tactics and all the dimensions he thinks about football. He’s the best I’ve had</p>
