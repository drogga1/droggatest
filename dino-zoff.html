  <p><b>[<a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> Manager Dino Zoff on <a href="paul-gascoigne.html">Paul Gascoigne</a>]</b> He ate ice cream for breakfast, drank beer for lunch and when injured he blew up like a whale. But as a player? Oh, beautiful, beautiful. I loved that boy. He was a genius, an artist, but he made me tear my hair out</p>

  <p><b>[Dino Zoff on Silvio Gazzaniga’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup trophy]</b> It was really exciting to win this trophy. I must admit that <b>[Enzo]</b> Bearzot did an amazing job, being able to handle a difficult situation. Bearzot was exemplary, a commander and also very brave. I remember that there were many controversies in many regards but the squad was able to think solely about achieving excellent results. In the final I made the most important save of my career. I remember only so much joy</p>
