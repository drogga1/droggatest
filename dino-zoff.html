  <p><b>[<a href="lazio.html">Lazio</a> Manager Dino Zoff on <a href="paul-gascoigne.html">Paul Gascoigne</a>]</b> He ate ice cream for breakfast, drank beer for lunch and when injured he blew up like a whale. But as a player? Oh, beautiful, beautiful. I loved that boy. He was a genius, an artist, but he made me tear my hair out</p>

  <p><b>[Dino Zoff on Silvio Gazzaniga’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup trophy]</b> It was really exciting to win this trophy. I must admit that <b>[Enzo]</b> Bearzot did an amazing job, being able to handle a difficult situation. Bearzot was exemplary, a commander and also very brave. I remember that there were many controversies in many regards but the squad was able to think solely about achieving excellent results. In the final I made the most important save of my career. I remember only so much joy</p>

  <p><b>[Zoff believes that Gianluigi Donnarumma is capable of surpassing his own remarkable achievements]</b> I see him as even better than myself. He’s doing extraordinary things and he looks set to have a fabulous career. My only advice for him is that he remains humble and tries to improve, especially in terms of his technical skills, as some goalkeepers forget about <b>[working on]</b> them</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona would never come back from 4-0 down against Juventus]</b> Not at all. Juventus also saw, as well as the comeback, the 4-0 win for PSG against Barcelona. So I don’t think that result will amaze a team like Juve.<br /><br />They are still one of the best teams in the world. It’s true that some of the players have changed, but in attack they have the best - a headache for any defence. In any case, Juventus have gained a lot of experience since that final. Also in the final itself. They have brought in world-class players like Gonzalo Higuain and Sami Khedira, too. The team has grown a lot<br /><br />When we talk about Juventus, we have to talk about the block, not individuals. That has been the case for decades. And however much Barcelona want to win, this time they will be up against a really serious side<br /><br />I haven’t seen Ter Stegen that much, but for me Buffon is still the world’s most prestigious goalkeeper.<br /><br />I played many games in similar circumstances to Ter Stegen and I have to say it was always a pleasure for me. I was never afraid that a high defensive line could compromise me. The defences I played with were formidable, just like Barcelona’s. I don’t think it has changed too much. Playing with your feet is still secondary, even if you can create a play. It’s not decisive<br /><br />It’s obvious that goalkeepers can be more decisive than forwards. But when you see that in this sport, there are players competing like <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi, <b>[Cristiano]</b> Ronaldo and <b>[Zlatan]</b> Ibrahimovic, among others, you understand that for a goalkeeper, it’s impossible</p>

  <p><b>[Dino Zoff is among those who have defended the Juve coach]</b> I think it’s impossible to criticize him. Over the last few years he did amazing things, he won so many trophies. <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> has a big quality: he doesn’t get influenced by others.</p>

  <p><b>[On <a href="gianluigi-donnarumma.html">Gianluigi Donnarumma</a>]</b> He has become a man, he is more aware, he is an adult. With all the pressure he had on him, it wasn’t easy, but he has the maturity to realise where he’s going wrong. <a href="gianluigi-donnarumma.html">Donnarumma</a> is young and, like all young lads, can make mistakes or do incredible things. He has extraordinary quality and will have a very long career, but errors are part of human nature.</p>
