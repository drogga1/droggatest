  <p><b>[Leicester City legend Matt Elliott feels the threat posed by Manchester United’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic on Sunday would have been ‘snuffed out’ had N’Golo Kante still been at the King Power Stadium]</b> He covers that area, in-between the lines, Ibrahimovic was dropping in there and Kante would’ve snuffed that out, not a problem. Leicester’s problems? It’s a slight change of tact, they’re not as compact, they don’t defend as deep as last season. That made them tighter as a unit. If anything they tried to be more adventurous this season and paid the price for that. But Kante’s a big miss, without a doubt.<br /><br /><b>[Elliott believes the Foxes will stick with Claudio Ranieri for fear of further disrupting an already precarious situation]</b> They appointed him and I think they’ll stick with him and I think it’s the right thing to do. If they change, it’s going to add more turmoil to the situation. The players, whether they’re 100 per cent behind him at the moment is up in the air but they need to follow his direction</p>

  <p><b>[Matt Elliott says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>’s interest in Maddison won’t worry <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>]</b> Yes of course it’s vital for any team to keep your best players but I don’t think it’s anything that unduly worries the <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> manager and the board. Maddison is a top-class player, of course he is, but he’s still in the development stage and I don’t think he’s in any mad rush to be leaving <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>. Who would? Even if the big boys come in and make huge offers <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> are not in a situation where they need to sell. They have the financial backing, they have the progress they’re making, and they have the platform for the players to go and showcase themselves so I don’t think it’s anything that unduly worries <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a>. And even if one, or even two, were to go they show they have the reinforcements ready to come in<br /><br />This modern-day crop are going onto big things, I think that’s quite evident in how they’re playing. To be featuring in big games like this is part of their development but it’s something they’ll be able to handle. They’re almost expecting to be involved in these showcase events and long may it continue in the future. Part of the progression under <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> is to play in these big games, whether it’s in the Carabao Cup, <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, and who knows maybe in the Champions League next season. But without getting ahead of themselves I think they’ll be highly confident they can go on and reach the final at least and then see what happens</p>
