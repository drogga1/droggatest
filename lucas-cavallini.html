  <p><b>[Lucas Cavallini became that player when he signed a record-breaking deal with the Vancouver Whitecaps]</b> At that time, when I was a kid, it wasn’t easy playing with clubs or trying to get in at all. Since, things have started getting better here. In <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, there are more opportunities for kids, for youth, to make themselves something with soccer professionally. It’s a good step that <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is doing to involve the youth, to have professional soccer here in their home country instead of leaving here and going abroad<br /><br />I like that Vancouver came out to me, came to Mexico to speak to me, and everyone was just hyped for me to go there. The confidence in me was something special. It made me feel comfortable. The coach wanted me, he treated me as his No. 1 pick to come to Vancouver, and that was something special to me. I felt that it was necessary to go play there. Now that I’m here, I’m happy with my decision. I’m excited to give what this club needs<br /><br />It was an easy decision. you never know how life goes. You try to plan your life and your career, but it’s hard. There’s always something that gets in the middle or you change course. You have to go through obstacles sometimes and I was looking to leave at least my club. It was a good fit for me. It’s not something I expected, but at the end of the day I’m happy<br /><br />Individually, it was a good year for me. Playing for Canada, obviously, it was for the team as well. We could have done better, obviously. We had key highlights there: beating the U.S. for the first time in 34 years, that was great, but the Gold Cup you could say there’s a bitter taste and I think we should have done better. Our last game where we got eliminated, we deserved more. We deserved to at least make the finals, but what are you going to do? Those are experiences that you learn from. They only make you better<br /><br />That’s what we’re trying to make out of this national team: a brotherhood. We haven’t gotten to that stage yet, but we’re almost there. That takes time. We have big unity in this national team. We’ve worked together for two years, same players, same format, same system. That’s going to help us achieve our goals. I’m excited for what the future holds for us<br /><br /><b>[Making it to Qatar in 2022 may prove to be too much, too soon but, by 2026, the belief is that Canada will be ready]</b> It depends on us. It depends on players to change the face of our country and to change how we invest in order to grow players and make a better national team out of it, make better leagues, with the CPL now. It all depends on us now. We have a new generation, you could say a golden generation, but there’s still a lot to do. Making the World Cup would be huge. That would be a life-changer for everything</p>
