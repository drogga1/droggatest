  <p><b>[Hamza Choudhury has apologised for his rash challenge that hospitalised Jonathan Bamba during England’s Under-21 Euro clash opener with France]</b> I just want to let everyone know that I know I have let them down. I just want to get that message out there and really apologise. I remember that the ball was there to be won but, honestly, watching back it looked like I was over-aggressive. It wasn’t malicious and I didn’t want to hurt him whatsoever. I saw the ball and tried to take it but I mistimed it. I don’t think I have ever felt worse in my footballing career than I do right now. I have let the lads down, I have let the country down. I understand playing at this level comes with a certain pressure.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">The Foxes</a> man has clearly been distressed by the tackle but said that his team-mates have been really supportive]</b> I will go back and think about it. The next time I get in that situation, I won’t make that tackle. Right now, I am just upset. The lads were brilliant with me to be honest; they picked me up off the floor, they told me to keep my head up. But right now, I can’t. I just can’t. It’s a really difficult time</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> have reported alleged racist abuse of 22-year-old midfielder Hamza Choudhury to the police following their <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clash with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> on Saturday]</b> We are appalled by these comments, which the club has reported to the police and to the social media platform on which they were made. Discriminatory behaviour has no place in football or in society and we will seek the strongest possible course of action to be taken against those responsible</p>
