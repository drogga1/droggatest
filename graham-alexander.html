  <p><b>[<a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> Veteran Graham Alexander Afraid Owen Coyle Will Join <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>]</b> I don’t for definite, but it’s going on a little bit longer than probably was first thought. I think he’s away on holiday at the moment. Every player at <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> is hoping he stays. He’s been fantastic since he walked in the door, and, obviously, with the achievement of getting promotion we don’t want to lose out manager. Everyone’s hoping it gets put to bed and we see him in pre-season</p>

  <p><b>[Graham Alexander Asserts That <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> Will Not Be Overawed]</b> I think a few teams go up and don’t believe enough. But I know from my time with Scotland that you don’t put other players on a pedestal. The France games especially taught me that and I know the gaffer is a great believer in that too. Going back to the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> game in the Carling Cup, they got beaten at home for the first time in 86 games the week before we played them by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.<br /><br />The gaffer was saying, ‘See, it can be done.’ We were sitting there thinking, ‘But it was <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>!’ He was telling us we could do it if we kept believing. So we went out there thinking we were equals with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and won. It was a great feeling and that was the game I’d say made everyone properly believe we could get a result against anyone.<br /><br />He is a fair gaffer. He will have a go at you if he thinks your work rate or effort isn’t great. But if you make a mistake by getting on the ball, passing and playing football then he won’t. I liked the fact he never used the cup ties as a reason to say the players were feeling tired if we lost a game.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> defender Graham Alexander has stated that the club have enough firepower in their squad to be able to score goals next season]</b> It would be great to get as many people on the scoresheet as possible, like last pre-season. It’s about getting fit at the moment, but we want to get into a winning habit while also working hard to get our fitness levels. Training’s going really well and we put it into the game the other night. The lads played really well and scored some good goals and spread it around the team. With the amount of players we’ve got in the squad, the manager wants to give players more than 45 minutes now and give different people different games. Four or five of us were out on Tuesday but hopefully we’ll be involved <b>[tonight]</b></p>

  <p><b>[<a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> Veteran Graham Alexander Not Considering Retirement]</b> Playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is something I have looked forward to all my career. I have got this chance and I really want to take it and give it everything I have got. It’s a great fillip for me to have towards the end of my career - but hopefully not the end. I am loving it and hopefully I can play at this level for a couple more years yet.<br /><br />It’s a slightly different game to the Championship, with the pace of the players, and the finishing is of a higher standard. But I think you get a bit more time on the ball so, if you can use the ball and pass it, it’s a positive for you. I would like to think I can pass the ball reasonably well so I have adapted to that side. But, like everyone else, I am finding my feet and you look forward to the challenge every week. With the players you put yourself up against, it’s like a personal battle and a test every week</p>

  <p><b>[Graham Alexander urges his <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> teammates to show aggressive side during relegation battle]</b> I don’t think any player can look at that game <b>[against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> and think we were aggressive and competitive, because we weren’t. You can’t sweep it under the carpet. You’ve got to look at it and be critical of yourself and take what you did wrong and what you could do better into this next game. We’ve got to prove to ourselves and other people that we do care about the results and about our jobs<br /><br /><b>[<a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a> have now suffered four straight league defeats and another this weekend could spell the end for both Laws and his team’s top-flight adventure]</b> Maybe we’re too nice. Maybe we’re just relying on ourselves to outplay opponents, because we like to get the ball down and play. Maybe we think that’s enough at the moment, but obviously it’s not. You’ve got to do the dirty side of the game first.<br /><br />I think you’ve got to be competitive and aggressive in any game and at any standard, first and foremost, and you’ve got to be in the game and let your opponents know that you’re here to compete. I think we’ve got to learn from that and start the game at a high tempo, be aggressive and compete with teams before we can get the ball down. Hopefully we’ll take that into the last five games</p>
