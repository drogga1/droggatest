  <p><b>[Asako Takakura reacts after the Nadeshiko claimed their second successive Asian Women’s Cup following a 1-0 win over Australia]</b> I’d like to congratulate my players from deep in my heart. This tournament we played in the Japanese way and won the title, and that gives us confidence, but I can go further and I must go further, so let’s see what happens</p>

  <p><b>[Scotland women vs Japan women. Coach Asako Takakura accepts the Scotland game is a must-win for her side]</b> Yes we must win and every player understands this. Scotland’s players are playing at high levels throughout Europe. I couldn’t pick out one player who will be dangerous to us. They are all disciplined and quick, so we’ll have to watch that. We are at a disadvantage in terms of height, but each player will work to cover for the others.</p>

  <p><b>[Japan clash a reminder of England’s progress. Asked which England players she fears tomorrow]</b> All of them. Seriously, England’s squad is full of excellent players. Without us giving everything that we’ve got, we won’t be able to win the game</p>
