  <p><b>[The former Old Trafford full back has warned <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> about targeting the wrong type of players in the coming transfer window]</b> It has taken too long to get back on track. Two years should be enough to do that but now it’s been seven years. We did some things wrong. We started signing expensive players and giving them a lot of money. I don’t agree with that. Just because a player is £150m does not mean he’s good for the team. It depends on the character of the player. We have made some mistakes but I hope now that we can get back on track<br /><br />They should go for the players who want to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Not just because <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are going to pay you. Look at <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a>. How hard did he play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>? He wanted to play. How much did <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> pay for him? Not much. You have to be clever.<br /><br />You have to see that the player wants to play for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. You have to be clever. <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is a goalscorer. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> is very, very good, but first of all you have to see the character of the player and see if they really want to do well for United, not just coming for the money.</p>

  <p><b>[Brazilian fullback Rafael da Silva believes <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> midfielder <a href="corentin-tolisso.html">Corentin Tolisso</a> would be a perfect signing for his former club Manchester United]</b> One of the best midfielders I’ve played with. I think he will be perfect for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Hope he goes there. I think it made me grow mentally, it hardened me. It forges a mindset. I knew that I had to work hard to get back to the top level. I have to continue like this and find my true level before my injury. It depends only on me. I have to give myself a little time. With Bayern, I worked a lot too. I made good preparations. It’s up to me to continue like this<br /><br />It has taken too long to get back on track.
