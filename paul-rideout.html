  <p><b>[How <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s ‘dogs of war’ rose from depths to beat <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and win <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup]</b> It wasn’t an easy header. When it came off the crossbar and bounced I had to challenge and I had to generate power and I had one side only to head. I got it perfectly right. You knew he’d lost the dressing room because he was an idiot. He had no clear idea of how to put anything right and players see that<br /><br /><b>[Everything turned on Walker’s dismissal in November 1994 and the arrival from Oldham Athletic of Joe Royle, a 1970 league champion as an <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> player, and his assistant Willie Donachie. Graham Stuart, Rideout’s strike partner on FA Cup final day, explains]</b> As soon as Big Joe walked through the gates, everything changed. He was very astute, very experienced. He got the senior players on his side straight away. He felt we were a bit of a soft touch before he came and he put bodies in the middle of the park that were energetic, could get around, could make tackles</p>
