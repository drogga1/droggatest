  <p><b>[Hibernian goalkeeper Conrad Logan made his club debut and returned to action after 16 months out due to injury and saved two penalties against Dundee United to help Hibs advance to the Scottish Cup final]</b> I feel very happy for friends and family that have stuck by me in this time. There was a lot of messages and phone calls and everyone’s just happy and proud obviously because of my injury and being out for so long. They’re just excited and happy. They know it’s been a tough time over the 15, 16 months when you’re out injured and nothing’s really happening so it’s nice for them as well. It was a dream debut at the time but I was brought back down to earth quickly when I rang my daughter, who was watching it on telly. I said, ‘did you watch the game?’ and she said, ‘I did but why did you dive the wrong way for one of the penalties?</p>
