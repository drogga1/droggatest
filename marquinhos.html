We must not make the same mistakes if we want to be champions, but when you take a slap, you learn a lot. We must immediately get back to work. The fans will see a different Paris in the next game.</p>

Plus my family is feeling well in Paris. Things are going well and I would love to stay here. I hope to sign a renewal. It does not only depend on me, but it is looking good.<br /><br />It is hard to explain this difficult spell. You always have to win at PSG. A draw is already regarded as a bad result. But PSG are capable of doing anything. We are aware of our abilities and we are confident the best is yet to come. We are working to get out of this situation. Everything will soon be forgotten</p>

He’s a very good player. At his age, it’s not easy to put in successive performances in Ligue 1 that are so strong. He’s gone into the France squad, he’s in great form, he’s scoring goals and will be a very important player for France and Monaco. He’s got a great future and I hope that he continues to work hard and does not stop because there’s still a lot for him to learn.</p>

They need to keep working but I’m confident, I know they will find the perfect understanding on the field.<br /><br />It was easy for Neymar to feel as part of the team. He’s smart and he knows that it’s very important. The integration of Mbappe was also natural and quick. Concerning the foreign arrivals, they know that they have to speak French. Dani Alves understands French because he plays alongside many French players but he asks me how to say ‘orange juice’ at the restaurant, for example.

Cavani came to PSG more or less at the same time as me. In the dressing room, we usually sit next to one another. He is a good guy, a very hard worker, and I only have good things to say about him.<br /><br />I don’t know Suarez very well, but I believe he and Cavani have a similar style. They have that Uruguayan style and for them losing the ball almost doesn’t exit. They consider their team-mates and are always working for others. Both are very challenging opponents. They’re a really a powerful front-two. I have faced them before and I know very well how much quality they have</p>

Everyone is happy with the work he does. I say that on behalf of the team. He is a very intelligent coach, he puts a good atmosphere in the locker room. We are doing good things this year with him. I hope he will benefit from continuity to put his philosophy in place for years. We want to do beautiful things with him. The aims of the season are always to bring back trophies. It is these victories that give joy to the fans, to our families and to ourselves. We have an important game in the semi-finals <b>[of the Coupe de France against Nantes]</b>. It is essential to win.<br /><br />We know the context when we come to play here. Toulouse always put us in difficulty with a low block, tight. We had to find solutions, with a lot of injuries and when we came back from the international break. It always takes a little time to get back to normal. We tried to take advantage of the spaces we had, to remain patient but also to play forward. We looked for Kylian and our attackers in behind and in the end his goal helped us. We hope that Kylian will continue like this. We know the talent he has, the strength he has. When he has an opportunity, it is rare that he does not score. He is often told to remain calm and positive. Sometimes he tries, he tries again and it does not happen. And then, the ball crosses the line and he saves us</p>

Whether we have the ball or not, if we do not think for each other, well…When things go well, we win, it’s easy. But we know our responsibilities here at PSG, a club loved by many people, but also hated by many. We must stay united. It’s too easy to say that the season is over. We can not continue to present a face like this, otherwise we will take slaps from supporters and the media and give reason to our haters. This is one of the most difficult moments, because we can not give a good answer and it’s been a while. Next season? We are preparing it now, but we can not play four shitty matches. We are PSG, we are the champion, We must take pleasure and give joy to people.</p>

Nobody wants to be on the bench on a match like this, at the Bernabeu. He is a player who takes his responsibilities, especially in this kind of match. He takes the ball to be aggressive and decisive. In matches like this one, it’s good to have him with you. He’s a different person on the team and I think he’s going to play a good game. Keylor is an experienced goalkeeper who has won important titles. In Paris, he has already shown that he is a high-level goalkeeper. It is important for a team to have a goalkeeper who gives us serenity and confidence. He is doing that</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="psg.html">PSG</a> defender Marquinhos admitted his side found it difficult against their opponents but feels they improved in the second half]</b> It’s not easy to beat <a href="nantes-fc.html">Nantes</a>. They play well together as a team. They started the season well. I think we tried to play forward with speed, we lost the ball a lot too. I think in the second half we managed better, we controlled the game, we tried to play forward and we kept the ball</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="psg.html">PSG</a> condemn immature criticism of Marquinhos after birth of his child]</b> His wife was in the hospital for two days waiting to give birth, the club decided that Marqui stays with her. The club also conveys all its congratulations and wishes of happiness to Marqui and his wife, who gave birth yesterday afternoon to their second child. It is with dismay that we heard the immature and hurtful remarks made yesterday in L’Equipe du Soir. Coming from people who give us year-round lessons on the values of sport and life, we are surprised by the mediocrity of these remarks<br /><br />Very happy for you Marquinhos, as well as for the mother. Enjoy this new moment of happiness with your family</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="psg.html">PSG</a> defender Marquinhos signs new contract until 2024]</b> Paris and <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> have every argument for me to stay here and extend my contract. It’s an ambitious club that still wants to do great things, making football and club history. Then there’s the city side, the family side. My family is really very, very good here. I really feel at home here, I’ve got everything I need right here, and so that’s why the choice is quick. This is the seventh season. Six-and-a-half years since I signed, I look back and see how much <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and I have accomplished. We’ve done great things. I think it’s really a very special club. We just have to keep living this beautiful story together</p>

  <p><b>[Set to host <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> in Paris next month, Marquinhos has called on his side to seize the initiative in the second leg]</b> I think we still had possession of the ball in the first half but we were not very intense and active in our game. We missed a lot of balls.<br /><br />They tried to counter the mistakes we made and that’s where they hurt. Wwe conceded two goals on small details that made the difference with a striker <b>[<a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>]</b> who really has a sense of goal; maybe he is not too much in the match but the ball arrives and he puts it in. But still we managed to score a goal, it’s important for the return match. By the return match we will work well for all the players are in top form and we can make a very big match. It will take a mentality of winners. They have the score and we have to make a good victory at home, be aggressive, solid behind because we know that it is important not to take a goal at home.<br /><br />These are the things that are clear: more intensity, more aggressiveness in our counter-pressing because it was lacking today. It’s the little details that make the difference and it is certain that we will do better because otherwise we will not succeed</p>

  <p><b>[Marquinhos feels <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> must work hard to improve their defensive performances after leaking seven goals in their past two <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> games]</b> On the one hand we are really very strong offensively, but on the other we concede a lot of goals. As defenders we really have to think about what we can do best. In this match it was mainly on set-pieces. We really have to work better collectively</p>

  <p><b>[Marquinhos wants <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> clash with <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> postponed]</b> That would be a shame. If it is to be played behind closed doors, I think the best thing would be to cancel because we want our supporters and they will want theirs too. I hope it doesn’t happen. If this decision is made, I think we will ask to cancel the match to play with our supporters</p>

  <p><b>[Marquinhos says <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> planned mocking of <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> after PSG-Dortmund tie in advance]</b> He likes that. <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is not just a football player, he is not afraid and always responds to provocations. After his goal, I asked him if he had changed his mind. He warned me, I told him to wait until the end of the match, but he told me to leave it and not to stop it</p>
