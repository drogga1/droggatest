  <p><b>[Marquinhos says <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a>’s unexpected comments about potentially leaving <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> have not been explained to his team-mates]</b> I didn’t really understand the message he wanted to get across. I think he talked about it with the <b>[club’s]</b> leaders and maybe the coach. He didn’t say anything about it to us. You have to ask him about the meaning of his sentence. We have important players; he’s one of the most important. He’s still young, but he’s strong in the mind and responsible for what he says and what he does on the field.<br /><br />The club matters first and foremost. It’s more important than all of the players. Whether we stay or go, the club will still be here</p>

He is an important player, he’s also a friend, a guy I love, and I really hope he’ll stay. We have not talked about his future, I guess there are already a lot of people who only talk to him about it.<br /><br /><b>[The centre-back also revealed that <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>’s recovery is going well]</b> He’s a friend, so we just wanted to know if he was feeling better, mentally and physically. He can make movements with his foot, he can already hit the ball a little at home. At the beginning of this he was really sad but today he is better, and that’s why it made us happy to see it<br /><br /><b>[Captain <a href="thiago-silva.html">Thiago Silva</a> rumoured to be a target for former club <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>]</b> When I arrived at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, he was my idol and I wanted to imitate him.

  <p><b>[Brazil defender Marquinhos has revealed how he was battling with diarrhoea and vomiting when given the ‘very difficult’ task of marking <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> in their win over Argentina on Tuesday]</b> It was not easy, no. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> was having an inspired night, not only him but the whole Argentine team, they made a great game. It was very difficult, but I think the team managed to cancel out the attacks of Argentina well. The ones we could not had some lucky chances with balls hitting the post and Alisson made some great saves. That makes a strong and solid team. On the day of the game, I ended up suffering a virus, and I spent the day at the hotel. It was very complicated, I had diarrhoea and was vomiting. I still managed to play, but with the effort I put in it worsened and eventually I had to leave the game<br /><br /><b>[Marquinhos says his condition only got worse after he was substituted for Miranda in the 64th minute]</b> After the game, it ended up getting worse too]&lt;/b&gt; I had a fever and I ended up having to go to the stadium infirmary, but I managed to get an injection and I feel better</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> star Marquinhos has outlined his personal ambition to become the best defender in the world]</b> Being the best defender in the world means a lot - it’s a personal target, which can also help to reach the team’s goals<br /><br />The big ‘tifo’ from the fans for me? It was a great feeling. I had all my family with me, my mother too, and on the pitch I always give 100% of myself. I think that’s what the fans admire in a player. If at some point I have to be a captain of <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, I’ll try to do it in the best possible way, but it’s with the experience, the time and the history you have with the club that dictates who wears the armband, which is why <a href="thiago-silva.html">Thiago Silva</a> deserves it. Could I finish my career here? Yes.

  <p><b>[Marquinhos backs <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> after <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> transfer saga]</b> Ney has always been thorough. He is someone who doesn’t do things by halves. It shows on the field. When he takes the ball he wants to be decisive. Once he’s on the pitch, even after all that happened during the transfer window and the other stories, he’s back on the pitch to win, to score, to make a difference. He’s not hiding. He proves that he is totally committed alongside us<br /><br />There are other things to say as well. He worked well during the week, he did everything right. I think we should put more emphasis on the good things he does rather than the negative things. If you put all this in the balance, the positive things that he does <b>[are superior]</b> but there are always some negative points that people want to talk about because it is Ney! And when you speak about Ney, it resonates around the world.<br /><br />As a friend, he always does good things but we don’t talk about them. He always wants to perform, to win. He’s a real competitor, not just in football. In everything he does, he wants to be the best, that is always in his head. If he hasn’t been in recent years, he is certainly going to want to show it this season. I hope it’s going to be a very good season for him and for us</p>

It’s a very important game for the club. Everyone is in love with this player, not just <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. Even at his age, he is already very important for his club. We are lucky to have him with us. He is an important player who can make us win matches<br /><br />I think <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> is ready to start. Nobody wants to be on the bench on a match like this, at the Bernabeu. He is a player who takes his responsibilities, especially in this kind of match. He takes the ball to be aggressive and decisive. In matches like this one, it’s good to have him with you. He’s a different person on the team and I think he’s going to play a good game. Keylor is an experienced goalkeeper who has won important titles. In Paris, he has already shown that he is a high-level goalkeeper. It is important for a team to have a goalkeeper who gives us serenity and confidence. He is doing that</p>

It’s an ambitious club that still wants to do great things, making football and club history. Then there’s the city side, the family side. My family is really very, very good here. I really feel at home here, I’ve got everything I need right here, and so that’s why the choice is quick. This is the seventh season. Six-and-a-half years since I signed, I look back and see how much <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and I have accomplished. We’ve done great things. I think it’s really a very special club.

We missed a lot of balls.<br /><br />They tried to counter the mistakes we made and that’s where they hurt. Wwe conceded two goals on small details that made the difference with a striker <b>[<a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a>]</b> who really has a sense of goal; maybe he is not too much in the match but the ball arrives and he puts it in. But still we managed to score a goal, it’s important for the return match. By the return match we will work well for all the players are in top form and we can make a very big match. It will take a mentality of winners. They have the score and we have to make a good victory at home, be aggressive, solid behind because we know that it is important not to take a goal at home.<br /><br />These are the things that are clear: more intensity, more aggressiveness in our counter-pressing because it was lacking today. It’s the little details that make the difference and it is certain that we will do better because otherwise we will not succeed</p>
