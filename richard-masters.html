  <p><b>[Richard Masters says The Premier League will not suffer any ill effects as a result of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union]</b> I don’t think there is a scenario where the Premier League will be badly affected by Brexit. We have to come to an arrangement with the Home Office at some point. Obviously no-one knows when Brexit is going to happen<br /><br />We’re in constant dialogue with the Home Office and <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> and making sure that our clubs can continue to get access from talent from Europe and beyond. I think we will find appropriate accommodation and our clubs will be able to recruit the players they want from abroad. At the same time we are developing a cohort of players through the academy system and we have to keep the balance right. We have a team of people involved in those conversations, looking at it, talking to all of the different stakeholders involved<br /><br /><b>[One of the solutions mooted for the Premier League in the event of a no-deal Brexit was for homegrown player quotas to be introduced]</b> We aren’t convinced by the arguments that limiting the number of foreign players and increasing quotas on homegrown players will benefit the England team. We certainly think something like that would have a negative impact on the Premier League - and that’s what we are talking to <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> about. Our clubs want to have full access to talent - and that is our focus<br /><br /><b>[The Premier League, according to Masters, provides the country a unique sporting a cultural asset]</b> I think the government and politicians appreciate what English football in general and the Premier League in particular brings to the country. The Premier League is an important part of ‘Brand Britain’ around the world and I don’t think the government would want to do anything that has a negative impact on the Premier League or the English national team. That’s why I am sure we will sort it out</p>

  <p><b>[Interim Premier League chief executive Richard Masters is confident that the introduction of VAR in the 2019-20 season will have a minimal impact on the pace of matches]</b> I have no doubt it will create some controversy because it is about the big decisions but we are prepared for that. We have spent two years working up to this point, and we were committed to doing it in our heads for two years. We have been training and testing and making sure when it happens, particularly on Saturday afternoons when we have got multiple matches going on, that we have a number of VARs trained. We feel that is done and we are ready to launch it.<br /><br />I think fans want to see those clear and obvious errors cleared up, but they also want to see the game moved on quickly. You’re probably going to see the referees not use the review area - which is that camera to the side of the pitch - as often as you might see in other competitions. You have to operate within the guidelines that the IFAB (International Football Association Board) gives you to operate VAR. But, hopefully it will work and it will clear up those decisions and it won’t interrupt the fast-flowing pace of the Premier League. Those are basically our two objectives</p>

Our clubs are already doing vital work in this area, whether that is within academies or working closely with local communities and schools to support mental wellbeing. All our clubs, their staff, managers and players are backing this campaign to help remove stigma and encourage fans to talk openly about their own mental health. Football has a major role to play and we hope that by joining the EFL and <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> for these weekends of action we can change the conversation</p>

  <p><b>[Premier League chief says ‘very real threat’ clubs could go out of business as he defends furloughing]</b> It is important to recognise that these decisions need to be taken with the short, medium and long term all in mind. Not only is our industry facing losses now, but to be realistic, we must also base our plans on full recovery being some distance away. Ultimately, the very heavy losses that we face will have to be dealt with or else clubs and other enterprises who depend on football for income will go out of business. We do not say this lightly, or to justify clubs’ decisions; it is a very real threat<br /><br />The furlough scheme announced by government is meant for the whole economy, including many enterprises which might be regarded as providing entertainment or otherwise dependent on elite talent. We do agree with you that restraint needs to be shown by all and we and our clubs are doing just that. Individual clubs will need to make these decisions based on their own forecasts as each club will have its own unique position</p>

  <p><b>[Richard Masters says Every <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club would rather play at home over neutral venues]</b> Just to reiterate that, I think everybody would prefer to play home and away if at all possible. And I think it’s clear to see that some clubs feel more strongly about that than others. It is an ongoing dialogue and obviously we’ve been talking to - since Covid-19 became an issue - we’ve been talking to the authorities about the conditions in which we could get <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> back up and running and taking all that advice on board<br /><br />We have protocols created and reviewed, we have a testing company appointed, but the important consultation with players and managers is the next step, nothing has been agreed and nothing will be agreed until we have spoken to both the managers and the players. We discussed the training protocols, they’re under medical advice and we’re working closely with government still. No decisions will be made until after we have talked to players and managers and those meetings are scheduled for later this week. We have appointed a testing company. We talked about neutral venues - obviously it is the preference of all our clubs to play at home if at all possible, but all must be cognisant of what authorities are telling us and we will continue with that conversation. We won’t be playing until the middle of June, it doesn’t seem quite right to be talking about playing before we’ve actually taken the decision to return to the first stage of training, but obviously in terms of how those matches will take place, there’s a lot of water to pass under the bridge and we will continue to assess the circumstances then.</p>

  <p><b>[Premier League clubs discuss curtailing season for first time]</b> It was the first time we discussed curtailment - it’s still our aim to finish the season obviously but it’s important to discuss all the options with our clubs. Obviously we reflected on Boris’ statement last night and the fuller statement that came out right at the end of the meeting and what that means for us. I’m happy to reveal it was discussed for the first time but the contents of that discussion have to remain confidential. What I can say is that all of the talk was about finishing the season. No conclusions were reached on any other models. Those are future conversations we may need to have. There was a desire to see all the different implications, the adaptions, if you like, to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> model as we know in order to play out the season and then discuss what the fairest way forward is.<br /><br />What we decided today - obviously this issue has been highlighted and we’ve discussed it at the last two meetings - but we’ve been working as far as possible to ensure that clubs complete the season with the same squad they had prior to the suspension<br /><br />What was agreed today is that players can extend their contracts beyond June 30 until the end of the season but it must be agreed by both parties and a later date can be scheduled for that; no later than June 23</p>

We have done everything we possibly can to make return to training as safe as possible. We think it is safe to return. We have to respect players’ decisions not to return to training. I would be comfortable to return to training<br /><br />We’re talking to the authorities about that.
