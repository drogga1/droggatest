<h4 id="2018-06-27-publish-illusions-of-progress-towards-thai-democracy">2018 06 27 Publish: Illusions of progress towards Thai democracy</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>22 May 2018 marked four years since Thailand’s last coup - the 12th successful one (out of 19) in Thailand since 1932. The motives behind the most recent coup were complex and depend on who you ask. But one thing is clear: throughout its history and in the years since the 2014 coup, Thailand’s fascistic tendencies have emerged through the crevices of an imaginary democratic state. Thailand was never able to establish its democratic bearings and has been constantly held back by military–monarchy interests<br /><br />At the heart of matters in 2014 was the need for the ancien regime to reassert its dominance, just as it had been concerned with losing power under prime minister <a href="thaksin-shinawatra.html">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> in 2001–06. To really understand what is going on in Thailand today, one must critically examine the ‘Thaksin issue’.<br /><br />The problem from the military’s perspective was the relative success of Thaksin and the elected leaders who followed him. The military–monarchy complex remains fearful of Thaksin’s ongoing popularity and his potential to mobilise mass support. The military government has even tried to copy a number of Thaksin’s social and economic policies without credit - and been unsuccessful due to a lack of popular participation<br /><br />In Thailand, for a government to be allowed by the monarchy to govern, it must be ineffectual and irresolute, and not be seen to be undermining the standing of the palace or the palace’s control over the network circulation of wealth and benefaction<br /><br />In Thailand today, it is enough to accuse a prominent person of corruption, whether they are guilty or not, to bring about their downfall. The rest is then left to a complicit establishment media. This, combined with consistent propaganda, has left little room to discuss the Thaksin issue<br /><br />Thailand’s pro-democracy red shirt movement, which continues to appear in the media as the country’s decisive menace, has been decimated. Surviving leaders and those not currently incarcerated are under constant surveillance, and the movement has fragmented and been implanted with military agents. This makes it impossible, at this stage, for it to become a mass movement again<br /><br />With possible elections in February 2019, the coup’s leader General Prayut Chan-o-cha is pork barrelling in red-shirt areas and forging alliances with anti-democrats. No electoral campaigning is allowed for Thailand’s registered political parties, though the junta can be on the campaign trail all it wants with all the resources of the state<br /><br />The military constitution of 2017, signed off by a junta-appointed national assembly, does not allow for a free and fair election nor does it establish a basis for democracy. The 2017 constitution, which followed a sham referendum, allows the military to control politics for at least the next 20 years<br /><br />There are also reasons why the yellow shirts now want to terminate the junta’s tenure, which they cheered in 2014. The ruling junta has failed in the last four years to achieve anything for them, only spending big for themselves. The economy is skewed and corruption is rife, with the military and their government lackeys faring quite well, while much of the rest of society is running on empty<br /><br />This is the scenario that confronts the new Future Forward Party under <a href="thanatorn-juangroongruangkit.html">Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit</a>, its rich, ambitious, neoliberal and business-focussed leader. The party’s co-founder <a href="piyabutr-saengkanokkul.html">Piyabutr Saengkanokkul</a> is more left-leaning, but Piyabutr is a far cry from his former teacher at Thammasat University Worachet Pakeerut of the Nitirat group, an association of legal scholars advocating for reform that has been silenced by the regime<br /><br />In order to challenge Thailand’s dominant military–monarchy hegemony and its power over public debate and politics, new movements and sites of struggle must emerge. It is the intrusion of the junta’s continuing false ideology and tradition along with the illusion of historical progress that has created Thailand’s current dilemma</p>
