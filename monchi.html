  <p><b>[Monchi reveals why Roma snubbed <a href="daley-blind.html">Daley Blind</a> offer]</b> We talked with Jonathan Silva even before the window opened, in expectation of <a href="emerson.html">Emerson</a> leaving. Blind was offered to us three or four days ago, but we decided he was not the right player, even from an economic point of view, which is important.<br /><br /><b>[Roma were reportedly in danger of losing their highly-rated goalkeeper Alisson as rumours of a late bid from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> spread. However, Monchi denied claims that an offer was made]</b> No, no, Now let me rest for a week before we start talking about the next transfer period.</p>

  <p><b>[Roma sporting director Monchi insists <a href="alessandro-florenzi.html">Alessandro Florenzi</a> has not been issued with an ultimatum as the club attempt to meet the in-demand Italy international’s wage demands]</b> We have not moved forward much. It’s a difficult negotiation because he is a great player. I think that Roma have made a strong offer to him, a very good offer, but I understand that he too has his thoughts and requests. I am confident, but not much has changed in the last few days. There will never be an ultimatum, Alessandro is a son of this club. What will happen will happen, I am fighting every day to get the renewal done and I have faith. But we are still a little apart<br /><br /><b>[Justin Kluivert, Davide Santon and <a href="javier-pastore.html">Javier Pastore</a> headline the other arrivals with sought-after Brazil shot-stopper Alisson appearing increasingly likely to stay]</b> We have not received any offers, so it’s difficult to have an idea about figures if there has not been any offer. Now Alisson will go on holiday and he will join up with the squad after that</p>

  <p><b>[Wissam Ben Yedder continues to be linked with a move away from Sevilla, with the France forward reportedly a target for Manchester United should they sell Romelu Lukaku]</b> There’s nothing new. He has one week left of holiday and will report for pre-season on the 13th <b>[of July]</b> to travel to the United States. From then on, the <b>[transfer]</b> market is open and there are possibilities for any player of our squad. As of today, no offer has arrived.</p>

  <p><b>[Sevilla sporting director Monchi on <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Javier Hernandez</a>’s sacrifice]</b> I’ve never seen a player cut his wages the way he has done in order to come here. That’s a sign. He has made an important financial sacrifice to come here, and when I think about that I realize it can only be down to his true desire to play for <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>. I think he is among the best strikers in the world. Javier has goals, has quality, he’s fast and he’s a good finisher</p>

  <p><b>[Hernandez reportedly took a significant pay cut to join <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> over the summer, a sacrifice which was not lost on the club’s director of football Monchi]</b> <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Javier Hernandez</a> will give us a lot because at 31 years old, I see him at the peak of his career. He arrived completely convinced by the project. Rarely have I seen a player who has sacrificed so much to sign for this club. How he has gambled on coming to <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>, it’s a huge example of the level the club is now at</p>

  <p><b>[Sevilla chief Monchi says he would have taken team off after <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> profit from VAR controversy]</b> Everyone saw the action. There’s no footballing, technical or tactical analysis after such a clear incident that defines the game. There’s nothing more to analyse about it. It’s absurd. If they had ruled out the second goal, I would have come down to the pitch and taken the team off. We leave here satisfied with the game despite the defeat because <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> are a very big team. We’re angry, outraged, and <b>[…]</b> I stop there</p>

  <p><b>[Monchi says <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> have not been in touch with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> over a possible transfer deal for Ivan Rakitic]</b> It is not known what will happen to soccer, therefore we are not going to spend money when we do not know what income we will have. We will not do it yet, neither in purchases nor in renewals. There is no negotiation with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> for <a href="ivan-rakitic.html">Rakitic</a>. I have read Ivan’s wish to return to <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> one day. And I thank him for his words and his interest in returning, but right now talking about the market is risky. You can’t say we’re interested in anyone because it’s unrealistic. <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> is not making movements for anyone. We have not made movements because we do not know how the pandemic will end. Talking about paying a transfer fee today does not go with the path we are on. I would gain adulation <b>[from the fans]</b> if I say that we are working on bringing in players, but it is not the case</p>

  <p><b>[Monchi defends <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> players after lockdown-breaking party]</b> Those involved have publicly apologised, that’s not easy. <a href="lucas-ocampos.html">Lucas Ocampos</a>, Franco Vazquez, <a href="luuk-de-jong.html">Luuk de Jong</a> and <a href="ever-banega.html">Ever Banega</a> made a thoughtless mistake and they have assumed responsibility for it. For me, the important thing is that they have apologised voluntarily. I think it’s also an example of apologising at a moment in which we’re all making mistakes. All this is new, it has caught us off guard and <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>, regarding compliance with the sporting protocols, both from the National Sports Council and <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, I think we are being a model club. It’s impossible to get a 10 but I think we are getting a 9.5. The important thing is there was a mistake which they recognised, and above all with the capacity they have had to apologise<br /><br /><b>[Monchi feels the team are in good shape and ready to get back on the field]</b> We’re satisfied. The amount of work from the beginning is optimal. Little by little we’re coming up to that moment which we’re all waiting for, which is being able to train as a group. I hope this process lasts as little as possible because training collectively is the most real thing. At the end of it all, without friendlies and with the amount of time we were stopped, with the competition being so close, collective training sessions now seem key. We’ve all pushed and fought for football to return. We’re missing something important, which are fans, but the safety and health conditions hinder that and we have to approach it as something which isn’t ideal, but necessary. I think it’s everyone’s triumph. Clearly <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> have backed it strongly and have led the way for all of us to push too. It’s an achievement and an important step in order to return to normality.</p>
