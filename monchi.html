  <p><b>[AS Roma coach Eusebio Di Francesco has insisted that Edin Dzeko still wants to give his all for the club]</b> It’s been too often now that newspapers have spoken about Roma as a club that is looking to change everything. I even read that we’re allegedly selling players without their knowledge. This could not be further from the truth. That we have numerous quality players, that will always attract the interest of top clubs, is not our fault - or a problem. If concrete offers come through, it’ll be my duty as sporting director to weigh them up, just as my offers are assessed when I contact other sporting directors. It was what I did at Sevilla and, fortunately, that yielded decent results. Just as I did then, I’m in a position to make the decisions I feel are right. I can tell you, with 100% certainty, that I’ve made three times more calls about bringing players here to Roma than calls I’ve received.<br /><br />I want to be clear with you all about one thing: Roma are not going around the world soliciting offers for our players and we certainly do not want to dismantle the playing staff. In fact it’s the opposite, and I say to the fans that our objective is always the same: to improve the squad. A sporting director is always pleased when the names of players he is following do not appear in the papers, but do not thing that we are sleeping on the job</p>

  <p><b>[AS Roma were able to push Liverpool in a deal for Mohamed Salah to around €50 million]</b> At the end of the day, we could reach €50m with bonuses, but at that moment we had to sell and that was an important option. The Neymar and Kylian Mbappe transfers changed the market, but at that moment it was necessary that we sell. I still think the price could’ve been better for Salah, but it did give us the possibility of making other moves. When I arrived, the Liverpool offer for Salah was €32m plus €3m in bonuses. In today’s football, players go wherever they want to. The figures are important, because at the end of the day we are a business, but the fans cannot be bought. In my years at Sevilla, people counted the trophies and those are so far missing at Roma.<br /><br />I understand the fans perfectly well, I know they don’t want to talk about numbers, they just want to win, but that is my job. We have to build a club that doesn’t just win, but does so consistently over time. Fans don’t want promises, they want results. I accept all of that, but ask them for a little faith. It takes time. We’ve got to stay quiet and work harder to find the right path towards what the fans want.<br /><br /><b>[On Emerson Palmieri]</b> We had started talking with Chelsea about Emerson and then they asked us about Edin. We told them to make an offer and we would consider it. Chelsea never offered what we were asking for, though, and Dzeko didn’t reach an agreement with them either. We were not 100 percent convinced about selling Dzeko, but if he had gone, we would have brought in a replacement. <b>[Olivier]</b> Giroud was a serious option, as was <b>[Michy]</b> Batshuayi.</p>

  <p><b>[Monchi - Meet the Roma ‘transfer genius’ looking to break Liverpool hearts in Europe again]</b> We go looking for unknown players in places where we know the richer teams won’t go because they don’t think they will find anyone talented enough for them. For the first five months we watch a lot of football but with no particular aim: we’re just accumulating data. Every month we produce an ideal XI for each league. Then in December we start watching players who appeared regularly in different contexts - home, away, international - to build the broadest possible profile.<br /><br />There is really no secret. We watch a lot of football, we travel a lot, we work hard. And, one imagines, to aid his negotiations with Premier League clubs. England is a good market. It was he who negotiated Mo Salah’s sale to Liverpool last summer - a rare mistake in the market, perhaps?<br /><br />Nobody takes a ‘great economic results’ banner to a football match. <b>[Asked whether it was more important to buy well or sell well]</b> Neither, the priority is to win trophies</p>

  <p><b>[Monchi has joined their voices to the chorus of those calling for Video Assistant Referees to be added to the Champions League]</b> We conceded a goal that was offside in the first leg, here we had two penalties not given, one of which was a clear red card. It’s time to raise our voices, not just Roma either, as Juventus suffered the same against Real Madrid. Italian football has to raise its voice, because what we saw tonight was shocking. It’s playing with the hearts of all the fans. I don’t understand why VAR is not used in the most important club competition in the world. I don’t get it. There are still mistakes, but many fewer than we see otherwise. It’s not just damage on an economic level, but also for the passion and hard work. The lads in the locker room were really angry, as we gave 100 per cent in the second half and were excellent. We must introduce VAR in the Champions League, because it’s fundamental. I don’t know why UEFA don’t want it. I really think it’s necessary, because fans might joke that the final with VAR would be Bayern Munich-Roma, but it’s actually true.</p>

The amount of work from the beginning is optimal. Little by little we’re coming up to that moment which we’re all waiting for, which is being able to train as a group. I hope this process lasts as little as possible because training collectively is the most real thing. At the end of it all, without friendlies and with the amount of time we were stopped, with the competition being so close, collective training sessions now seem key. We’ve all pushed and fought for football to return. We’re missing something important, which are fans, but the safety and health conditions hinder that and we have to approach it as something which isn’t ideal, but necessary. I think it’s everyone’s triumph. Clearly <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> have backed it strongly and have led the way for all of us to push too. It’s an achievement and an important step in order to return to normality.</p>
