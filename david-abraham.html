<blockquote>
  <p>[David Abraham shared a football pitch with Lionel Messi before the Barcelona star became a household name] He was a very calm, a very shy guy. He never wanted to be the centre of attention outside the pitch, always speaking very quietly. A few years later we met again in a Champions League match between Barcelona and Basel. After the final whistle, we had a very nice and friendly conversation. He is really a normal person. He used to like playing PlayStation, like most people.<br /><br />At the moment, he’s definitely the world’s best. Whether he is the best of all time, I don’t know. What [Diego Armando] Maradona did for Argentina at the time was really great. Messi could now win three World Cups with Argentina, but they will not have the same meaning as the Maradona triumph. You cannot compare that with each other. At that time, Argentina was recovering from a lost war against England and Maradona scored twice in the quarter-finals against England and later led Argentina to the World Cup victory. This triumph created an incredible joy throughout the country. Therefore, one you can’t make comparisons. That’s impossible</p>
