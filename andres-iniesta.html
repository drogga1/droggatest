  <p><b>[Barcelona legend Andres Iniesta thinks it is an exciting time for the club following the big-money signings of Frenkie de Jong and Antoine Griezmann]</b> De Jong is an exceptional signing. He is a step up for the club, young, very talented and, if all goes well, will be a leader in the centre of midfield, because he is also surrounded by the best <b>[players]</b> to continue growing. Every year, Barça has to improve the team and those who come must be even better. I have said it before, Griezmann is an exceptional player, who knows the league and the teammates he is going to have at Barça, so everything indicates that his career as a culé will be positive<br /><br />Last season was looking magnificent and one game put them out of a Champions League that they could have won. I don’t know if anyone else will come, but Barca will compete for everything<br /><br /><b>[Speculation has been rife throughout the summer and Iniesta would clearly love to see his former teammate Neymar back at Camp Nou]</b> As a player, for me, he is one of the best there is. It’s a matter of sports management, for the coach, but as a player, for me, he’s one of the best</p>

Here we both are, about to play your last game as a professional. I still have some left. Here we are, on the other side of the world. It’s as if life, funny as she is, had brought us all the way to Japan to say goodbye. Football brought us together more than 20 years ago, when we were children. Well, you will always be El Nino. And it will never separate us. We met when we had utopian dreams. That goal you scored us at the U16 European Championship with the national team in England. I’ll never forget the gesture you made to dedicate that goal to me. I saw it on TV because I had to go home with an injury<br /><br /><b>[Ahead of the match, Iniesta also recalled a gesture made by Torres when the pair were young]</b> Someday, you and I will win the World Cup together <b>[…]</b> We began away from spotlights and cameras until we came to share thousands of experiences before winning a World Cup for our country. When we meet in Spain, I’ll show you that shirt, that treasure that nobody else discovered. Although, it is true, there is no greater treasure than your friendship, Fernando. It’s been a wonderful journey. It has taken us to every corner of the world. And look where we are today. In Tosu, you and I playing a football match. One more. But it’s not just another one, it’s your last game, who knew? You face David Villa and I. Then you’ll go home. Yours are waiting for you, although you have to know that the ball will be sadder today than yesterday. Enjoy everything that comes to you now and be happy. But how strange, Fernando. You haven’t left yet and I miss you already</p>

You try and have some hobbies or pastimes, things that fill your time away from the game. The bodega <b>[winery]</b> that our family have had since 2010 is a very nice project. There is also the ‘Mikakus’ range of trainers. We try and do different social projects, things that keep you excited and interested<br /><br /><b>[Iniesta has also revealed how his father has been the biggest influence on his professional career]</b> My father was the most important figure for my career. He was not my coach, not at all, but from very small I was always with him, he was the first who gave me a plastic football out on the patio of our house. I always listened to him. He has given me his advice. Above all, he would always tell me that the most important opinion was that of my coach. I had to do what the coach told me, and that has always been very important<br /><br />I’ve always been very clear about what I wanted to do, that has always been the most important for me. The principal objective has always been to learn things to become a better player, respect those around me always. That has been my path. Maybe I would have done some things differently, I don’t know. There are things I did well, others not so well, but that’s life. When you make mistakes, you can correct them, and move forward</p>

If he goes up to the first team then he needs to take advantage of each game. He has to trust his talent and learn from those next to him</p>

  <p><b>[Iniesta: <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>’s golden generation will never be repeated]</b> That generation will never be repeated but what follows does not have to necessarily be worse in terms of how the club fares. It will never be same but it doesn’t have to be worse. There have been all sorts of eras in the club’s history: young players used to get a chance in the first team when results were bad and they had to turn to the youth team. That happened in my era. But then you have the period when you have 10, 11, 12 players from the youth team in the first-team squad. It depends on who the coach is, the situation of the club, but I always think that a player in the youth system who is good enough to play in the first team reaches the first team, in one situation or the other. It was many years living this club, growing up here since we were very young, getting into the first team and staying there for 10, 12, 15 years, becoming captains. We were all formed here as people. It’s difficult for something like that to happen. It’s very difficult. We’re talking about <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, a club with the best players. Víctor, <a href="carles-puyol.html">Puyol</a>, <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a>, me: we came up in a scenario to Busi, <a href="gerard-pique.html">Pique</a>, and Leo. We’re people who have been at the club our whole lives and we have that ‘plus’ that others don’t have.<br /><br />Right now, I’m trying to extend my playing career as much as possible, I want to kick a ball for as long as I can because that’s what makes me happy. I’ve got a contact until next year, 2021, but I’m looking at things at the end of every season and I feel good, motivated. I want to keep playing and we’re delighted to be here. When it does end, I have always said that I would love to go back to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. It all depends on how? In what role? What situation? Who is at the club? That’s some way off. But with everything I experienced there, all the feelings I have, I would love to go back</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona legend Iniesta says <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> encourages me to become a coach]</b> I still talk a lot with him, also about being a coach. And obviously he has encouraged me to test it out and see if I like it. He is delighted that he is going to be a coach. For those of us who like football and think about it, in the end, it is a situation that pleases and seduces me in some way. I am glad for him in this new stage in his career, perhaps I may be in a similar situation in the future<br /><br />The idea is still there but until I stop playing football it will be difficult for me to try to get my licence. Meanwhile, one tries to continue learning and to experience situations that one can use to learn. As for reference points, I have a small idea of the game that I want <b>[my team to play]</b>, which is the one that I have always played at the same club. But we’ll see. There is still plenty of time for me to sit on a bench. When I am a coach, I will definitely see different things than what I see today as a player. Let’s see what is going to happen. For the moment we have to wait<br /><br />We want to play again and make everyone happy again. We will see later. This break gives me some strength to try to extend my professional career, but now the only thing we are all thinking about is getting over this complicated situation. Football has been relegated to the background, but I try to stay physically strong for the time when we have to play again. We don’t know exactly when it will be</p>

  <p><b>[Andres Iniesta believes <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> should have won several more Champions League titles with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> in the side]</b> It surprises me in the sense that Argentina has had great footballers, a team with spectacular players and having, for me, the player who is number one. So they haven’t succeeded, but what happened against Germany (1-0 loss in 2014 World Cup final), for example, are small details. Small moments tip the balance for one team or another. If they played another game maybe it would turn out differently. I also feel that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> are at their level because they’ve had Leo for so long. Four Champions Leagues have been won, but having the team we had and being able to count on Leo, surely we should have won it more. But this is football. Rivals play, they are also very good and the important thing is to savour the moment when you do win things.<br /><br />In the end, when the results don’t come, this type of situation happens, looking for someone to blame. For me, it’s very difficult to say that Leo has played a bad game because that’s practically impossible. But hey, there are times when things turn out better, others turn out worse. Also, you can’t compare the environment or the Argentine team with one like <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, which works every day to play in a certain way</p>

  <p><b>[Iniesta: Winning goal in 2010 World Cup final helped save me from depression]</b> Unfortunately, I had to experience several misfortunes in a row, even though I was really successful at the time. But then my friend Dani Jarque died in August 2009, which really put me in such a fragile situation that I needed professional help. It was certainly the hardest phase of my life. It was very good for me to have the support of Anna, my then girlfriend and current wife, and of course that of my parents. Fortunately, this phase is a thing of the past. A phase that made me stronger and better<br /><br />You feel that it’s not you, that you don’t enjoy things, that the people around you are just people. You have no feelings or passion.
