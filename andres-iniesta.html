We must solve the errors and not kill them; kill them when there’s no cure. I do not think that the solution is hopeless; my advice is that this will come in time</p>

We always sat next to each other on the team bus and had a very good relationship. Marc-Andre is a phenomenal guy. For me, he is definitely one of the best goalkeepers in the world.

  <p><b>[Andres Iniesta has called for Barcelona to retain their focus ahead of a Clasico double-header against Real Madrid]</b> Barcelona have an advantage, of course, but you don’t win the league in February. There are still many games left, not only in the league but also in the Champions League. It’s crunch time. Furthermore, we can’t forget about Atletico - the Rojiblancos are currently Barcelona’s closest competitors. It’ll be exciting until the end. Real Madrid had some games in the first half of the season where they didn’t get as many points as they usually do, that’s why Barca was able to generate an advantage. One must not forget though that Real Madrid are still in the Champions League and in the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey. As always, they will fight until the end, even in the league<br /><br />It’s hard to pick out one game as a favourite but the 6-2 and 4-0 wins at the Bernabeu were really special. We also won 5-0 in Barcelona, but there were other, closer matches which we won that were less spectacular. I still have good memories of those too</p>

I’ve got a contact until next year, 2021, but I’m looking at things at the end of every season and I feel good, motivated. I want to keep playing and we’re delighted to be here. When it does end, I have always said that I would love to go back to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. It all depends on how? In what role? What situation? Who is at the club? That’s some way off. But with everything I experienced there, all the feelings I have, I would love to go back</p>

  <p><b>[Andres Iniesta speaks about his time at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> It was many years living this club, growing up here since we were very young, getting into the first team and staying there for 10, 12, 15 years, becoming captains. We were all formed here as people. It’s difficult for something like that to happen. It’s very difficult. We’re talking about <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, a club with the best players. Víctor, <a href="carles-puyol.html">Puyol</a>, <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a>, me: we came up in a scenario to Busi <b>[<a href="sergio-busquets.html">Sergio Busquets</a>]</b>, Piqué, and Leo <b>[<a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b>. We’re people who have been at the club our whole lives and we have that ‘plus’ that others don’t have. The moment could come when all of those players coincide at the club <b>[again]</b>. Without doubt, the likes of Víctor, <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a>, <a href="carles-puyol.html">Puyol</a>, have to go back because it wouldn’t make sense for them not to</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> legend Iniesta says <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> encourages me to become a coach]</b> I still talk a lot with him, also about being a coach. And obviously he has encouraged me to test it out and see if I like it. He is delighted that he is going to be a coach. For those of us who like football and think about it, in the end, it is a situation that pleases and seduces me in some way. I am glad for him in this new stage in his career, perhaps I may be in a similar situation in the future<br /><br />The idea is still there but until I stop playing football it will be difficult for me to try to get my licence. Meanwhile, one tries to continue learning and to experience situations that one can use to learn. As for reference points, I have a small idea of the game that I want <b>[my team to play]</b>, which is the one that I have always played at the same club. But we’ll see. There is still plenty of time for me to sit on a bench. When I am a coach, I will definitely see different things than what I see today as a player. Let’s see what is going to happen. For the moment we have to wait<br /><br />We want to play again and make everyone happy again. We will see later. This break gives me some strength to try to extend my professional career, but now the only thing we are all thinking about is getting over this complicated situation. Football has been relegated to the background, but I try to stay physically strong for the time when we have to play again. We don’t know exactly when it will be</p>

  <p><b>[Andres Iniesta says <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> &amp; De Jong will ‘definitely triumph’ at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> despite inconsistent start]</b> I don’t know. Comparisons are usually tedious. They are difficult to compare. I have always said that everything is going to be different from what the Catalans have in their head, but it does not have to be worse than what they have experienced. They are very good players and all <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> have to do is be clear about their playing style and, from there, look for players of their profile like those in the squad. De Jong has just arrived, he needs that adaptation period<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on why <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> has also found it difficult to settle]</b> It is a case similar to that of De Jong. <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> and the rest of the new players that arrive every year need time. They have enormous talent and will definitely end up triumphing and making a place for themselves in this team where it is not easy to play</p>

  <p><b>[Andres Iniesta believes <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> should have won several more Champions League titles with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> in the side]</b> It surprises me in the sense that Argentina has had great footballers, a team with spectacular players and having, for me, the player who is number one. So they haven’t succeeded, but what happened against Germany (1-0 loss in 2014 World Cup final), for example, are small details. Small moments tip the balance for one team or another. If they played another game maybe it would turn out differently. I also feel that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> are at their level because they’ve had Leo for so long. Four Champions Leagues have been won, but having the team we had and being able to count on Leo, surely we should have won it more. But this is football. Rivals play, they are also very good and the important thing is to savour the moment when you do win things.<br /><br />In the end, when the results don’t come, this type of situation happens, looking for someone to blame. For me, it’s very difficult to say that Leo has played a bad game because that’s practically impossible. But hey, there are times when things turn out better, others turn out worse. Also, you can’t compare the environment or the Argentine team with one like <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, which works every day to play in a certain way</p>

  <p><b>[Iniesta: Winning goal in 2010 World Cup final helped save me from depression]</b> Unfortunately, I had to experience several misfortunes in a row, even though I was really successful at the time. But then my friend Dani Jarque died in August 2009, which really put me in such a fragile situation that I needed professional help. It was certainly the hardest phase of my life. It was very good for me to have the support of Anna, my then girlfriend and current wife, and of course that of my parents. Fortunately, this phase is a thing of the past. A phase that made me stronger and better<br /><br />You feel that it’s not you, that you don’t enjoy things, that the people around you are just people. You have no feelings or passion. You end up feeling empty inside and there is a moment that you realise that you cannot take it anymore. I had the ability to see that I needed to see someone to get out of that situation. The important thing is that in that period I never lost the spark</p>
