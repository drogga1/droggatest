  <p><b>[AC Milan have been excluded from the 2019-20 Europa League as a result of Financial Fair Play (FFP) breaches]</b> AC Milan is excluded from participating in the UEFA Club Competitions of the sporting season 2019/2020 as a consequence of the breach of its FFP break-even obligations during the 2015/2016/2017 and the 2016/2017/2018 monitoring periods. The Adjudicatory Chamber of the UEFA Club Financial Control Body is invited to issue a Procedural Order, acknowledging the outcome of the present arbitration(s) and terminating the AC-01/2019 proceedings relating to the 2016/2017/2018 monitoring period, which have become moot</p>

  <p><b>[The Court of Arbitration for Sport has rejected the Palestine Football Association president’s appeal against a 12-month ban for ‘inciting hatred and violence’ against Lionel Messi. Ahead of Argentina’s scheduled pre-World Cup friendly against Israel in June 2018, Jibril Rajoub spoke out about the match amid the conflict and political tension between Israelis and Palestinians. The match was due to take place in Teddy Stadium, Jerusalem, a ground built on land said to have belonged to a Palestinian village before its destruction in 1948]</b> He’s a big symbol so we are going to target him personally and we call on all to burn his picture and his shirt and to abandon him.

  <p><b>[The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has ruled the 2018-19 CAF Champions League final second leg will not be replayed, following a request by the CAF Executive Committee. ES Tunis were crowned champions after beating Wydad Casablanca 2-1 on aggregate after a 1-0 win in the second leg]</b> The CAS Panel in charge of this matter has considered that the CAF Executive Committee did not have jurisdiction to order that the second leg of the final be replayed and has decided to annul the decision challenged.<br /><br />The appeals of both clubs are therefore partially upheld for that reason. It is now for the competent CAF authorities to review the incidents which occurred in the Rades stadium on 31 May 2019, to order the appropriate disciplinary sanctions, if any, and accordingly to decide whether the second leg of the CAF Champions League final 2018-2019 shall be replayed or not.<br /><br />The CAS Panel having annulled the decision of the CAF Executive Committee for formal reasons, it has decided to refer to the competent CAF bodies the questions of the replay of the final’s second leg and of the disciplinary procedure, which is currently pending before the CAF and which does not fall within the CAS jurisdiction in the present arbitration procedure.</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain forward <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> has seen his Champions League suspension reduced from three games to two by the Court of Arbitration for Sport]</b> The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has rendered its final decision in the appeal filed by the French club Paris St-Germain and the player <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> Da Silva Santos Jr. against the decision taken by the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Appeals Body on 18 June 2019. The player was found to have insulted match officials through social media at the end of the Champions League match Paris St-Germain vs <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> on 6 March 2019 and sanctioned with a 3-match suspension from <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> competition matches for which he would otherwise be eligible.<br /><br />Following an appeal filed on 18 July 2019 by both Paris St-Germain and the player, this CAS procedure was referred to a Sole Arbitrator, Prof. Ulrich Haas (Germany). A hearing was held at the CAS headquarters on 13 September 2019, during which the parties and their legal representatives were heard. In application of Art. 15 (1) lit. b of the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Disciplinary Regulations which provides for a minimum suspension of two matches in case of ‘abusive language’ directed at a match official, the Sole Arbitrator partially upheld the appeal and reduced the suspension imposed by <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> on <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> Jr. to two (2) <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> competition matches for which he would otherwise be eligible.</p>

  <p><b>[CAS explained <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>’s appeal was not admissible because <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> has not reached a final decision in the case]</b> The CAS Panel determined that MCFC’s appeal was inadmissible, considering that ‘An appeal against the decision of a federation, association or sports-related body may be filed with CAS … if the Appellant has exhausted the legal remedies available to it prior to the appeal, in accordance with the statutes or regulations of that body.’(Article R47 of the CAS Rules)<br /><br />In the present case, the decision rendered by the CFCB IC to refer a case to the CFCB AC is not final and can therefore not be appealed to CAS directly, because the AC is competent to take any of the decisions listed in Article 27 CFCB Procedural Rules, that are described as being final</p>

Once the Panel has been formally constituted it issues procedural directions, including, inter alia, with respect to the holding of a hearing. Following the hearing, the Panel deliberates and then issues its decision in the form of an Arbitral Award.<br /><br />It is not possible to indicate at this time when a final award in this matter will be issued</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City to play in Champions League next season after European ban overturned]</b> As the charges with respect to any dishonest concealment of equity funding were clearly more significant violations than obstructing the CFCB’s investigations, it was not appropriate to impose a ban on participating in <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s club competitions for MCFC’s failure to co-operate with the CFCB’s investigations alone<br /><br />However, considering i) the financial resources of MCFC; ii) the importance of the cooperation of clubs in investigations conducted by the CFCB, because of its limited investigative means; and iii) MCFC’s disregard of such principle and its obstruction of the investigations, the CAS Panel found that a significant fine should be imposed on MCFC and considered it appropriate to reduce <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s initial fine by 2/3, i.e. to the amount of EUR 10 million</p>
