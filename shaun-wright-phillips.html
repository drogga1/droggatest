  <p><b>[Hudson-Odoi right to reject Bayern for Chelsea]</b> For me, I thought he always had to stay. Especially with <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> leaving. It has opened a pathway for him. He can become that person. Maybe not to <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>’s capability, but he has the potential to create a lot of problems for teams in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He is an entertainer. He likes to take people on, create chances and score goals. I think, as a fan, when you are sitting there in the stadium you want to be on the edge of your seat<br /><br />He brings that X factor of what will he do next? So, I think he will be good for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Sometimes, for me, age doesn’t matter if you have the maturity of a man, which is something he has. He has learned and the more games he has played in and around the first team, the more experience he gets<br /><br />I think he has grown into it really well. Now he just needs to keep his consistency level up to show what he is capable of. I love watching both (Ruben) <a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Loftus-Cheek</a> and <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a>. I think they are going to have big seasons for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. You have seen them do it at the end of last year and I think now they will do it on the big stage this year<br /><br /><b>[Wright-Phillips hopes that comparisons with <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> do not put undue pressure on the USMNT international, but he is happy that his old club have attracted a player who he has watched for some time]</b> I like the way <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a> plays. I have kept an eye on him from when I was in the United States. I watched a lot of <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>. I like the way he plays; he drifts in and out of games. Nice touches, takes people on and he knows where the net is as well.<br /><br />So, for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, they have two exciting wingers. They need to get them on the ball as much as possible. I don’t think you should compare either of them to <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>. He was in a league of his own when he was there. I feel like they have just got to show the world what they are capable of</p>

  <p><b>[Sterling hailed as 30-goal forward by Wright-Phillips and ‘a boss’ for handling of racist abuses]</b> He’s outstanding. He’s a delight to watch, always plays with a smile on his face and does what City fans love – works hard, fights for the club and under Pep he’s grown so much. People always talk about his end product and now you just expect him to have 15 assists a season. It’s looking like he could hit 30 goals this season and I hope he does<br /><br /><b>[He was targeted by a group of supporters during a visit to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> in December 2018, but has seen several high-profile figures suffer similar abuse before and since]</b> Raheem handled it like a boss. Obviously now there’s a bigger platform to speak out so he could get his message and point across to a lot more people whereas when it happened to me social media wasn’t that powerful. The way I dealt with it was to laugh at it and say: ‘How old are you?’ We’re in a different time now and football is multicultural. It’s horrible to see it still in the game, especially for kids growing up now. That’s why the way Raheem dealt with it is powerful because kids follow him and will know it isn’t acceptable. So many people have always been on his back and I’ve never understood why. He’s a family man and you never hear about him messing around. Although his image is outstanding now, I never thought it was bad in the first place.<br /><br /><b>[Pep Guardiola’s side are considered by many to be the team to beat at home and abroad this term and Wright-Phillips is impressed by the progress his former side have made in a short space of time]</b> I didn’t think it would happen this quickly. What the club have built has been fast in terms of dominating the country, and to a point Europe, even though we fell at a late hurdle last season. People now fear <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and that doesn’t normally happen this quickly.</p>

I am really looking forward to it. It is really touching and nice for Vinny to invite me. I will definitely try to kick him if I get the chance. They have to cope without him, that’s football. It is going to be a massive loss both on and off the pitch. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> know that. It was time for him to move on for his own reasons and they just have to fill the shoes the best they can. They have other options to fill in but Vinny’s shoes are big to fill from a leadership point of view. I hope whoever does it, does the best job they can. He has always had that leadership mentality. The job he has taken now shows a big, strong character. He has a big presence - just walking into the changing room <b>[made you notice him]</b>. He wanted to play in midfield, but he was a better centre-back. He had an aura about him</p>

I do believe that if they can have a strong festive period, there is no reason that they can’t catch up with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> – it is still a long season ahead.<br /><br />Saying that, even if they end up finishing in the top four this season, that would still be exceptional.

  <p><b>[Wright-Phillips expecting key men to be retained]</b> Even if City fail to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or Champions League this season, they need to stick with Pep. I’m quite a loyal person, so I never quite understand why clubs are so quick to get rid of managers, especially after such recent success.<br /><br />Pep is one of the best managers in the world, if not the best, and the club need to keep him happy. Looking back to last season, a VAR decision against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> is what stopped his team from progressing in the Champions League; if VAR doesn’t exist and that goal counts it could have been a completely different story last season.<br /><br />Pep has all the quality to deliver the Champions League for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, I just hope that he doesn’t walk away at the end of the season on his own accord. He’s evolved all aspects of the club, from the first team to the youth set-up. I think he will want to stick out the challenge for a couple more seasons and deliver the Champions League for City.<br /><br /><b>[Wright-Phillips is also tipping England international Sterling to stick around in Manchester]</b> There are rumours that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> have offered <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> and £70 million in exchange for <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> but I don’t think City should even consider it.<br /><br />Perhaps, if <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> was the same age as <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> then I would say OK, but for me, <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> is coming to the back end of his career now while Raheem has possibly another 10 years at the top.<br /><br />Regardless, £70 million in this day and age, wouldn’t be nearly enough to pry away a player of Sterling’s quality. Sterling’s performances over the last 4 years have been brilliant and it would require a much more attractive bid for City to consider any sort of deal<br /><br />City could have looked to sign De Ligt in the summer; I think he would have helped them cope with the loss of <b>[Vincent]</b> Kompany, but he ended up at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>.<br /><br />I don’t think that <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> were necessarily wrong for not replacing Kompany in the summer, they have just been dealt a blow with the injury to <b>[Aymeric]</b> <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> at the beginning of the season – we probably wouldn’t even be talking about this if <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> was fit at this point in the season.<br /><br /><a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> should look at replacements in January but they need to locate the right player, they shouldn’t sign a defender for the sake of signing a defender. Ideally, you want a defender with <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> experience.<br /><br />The problem is that any player joining <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> from another <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club will want to know that he is going to be starting week in week out, which won’t be a guarantee at a club like City. So, I don’t feel like <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> will be able to sign another player from another <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> team, unless he’s happy to fight or sit on the bench.</p>

In any footballer’s head there comes a point where he recognises that he needs to be playing more games. It’s fair to think that if <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> was playing regularly, he has enough quality to be in the England setup. There is a danger that a lack of game time could stagnate his career.<br /><br />Of course, he’s learning from some amazing players, he’s fought his way through, he’s taken his chances when given but he is at the stage where he needs to kick on to the next level and play consistently<br /><br />You look at someone like <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>, he took the chance of going abroad to get more game time and now he’s possibly up there with the top players, wingers, in the world.<br /><br />Youth has always been essential to the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> setup and they are screaming out for a player like <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> to establish himself in the team, but <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a> needs to decide whether it is best to wait around or move on elsewhere to establish himself</p>

I think for me as a player I would rather it <b>[be rescheduled]</b> this weekend.<br /><br />I think it’s more of ‘where do you put it in?’ For <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, and the teams up the top or even the teams at the bottom, if you’re getting into your stride at that time, the winter break can almost break it and when you come back you could be doing the opposite things.<br /><br />It’s a tough one especially when you come back off holiday to keep that momentum going<br /><br /><b>[Wright-Phillips did, however, go on to concede that the break may have come at the perfect time for <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>, who is fighting to get back to full fitness after suffering a hamstring injury]</b> I would have rather just played continuously, to be honest with you, but like you said the game’s a lot different now. Maybe a plus for Sterling with the hamstring issue, it might have come at the perfect time for him to recover and be back fit and ready for it afterwards<br /><br /><b>[Wright-Phillips says City should be focusing on their own form rather than how well <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are doing]</b> I wouldn’t be worried so much about their form. I think they’re doing well. I just think that the problem they have is <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are doing so well that they’re not even dropping any points - they’re just winning.<br /><br />If you go back to seasons, like when you had ‘the Invincibles’, they would drop points to a draw, whereas <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are taking those draws and turning those into wins, which is making it even tougher to catch them<br /><br />I think for every player it’s tough, but with the team and the standard of player that he has, he has to rotate to keep people happy. It is a tough one. Normally it’s never been a problem, so it’s interesting to hear that it is now</p>

  <p><b>[Shaun Wright-Phillips says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> should not fear summer exits if a Champions League ban is upheld]</b> I don’t think a ban means anything for Pep and the top players. If it does stand, which I don’t think it will and I feel they are confident it will get overturned, it is the same as any other club. Man United have not been in the Champions League for a few years and they have still kept De Gea, players like <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> will be able to do the same<br /><br />I feel like the way Pep manages he wants to win every game and he has a squad depth to be able to do that. It would be a great achievement, from the 1980s I think the only other team to do it are <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> so to equal that will be a tremendous success. Coming off a massive result like that, winning 2-1 at the Bernabeu <b>[against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> in the Champions League]</b>, coming from behind shows the character that is built and instilled in the team.

From the facilities, the way they’ve bought players. I don’t think they have spent over £60 million on a player. They’re more strategic<br /><br />Whereas, when <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> were doing it, it was just instant and it worked, but it’s something that would never work again<br /><br />It’s the same if you look at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> where it has been structurally done and they never had a massive takeover. When <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> came in he brought little things in slowly and I think that is a route a lot of clubs will go down from now on if they ever have a takeover<br /><br />Despite that, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> both had the same aspirations. They both wanted to win titles and play in the Champions League<br /><br />I think the mentality has always been the same. All the managers that have been there have always known how big City is as a club, and they’ve all had the dream of doing the things they’re doing now. Sadly, in the past they didn’t have the budget to do it<br /><br />I think <a href="mark-hughes.html">Mark Hughes</a> set the pace. It was incredible to play under him, he came with entertaining football, we played well on the break. I think we were sitting fourth when he got the sack. We couldn’t believe it, but that’s football. When a lot of money comes into the game, a lot of things change.

  <p><b>[The former New York Red Bulls winger believes the grassroots system in Europe means it remains some way ahead of soccer in the United States]</b> No. If I’m being totally honest, I don’t think it will for a while because, in Europe, we’ve got a whole grassroots system. But in America, they miss like four to five years of being coached and learning what it takes to be a professional footballer.<br /><br />You either play in the second tier, which they call the USL, and then from that you jump straight to the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. There are no bridges, you’re jumping a lot of gaps to get to the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> without actually being fine-tuned as a footballer first<br /><br /><b>[He added on his time in the States]</b> It was a big change physically. American athletes are athletes! There wasn’t a tactical side to it, there wasn’t any slow build-up play or anything like that. It was just, you attack, I attack, and it’ll be like that for 90 minutes.<br /><br />When I signed for Red Bulls, I was under <a href="jesse-marsch.html">Jesse Marsch</a>, Chris Armas, and Denis Hamlett, and they were great coaches, and I’ve worked under some good coaches. The philosophy they had, even in the New York humidity of 80 per cent, was literally press for 90 minutes. You literally just aggressively pressed for 90 minutes<br /><br />Don’t get me wrong, it works. But if you’ve got a team, for example, like <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, or what Orlando did to us, and they beat the first press, you’re wide open. So there was never a backup plan. Managers in Europe, if it doesn’t work for the first 15 minutes, would change<br /><br />Tactically they weren’t as sharp as clubs in Europe. It’s not because they weren’t good enough to change it, they just stayed the way it was in the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. For example, Jesse’s gone to Germany now and he’s doing amazingly well.</p>

Not many foreign players come in and hit the ground running as well as he has done, and consistently done it for eight or nine years. With injuries as well. He’s never really had a season without a few weeks out, he has been out through injuries and he still always races for the Golden Boot. He shows up in all the big games.

As you can see, he’s having a nice mix of maturity and young talent, and it’s very hard to go wrong with that<br /><br /><b>[Wright-Phillips added on Ziyech]</b> He brings that attacking flair, he scores goals and he creates goals. We have seen him do it in the Champions League, and now other wingers and other midfielders have to up their game because there is a lot of competition there. Having a lot of players on top of their game can only be a good thing for Lamps for and for Chelsea<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he sees <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> challenging for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> crown]</b> Yes, definitely. I think next year if he gets the players that he wants and get his team exactly as he wants it, then 100%. They are still challenging for the Champions League spots now, so it’s only one step further forward, and that is challenging against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, who have run away with it this year</p>
