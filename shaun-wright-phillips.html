  <p><b>[Former Chelsea winger Shaun Wright-Phillips has warned his former club are on a downward spiral]</b> In a Premier League race, it’s never over until it’s over. At one stage it was an 11 point gap and now it’s down to four points so that is nerve-wracking for the players. As we would say, it’s squeaky bum time. It could be that they’re on a downward spiral. As big as the characters are in that dressing room, I think there will be a spell where they might get nervy if Tottenham keep going as they are.<br /><br />I saw it on the news over here, it just flashed across the bottom of the screen. I didn’t see it coming. Twenty two years he has stayed there - pretty much his whole life - and I would have thought they’d be more for him, like a testimonial or something. I really think though that he will stay in England. He’s played a bit this year and that shows he’s still got a lot to give in the Premier League. Hopefully Chelsea win the league because that would be a huge achievement to sign out on</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City frontman Sergio Aguero is the Premier League’s best ever striker]</b> There is definitely an argument that Sergio Aguero is the Premier League’s best ever striker. If he stays fit all year that ups City’s chances of winning the Premier League and the Champions League. He’s a great finisher and he always fights hard for the team as well. I think Kun can score thirty goals easily this season. Especially in the form that he’s in now, that would be an easy mark for him.<br /><br /><b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne is unbelievable but my favourite player there is still David Silva. I had the privilege of playing with him and training with him. He just makes it impossible to get the ball off him and he sees things three passes ahead. Everywhere I’ve been and everyone I speak to speaks very, very highly of him and about what a great player he is. He’s just as nice off the pitch too<br /><br /><b>[On Pep Guardiola]</b> For me, he has proven his critics wrong. He’s now had the time to get the team that he wants, and mould them into his style of play. From the results you can clearly see what is happening</p>

  <p><b>[Shaun <a href="bradley-wright-phillips.html">Wright-Phillips</a> has urged Eden Hazard to make the right decision over his future]</b> It’s a hard one because Chelsea is an amazing club, the fan-base is amazing and the owners are amazing as well - everything about the club is amazing but it’s a hard one for Hazard. You have to ask yourself how far do you want to go in your career, what do you want to achieve and that will make his decision.<br /><br />Hopefully Chelsea can go out and win the Champions League again, win titles again, but if they can’t then what does Hazard want? Does he want to win these things or does he want to be Chelsea’s main player - that’s a question that only he can answer<br /><br />I don’t think the transfer ban will hinder Chelsea because they have enough players in their squad now, and they have enough players on loan, which are clearly of a Premier League standard so they can call them back. So I don’t think the ban will hinder them that much - we’re forgetting that they have something like 40 players out on loan. Of course not all of them are worthy of a place in the Chelsea side, but there’s a lot of people with the potential and this could be the start of somebody’s career by bringing them back and giving them a run in the team, and maybe even the next England superstar, or French or Belgian superstar on our hands</p>

  <p><b>[Southgate has got the fans behind England again]</b> 100% Southgate has got the fans behind England again, and what he’s done so well is that if players are playing well and they deserve to play, they’re given that chance and they’re given that start whereas previously it wouldn’t be like that. No matter how well you played, you knew that you were on the bench or you were just in the squad whereas now, it’s keeping the competition so high in the England squad because people know that if you’re playing well in the league and say scoring goals, you’re likely to get the same chance to do that for England, so no-one’s position is safe as such. You have to keep performing which is always good in the game.<br /><br />We’ve never not had the players, but we just never seem to get to the final hurdle for some reason. Even now, the potential of the squad is unbelievable and they can win it. The current squad is definitely good enough to win it and I think Southgate has done a tremendous job with them, and he has utilised the young talents coming through very well</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany should stay at Manchester City this summer]</b> I don’t know what’s happening with Vinnie at the minute, whether he’s going to re-sign or if he’s going to hang the boots up, but I think it would be nice to have a few more centre-backs and that’s the only position that I can think of, just to cover injuries. They suffered a lot with injuries at the back this year.<br /><br />I think that City definitely deserved it and Manchester United fans and most people didn’t want Liverpool to win the title, but Liverpool were outstanding this year and if it wasn’t for City having that game in hand, Liverpool would have won the league. But they won their game in hand, kept the train rolling and kept pulling off result after result. I think the most important goal was that hit from Vincent Kompany against Leicester. It was an unbelievable hit and considering that he hasn’t hit the target from outside the box since 2013, it was just meant to be! He scored the header against United in their first title win, and twice he’s scored the goal that has got them to a point to be able to win the league. Big players always show up at the right times, and Vincent being the amazing person and captain that he has been for the team, he showed that over the back end of the season<br /><br />I’ve been watching City all year and you can see that they never ever give up and they always fight until the bitter end, City have always done that for the last few years. The quick response after falling behind, with Aguero scoring, completely set the pace and the tone, and gave the belief to the players. For me Aguero’s equaliser completely turned the game on its head, because the longer the game went on at 1-0, you’d start thinking it would more likely turn out as a draw or a loss, but the players built on the momentum of the quick response. You know that City are going to create chances and they all went in, and obviously Mahrez’s goal came at the perfect time</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bradley-wright-phillips.html">Wright-Phillips</a> praises Raheem Sterling’s demeanour on and off the pitch]</b> I’ve been very impressed with Sterling this year, both on and off the pitch, and he has shown that he is the perfect role model for a new kid coming through. He has seen what it takes, he has gone and done it and dealt with the bad stuff that has come with it, that he never even had a say in. People forget that Sterling is still young, in footballing terms he’s still a baby. He’s meant to be learning but he’s dealing with things that a more experienced pro should be dealing with, and doing it perfectly. He’s answered everything in the right way by letting his football do the talking. It’s very powerful what he has done.<br /><br />To an extent I agree that the FA hasn’t done that much to tackle the problem of racism, but it’s hard to police racism for the FA. How do they police it? Unless someone makes people aware of what has happened within a stadium, the FA would never know that it is happening. I would just ban the fans. I think it’s everywhere and it’s just whether it comes out or not - some people get ahead of themselves and it just comes out. When I say ban the fans, not to punish people, but so that fans will start policing it themselves. I don’t want to bring my kid to a stadium and sit next to somebody who is shouting racist chants, because it’s going to make kids think that it’s okay to do it. It’s not only affecting players, but it is affecting kids that are growing up now, and are going to be bringing their kids in future. It needs to be nipped in the bud somewhere, and I would just ban those fans for life, and don’t allow them into any football stadium in England</p>

He is going to be almost impossible to replace. But if you can start off by replacing him on the field then I’d love to see De Ligt at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. After watching him play this year and especially being so young I think him and <b>[Aymeric]</b> <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> would be a great team.

It’s not fair to put that load on him.

We’ve all seen the glimpses of what he’s capable of and if he plays regularly and he finds a consistency and it keeps happening for him then he can only grow and mature.

  <p><b>[<a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Hudson-Odoi</a> right to reject <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> For me, I thought he always had to stay. Especially with <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a> leaving. It has opened a pathway for him. He can become that person. Maybe not to <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>’s capability, but he has the potential to create a lot of problems for teams in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He is an entertainer. He likes to take people on, create chances and score goals. I think, as a fan, when you are sitting there in the stadium you want to be on the edge of your seat<br /><br />He brings that X factor of what will he do next? So, I think he will be good for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. Sometimes, for me, age doesn’t matter if you have the maturity of a man, which is something he has. He has learned and the more games he has played in and around the first team, the more experience he gets<br /><br />I think he has grown into it really well. Now he just needs to keep his consistency level up to show what he is capable of. I love watching both (Ruben) <a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Loftus-Cheek</a> and <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a>.

Obviously now there’s a bigger platform to speak out so he could get his message and point across to a lot more people whereas when it happened to me social media wasn’t that powerful. The way I dealt with it was to laugh at it and say: ‘How old are you?’ We’re in a different time now and football is multicultural. It’s horrible to see it still in the game, especially for kids growing up now. That’s why the way Raheem dealt with it is powerful because kids follow him and will know it isn’t acceptable. So many people have always been on his back and I’ve never understood why. He’s a family man and you never hear about him messing around.

Looking back to last season, a VAR decision against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> is what stopped his team from progressing in the Champions League; if VAR doesn’t exist and that goal counts it could have been a completely different story last season.<br /><br />Pep has all the quality to deliver the Champions League for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, I just hope that he doesn’t walk away at the end of the season on his own accord. He’s evolved all aspects of the club, from the first team to the youth set-up. I think he will want to stick out the challenge for a couple more seasons and deliver the Champions League for City.<br /><br />Perhaps, if <a href="gareth-bale.html">Bale</a> was the same age as <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> then I would say OK, but for me, <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> is coming to the back end of his career now while Raheem has possibly another 10 years at the top.<br /><br />Regardless, £70 million in this day and age, wouldn’t be nearly enough to pry away a player of Sterling’s quality. Sterling’s performances over the last 4 years have been brilliant and it would require a much more attractive bid for City to consider any sort of deal<br /><br />City could have looked to sign De Ligt in the summer; I think he would have helped them cope with the loss of <b>[Vincent]</b> Kompany, but he ended up at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>.<br /><br />I don’t think that <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> were necessarily wrong for not replacing Kompany in the summer, they have just been dealt a blow with the injury to <b>[Aymeric]</b> <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> at the beginning of the season - we probably wouldn’t even be talking about this if <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> was fit at this point in the season.<br /><br /><a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> should look at replacements in January but they need to locate the right player, they shouldn’t sign a defender for the sake of signing a defender. Ideally, you want a defender with <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> experience.<br /><br />The problem is that any player joining <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> from another <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> club will want to know that he is going to be starting week in week out, which won’t be a guarantee at a club like City.

  <p><b>[The former New York Red Bulls winger believes the grassroots system in Europe means it remains some way ahead of soccer in the United States]</b> No. If I’m being totally honest, I don’t think it will for a while because, in Europe, we’ve got a whole grassroots system. But in America, they miss like four to five years of being coached and learning what it takes to be a professional footballer.<br /><br />You either play in the second tier, which they call the USL, and then from that you jump straight to the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. There are no bridges, you’re jumping a lot of gaps to get to the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> without actually being fine-tuned as a footballer first<br /><br /><b>[He added on his time in the States]</b> It was a big change physically. American athletes are athletes! There wasn’t a tactical side to it, there wasn’t any slow build-up play or anything like that. It was just, you attack, I attack, and it’ll be like that for 90 minutes.<br /><br />When I signed for Red Bulls, I was under <a href="jesse-marsch.html">Jesse Marsch</a>, <a href="chris-armas.html">Chris Armas</a>, and Denis Hamlett, and they were great coaches, and I’ve worked under some good coaches. The philosophy they had, even in the New York humidity of 80 per cent, was literally press for 90 minutes. You literally just aggressively pressed for 90 minutes<br /><br />Don’t get me wrong, it works. But if you’ve got a team, for example, like <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>, or what Orlando did to us, and they beat the first press, you’re wide open. So there was never a backup plan. Managers in Europe, if it doesn’t work for the first 15 minutes, would change<br /><br />Tactically they weren’t as sharp as clubs in Europe. It’s not because they weren’t good enough to change it, they just stayed the way it was in the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. For example, Jesse’s gone to Germany now and he’s doing amazingly well.</p>

All the managers that have been there have always known how big City is as a club, and they’ve all had the dream of doing the things they’re doing now. Sadly, in the past they didn’t have the budget to do it<br /><br />I think <a href="mark-hughes.html">Mark Hughes</a> set the pace. It was incredible to play under him, he came with entertaining football, we played well on the break. I think we were sitting fourth when he got the sack. We couldn’t believe it, but that’s football. When a lot of money comes into the game, a lot of things change. As for them looking forward and changing, I think <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> always had the desire to be where they are now.</p>
