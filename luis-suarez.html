My big brother lent me it, around 70 dollars. It was a long flight, I got lost, and they detained me at customs. I was 16 and I didn’t have any address - I didn’t have anything! I’d come with a white shirt and my nose had started bleeding. My girlfriend Sofia was waiting for me in the airport, but it had been two hours since I’d arrived and I still hadn’t come out. I was being detained there and I didn’t know why. They told me it was because I didn’t have address for where I was going to stay or anything else. I told them I’d come to visit my girlfriend, that she was living here. In the plane I’d seen mountains and beaches, so I said I’d come to visit the mountains and beaches. They opened my bag and found a note from Sofia’s aunt showing the address and a telephone number. I was so lucky! I finally got out. Sofia had spent the last three hours running around all the terminals, desperately looking for me, until I came out with my white blood-stained t-shirt!</p>

We all want to help the club. I do not say who to bring in or who not to bring in. I took over last season and I assume that over the next few years the club has to bring a young player, a number nine, not only to compete with me but for the future of the club, because I also want what’s good for the future of the club.

  <p><b>[‘Spectacular’ Lautaro’s arrival is the beginning of the end for Suarez at Barcelona]</b> I’m doing just fine, adapting to the return to training with my team-mates, taking it step by step. Obviously, coming back from an injury is difficult because you are a little afraid, but I’m already enjoying training with my team-mates<br /><br /><b>[Suarez has been nothing but enthusiastic when asked about the Inter striker’s possible signing]</b> He has all the talent to play at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. I have been saying for two years it would be good to bring in a young forward so he can start adapting and learn for when I am gone. Bringing in new players is great because it makes you more competitive. He is a No.9 who has spectacular movement and that reflects what a great forward he is.<br /><br />Because of his age, we might be looking at the end of Luis Suarez at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. He has started picking up injuries of late and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> cannot afford to wait to see what happens. If he can play, great, because he has always performed phenomenally. If not, you have to look for a substitute.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona striker Luis Suarez has revealed why he believes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are such a difficult opponent to play]</b> I think the mentality of the players is so important on the pitch. We arrived in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> 3-0 up, but when you play there they have the supporters and the manager, and the players are so focused and concentrated on the pitch. It’s difficult<br /><br />They scored in the first 10 or 15 minutes and they got the confidence to continue their play. In the second half they played fantastically. We need to accept that and if we’d have scored one goal, we would have had a really good chance to go through, but I think they are really good players</p>

  <p><b>[The <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Blaugrana</a> drew 2-2 at Celta on Saturday, meaning their title rivals can go two points clear by beating Espanyol on Sunday night]</b> It was a vital match to fight for the title. We had a good first half, creating chances, but in the second half it was different, Celta wanting to be more aggressive. The result leaves a bitter taste, one of sadness and frustration because we have lost two points</p>
