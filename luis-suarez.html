I’d come with a white shirt and my nose had started bleeding. My girlfriend Sofia was waiting for me in the airport, but it had been two hours since I’d arrived and I still hadn’t come out. I was being detained there and I didn’t know why. They told me it was because I didn’t have address for where I was going to stay or anything else. I told them I’d come to visit my girlfriend, that she was living here. In the plane I’d seen mountains and beaches, so I said I’d come to visit the mountains and beaches. They opened my bag and found a note from Sofia’s aunt showing the address and a telephone number. I was so lucky! I finally got out. Sofia had spent the last three hours running around all the terminals, desperately looking for me, until I came out with my white blood-stained t-shirt!</p>

It’s a decision which must be respected, it was taken for a reason. But we are in the Spanish league and we’re competing against Real Madrid, Atletico, Sevilla, Valencia, Villarreal and all the other teams. We’re not competing against one player.

Phillipe is a friend, he’s young and I try to advise him. At Liverpool he proved the player he is. It was hard for me and I told him it would be the same. You have to accept criticism, but the most important thing is that he’s comfortable, happy, his team-mates trust in him, the manager trusts in him.<br /><br />Players are exposed. The smallest thing you do - tiny, like Philippe did - is made bigger. The manager <b>[Ernesto Valverde]</b> said it: ‘I’m surprised they you’re talking about the gesture and not the great goal he scored,’ a goal that would have given him confidence. Sometimes you have to understand him. If fans want a player to perform, be on his side, support him, because a player out on the pitch - and it happens to me - is not stupid. He hears it when he loses a ball and there’s this ‘zzzzzhhhhhiiii’, he hears that buzzing, that murmur and that affects him. He thinks ‘Ay, the fans ay, if I lose another ball.’ No, the fans have to support our players. If they want to win the Champions League and everything, they have to be with the player<br /><br />English football in general is a different culture.
