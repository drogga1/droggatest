  <p><b>[Nicola Amoruso - a three-time league champion with <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> who spent the 2000-01 campaign with <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> - says <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> must accept the inevitable when he takes to the pitch]</b> <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> is a champion and there are two very difficult games in Naples awaiting him. His departure was seen as a betrayal but he gave some extraordinary performances in those three years<br /><br /><a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> will feel the consequences of his choices the moment he steps onto the field<br /><br />In some games, the San Paolo can give you so much and right now there is a great deal of enthusiasm in the city. However, when things are going badly, the atmosphere can burn you. Either way, it’s an unforgettable experience</p>

  <p><b>[Former Juventus and Napoli star Nicola Amoruso has singled out Lorenzo Insigne as the man who can hurt the Old Lady in Friday’s Serie A showdown]</b> <b>[Insigne]</b> has a great technique and has recently learned to play with great flow. Every ball he touches becomes magical, it’s a pleasure to watch him play.<br /><br /><b>[When asked who Napoli must be wary of at San Paolo]</b> Imagining it and thiking about it, my answer is Dybala because he is an important player and is crucial for Allegri’s game.<br /><br />I think in this match, technique will make the difference. In the past season against Napoli, between the Serie A and the Coppa Italia, <b>[Higuain]</b> was significant. However, playing at the San Paolo stadium would not be easy for him. If Higuain does not play, Juventus still have many options who could replace him very well<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether this could finally be the year Napoli retake the Scudetto]</b> Serie A is far from over and there are still lots of matches but Napoli are playing well and have found continuity in results. The team, compared to the last season, has become more mature. Until now we have not seen a very bright Juve, but we are talking about a team that has won six consecutive championships. A mature team that wants to fight till the end</p>

  <p><b>[Nicola Amoruso believes that the addition of Cristiano Ronaldo can help Juventus win the Champions League]</b> Of course he will help them in the Champions League. He will help them in tournaments and also in an economic way. He will be great in Serie A and is a great talent and champion. Juventus are one of the best teams in Europe, and of course they are a leading contender to win the Champions League.<br /><br />Juventus are one of the best teams in Europe, and of course they are a leading contender to win the Champions League<br /><br />Serie A teams need big stars to compete in the Champions League, and now they have Ronaldo, and I think more players will come in the future. The teams are now stronger than in the past five or 10 years. But Juventus are better than the other teams, like Inter, Napoli and Milan. They’ve more talent and very good players<br /><br /><b>[Amoruso also gave his opnion on Mohamed Salah’s move to Liverpool last summer]</b> Salah is a very big talent and I don’t know why Roma sold him so quickly and for such a low fee. They gave a gift to Liverpool!</p>

  <p><b>[Not everyone is so keen to see <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> back at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> He would be added value; he is a great champion. He knows the <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> environment very well and he is widely loved here. But I don’t think <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> can afford to bring in a player earning at least €15m per season. They already have to deal with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s salary, and he is the best in the world with <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. He would alter all the dressing room’s balances. I don’t see it being very likely. I guess there is the mutual will to find a potential agreement but, in reality, I think there are really slim chances</p>
