  <p><b>[<a href="carles-alena.html">Alena</a> Moulton: Widen player access to address black coaching gap in women’s football]</b> It’s much better now but we need more people to take that leap and go through the door and challenge stereotypes, challenge the perceptions that people have, and say ‘this is what we are capable of. There is an issue, if you are looking across the elite game, that there isn’t that many <b>[black players]</b> across the youth system in elite establishments, and there isn’t that many represented in the coaching aspect as well. Until we get more playing, we are not going to see more getting involved in the coaching aspect. We need to see more that move on into the elite game and see it as an option. Then those girls need to move on into positions of coaching so then when they do go into these clubs, they say ‘well, there is someone that looks like me’. It is possible<br /><br /><b>[The factors that prevent some from progressing in the women’s game are multi-faceted]</b> It is completely different <b>[to the men’s game]</b> and the issue is that people see it as the same thing. A lot of the time, I get comments of, ‘well, you’re black’. They are judging that based off the experience of a black male which is different to being a black female. Are we really reaching those communities, or is women’s football elitist? If you look at our structure in terms of the female academies that are called RTCs, they often aren’t reflective of their communities because they aren’t based in the areas that are in the cities that everybody can access regardless of money.<br /><br />If you need to travel to another club at the weekend, you need to have financial backing, so that automatically excludes a certain amount of people - that could be ethnic minorities, or it could be those that have a low income. For me, the clubs aren’t representative of the communities and their cities. There are different challenges and barriers and we have really got to ask ourselves the question, ‘how do we do that, how do we become more representative?</p>
