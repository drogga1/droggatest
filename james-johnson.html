  <p><b>[Australia however declared on Monday that football in the country will continue with the A-League and W-League to be played behind closed doors]</b> The scale of football means that we have a key role to play in maintaining the health and wellbeing of Australians, as well as their families and the wider community. We are doing so by allowing people to play, in line with the current government position but with additional guidance to further improve social distancing at football fields around the country. We have been working closely with our stakeholders, government health officials and our own chief medical officer to develop our policies for the whole of the game following the COVID-19 outbreak. The situation is subject to constant change, and further measures may be necessary in the future. The decision to play the remainder of the Hyundai A-League 2019-20 season, and the Westfield W-League 2020 Grand Final behind closed doors was made in consultation with the clubs and in accordance with the latest federal government advice</p>

  <p><b>[The FM simulator filling football-shaped void for players, coaches, fans]</b> The thing I remember the most about it was I personally started to really appreciate the business side of football - the inter-relationship at club level between winning and revenue. The more you won, the more you earned, the more you could then invest in your squad, and the easier it became to win again</p>
