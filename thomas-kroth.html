  <p>[Manuel Neuer is considering leaving <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> over concerns the squad is not strong enough to match his ambition, his agent Thomas Kroth says] He wants to win Euro 2020 and he wants to win the Champions League again. Manuel is success-oriented. My impression is that the gap to the top four English top teams is already serious and the Munich squad is currently not yet as competitive or set up to tackle Manuel’s goals seriously. When he realises that <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> are responding, then he will probably blossom again. He does not want to retire in 2021. Now he is in the phase in which he has to decide: how will things progress in the future? Signing a contract extension and ending his career at <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> is of course the obvious option, but it’s not the only one.<br /><br />[Neuer has faced criticism for his sub-par performances for Germany and <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> over the last year, but Kroth is not concerned about his form, inisisting he is still at his best] Much has been said and interpreted against him. The bottom line was: ‘He’s 33 years old now and he’s starting to break down’. Many have interpreted his achievements as having lost the extraordinary and invincible ability</p>
