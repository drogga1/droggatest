  <p><b>[<a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> may have left under a cloud, doing what he could to force a big-money switch to <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> that summer, but memories of Mane in Salzburg remain overwhelmingly positive]</b> <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> is probably the best player who ever played in Austria. He was just a special player, a special talent<br /><br />It was a lot of money for a player not many people had heard of, for sure<br /><br /><b>[<a href="ralf-rangnick.html">Rangnick</a> went to watch Mane play against Tours in a French League Cup game at the start of the 2012-13 season]</b> He signed alongside Isaac Vorsah and Rodnei who both turned out to be fairly bad transfers. But around this time Red Bull were realising the huge amount of unearthed talent in France. Mane was presented as one of the most talented players in Senegal and after his first few games it was quite clear why. In Austria you rarely see extremely fast players with technical abilities gliding past opponents, but Mane would do that. He played on the left wing and at times he was just unstoppable<br /><br />Everyone liked Sadio. He had a special relationship with Roger Schmidt and he was close to Kevin Kampl too. At the beginning he had some troubles with the physical style of play from his opponents and was sometimes accused of falling too easy - sometimes rightly so. But he was just special, you could see that immediately<br /><br /><b>[the <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> beckoned. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were offered the chance to sign Mane but looked elsewhere, and it was <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> who eventually got the deal done, paying Salzburg a little under Â£12m]</b> Mane tried to force his move by not training. And that began a huge melee.</p>
