  <p><b>[Rumoured <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> target Mario Lemina has confirmed he is seeking a move away from <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> and would prefer to remain in the Premier League]</b> I am physically preparing myself at the training centre, with a few other players including <a href="charlie-austin.html">Charlie Austin</a> and Jordy Clasie. I did not accompany the team in training in agreement with the coach <b>[<a href="ralph-hasenhuttl.html">Ralph Hasenhuttl</a>]</b>. He wants to build his group with the players who want to stay at the club, so he left me out. The best option for me would be to stay <b>[in the Premier League]</b>, but I do not close the door to any club, no country. I aspire to play for the biggest clubs. I had chosen to leave Juventus for <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> to have more playing time - I got it. I have made a good impression in England.<br /><br /><b>[Lemina missed four months of last season with an abdominal injury, but he insisted the problem is behind him and he is now fully fit]</b> As early as last year, I had set my conditions: I wanted to go elsewhere this summer. I was also very frustrated by my injury that lasted four months, so I really want to discover something else. I’m not afraid. I made a choice and I take it to the end. I stand by my plan. I decided to tell the leaders that I wanted to leave, there is no turning back. There is a risk, of course, but I know what I’m capable of. I’m 100 per cent fit and I’m going to prove that I can get back to my best. Some clubs may be more cautious, but they already know me. Today I am fully recovered, I have worked a lot. I am ready to move on. The injury is a very hard one to handle and it requires a lot of work. I did it and now I’m doing very well physically<br /><br /><b>[And after spending two years with Juventus, Lemina is hopeful that he can play for another big club]</b> I’m trying to regain consistency and to become an important player in a team with high goals. I need to play. That’s really my priority. I want to show everyone what I can do. Everything depends on the project that is proposed to me… There are many unknowns. I’m waiting, even if I already had some approaches. I really hope that it will be done quickly, to be able to be part of a team before the resumption of the league</p>

  <p><b>[Lemina acknowledged the difference in the team’s recent displays compared to the first half of the season, and he discussed the reason behind their form]</b> There is a very different <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> in the second half. A high-level <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> has emerged. The reason for this is that a certain game order is settled as we play together. I think we know each other better and reflect it on the field. A new <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> appeared. I am very happy in <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a>. We will look at the end of the season and see what happens next.<br /><br /><b>[Lemina talked up the preparation of the team as they aim to boost their chances of defending the league title they claimed last season]</b> Obviously, we continued our preparations as usual. We are still willing to continue our preparations at the moment. It will be an important match for us. We have a week to be 100%. I will work hard for a whole week. I will take my jersey and return. I will give my 100% on the field</p>

  <p><b>[Lemina reveals how <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> are dealing with coronavirus pandemic]</b> Our club has sent us a work program, I am trying to fulfill them. There are more to be done in the fitness room, but I am trying to put more on it and do exercises to increase cardio and physical condition<br /><br />I am doing extra work. I am in good shape, I feel very good. But of course, we miss the field because training at home does not replace ball games unfortunately. We miss playing on the field.<br /><br />Our nutritionist sent us a certain program, but I was paying attention before. We need to be careful about our nutrition as professional actors because we get the energy we need through nutrition. I would like to thank our nutritionist from here<br /><br /><b>[The Gabon international, who is on a season-long loan from <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>, reserved praise for health workers who are in the frontline of the fight against coronavirus]</b> The work they do requires a lot of courage and they do a lot of courage. I wish them a lot of strength and patience because of their courage. With support, donations or donations. Thanks to them, many lives are saved now. One day, when we return to our normal lives, we will see how big business they are doing</p>

  <p><b>[Southampton-owned Lemina tempted by Marseille return]</b> Yes, of course a possible return to Marseille interests me, even without the recovery project. Marseille remains a club in my heart. If there is such a beautiful project, it is even more tempting. The best option for me would be to stay <b>[in the Premier League]</b>, but I do not close the door to any club, no country. I aspire to play for the biggest clubs. I had chosen to leave <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> for <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> to have more playing time - I got it. I have made a good impression in England</p>
