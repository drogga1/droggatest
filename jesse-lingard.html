You can’t get drawn into all that stuff. I don’t read that stuff, I don’t read papers. That’s why it’s tough for young footballers coming through now, they’re so attracted to social media and what people are saying about them, they don’t actually know how good they are themselves. For me, I just don’t read anything online. When I first got into the first team I started reading things like that, but now I still don’t read it if it’s going well. One person can hate you and one person can love you, that’s just life. You have to get on with it. We’ve got to play in front of 75,000 people every week. At United, it’s the biggest club in the world, so you get criticised either way. For us as players, we’ve just got to get on with it and be thick-skinned. I love football. I love training, I love playing, I love the fans, the stadiums. I love everything about football. For me, I’m an out-and-out footballer</p>

  <p><b>[Lingard targeting trophies as he aims get back to ‘the Jesse that everyone knows’]</b> There’s always that hunger and fight for positions and obviously it goes down to form and where you’re at club-wise so, for me, it’s about getting back to the Jesse that everyone knows and the Jesse Lingard that I know. Things can affect that on the pitch, off the pitch, but mentality is key, confidence is key and belief is key. I’m a player who likes to score goals, make assists and, for me, I need to get back to that, back to my best and I feel I’m slowly but surely getting back there<br /><br /><b>[For Lingard, cups are what count, and he has more than one in his sights right now]</b> For club, my ambition is definitely a trophy. We’ve worked so hard last season, this season we started off well. A trophy is in our sights and we have to concentrate on winning a trophy, getting that winning feeling by lifting a trophy. For England, Euros is a really important competition. It’s in Europe, quite a few games at Wembley, a ground we’re used to, so the ball’s in our court and I feel we can do well in that competition. Any competition that Man United are in, we want to win that trophy. The Europa League, we want to win that, <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, the EFL Cup, we want as many trophies as we can. That’s down to everyone’s mentality and we have that winning mentality at United. That’s what we expect</p>

He’s been a person I can speak to about different things, different issues. He’ll always help you out, he always has a helping hand, so he’s been brilliant with me. He’s always wanted to see me get back to my best, he knows what kind of player I am and what I can bring to the team. It’s good to be back.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on how <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> are feeling]</b> Confident. It’s all about belief for us. You’ve seen the way we’ve played over the last two games and if we can have that mindset for every game - starting quick, starting aggressive, with that intensity - we can beat anyone. As a team, we’re solid, we’re compact. We defend well, hit them on the transition and counter really well. Like I say, it is all about mindset. We could’ve scored three or four against City and if those goals go in, the game’s done<br /><br />I said at the start of the season I’d like to become more vocal on and off the pitch, more of a leader on and off the pitch. The Astana game was perfect for that. From being at the club since I was seven, it’s a huge honour and me and my family are so proud. Everyone back home was watching and were so happy. For me, that was the first step. It’s about carrying it on now</p>

  <p><b>[Jesse Lingard admits he thought his <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> career was over following a social media post during a year in which family problems have taken their toll on his form]</b> It genuinely was a mistake to post it. I have a lot of young followers and I would never put that out there deliberately. It was an accident. I was meaning to send it privately to one of my friends. I was on a plane waiting to take off. Someone from the club texted me and said: ‘Take the video down’. When I realised what I had done, my heart just sank into my stomach. I was like, ‘I am done at United now. This is the final straw’. I was told the manager was going mad, but I was in the air for two hours and literally couldn’t do anything. When I got back, I came in early to speak to the manager and apologise. He said I was on my last chance. He said I had to get my head down and that is what I have done. I am not stupid<br /><br /><b>[Lingard went to the manager to explain his off-the-field concerns, which have also included his grandfather battling cancer and his grandmother being unwell]</b> I wasn’t performing, and he was on me all the time. He wanted more from me. So, I felt it was best to get everything off my chest and tell him why my head wasn’t right. So, I knocked on his door. I am a person who likes to deal with stuff on his own but it’s not necessarily the right thing to do. I always use the phrase ‘be yourself’ but I have realised now that there are times when you just can’t be. My dad and older brother, Louie, have been great support but some of this stuff has broken my heart, you know?<br /><br />He has just told me that everything will be okay. Maybe I just needed someone to say that. He said he just wanted the old Jesse back and maybe I can give him that now</p>

If we keep the consistency and mentality we had against City and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, I don’t see why we can’t win every game. It seems like our mentality changes. To keep that consistency throughout the rest of the season when we come against the mid-table teams, we need to have the same mentality that we did going into the City and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> game. When we start with energy and on the front foot, we’ll cause teams problems all day long.<br /><br /><b>[Lingard, now 27, is eager to continue setting an example for the club’s younger players]</b> I’m in between at the moment. I said at the start of the season that I would like to become a bit of a leader on and off the pitch. I’ve always come through the ranks and not been that vocal, but now I’d like to take that leadership on and be a bit more responsible in the changing room before games. I’ve started to do that. We’ve got a lot of the academy boys coming through the ranks now. They’re getting their time to shine and are doing really well, and we’ve got experienced players as well who have won trophies. That blend is working perfectly for us at the moment<br /><br /><b>[Struggling to contribute in the final third for United, Lingard has fallen out of the England squad]</b> I’m 100 per cent determined to get back in. I’m back to my old self and that’s what Ole and Gareth <b>[<a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a>]</b> want to see. For me, it’s doing well for Man United first and then England will come.

  <p><b>[Jesse Lingard admits he has encountered his share of setbacks at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> I was always small, when I was in the Under-18s I played most Under-16s games because a lot of people were bigger than me, but it didn’t faze me. I always worked hard, I always stayed behind, always did the right thing. I think it’s just working hard, and sticking to the plan but, sometimes you go off course. I went on loan, I had to battle there and fight for my place when I came back to United. I got injured on my debut so I was out for six months, so I have had a lot of setbacks but if you keep fighting, work hard and keep believing, your dreams will come true. It’s the biggest club in the world so it’s tough to start at the bottom and work your way up. There’s a lot of obstacles on the way, a lot of highs and lows, but when you finally get to the end you’re playing for the first team week in, week out, you cherish every moment that you’ve been through</p>

  <p><b>[Lingard: <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> can keep up momentum of 11-match unbeaten run when football returns]</b> I feel like we can. I’ve spoken to a lot of the lads and everyone is training hard. We’re all on the same training programme and we’re all ready and waiting to go. It’s a slow process. We’ve got to keep ticking over and maintain our fitness so when we do go back we can get off to a flying start and pick up where we left off.<br /><br />I think it’s about taking the right steps and the right procedures, just to make sure that everyone is safe. We need to go back when it’s safe. Obviously, everyone is missing football. It’s been a long time and I know a lot of people are getting agitated. It’s about following the right protocol and making sure everyone is healthy and safe</p>

  <p><b>[Lingard looked to model game on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> &amp; <a href="david-beckham.html">Beckham</a> when making <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> breakthrough]</b> I used to watch the likes of <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a>, <b>[Andres]</b> <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> and <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. But obviously coming through the club, I used to watch <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a>, Scholesy, Becks, <a href="nicky-butt.html">Nicky Butt</a>, the Nevilles, the Class of ‘92. I used to watch all the videos of them seasons at home so I had a really good understanding of how they played. They were all British players and they reached the top and won trophies, so it was really inspiring for me to look at that at a young age and I thought ‘I’m young, but eventually I’ll be in their position and I want to know how they do it’. So I’d say the Class of ‘92 were an inspiration for me at that young age<br /><br />Obviously you watch players and try and take something from their game to yours. Each player individually has their own talent and ability. You can watch players and take different elements of people’s game and try and add them into yours. Sometimes I watch <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> off the ball and see how sharp he is</p>

  <p><b>[Lingard admits to lows at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> but believes in long-term trophy vision]</b> The main thing is to concentrate on the game, to get the win. That’s the most important thing. I just think of all the lows that I’ve had, I’m here now, coming onto the pitch and doing what I love doing best. I love playing football and I’m at Man United, so you try and be positive in that aspect and your family are there watching. You’ve just got to go out there and enjoy it, take the positives<br /><br />I think when I was coming through, the history of the club stuck out a lot to me. The amount of trophies that had been won over the years was so inspiring. As a young lad coming through at that time, you can see the success, you know it’s there and you can’t wait to work hard to get into their shoes and be winning trophies as well. We go through different stages of life where things change, managers come in and life transitions but as a club we have that backing behind us. We do have that never-say-die attitude. We have that hunger to win</p>

  <p><b>[Lingard compares Ibrahimovic at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to Michael Jordan]</b> I think it’s very inspiring and there’s a lot of different personalities in the team like <b>[Dennis]</b> Rodman, <b>[Scottie]</b> Pippen, Michael Jordan but they all come together on a day and to get the job done. It was really inspiring to see the work ethic from Jordan to make his teammates become the best and it paid off in the end. It was a really inspiring story<br /><br />I have to say <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a>. As soon as he came to <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> you could feel that aura around him. He had that winning mentality and that drove us, motivated us to win many trophies. Not many people have had that effect. He had that raw winning mentality; he’d played at big clubs before and had that winning mentality. He came to <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and said he wanted to win trophies. At that time, I was a young player, <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> was young. As soon as we won that first trophy it made us hungry for more, so I’d say he brought that winning factor and winning mentality to the team.<br /><br />I couldn’t wait to get back to football but since being back it’s been great. At the moment we’re currently training in groups with specific time slots and it’s been good just to get my boots on and back on the grass with the balls and around my teammates and coaches. If it wasn’t a safe environment then we wouldn’t be training, but we follow the right protocols, we get tested every two days and we keep our distance when group training as well. At the moment we’re taking everything so steady and we’re waiting on the government to give the green light for the next step but none of the players would be there if we didn’t feel it was safe</p>

  <p><b>[Lingard hoping for ‘fresh start’ at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> when <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> resumes]</b> Obviously to finish the season. You know I wanted to go back in fitter, sharper than last season to play every game. I’ve kind of forgot about last season, we move forward and even though the season’s not finished, I feel like it’s another little fresh start. Finishing a season, it feels like a mini-season for me, so to go back in, like I say, flying from the get-go, in which I feel good and then, obviously, for next season to just carry on. I have the right attitude, I have the right desire, I have the right hunger to win games to play for United to obviously win trophies which is one of the most important things. I think we can get there, we all need to push each other to new heights, day in, day out in training. So I don’t see why we can’t take it into the game too. But trophies are the main thing and individual targets like goals and assists, I have a lot else that I target before the season because I do that anyway but last season, for some reason I didn’t set any targets. My mind wasn’t there, I wasn’t really pushing myself. It felt like it weren’t me. You feel like when you watch yourself you’re like ‘that’s not Jesse.’ I know who I am and my family know who I am, I know how I play and, like I say, I didn’t really push myself last season. So this season I’m gonna have targets, I’m gonna have goals that I need to hit, individually and as a team as well</p>

  <p><b>[Jesse Lingard has lauded the potential of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> teenager <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a>,]</b> He knows the game of football, he shoots right to left foot. Still to this day I don’t know what foot he is! He can score free-kicks with his left, take corners with his right. When he has been given the opportunity, he shows what he can do. It doesn’t matter about age, as long as you can perform on the day, and do the job for the team, you’ll be in the team. He is learning at a rapid rate at the moment<br /><br />Mason, he is a cheeky chappy. He is a good lad, holds his own in the changing room, holds his banter</p>

  <p><b>[Jesse Lingard says <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>’s the complete player &amp; a <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> leader]</b> I grew up with Paul and when he first came you could see the technical ability that he possessed at such a young age. He’s gone on to win the World Cup and many trophies with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and us. He’s the all-round player, the complete player. He’s always positive and has a good energy off the field. He’s humble and one of the best guys you could meet. He’s always positive in the dressing room and picks the lads up when they’re down. That shows on the field as well. It’s hard for the lads to get the ball off him because he’s so strong. He’s become the leader-type and has taken on that responsibility really well</p>
