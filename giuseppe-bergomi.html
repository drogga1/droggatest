  <p><b>[Inter legend Giuseppe Bergomi expects <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> to thrive in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> while needing to offer more in Europe]</b> Those who have physicality in our league do well: I think of Ibrahimovic’s <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> of the modern era or Inter 10 years ago. I had no doubts that <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> would have success in our league. I think, for example, of the goal he scored against Sassuolo, when he easily got rid of <b>[Federico]</b> Peluso using his physique. But in Europe it is not enough, there is also the need for technique<br /><br /><b>[Bergomi prefers <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Arturo Vidal</a> than <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a> back to Italy]</b> For knowledge of <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> I think <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> would have been perfect, since he also knows <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>. It would have been the ideal purchase, but <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> has very specific characteristics and I trust <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>, if they go for him there is a reason</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="chris-smalling.html">Chris Smalling</a> dubbed Smalldinis as Italian legends Bergomi explain why <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> defender is shining for Roma]</b> I am not surprised about Smalling. I thought he was good at United. When English players leave their country to learn something else, I think it benefits them. He is physically very strong and when he faced Inter and <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a>, the Belgian did not touch the ball. He and Roma team-mate Gianluca Mancini are the best couple of central defenders in Serie A</p>

  <p><b>[former Inter star and Italy international Beppe Bergomi says <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> is not a champion]</b> He is a great player, but he is not a great champion. The question is if he can start in this <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> team where there is <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, who leads all the others. A champion is someone who is undisputed at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> and in the national team. <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> is not in either</p>

  <p><b>[Giuseppe Bergomi says If Inter can afford <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> they have to sign him]</b> If you have the economic strength to go and get him, you have to do it immediately. It’s true that he hasn’t been at his best in recent seasons, but he would return to a football he knows well. He doesn’t need to adapt and could immediately leave a mark. Beyond his technical abilities, with the physique he has, he would still be dominant in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>. There are few players like him around. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is 27 and would return to Italy in time for his last leap in quality<br /><br /><a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> can bring out the best in him, like in the past. For Inter, it would be a coup to help them challenge immediately, but I guess they will have to sacrifice something. If they aim to build something for the long run, I remain convinced about the idea of investing in players like <b>[Sandro]</b> <a href="sandro-tonali.html">Tonali</a> or <b>[Manuel]</b> Locatelli</p>

  <p><b>[Giuseppe Bergomi says <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> has done a fantastic job of replacing <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a>]</b> Inter had already made their decision on <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a> last year. Considering the way the situation had evolved, I think <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> represent the best choice for all concerned. <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a> has joined a club that doesn’t have the prestige of Inter, but it has won the <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> title and can technically still win the Champions League. Meanwhile, <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> has done a fantastic job of replacing <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a>, so everyone is happy.</p>
