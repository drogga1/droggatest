I don’t know what will happen next year, but I have always stressed that I am a player looking for new challenges - whether that will be at Bayern or elsewhere, I cannot say<br /><br /><b>[A loan deal for Barcelona playmaker Philippe Coutinho has been agreed, with Alaba admitting that fresh faces are necessary despite Bayern doing another domestic double in 2018-19]</b> The season lasts a long time, and we need not only a high-level squad but also a big squad. I think there should be one or two more players to raise the level of competition and to be well positioned with respect to depth. I have faith in our bosses and I think there is still some work to be done</p>

  <p><b>[Kovac laments lethargic Bayern despite Mainz mauling]</b> We struggled to get into the game in the first 20 minutes; we weren’t aggressive enough, we weren’t quick enough. We also made a few mistakes, it’s difficult then. Mainz did a very good job. We got a grip after the first cooling break. I’m proud to be part of this team. Everyone hits the gas in training, you can see everyone loves football. And when we put it into practice as a unit at the weekend it’s great of course</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich’s long-serving left-back David Alaba’s future at the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> champions appears to be up in the air]</b> I’m not worried about that at all. At the moment, we have world-class defenders in our team who are injured. I know my job right now and I’m trying to help the team. Whether or not I will stay in this position, we’ll find out<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether he would be seeking a contract extension or looking to move on]</b> I can imagine both: staying here or taking a different route.

He is a player who is very brave, and he improvises well. You need that at the top level these days and he really does it very well</p>

He’s a world-class player and a world-class striker. We all know that he can score goals and he showed another side of himself today by giving assists. We know that he is very important to us and we’re grateful to have him in our squad. He shows it every weekend – he’s one of the best and maybe the best striker in the world. He scores goals in almost every game and, of course, I think he deserves to be at the top and spoken about with those guys<br /><br />I hope so, he deserves it. I see how hard he works every day. He would deserve it. With <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> having been condemned to their worst margin of defeat at home in their history, Bayern could be forgiven for thinking that they have one foot already in the quarter-finals, but the defender made it clear that there is still plenty of work to do<br /><br />That’s not how we think. There’s a second game and we still have to play that second game. We did very well in the first game, we know that, but anything can happen in football. We have to believe in ourselves but there’s still a long way until the final. We have another game against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and we have to win to get through. We’ll see. We go from game to game</p>

At the moment, everything is calm<br /><br /><b>[Lewandowski added a second before <a href="alphonso-davies.html">Alphonso Davies</a> rounded off the scoring two minutes later in an emphatic victory]</b> We are very, very ambitious. The mood in the team is really great. We want to win every game, and you can see that too. We are keeping our foot on the gas.<br /><br />I try to help the team. It’s fun to play on this team.
