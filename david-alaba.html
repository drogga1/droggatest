I’m feeling very well in Munich, there’s nothing more to say about it.<br /><br /><b>[Bayern crashed out of the Champions League at the semi-finals after losing 4-3 to Madrid]</b> With our squad we have absolutely the potential to continue to get very far in this competition. Our bosses at Bayern have shown over the past few years how much experience they have in putting together big teams that have also been successful in the Champions League</p>

I knew that I could make a lot of decisions <b>[on the pitch]</b> and I guess he’s one of the best coaches in the world, if not the best. He brought a new style of football - not only to our team, but to the world. We improved. We learned a lot about football and the way we played. When we won the championship … the style of football that we played was great.<br /><br />They won the championship in England in a really good way. He’s doing a great job. He was unlucky in that Champions League <b>[quarter]</b>-final against Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[Bayern Munich on the right path to ‘put young players in the position where I am now’]</b> I think this is the goal of the club, FC Bayern Munich. They just built a big campus in Munich for young players. I was the last young player, and it’s been a long time now, but I think we’re in a good way to try and put young players in this position where I am now. We have a lot of potential in the young players. You can see it on the pitch during training, also during games, that they’re doing very well. But, the step up to the first team is very high, so it’s not easy. I think they’re doing their best, and you can see the coach trying to talk to them a lot, trying to give them some tips to improve themselves. We’ll see, but I think we’re going in the right direction.<br /><br /><b>[On Niko Kovac]</b> You can feel the experience he has as a player and also as a manager now. He tries to bring his philosophy to our team now. Of course, it needs time, but he has a lot of experience especially as a player and also now as a manager. Our training is hard, but it’s very effective. We have a really good atmosphere in the team and on the pitch. He’s talking to the players a lot and giving us his trust and good feelings<br /><br /><b>[Alaba said those who were on the tour have been put through a number of demanding training sessions by Kovac]</b> The first couple weeks were very positive. We worked very hard. We’re very concentrated. You can see that every single week we’re getting better, getting closer to where we want to go. Of course, we want to go this way so we can reach our goals</p>

  <p><b>[We have to stand against racism and make the world better]</b> This a good question, and for me to explain it in English is not so easy. I want to find the right words to explain exactly how I think about this. These things aren’t easy to explain, how we have to fight against this thing. It’s an ugly part of this world and also in our game. We have to figure out how to fight against this.<br /><br />When we talk about racists, first, racists still exist on this earth. They’re in Europe and in Austria and Germany where we play, in Italy. I’ve heard a lot of things and also have my own experience with that. We don’t have space for this, especially in football, but also just on the Earth. We have to try to stand against it and make this world better. Football is a good platform for that. I think football is trying to handle this and make things better, but of course it still exists<br /><br />I grew up Seventh Day Adventist. Faith means a lot to me. My parents brought me up with the faith and since I was small I’ve believed in Jesus and tried to read the Bible as much as possible. It helps me a lot during my life on the pitch, but also beside that. I’ve still tried to mature in this<br /><br />I try my best. First of all, I have a lot of English-speaking fans in the world and I want them to be a part of what I’m doing, so I want to keep them close and give them back the love they’re giving to me. We feel over here how much love there is in the U.S. They always welcome us kindly and with a lot of love, and we try to give that back with this trip when we’re here and me on social media<br /><br /><b>[When asked when he started to notice American culture]</b> Music is a big part of it. I grew up in a very musical family. My sister is a singer, my father is a singer. I grew up with hip hop and also sports, especially basketball and football. It’s big over here. Soccer is getting bigger now in the States. I think music and sports were the first things</p>

Our scouts see the potential in these young players to help us in the future. But I don’t think that the focus will only lie on signing young players.<br /><br /><b>[Alaba sees that as a natural progression for Salihamidzic]</b> In his first season he had other things to do. Now that’s kind of routine for him and he gets more and more tasks. He makes a very good job and settled very well. The communication between him and us is very regularly. He knows when he has to intervene. If he has something to say he approaches the players and searches for a chat. You realise that he has experience <b>[as a player]</b>. He’s able to see things from a player’s point of view very well</p>

He’s fast, but I’ve played against other fast players such as Mbappe. I know from experience that it is crucial that I use my strengths<br /><br />It definitely will not be an easy game. But, of course, we believe in ourselves because we know our strength. We are Bayern Munich and we don’t have to hide from any opponent!

I’m happy in Munich but of course I can imagine seeing something else <b>[in the future]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[When asked which leagues would interest him]</b> Spain, England. In Spain it would be the two big clubs, I guess? Real or Barcelona. Also the big clubs <b>[in England]</b>.<br /><br />Yes I was <b>[and Arsenal fan as a child]</b>.
