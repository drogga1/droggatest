It’s been a few months that we’ve been talking about it; I’m happy it’s happened. I feel good in this Arsenal family and I want to win some more trophies. We needed to wait a little bit. We said we’d see after the Euros and then I had my injuries but it’s nice that’s I’ve signed it. I needed to understand why I didn’t play and it was clear between us <b>[Giroud and Wenger]</b>. I’d been injured, I came back a bit late from the Euros and the team did well. I was waiting for my time but when you don’t play you need to keep the faith, keep working hard and that’s what I’ve done. I’ll always try to give my best - that’s my motto - and when I came back, I tried to give everything for the team</p>

  <p><b>[Olivier Giroud is happy to have contributed important goals to the Arsenal]</b> It’s always hard when you see the team doing well and you’re not on the pitch. You can’t show what you want to do, what you can do. I tried to bring my small cog to the machine when I came in. I was lucky to make a difference against Sunderland and Manchester United, and after I played two games in the Champions League and scored again. Step by step, I came back well and you see the confidence was getting higher and higher. I never doubted my quality, it was just about having game time. When you have time to show what you can do on the pitch, it’s better for a striker. I want to carry on like that and keep the efficiency high.<br /><br />I’ve always tried to bring something to the team and I was very pleased to score important goals, especially in the last minutes of games. But as I’ve said before, we need to be stronger at the beginning of games because I’m not going to score goals in the last minute every week!</p>

We were the champions of France with him.</p>

That would give me an average of 20 goals a season with Arsenal. Not bad, eh?<br /><br /><b>[Among Giroud’s efforts this season was a spectacular scorpion kick against Crystal Palace on New Year’s Day]</b> I watched it many times over. I was even sent a video where it was commentated on in numerous different languages live. It was nice. I quickly moved past it and thankfully, four days later, I scored again with Arsenal, an important goal <b>[against Bournemouth in a 3-3 draw]</b>. I believed in an incredible 2017. Already the match before against West Brom, I scored the decisive goal, and there, I was beginning to get a run <b>[of games]</b> under my belt. What followed resembled more my situation in the autumn. At the time, the team was going well, and I, I came back late from the Euros and had to wait to win a place. Then I started to have slight physical problems. Obviously, it is frustrating</p>

  <p><b>[Olivier Giroud is eager to know Arsene Wenger’s plans at Arsenal but has no intention of leaving the club, says his agent Michael Manuelo]</b> There was talk that Olivier was in contact with Rudi Garcia. I said that that was false. When we know exactly what Arsene Wenger is doing, we will ask ourselves questions. We will think about what is possible and what is not possible. Today when Olivier and I talk, there are no discussions about other projects. I believe that when you are at such a level, you first have to think about the club.<br /><br />We are not going to talk hypothetically about if Inter Milan, Marseille, Napoli or Lyon are interested … his future is not only linked with that of the manager. It is linked to what Arsenal are going to do and if there is a change at Arsenal in terms of how Olivier is implicated at the project. Things have not changed since his contract extension.<br /><br />Our desire is be at Arsenal long term. Olivier has been there for five years. The aim for Olivier is still to go as far as possible in this adventure with Arsenal to do great things there. At some point, if the two are to separate, we will see. But it is not the intention of the parties.</p>

It will be necessary to think with my family and advisers.<br /><br />I still have three years with Arsenal, so my future is for now with Arsenal.

People have always questioned me over the years. It does get to you after a while, especially because you’re doing the job on the field. But this is what also helps me to stay alert and focused on what I have to do. I’m not really asking myself any questions about how popular I am. The pseudo-debates don’t really capture all of my attention, to be honest<br /><br />Obviously a forward is judged on what he brings to the side, how he is involved in the game. But a striker’s also there to finish. I have to put it away and I’m doing that. I have a good ratio and I hope to keep climbing up the hierarchy</p>

And that’s why I want to carry on my good journey at Arsenal and I always want to give my best. I would love to win another title, or maybe more until the end of my contract.

You need to show a big solidarity in the team and keep the team cohesion. The most important thing is to keep the head up and keep the confidence high no matter what. We understand when we do mistakes in the game, and the most important thing is to realise and understand what we have to do better and not to do it again.<br /><br />After a bad result, to be honest with you, I don’t sleep too much at home. I try to spend my time with my kids to help me to think about something else but once I come back to the training ground I’m 100 per cent focused on what I miss, what I need to improve. I think as a team we all focus on the same target and we all want to improve so that’s a good point. Obviously, we don’t want to make another bad result the game after so I think we are quite good at that, bouncing back straight away</p>

Everything is here for me to be happy.<br /><br />I don’t know him very well but I like the positive energy he brings from the side of the pitch, always supporting his players, talking to them. I think communication is massive in football and in all sports in general. For me, the relationship you have with the coach is very important. His tactical philosophy is very good because he is Italian. Chelsea is a strong team defensively and they are quite efficient up front with great players, so I think I will enjoy it<br /><br />My ambition is to win some trophies.

It made sense for me to take a new direction in my career. There was a bit of disappointment, even though I spent five wonderful years there.

  <p><b>[Olivier Giroud believes he found the perfect club when he made a deadline day move from Arsenal to Chelsea]</b> Chelsea was the perfect team for me, the perfect club. It’s the Premier League, it’s the club which has won the most titles in the last 10 years, it’s a massive club. I’m very proud and happy to be here. People want you to wear the shirt and give the maximum. I know I will have to be efficient, assist sometimes, score sometimes. We don’t have too much time for integration but I feel very good and the boys have been very good to me.<br /><br />We’re going to take the games step by step. Firstly we want to qualify in the FA Cup and then we have three big games to come, Barcelona in the Champions League and then the two Manchester clubs away, that’s why we need the confidence high. We need to keep it up and build momentum</p>

  <p><b>[Giroud explains Chelsea choice]</b> The coach immediately said to me: ‘Don’t worry, I will do my best so that you are happy’. On one side, it was normal. I had never asked to leave. On the other, I knew that he would not cause problems given the relationship we had always had. He <b>[Wenger]</b> even said to me that it would piss him off if I did not go to Russia.<br /><br /><b>[On his time in north London]</b> It was frustrating at Arsenal, obviously. For a year and a half, it went from bad to worse. I could no longer continue like that. I could not bring myself to spend another year at Arsenal and remain a reserve, even a second reserve. The future looked gloomy with the arrival of a new striker. I wanted to become happier again by playing, so I left - it is as simple as that<br /><br />The easiest solution was to go to Dortmund. Arsenal were happy, Dortmund as well. It was the offer most interesting financially speaking. I have a very good contract at Chelsea but Dortmund really wanted me. It happened after a game of poker, like in all transfers. It dragged on, I started to get stressed because my third child was born at that exact moment. That was also why I did not want to go to Dortmund. Spending four months without seeing him, I do not know how I could have done it. It was why I needed to take the bull by the horns</p>

You don’t just wipe away five-and-a-half years like that. I have said it often enough - it was my ultimate goal. Having said that, it’s not over, I’m still in the Premier League, now I’m at Chelsea. For this year, I think it’s over for the title, but next year, we’ll come to it with great ambitions. I still want to win it before I end my career.</p>

  <p><b>[Olivier Giroud has denied that Chelsea are in crisis]</b> Of course, of course <b>[we are behind Conte]</b>. I don’t even question myself about that. So, it is not a crisis. We played United away and City away. Obviously, we could have done better but these are not small games. We are not happy with that. It is not the day and the moment to question whether we are behind the boss or not. Obviously we are behind him and together. It is not a good weekend for us because our opponents won but we still have nine games to go. We will believe until the end. Keep the faith and some top teams will play against each other. You never know, we need to keep the focus on this and win the next game. Go step-by-step. We need momentum to reach this fourth place. Obviously we knew Man City is on a good run. They play with a lot of confidence and they’ve got one of the best teams in Europe. We still felt like we should have maybe been more focused when we came back from half-time. It is a shame to concede a goal in this period. It is painful. We just tried to score at the end of the game. We tried and tried but they did great pressing. At the end of the day, it is 1-0, it is not 5-0. We could have had some situations at the end but it was too late. Yes, we are very disappointed today. Not everything is thrown away. We will rest and come back stronger and try to bounce back as soon as possible against Crystal Palace<br /><br /><b>[He says that he wasn’t upset at being left out again]</b> That’s a question for the coach. The coach made the tactics and we tried to respect it. It was okay on half-time. It was still 0-0. They didn’t create too many chances, even though they had two or three. I think the target was to be solid until the end and then try to put one in at the end. Obviously, when you concede just after half-time, it is a kick in the leg a little bit but we still thought we could come back at the end. It was not enough but City deserved to win. It is always easy to say that after the game but if Eden had an opportunity to score, we could have said it was the best choice. Obviously it was difficult today. I am not the coach and the coach makes the team. We have to respect that and give our best no matter who is on the pitch. We have some great players, we are a great team, but obviously today Man City deserved to win</p>

Of course, sometimes you can close your eyes and score and sometimes the goal gets smaller like the other game <b>[Crystal Palace]</b>. Trust me, I keep working hard and I am doing my best to reach my targets. So you can count on me to do my best, to be at my best level as soon as I can. I feel very good. I try to do what the boss asks me to do on the pitch. If I play, I try to give the best for the team and it is not up to me to speak about tactics.

That’s it.<br /><br />I am settling in quite well. I am very pleased with my understanding with the boys. Obviously, not everything is perfect but I try to be that target man that the boss asks me to be. To be a link with the No,10s, tonight it was Eden and Willy. It is not easy to sign in winter for a new club so I try to adapt myself as quickly as I can. I think there’s always room for improvement but I am quite happy with what we are doing on the pitch. We have good team cohesion.

We had a lot of chances. We felt that we could have been more dangerous. We succeeded to play our game, we wanted to play this way and we have to be proud of what we have done tonight. That’s even if we cannot be happy with the result. We are not qualified, obviously, but the thing is that we have done some very good things tonight. When you hit the post four times in two games against Barcelona, it is too much, you need a bit of luck. Even more when you are 2-0 down. We didn’t get the penalty and it was obvious, for me. It is frustrating because we felt like we could have done it. But at the end of the day they play with a player who is very efficient. It is very hard to play against Messi.

When you sign like that in January, it’s never easy because you have to acclimatise yourself to the team. But I wanted to be ready straight away, even though I was coming back from six weeks of injury. It was a little paradoxical. The coach started me in the second game and made me comfortable. It went very well. It’s true I played some poor matches, but the content of my game has been very encouraging</p>

Of course, the fact that Arsenal signed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after recruiting Alexandre Lacazette last summer, that weighed heavily on the scales to make me lean towards leaving. Wenger told me that he would make sure, in terms of how I left, that I could be happy because he took a little responsibility with my situation. At the start of the season, I said I wanted to stay even if he wanted a different type of attacker because I knew that I was going to get some playing time and I wanted to fight for my place.

I like challenges.<br /><br />After Montpellier, there was the choice of Arsenal and another club. My agent asked me if I was sure I wanted to go to Arsenal. I replied: ‘Of course, it is that or nothing, even if there is <b>[Robin]</b> van Persie, the star of the club because I know I will have my chance’. I really wanted to go there. And then Van Persie left. But my choices have never been motivated by the easiest thing to do or the money. And until now, these sporting choices have proved to be rather good and rewarding. The situation at Arsenal could not have been worse and it was really a step forward. With Chelsea, I think I have surprised people.

No <b>[competition]</b>, not at all. We just played to help the team win the game. I was a bit sad for him because he didn’t score. I tried to help him in the first half and in the second half he could have scored as well. I wanted to assist him, but I will do that next time. One thing is sure, when Willian or Eden <b>[Hazard]</b> don’t play we just try to give everything for the team.<br /><br />I feel very good. I was very tired because this game demanded a lot of pressing from us. The coach wanted us up front to press very high, not let them go inside and pass the ball because it is in this situation where they are the most dangerous. I tried to combine with Alvaro in the first half. It was good for me but in the second half it was more on the counter attack. We could have scored more but at the end of the day we are very pleased with this victory. It is never easy to win here.<br /><br />If I win it again, it would be my fourth FA Cup in five years. I’m very excited. It’s a competition that is very important for the fans and for us. We are still hoping to qualify for the Champions League and, as long as it’s mathematically possible, we still have hope. The FA Cup is something different. Obviously, I want to win it with Chelsea. I am not an Arsenal player anymore so my target is to finish as best as I can with Chelsea. Chelsea is a competitor. In the last 13 years, Chelsea have been the biggest club. I signed here to win trophies. Obviously, Manchester City have done very well this season to be champions and that’s why it’s <b>[the title race]</b> over for this year. But I believe we can compete very well next season. I am looking forward to that. But we need to finish the job this season.

  <p><b>[Olivier Giroud believes that Chelsea need to become more versatile in their approach]</b> I always want to take this frustration to transform it into a positive thing for the next game. Now, we are going to look at what went wrong in this game. Even though we didn’t do so well, we could have won the game at the end of it. It’s disappointing and we lost two points - West Ham were happy with this draw. We have a big game at the weekend and we want to show our strength, our character. I’m not saying it’s a tactical problem. Sometimes as players we have to recognise the best way to put them in difficulties. Sometimes we rushed our game and have not been patient, or maybe we did not put enough pace in our game. Now, our opponents are starting to know Chelsea well so we need to bring something else. Maybe we need to give a bit more on the pitch as well. It’s a tough time, but this is when you see the men and we have to show stronger character and response in the next game. As a team, we didn’t succeed in finding the solution. We tried too much to play centrally and against a strong defence like that, a lot of players, it was very hard to combine, especially in the last 30 yards. Maybe we should have gone a bit more down the wings and put in more crosses into the box. It was a bit disappointing, we are aware of that and we will work on it. We want to bounce back as soon as possible<br /><br />We had a long trip and it was tiring because we had to stay there. When we came back we had to train straight away. It’s not the best. We are not hiding behind the fact we play two games in a week. We have to do more and we are aware about that.<br /><br />I don’t like to say that I’m ahead of another player, that I’m in first position. I have a fair competition with Alvaro, I played well in the last Premier League game but I wasn’t at my best against West Ham. That’s why I was a bit frustrated and disappointed to be substituted, but the coach made his choice and you have to respect it. I will transform my frustration in a good way in the next game. Alvaro and myself have to score goals for the team so we need to find the net to help the team reach our targets<br /><br />We want to win every single game. The coach will obviously make some changes, but we have many players with quality and we have a good team. We want to be strong and show them that it won’t be easy for them at Anfield. Maybe they will make changes too. We want to keep the confidence high and come back to London with good momentum and start again a winning run. It would be the best preparation for the Premier League game to win. We need to show character after the West Ham game. But there is nothing better than to play the team at the top of the league. It will be a good game, a good test</p>

  <p><b>[Olivier Giroud hopes that Gary Cahill will stay at Chelsea]</b> We have a lot of good players who can play in the starting XI. The problem is we have four-five centre backs and the coach made his choice. Gary is not in a good position because it is quite tough for him, he doesn’t play so much. I understand that he wants to play more. At one stage I was the same and I didn’t like that. We are happy when we are on the pitch. I think his heart is still in Chelsea and hopefully we will keep him because we need him. He needs to be happy, that is the main thing. But I hope he stays because he is important for us, he is a very good player. He’s been at Chelsea for six years, he is one of the faces of Chelsea and one of our captains. We need him</p>

  <p><b>[Olivier Giroud happy to fight for Chelsea place]</b> Last season I was already competing with Alvaro. I played a lot of matches. This year, it was truncated by the fact that I arrived late. Football is an eternal start and even if you have some credit, you have to move with the times. That’s what I did and I’m not worried. Chelsea need two attackers to fulfil their goals this season. What Sarri asks of me? A good understanding with his attacking players combined with tactical nous. Be the first to do the pressing, and press high to get the ball in the other half<br /><br />I did not manage to find the net at the World Cup, but I know what I brought to the team. It was an amazing summer and I think a lot of French people think the same thing. I have never put my personal interest in front of the collective. It shows on the field, the way we defended. We are the team that scored the most goals with Germany 2014 in the last 20 years<br /><br />Go past Michel Platini’s mark with France? I will try to overtake David Trezeguet’s one first then we’ll see after that. I am someone who sets goals for myself if the odds are reasonable, It will be step by step.</p>

  <p><b>[Olivier Giroud insists he is not bothered by speculation Chelsea will seek to sign another striker in the January]</b> All the speculation is part of the sport, part of the job. We must expect good players, good strikers at big clubs. But the both of us just need to carry on and show the team is doing well with us. It’s true that at times we didn’t score. But, as I always used to say, some strikers need to do the runs for team-mates, to do the things that people don’t see. We are fully committed to Chelsea. Even if sometimes it wasn’t perfect, I will always give my maximum. I’m not worried about the future and I’m sure we will score more goals for the team. It (the talk of Chelsea signing another forward) doesn’t trouble me, no. I am a competitor and I will do my best until the end of my contract. It has always been a fair competition between Alvaro and me, and now we are going to step up and reach a higher level of competition between us. Then it will be better for the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Olivier Giroud has aired his frustration at life on the bench at Chelsea]</b> It’s not me who decides the team, making the starting XI, but obviously every single player wants to play every single game. As a competitor obviously I can’t be happy to stay on the bench, but I keep that frustration with me and try to transform it to positive energy to work hard in training. It’s true that every time I play from the start I try to bring something to the team, to play my part. But in these 14 games I started maybe only half of them, so it’s a bit difficult to be consistent in this case. You need to play a few games in a row to be competitive, so that’s what’s a bit difficult in this last month.<br /><br />The first six months <b>[at Chelsea]</b> were very good for me. I needed to leave Arsenal because of the fact that Arsene Wenger wanted to play with a different kind of striker. My time was over in Arsenal and I was really pleased to sign in a big club like Chelsea. I settled really well - it’s like I was part of this Chelsea team for a long time. I felt very good, with a good understanding with the players. We won the FA Cup and I played a few games, and then I had the opportunity to go to the World Cup. It was very good for me.<br /><br />Then after, when I came back late from the World Cup, it was a bit different because the new manager came and you have to start again, prove to him that you are ready to play in this team. It has been a little bit difficult for me to be honest, this last month, but I will keep fighting to play in this team.<br /><br />It’s going to be a special moment for me, the first time I’ll be back at the Emirates since I moved to Chelsea, so I’m looking forward to this game. We need the win to keep them away from us. There’s an opportunity to put them nine points behind us, but in a personal way it’s going to be a special moment<br /><br />It’s a new adventure for them with a new coach. I think Emery has settled well in the club, the players like him, the way they are training, his philosophy of the game. I spoke with some of them and they are quite happy, but you don’t forget what Arsene Wenger achieved in this club. He basically built this club - if you take the different teams that used to train under Wenger, there were some unbelievable teams. We need to be patient with Emery and I think he will do very well at Arsenal. I’m not sure they’re better than before <b>[yet]</b>, but one thing for sure is they’ve got a nice future</p>

At Chelsea you have to be ready quickly because in terms of trophies it has been the best club in England for the last 10 years.

You can see we have a very good academy producing very good players and a few of them are in the first team and that is a good example for the future generation.<br /><br />I don’t want to kill the dreams of these young Chelsea players.

It will be special for me. We need to be focused on our game. We will need to play our best game if we want to win this final. That’s the most important thing. It’s true I received a nice welcome when I played there <b>[with Chelsea]</b> at the Emirates, but as a footballer, you have to deal with this kind of moment. It is very nice, you need to enjoy it, but you have to keep focused on what you have to do on the pitch. It is going to be special for me but I will put it on the side, I will forget who I play against and do the maximum to help Chelsea win the trophy</p>

  <p><b>[Giroud makes <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> U-turn &amp; is open to signing new deal]</b> Yes, of course. There are a few weeks <b>[to go]</b>, games to win and maybe another trophy. And after I think I have two, three nice seasons in front of me. It’s not the time to talk about contracts. But one more time I will take a decision when it comes. It’s behind me. It was a tough month for me. I just spoke with the manager and I believed what he said, that I would get my chance and he has given me my chance. I have tried to give his confidence back on the pitch. I do my job the best that I can and I’m very happy to be back in the team. Of course, my confidence is better. The transfer window is behind me. I’m a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> player, I’m happy here again and that’s the most important thing<br /><br />My confidence is getting higher and higher because I am playing more games. I don’t know how long Tammy will be out for to be honest. When he comes back I will need him to be ready and then we can have good competition again, which will be good for the team. Everybody needs to be ready, to be good psychologically, to give everything for the team. I think that’s what we did against Liverpool<br /><br />I just told him I was happy for him (after Kepa’s performance in the win over <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup). He deserved to be man of the match because he saved us a few times. There is fair competition between him and Willy, they are both training very hard. His situation was the same as mine - when you get the chance to be competitive and decisive for the team you have to take it. He is a tough man, but very quiet. He hasn’t said anything <b>[about being dropped]</b>. We can understand his disappointment, but you have to respect the manager’s decisions. You have to work hard to get back into the team. He has done well against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and it’s a good answer. I’m always talking about the ‘carre vert ‘, like we say in France, that’s the reality of the pitch. Carre is square and vert is green. This is the reality of our job. You just need to be ready when the manager puts us on the pitch. I’m happy for us</p>

  <p><b>[Giroud reveals Europa League final motivation to prove Gunners wrong]</b> That final against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> was obviously very special for me emotionally. When I saw that we were going to face <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in the final, I knew it was going to be special. On top of that, it was only a year after I left. I have quite a lot of friends over there, people who work in the club’s offices. That was extra motivation for me and I knew that it was going to be a high-pressure match. You definitely prepare for the match in a special way, in a different way, because you know that they know you inside out, and they know that I know them well too. You have to plan for the match but not play the match before it’s happened. You have to think ahead. I thought that if I had a one-on-one with <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a>, who knows me really well, or a penalty, I would have to shoot there and not somewhere else. I knew that he knew me really well. I was also going to play against my friend <a href="laurent-koscielny.html">Laurent Koscielny</a>, who has also known me inside-out for years because we started together at Tours in 2008. It was a very special moment but it was like extra motivation for me because I wanted to show them that I still had some energy in me and some good years left in me. I scored, I got an assist and I won the penalty so quite a lot of good things happened there for me because I was involved in three goals out of the four that we scored. It was like in a dream because I couldn’t have imagined that it would go so well, so perfectly for us. I wanted to win things at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> - that’s why I was even more motivated that night - but winning against your old club like that <b>[…]</b><br /><br />After the match, I went to the changing room holding the ball and someone said ‘perfect hat-trick!’. I didn’t know that idiom but I had scored with my right foot, with my left foot and with a header so it was a nice thing to say. I kept the ball and everyone congratulated me for it so it was a great performance and a great memory. It was incredible for a striker like me to score a hat-trick against Dynamo Kyiv but you haven’t won anything at that stage and the whole point of the competition is to win the trophy at the end. It’s all about winning. That final was even more special because it was against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, and I went out there to win the trophy. That’s how you can leave your mark on history, by writing your name in the record books</p>

  <p><b>[Giroud reveals pains of training return ahead of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> restart]</b> We resumed training <b>[on Tuesday 19 May]</b>. It really feels good to be back on the pitch, to get to see team-mates again and to simply be playing football. I’d really missed it. It’s very unusual, as we work in groups of five. We need to maintain a two-metre minimum social distance between each other, meaning no contact. We’re tested <b>[for Covid-19]</b> twice a week. We can’t access the changing room. We can’t shower either, meaning you have to get changed before stepping into your car in order to keep it clean. It’s very hot at the moment too - I’m not complaining about that, but it means we sweat a lot! During lockdown, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> would send us programmes to follow to keep fit. We had exercises to do every day. I’m lucky enough to live right next to a great park and I went there to run almost every day. Towards the end of this period, the whole team video-called and we did circuit training. I did it at home in the playroom alongside my children. I took a picture of us - it was nice. However, nothing replaces being on the pitch. Almost all my team-mates got blisters after resuming training.</p>
