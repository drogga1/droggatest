  <p><b>[Olivier Giroud believes a focus on mentality is the reason why this France team is different to the one that lost the European Championships final to Portugal in 2016]</b> It’s different. After the semi-final when we won against Germany we were a bit euphoric, whereas against Belgium it was different. It’s not the same feeling - we know we still have one game to win. There’s that real focus and concentration to finish the job - that’s why it’s different. We’ve come a long way to get here and we don’t want to waste this opportunity now. You can’t win a World Cup on just talent. Talent alone is not sufficient. You need efficiency. The mental strength is 70 per cent of the job. If you’re ready to work for your team-mates and each other with dedication and commitment then anything can happen<br /><br /><b>[The <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> striker is yet to score in Russia, but knows his role is part of the bigger picture in creating team balance and fluency]</b> Against Belgium I missed efficiency, luck and something to score but hopefully I can have it for the final. In 1998 <b>[Stephane]</b> Guivarc’h played a good World Cup but didn’t score and I think I’m doing a good World Cup, I’ve assisted three times for goals, I’m committed and the work rate and the work every single player puts in is very important. I feel like I give everything for the team and if one goal has to come then hopefully it will come and it will come on Sunday, but if we are a world champions and I don’t score, I’m okay with that</p>

  <p><b>[Giroud defends goalless World Cup]</b> It necessarily results in a little frustration. But it has largely been filled by the title. The collective takes precedence over individuals. I often had to do a little bit of different work, make sacrifices to help the team hold the lead. In fact, you have less energy to be decisive in the last third. Except against Belgium in the second half, I do not have the memory of having missed many opportunities. I even produced two assists. My zero goals does not stop me from sleeping. In the street people tell me: even if you have not scored, you have been important. We might not have been world champions if I scored. Statistics can be used for anything and everything. I was decisive in another way<br /><br /><b>[Reaching further landmarks are still well within Giroud’s sights, with his 81 caps and 31 goals already having earned him a place among France’s elite]</b> A team-mate at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> already asked me this question. As long as I feel good, can bring something to the team and the coach calls me, I am available. I am aware of being closer to the end than the beginning. So I enjoy every moment. I do not put myself any barrier, I do not set any limit. It would be a nice figure <b>[100 caps]</b>, but before, I would like to rise to among the top three scorers in the history of Les Bleus.

He gave me explanations. What was annoying is in January, when he preferred to recruit an attacker who he knew very well, <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a>, it was not easy for me to reap any benefits.

I did not give up, despite my frustration. We’re going to start over for next year with a few changes, I’m happy and I cannot wait to get back. I won a title this year.

I’ve known him now for 10, 11 years. We played together in the second division <b>[in France, at Tours]</b>. He’s been playing for Arsenal for nine years; he’s been the skipper for so many years - very respectful, very professional, always the best example for the young players. The club gave him the opportunity to play at Arsenal, and it was a big, big opportunity for him to show his quality in the Premier League. I think he has always been grateful about that and respectful to the club. I don’t understand how we have got to this situation. I feel very sad for him because he’s a great person and the media wants to give a bad image of him. I’m not at the club, I don’t know what really happened - but one thing for sure is Lolo is very hurt by what’s happening and he’s an emotional person<br /><br />I didn’t want to leave. I spoke with the boss - at this time, Arsene - and I told him: ‘Look, gaffer, I need some game time to play at the World Cup, that’s massive for me’. At the end of the day, we won it, so it was very important for me to leave. It was tough for me, but it was amazing to sign for a club like Chelsea. It was like an improvement for me because - OK, it’s <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> now - but Chelsea have been the best club in England over the past 10 years.

  <p><b>[Olivier Giroud believes Chelsea are capable of challenging for the Premier League title in 2019-20]</b> I think he’s got the squad to compete in the different competitions this year. Many young players sometimes have to go on loan to get some game time. This transfer ban gives them an opportunity to play more, show their qualities and - honestly, trust me - we’ve got plenty of young, talented players at Chelsea. The Champions League is very tough. We’ve got a talented squad, but it’s quite young. Everybody knows the Champions League is a lot about experience. We’re going to fight in every competition - but the main target will be to compete with City and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for the Premier League title<br /><br />With Arsenal it was difficult to fight for the title. We were always fighting for the Champions League places. I won a few FA Cups and Community Shields. When you can’t win the league, winning <a href="fa.html">the FA Cup</a> is quite nice, so I’ve got amazing memories. Chelsea is a club where you have maybe more expectations, higher expectations. They were winning more titles these past 10 years and obviously Arsenal wants to come back to the ‘Invincibles’ days, but it’s not easy. I’m not going to say we are doing things better at Chelsea. We just try to be as competitive as we can, to step up and win more trophies</p>

  <p><b>[Olivier Giroud is hoping to help fill the goal gap at Chelsea following Eden Hazard’s summer switch to Real Madrid]</b> The numbers of goals Eden scored, I don’t know if I can take that from him but we have several strikers with different qualities. We have the quality and the quantity in the squad but obviously you know you cannot replace a player of Eden’s quality just like that. But that’s over. Now we need to forget and not put too much pressure on players who will play in his position. I’m thinking about the young players. I will take the pressure no problem if it can release them. We know there are a lot of expectations but, even with the transfer ban, we have a lot of quality and ability up front<br /><br /><b>[Giroud has also offered his backing to <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>, with a Chelsea legend in the process of getting his message across after inheriting the managerial reins from <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a>]</b> It seems very clear that he wants the best from us. He wants to help us improve and he has a clear idea of what he wants to achieve. He’s a competitor, he wants to win every single game. We’re working on the tactics when we don’t have the ball and playing this 4-2-3-1 we have to know each other a bit better as well. He repeats every day that we have to take responsibility and we have to show personality. He’s insisting a lot on this kind of stuff, playing without fear but with confidence.

He’s not going to be tough with us when we’re not doing well or put us above the mood - if I can say - when we are doing well. He is always trying to analyse the situation and he said he was very proud of our performance after the games. He said it was tough to lose like that, but we need to keep our heads up but, one more time, he said he was proud of us.<br /><br />To be honest, it was very painful straight after the game. I’m very disappointed for the team because we showed a great strong team character after the tough result at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>. Everybody said that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> would be the favourites but we played at least as good as them and we created a lot of chances and we felt we had the best chances to score the third goal and win the match. It’s very unlucky. I’m not used to saying that in football because it’s never random. We’ve done a very good team performance and I’ve been very proud of the boys<br /><br /><b>[The French striker also dismissed claims that Chelsea would be badly damaged by the departure of star man Eden Hazard, who joined Real Madrid this summer]</b> Even if we lost important players, I feel this squad is very strong in both quality and quantity. I have no worries at all. I think we have a super mentality, we are all pointing in the same direction, the same target and I’m pretty sure we can do good things this year. But it’s sad to start the season like that, it’s been quite tough, but we need to recover now and keep our heads up<br /><br /><b>[The France international has high expectations this season and wants to be a big part of <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>’s squad]</b> The most important thing has been to keep the confidence high and obviously being fearless, playing with freedom and that’s what we’ve done. We’ve been very strong. I think we can build good things from here. I feel very good right now. I still need more game time because I only played a few 45 minutes in the friendlies, that’s why after 70 minutes I said to the coach: ‘I feel like I can’t help the team anymore’. So, it was better that the boys came on and finished the job. I feel very good at Chelsea and I’m very happy and I’m sad after the results, but I have high expectations for the season because we have a very good squad</p>

But it was a progression because <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is the English club that has won the most titles, with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, in the last 10 years. I had competitors in attack - <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Alvaro Morata</a>, <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> - who ended up leaving. I won in the end: I played the final of <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup in 2018 and the Europa League final in 2019. Once again, I’m starting the season in difficulty, but as my brother said, I have always grown in the face of adversity. Although I would like there to be less of it</p>

So, we have nothing to lose, we’re going to play our game maybe with more freedom. They are a team with a lot of experience. When I was on the pitch I was thinking ‘everything is so smooth’.<br /><br />They have played together for a very long time, they have a very good understanding with each other. They played well and you have to recognise this. But you don’t have to keep your head down and we’ve got to bounce back as soon as possible. They were the better team so it’s very deflating obviously. We need to move on and focus on what’s next now, even if in the first half we could have done better because we had opportunities to score.

He deserved to be man of the match because he saved us a few times. There is fair competition between him and Willy, they are both training very hard.

I have quite a lot of friends over there, people who work in the club’s offices. That was extra motivation for me and I knew that it was going to be a high-pressure match. You definitely prepare for the match in a special way, in a different way, because you know that they know you inside out, and they know that I know them well too.

I thought that if I had a one-on-one with <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a>, who knows me really well, or a penalty, I would have to shoot there and not somewhere else. I knew that he knew me really well. I was also going to play against my friend <a href="laurent-koscielny.html">Laurent Koscielny</a>, who has also known me inside-out for years because we started together at Tours in 2008. It was a very special moment but it was like extra motivation for me because I wanted to show them that I still had some energy in me and some good years left in me. I scored, I got an assist and I won the penalty so quite a lot of good things happened there for me because I was involved in three goals out of the four that we scored. It was like in a dream because I couldn’t have imagined that it would go so well, so perfectly for us.

I kept the ball and everyone congratulated me for it so it was a great performance and a great memory. It was incredible for a striker like me to score a hat-trick against Dynamo Kyiv but you haven’t won anything at that stage and the whole point of the competition is to win the trophy at the end. It’s all about winning. That final was even more special because it was against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, and I went out there to win the trophy.
