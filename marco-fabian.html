  <p><b>[Mexico midfielder Marco Fabian requests fans avoid offensive chant]</b> This is a good time to send a message. We’re inviting the fans not to shout <b>[the chant]</b>, to support us in a different way. I know people have been doing it for a while, but I think there are different norms now. Now they’re saying they might take away people’s Fan IDs and not letting people into games to support us. They’ve come such a long way to be here with us supporting us, so it would be a shame if they didn’t let fans in. So we want them to support in a different way. It’s really lovely to hear ‘Cielito Lindo’ and the chants ‘Mexico’. We like the support at 100 percent, but hope that we can stop doing this chant that is affecting us as much as it is, and above all <b>[affecting]</b> Mexico.</p>

  <p><b>[Marco Fabian believes he and his Mexico team-mates were lucky to advance to the knockout round after an ugly defeat to Sweden]</b> That’s football. We had a touch of luck. Naturally we don’t go away happy today, but we have to learn from them, we have to learn from today and think about what’s to come. By the work of destiny, luck, whatever it was of life, we’re in the second round and now we have to think about our next rival, so we can learn from today and make sure it doesn’t happen again.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico national team once again a refuge for struggling Marco Fabian]</b> I did the exams, I passed them, everything was excellent and that’s when they wanted to change certain points in my contract that neither myself nor my agent agreed with. They were economic things, bonuses, we didn’t want to stay like that and they tried to put out excuses about my back.<br /><br />I’m fighting for a place in the team, and that’s no surprise - you win your spot like this. Everyone knows I’ve had a lot of problems in the last few weeks, but now my head and my mind are in the right place and I’m happy to be in the starting XI once again<br /><br />I’m going step by step. I know I can get to my third World Cup, to 2022, but I’m going to take this process on calmly. I know that right now I’m in a squad for a pair of friendlies, but I want to go step by step</p>
