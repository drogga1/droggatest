  <p><b>[Juventus are already piecing together plans to land the new <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, while club chairman Andrea <a href="gianni-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> believes the original would be a deserving winner of the 2019 Ballon d’Or]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was the end point of a plan that started eight years ago when <b>[Mirko]</b> Vucinic was our star signing. From him to <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> there were various steps: <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Carlos Tevez</a>, <a href="sami-khedira.html">Sami Khedira</a> … these signings show that <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are bringing in the biggest names in football. When <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, the number one, arrived, it was made clear that now any player can choose <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> ahead of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. Today everything is possible and the signing of Matthijs De Ligt is proof of that. Our next idea is to sign the new <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, but a younger version<br /><br />Our management model is made of clear responsibilities, that must work in sync to arrive at results. The capital growth has three objectives: maintain sporting competitiveness, increasing operating and brand revenues globally. Our growth is confirmed by the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> ranking: now we are fifth, but we have solid foundations to think about arriving in fourth place. Our new logo today is recognised everywhere, we had courage to release it.<br /><br />We also have a player like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, who I hope can win the Ballon d’Or because he really deserves it. We wanted <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to become a global brand and it’s an objective that we have achieved. Our vision is to make <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> prosper as a modern, innovative and iconic brand. The mission, instead, is to maintain sports leadership, consolidating economic and financial results and football results both in Italy and in Europe. The objective of the capital increase is to strengthen the club. We want to think big and to achieve new goals together</p>
