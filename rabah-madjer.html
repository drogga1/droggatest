<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Rabah Madjer on the goal that won Porto the 1987 Intercontinental Cup]</b> The conditions were atrocious, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime occasion. I was really fired up for it. It was just about impossible to follow the instructions of the coach, so we had to play on instinct, and with passion. As the weather got colder, I got warmer with the intensity of it. I was hot, I was really into it. And that team, we all had warm hearts, like brothers, we were very much together. I couldn’t see clearly because there was so much snow falling. I could see a shape, a silhouette, and I sensed that the goalkeeper had come far off his line. So I shot from long range. It was as if time had stood still. A few minutes earlier I had had a shot that was a few centimetres away from a goal. This time the whole team was frozen, there was so much tension. Everybody wanted salvation from the freezing cold. We all wanted to blow that ball over the line. It rolled slowly, slowly and then it was in! We were euphoric</p>
