<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Jeremy Toljan is not ready to give up on his future at Borussia Dortmund]</b> Next summer I still have three years on my contract with Dortmund. So I expect to play for Dortmund again. I will take the situation as it is and will try to get back in the team.<br /><br />Of course I am disappointed that I never got a real chance. But the team played very well and was successful, so there was no room for many changes at all. The full-backs played well also and it was clear to me that Achraf Hakimi would get his chance earlier than me - and he captured it. The manager was never forced to pull him out again. And I had no other perspective than practice well and wait for my chance. That’s professional football<br /><br />He <b>[Favre]</b> didn’t promise me anything. But I still had the feeling that I would get a fair chance from him - although I would have to wait for it. The manager encouraged me from time to time. He said that I’m not written off for him and that I had to wait for my chance<br /><br />When the offer from Celtic came I changed my opinion to thinking it would make sense to go on loan and play more regularly again. I decided for Celtic consciously because the manager really wanted to have me. The talks with him convinced me, also regarding the chances to play. And Celtic is a big name with outstanding fans. They were still in the Europa League, so I knew I would play international football<br /><br /><b>[On Brendan Rodgers]</b> You couldn’t expect that the manager would change in the rest of the season. He was very successful and actually wanted to go to the Premier League next summer. But that’s also football. You have to deal with new situations even when it’s hard sometimes. We have still a good manager now</p>
