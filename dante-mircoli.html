<blockquote>
  <p><b>[The story of <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>’s one and only appearance in Argentina]</b> I was about to give the ball to Pepe… I turn around, take the ball and when I turned to pass I saw a white shirt flying past me with the ball. He was on his way to goal! So I go for him, and when I get him I hit him <b>[on the thigh]</b>. And when he fell, he went down on my studs. I hadn’t seen him, that’s the truth. I didn’t even know who it was. When he got up and I saw it was <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> I thought, ‘I’ve really f*cked up here’. But I didn’t even get booked. They didn’t give many yellows back then, but if you fouled the other side’s best player. When he got up he went off with an ankle injury. I’m telling you: he did it on purpose<br /><br /><b>[Mircoli, meanwhile, still remembers with fondness that world-beating <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> team, despite finishing on the losing side]</b> That <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> were even better than history remembers, eh, they were all good! They played from memory. The coach didn’t open his mouth. All memory, and <b>[<a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a>]</b> ran everything. He talked the whole game: ‘come here, go over there, stop, run, move out.’ And he also played pretty well!</p>
