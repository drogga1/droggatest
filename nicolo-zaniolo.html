  <p><b>[<a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> have confirmed they have tied down Nicolo Zaniolo to new long-term contracts. Zaniolo joined from <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> last summer and instantly fell for his new surroundings]</b> A year ago it was an easy decision to choose <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a>, and today it is even easier - after a season that helped me fall in love with this team and this city. I would like to thank the club for giving me the opportunity to tie myself even closer to these colours - it is exactly what I wanted</p>

  <p><b>[Zaniolo’s first two goals for his country made him the youngest Roma player to score for the national side at the age of 20 years and 139 days]</b> I am very happy, I’ve made another dream come true tonight, but I realise it must be just the beginning</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolo Zaniolo out to repay <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> amid <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> links]</b> The minimum objective this season is to improve day by day. We want to win every game. The objective is qualifying for the Champions League. I’m very happy, Roma have given me so much confidence, now I’ll repay it on the pitch. I’m proud to represent these fans, I feel very good here. The things <a href="paulo-fonseca.html">Paulo Fonseca</a> has to say, he says to your face. He’s a very direct person and he’s helping me improve<br /><br /><b>[At club level, Zaniolo has netted five goals in all competitions for <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> this term]</b> It’s important to keep your feet on the ground at all times and I have a family behind me who do that, who understand football and who make sure I work my best at all times. Beyond that, the only way to manage expectations is within myself. I can’t listen to what others say, good or bad. I’m not <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a>, but one day I hope to be as good. My hero undoubtedly was always <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a>, especially during his Milan years and for Brazil. I watched him a lot. For me, he was the perfect offensive midfielder: strong, technically perfect and capable of scoring and assisting. That is what I wanted to become as a kid and I still do now</p>
