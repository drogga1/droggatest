  <p><b>[Fiorentina released him in 2016 because they said he wasn’t tall enough]</b> Was I disappointed how it ended? Yes, because they treated me badly, given I’d been there for nine years. But it was their choice. Let’s see if those who arrived were better than me.</p>

  <p><b>[AS Roma teenager Nicolo Zaniolo was over the moon after a record-breaking turn on Tuesday led his side to victory]</b> It’s an incredible night, I am speechless and never would’ve expected such a thing<br /><br />However, we’ve got the second leg coming up, we shouldn’t have conceded the second goal and we’ve got to think as a unit. We allowed Porto practically nothing, so we have to do the same in the second leg to qualify. I worked hard tonight, but I am very happy to do that for this team. Celebrating under the curva is an extraordinary feeling, I can’t describe it. I hope to score many more goals under this curva</p>

  <p><b>[Talented teenager Nicolo Zaniolo plans to remain at AS Roma for the foreseeable future]</b> I still have four years left on my contract and I’m happy here. I see my future at Roma. My agent will talk to the club at the end of the season. It’s always pleasing to have interest from great teams, but I’m focused on Roma and the last two league games. I’m positive about the <b>[contract]</b> renewal and I’m happy to stay.<br /><br /><b>[They seek to compensate for the loss of captain De Rossi]</b> I thank him for welcoming to Rome and treating me like a son. I remember that even before I arrived he wrote to me saying, ‘Welcome to your new family, I’m the old man of the house, you’re one of us’. I can’t hide the fact that I shed some tears today because Daniele has shown how important he is for the club and for the team. He is an absurd player, a leader on and off the pitch</p>

I would like to thank the club for giving me the opportunity to tie myself even closer to these colours - it is exactly what I wanted</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolo Zaniolo out to repay <a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> amid <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> links]</b> The minimum objective this season is to improve day by day.

Beyond that, the only way to manage expectations is within myself. I can’t listen to what others say, good or bad. I’m not <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a>, but one day I hope to be as good. My hero undoubtedly was always <a href="kaka.html">Kaka</a>, especially during his Milan years and for Brazil. I watched him a lot.
