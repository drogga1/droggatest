  <p><b>[Veteran goalkeeper Oscar Perez’s Pachuca future in the balance]</b> They’ve offered me six more months, but we haven’t talked about anything to this point. A lot has to do with Rodolfo Cota, if he’s sold or not sold, that’s why right now everything is in stand-by mode.<br /><br />If the six-month thing happens, I’ll do it with pleasure and if not we’ll see what happens. I’ve also got an offer to stay here and work with the club.<br /><br />The change hasn’t been easy and in some ways it hurts to be an active player and then stop being that. I’d visualized it in another way, but today that’s how it is and I’ve tried to adapt to the circumstances. Today I’m more relaxed, but I would like to have a farewell match, a game in which I could play and then go</p>

  <p><b>[Oscar Perez announces his retirement at the age of 46]</b> I thought this was the moment. I chatted about it with my family. I took advantage of everything this game has to offer. I feel grateful to have played so long, and I have had 46 years of happiness. I have so many things in my mind and so many emotions that everything still isn’t totally clear. I know that I’d like to pass on my knowledge and experiences to kids in an academy</p>
