  <p><b>[Inter Milan president Steven Zhang said on Tuesday he was ready to shake up European football with his youthful energy and enthusiasm after being elected onto the board of the European Club Association]</b> I’m young, but age doesn’t matter. I bring my energy and my enthusiasm, new ideas to European football. I feel ready at my age for the new job. Suning have been in football for five or six years, I have been in charge of Inter for three. I’m still in a learning phase. I can offer my freshness, my competence and even a global vision of football. I started working very young and I went ahead step by step. My age is not exceptional at all. In the United States and China many young entrepreneurs hold management positions. The new generation is full of energy and ideas. Football can no longer be limited to the 90 minutes of the game. Technology, video clips and social networks are increasingly important<br /><br /><b>[The 18-time Italian league champions last won <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> in 2010, the year they also won the Champions League, when under <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> they became the first Italian team to clinch the treble]</b> We have a great coach, who only arrived a 100 days ago, and we are supporting him 200 percent. We have bought many young players and even if I know everyone is enthusiastic and would like to win the Scudetto and the Champions League immediately, we must give him time to work. The results will come</p>

  <p><b>[Inter President Steven Zhang said Suning have ‘doubled the revenue’. The Chinese company purchased the club from Erick Thohir, who had replaced <a href="massimo-moratti.html">Massimo Moratti</a> a couple of years earlier. This week, Steven Zhang - the son of Suning chief Jindong Zhang - celebrated one year as President of the club]</b> I want to thank all our fans, who continue to support us with their marvellous passion. I also wish to thank our coaches, players and staff, because the steps forward we made in these years are also thanks to their hard work. Our project began with the acquisition of the club in June 2016, with the objective of taking Inter to the top of the world sport industry and build a club founded on sustainable economic principles. Today, Inter revenue is more than double what it was before Suning arrived, underlining the great work done so far. We are walking towards a splendid future we couldn’t have dreamed of before. Our gaze is always towards the future, to have success on the field and be increasingly innovative, global and close to the new generations off the field. Being in charge of Inter means taking on the grand responsibility of being up to the standards of this glorious club’s history and satisfying the passion of millions of fans in Italy and all over the world</p>

  <p><b>[Inter chairman Steven Zhang has issued a rallying cry to the club’s support]</b> Christmas is an important time to be together and to be grateful for what we have. Inter is a Club that has changed a lot in the last few years thanks to the work of our colleagues and our employees, all of whom are working to achieve the same objective.<br /><br />We are breaking many records. We’ve recorded the highest revenue in the club’s history. At the same time, our digital platforms have seen their biggest ever growth. We have moved into our new HQ and are renovating the Suning Training Centre at Appiano Gentile. We are heading straight towards our objective. We’re working to win, both on and off the pitch.<br /><br />We’re currently top of the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> table (Juventus are now top following Wednesday’s result), and this is significant. We are going forward with our work, and our effort will pay off step by step. But it might also mean nothing: we must learn from the past, we must maintain our concentration and continue our hard work. Courage, dedication and hard work are required.<br /><br />I’ve said it to the players: there will be difficulties, like there were last year and like there have been in this Club’s 111-year history. There are obstacles, but we can overcome them together. We’re not afraid. Today and tomorrow, and with courage, we can compete at the highest levels. Let’s overcome the difficulties and aim for the objectives that we’ve set. We are Inter and want to conquer the world, together. We only live once. Forza Inter! And Merry Christmas to you all!</p>

  <p><b>[Inter president Zhang blasts <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> chief over coronavirus chaos]</b> Playing around the calendar and always putting the public health as secondary consideration. You are probably the biggest and darkest clown I have ever seen. 24 hours? 48 hours? 7 days? And what else? What’s your next step? And now you speak about sportsmanship and fair competition? How about we don’t protect our players or coaches and ask them to play for you 24/7 non-stop? Yes, I’m speaking to you. Our Lega President Paolo Dal Pino. Shame on you. It’s time to stand up and take your responsibility! This is what we do in 2020! Everybody around the world, doesn’t matter if you are Inter fan or <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> fan or no fan at all. Please be safe! This is the most important thing for you, your family, and our society</p>

  <p><b>[Inter Milan targets global fan base in quest to restore glory]</b> For Inter, as one of the most important clubs in the world, you have to try your best to win. We don’t want to <b>[sell]</b> . . . our talented players and attract the best talents from around the world.<br /><br />Since Inter was bought by Suning, the club has gone through a huge transformation. Firstly, our performance on the pitch. Secondly, our commercial and marketing value. You can see from our digital platforms, the numbers are double or triple what they were a couple of years ago . . . so it is logical that our value <b>[to sponsors]</b> as a club is going up too</p>

  <p><b>[Inter Milan’s Chinese president Steven Zhang after call <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> president Paolo Dal Pino ‘clown’]</b> A lot of people think my words are strong but when protecting people and safety, words are never too strong. We always have to deliver a positive message and take responsibility for the public.<br /><br />Playing behind closed doors is the right thing to do, it’s the correct choice so that people don’t take any risks. Playing a match without fans is difficult from many points of view and nobody likes it, but it’s necessary to go ahead with the calendar and all the activities, privileging public health above all else. It’s currently the only viable option<br /><br />When this individual proposed that we move the game with one day’s notice in order to have audiences going to a stadium in such a situation … (it) is completely wrong. Safety and security of public health is the most important thing and nothing can be compromised. Commercial revenue should not be the main priority</p>
