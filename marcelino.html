But every time you looked right, my good side, and we attacked, there were real chances to score<br /><br />I’m not annoyed with him, not at all.

I’m sure the fans will be very satisfied to see that. Today <a href="casemiro.html">Casemiro</a> stopped four or five attacks of ours. Madrid are always going to have opportunities and few teams have come here and made so many chances; we were still attacking in the final minutes, still looking towards their goal, which tells you that this is a competitive, ambitious team<br /><br />In order to reverse that negative momentum we had to get rid of some. To avoid something similar happening, we had to take action: we had to act as we have<br /><br />I am proud of them. We competed to a very high level, looking to score. We showed collective will, spirit, enthusiasm, and ambition. There’s solidarity, organisation and bravery. We’re a team in construction still but we made a lot of chances here. It’s week two but we’re laying down solid foundations and so long as we keep this humility we can grow.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> manager Marcelino has praised his players’ togetherness following their 2-1 victory over <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday night]</b> I am the happiest man in the world at a professional level.

Look at today - with the help of everyone, they gave me the opportunity to win a title, and the affection with the fans is mutual.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> have no intention of parting with highly-rated forward Rodrigo]</b> Rodrigo is not going to leave <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> because that is not a thought in his head. But, like every player of that age and trajectory, if a great offer arrives, a good one for both parties, the coach has to accept it. I have tried to have an important role in discussions, but in sales the coaches cannot be part of that process. For us, Rodrigo is a very important player, but it will be the club and the player who decide. There must be an offer that is good for both parties. The market will dictate that.<br /><br /><b>[The financial muscle of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> allows them to continue cherry picking talent from across Europe, but Marcelino admits it would be better for Spanish football if the playing field were to be levelled]</b> It would be great for the league if the distances were shortened, it would be nice for the competition and there would be six or seven teams competing. We are seeing it in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I hope it can be done here, because <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and Madrid are two monsters. <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> are bearing the fruit of their magnificent work over recent years and are moving away from the rest and right now it is leaving a league for the remaining 17 clubs. Fortunately, <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> has been the champion of ‘the other league’ these last two years. I hope there can be more candidates. But <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and Madrid have had two geniuses, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, who have marked an era. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> with that ability to be different, there are few like him and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. His legacy will be more evident when he is gone. It’s complicated at the moment<br /><br /><b>[<a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> are hoping to find value of their own in the summer transfer market, allowing them to try and close the gap on the Liga elite]</b> We have to strengthen the squad. Teams grow when, in addition to winning, they are thoughtful and smart in how they grow. There is always a condition, which are sales, which are dictated by the offers that arrive. The club must be prepared for important players to leave and react in the market. From there, we want to grow. On the offensive side we have not been effective, although we have good players. We have to assess the offensive side, not only the strikers, but all attacking players. We will analyse the market and see what can be done</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> boss Marcelino revealed Rodrigo told him he was joining <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> before the forward’s move to the Spanish capital fell through]</b> As you know Rodrigo at one point was transferred, so the club told me the same day of training on Tuesday. He also told me that he was going to Atletico. But suddenly, that transfer was not completed. Starting from there, Rodrigo wanted to train again. He never asked me to leave <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>, it is something I want to make clear. We are trying to return to normal. We are a team with Rodrigo and another without Rodrigo. If he is not there, we will have to review the objectives of <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> because in the market it is very difficult to find a football player who brings us the same footballing merits as Rodrigo. To play in the Champions League the team must look for a higher potential. But if the team is weakened, the Champions League must not be a priority</p>

  <p><b>[Marcelino Garcia Toral is adamant <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>’s decision to sack him came about because they won the Copa del Rey last season]</b> I am absolutely sure that the trigger for this situation was the Copa del Rey. During the season, we received direct and indirect messages that we had to discount it <b>[the Copa]</b>. The fans wanted to fight for it and the players too, and they had the conviction to win it. The coaching staff wanted to fight and win the Copa. They didn’t tell me why they didn’t want the Copa, only that it was a minor tournament and that I could be putting the main goal <b>[Champions League qualification]</b> at risk. Winning the Copa was the trigger for this situation. We did not receive congratulations in Seville <b>[after the Copa final]</b> from the owner <b>[Lim]</b>. When I went to Singapore <b>[for a meeting with Lim and club president Anil Murthy]</b>, I was congratulated for qualifying for the Champions League, not for winning the Copa<br /><br /><b>[Former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> midfielder <a href="albert-celades.html">Albert Celades</a> was chosen as the surprise replacement for Marcelino.
