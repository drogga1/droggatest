  <p><b>[Valencia coach, Marcelino García says <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>’s draw against Real Madrid shows Marcelino’s methods are working]</b> We could lose this. But every time you looked right, my good side, and we attacked, there were real chances to score<br /><br />I’m not annoyed with him, not at all. You see the moment you can win at the Bernabéu and it looks easy from the side; on the pitch, after killing themselves all game, it’s much harder<br /><br /><b>[on Dani Parejo]</b> Dani is the leader of this team - not because he talks but because of what he does<br /><br />We have competed – and very well – against the best team in the world, the team that beat <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I’m sure the fans will be very satisfied to see that. Today <a href="casemiro.html">Casemiro</a> stopped four or five attacks of ours. Madrid are always going to have opportunities and few teams have come here and made so many chances; we were still attacking in the final minutes, still looking towards their goal, which tells you that this is a competitive, ambitious team<br /><br />In order to reverse that negative momentum we had to get rid of some. To avoid something similar happening, we had to take action: we had to act as we have<br /><br />I am proud of them. We competed to a very high level, looking to score. We showed collective will, spirit, enthusiasm, and ambition. There’s solidarity, organisation and bravery. We’re a team in construction still but we made a lot of chances here. It’s week two but we’re laying down solid foundations and so long as we keep this humility we can grow.</p>

  <p><b>[Valencia boss Marcelino revealed Rodrigo told him he was joining Atletico Madrid before the forward’s move to the Spanish capital fell through]</b> As you know Rodrigo at one point was transferred, so the club told me the same day of training on Tuesday. He also told me that he was going to Atletico. But suddenly, that transfer was not completed. Starting from there, Rodrigo wanted to train again. He never asked me to leave Valencia, it is something I want to make clear. We are trying to return to normal. We are a team with Rodrigo and another without Rodrigo. If he is not there, we will have to review the objectives of Valencia because in the market it is very difficult to find a football player who brings us the same footballing merits as Rodrigo. To play in the Champions League the team must look for a higher potential. But if the team is weakened, the Champions League must not be a priority</p>

  <p><b>[Marcelino Garcia Toral is adamant <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>’s decision to sack him came about because they won the Copa del Rey last season]</b> I am absolutely sure that the trigger for this situation was the Copa del Rey. During the season, we received direct and indirect messages that we had to discount it <b>[the Copa]</b>. The fans wanted to fight for it and the players too, and they had the conviction to win it. The coaching staff wanted to fight and win the Copa. They didn’t tell me why they didn’t want the Copa, only that it was a minor tournament and that I could be putting the main goal <b>[Champions League qualification]</b> at risk. Winning the Copa was the trigger for this situation. We did not receive congratulations in Seville <b>[after the Copa final]</b> from the owner <b>[Lim]</b>. When I went to Singapore <b>[for a meeting with Lim and club president Anil Murthy]</b>, I was congratulated for qualifying for the Champions League, not for winning the Copa<br /><br /><b>[Former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> midfielder <a href="albert-celades.html">Albert Celades</a> was chosen as the surprise replacement for Marcelino. But Marcelino hopes the fans get behind the man who was <a href="julen-lopetegui.html">Julen Lopetegui</a>’s assistant at Real Madrid]</b> You know <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> is complicated for coaches. I was fortunate that the fans received me warmly. I am proud to leave two years later with the same kind of acceptance, and I won’t forget that. I have been really happy in <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> and lived unforgettable moments. I hope the people now support <a href="albert-celades.html">Celades</a>. I wish him the best of luck</p>
