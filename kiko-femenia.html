  <p><b>[Kiko Femenia has called on his £40 million-rated team-mate Richarlison to join him in staying at Vicarage Road next season]</b> think he is still a very young player, he shows great potential, he did very well this year and he has helped us to win games. But, of course, he is young and I hope he stays here. We will help him to get even better day-by-day. Of course, if I could I would stay for my whole career. I think that there is a difference between La Liga and here and it is better here for my style of play. I would like to stay here. Watford was the team that bet the most for me. I thought the most difficult thing was going to be to relate to the different kind of people here in the UK. It was easier than I thought, I managed to get used to it in a quick way. I speak with the people who talk my language in the dressing room. So mainly Perreira, Britos and Carrillo. They have been very helpful, especially in the beginning, they have been my point in the middle and they are my team-mates.<br /><br />I think what has surprised me the most here in the Premier League and the big difference with Spanish football is that nothing is finished until the 90th minute, or whenever the referee blows his whistle. I have seen games where we are winning 1-0 and we end up losing 2-1 in the last minutes. No one gives up when losing, maybe in Spain when you are losing one game and it is only five minutes left, you know it is going to end like this. It is very difficult to change it. Here, you can win, draw or even lose the game in those last minutes. I used to see all these stadiums when I was watching on TV as a kid. Now I have got the opportunity to play in them and what has surprised me a lot was the Emirates at Arsenal, it is a great stadium. I think that any football player would like to play in these stadiums. My dream is to play here in the Premier League for as many years as possible and to stay here. If I have to go then I will go but I want to play here as much as possible.</p>

  <p><b>[On himself]</b> Yes, I trained with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and it was always great but the guy that surprised me the most was Xavi Hernandez because in the midfield, he never lost the ball. When I used to train with him, he was incredible. I was only 17-years-old and I was doing what I enjoyed <b>[at Hercules]</b>. Now I have gone from good to bad moments, from bad back to good. I learned from my mistakes in the past while I was young but now I am doing what I enjoy so I only think about this. Going to Barcelona is always right the right decision, just like going to Real Madrid and Castilla. It is true that I didn’t have the best experience of my professional career there <b>[in Barcelona]</b> but I think everything helps you to grow professionally and as a person. I think the main thing was that when I was in Hercules. I was the wonderkid and the guy that everyone was looking at. When I went to these big teams, I was just one more player and I think this was the big difference between what I was expecting, as a youngster, to be the wonderkid again. I was not one, I was just one of the group. That’s the bit that hurt me most, I didn’t feel as important as I was in my previous club I think this was the big thing that changed my career.<br /><br />No, it was not a big problem to go down because sometimes in life you have to make one step backwards to take two steps forwards. I think that these are the things that you have to do and it was not a big problem for me. It was difficult to leave Alaves in the end as I enjoyed being there, but professionally I wanted to grow and in the end it was the right decision. I had other offers in Spain, yes. In the Premier League, I had Watford. I also had the opportunity to make my dream come true and play in the Premier League, it was something that I always wanted to do<br /><br />Well, I have to say a great memory was when we won and went up with Hercules. That was one of my best memories as I was starting to play regularly in the first team. It is a big memory for me. I was born there, it is a city I love. The city I grew up in. I love to go back, when I have the time, to see everyone. I began in Hercules in Alicante. That was the team of my city, of course, when you are a kid you never think you are going to make it. To play in the top two leagues in the world. I managed to do it and that’s good<br /><br /><b>[On Gerard Deulofeu]</b> Of course, I was with him in Barcelona for two years. Of course, now he is here with us and it is great. I am very happy to see him and hopefully we can do great things together</p>
