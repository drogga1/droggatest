  <p><b>[Ozil has struck up a close friendship with Hasan Dolanbay, co-owner of Likya]</b> From the beginning Mesut came with his girlfriend at the time. He didn’t know who I was but of course I knew him. I said I could recommend him something or he could choose something on the menu, he said ‘no problem we will choose something’ and after a while we bonded and became friends. I gave him my card and told him if to call me if he needs any help because he didn’t know any Turkish people <b>[in London]</b>. Every week he came here after finishing his training - he spent a lot of his spare time in the restaurant. He loved being here because he didn’t know anyone else.<br /><br />He gets privacy here and it feels like a home for him. I never asked a favour for him. I say no to people who come to the restaurant and ask for pictures. He’s very shy if he doesn’t know someone well. He likes everything - especially Turkish breakfast. His origin is Turkish and we try and cook everything how a Turkish mother would cook. Egg, sausage, borek - he loves this kind of stuff. He never eats anything heavy before a game, he knows his limits. He loves Turkish food and this is his favourite Turkish restaurant. He always speaks Turkish to us. Not many people know how intelligent he is and he can speak several languages including Turkish, English, German and Spanish. He’s a traditional man who can have food anywhere in the city but he’s most comfortable here and enjoys it more here<br /><br />It was just fish and chips at the start but one day we sat down and realised there was a gap in the market - people love Turkish food. We decided to decorate the restaurant, improve the menus and do something that nobody had done at that point in London. Fifty-to-sixty per cent of our customers are Jewish as we’re at the heart of the community - they love our food because it’s similar to Jewish cuisine<br /><br />Hector Bellerin comes in. <b>[Granit]</b> Xhaka and <b>[Shkodran]</b> Mustafi as well. Tottenham, Watford and Chelsea players come in - Mousa Dembele most recently. Pep Guardiola’s brother has dined here too, and <b>[Germany coach]</b> Joachim Low has met with Mesut here before. When I saw Mesut come here everyone was so excited. He’s a really good person<br /><br /><b>[Ozil answered questions from fans which included ‘what is your favourite restaurant?’. His reply undoubtedly put Likya on the map]</b> I just said thank you. It was done from the heart. People want to hear something from the famous people. After this a few people came and said they got a recommendation from Mesut. I didn’t mention him and just wanted to make sure they enjoyed their meal. Even from Germany people have come to visit us!</p>
