  <p>[The LA Galaxy have sent defender AJ Delagarza to the Houston Dynamo in exchange for $125,000 in general allocation money and $50,000 in targeted allocation money] This decision was extremely difficult to make. AJ is a champion and will always mean so much to this club, this city and our fans. We thank him for his many contributions to the Galaxy and know he will forever be a part of our family. With that said, we feel that this will give us flexibility to strengthen our roster going forward with the use of additional allocation money.</p>

  <p>[The LA Galaxy have signed midfielder Joao Pedro from Portuguese side Vitoria Guimaraes] Joao is an extremely talented midfielder who has experience playing at a high level in Portugal. He is only 23 years old and has the best years of his career front of him. We identified him as a top target this offseason and we think he can immediately help strengthen our midfield.</p>

Romain will play a valuable role in our team’s success this season and we look forward to him joining the team ahead of the 2017 season</p>

  <p>[LA Galaxy and Jelle Van Damme have agreed to a contract extension] Jelle showed last season that he is undoubtedly one of the best defenders in Major League Soccer. His contract will still give us the flexibility to bolster our roster during the summer. He is a leader, a winner and a competitor and will continue to be a centerpiece along our back line. We are thrilled to have Jelle as a member of the Galaxy for years to come.</p>

  <p>[The LA Galaxy have signed midfielder Jaime Villarreal and defender Nathan Smith as homegrown players] Jaime is a player that has grown up in our system while excelling with LA Galaxy II. We are confident that success can continue with the first team and we are excited to add him to our roster.<br /><br />Nathan is a player that has shown promise during his time with LA Galaxy II. His signing with our first team is a testament to his continued growth on the field. We think he can continue to develop to contribute to our team at the MLS level</p>
