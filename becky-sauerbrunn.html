  <p><b>[The USA aims to press high but if teams can play through that high pressure]</b> You’re changing from a defensive formation to an attacking formation. You’re trying to get more attacking players on the field. You’re also then now giving up spaces on the field that you don’t give up in a 4-4-2 so you’re learning basically how to defend in a different shape and attack in a different shape.</p>

  <p><b>[Defender Becky Saurbrunn on Sam Mewis]</b> She just offers something something elevated in that position. She can break lines on the dribble, she can break lines with the pass and she’s got a shot.</p>

Pay discrimination has been a hot topic during the Women’s World Cup in France, with 28 U.S. women’s national team players currently embroiled in a lawsuit with U.S. Soccer over wage issues. The lawsuit, which was filed in March, is being led by current USWNT stars Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd and Becky Sauerbrunn.</p>

  <p><b>[Women’s World Cup recap - U.S. beats France 2-1 on two <a href="megan-rapinoe.html">Megan Rapinoe</a> goals]</b> In a World Cup, you need to be able to win pretty and win dirty. And sometimes you just have to put in a hard shift. Tonight was one of those nights where you put in a hard shift<br /><br />I’ve been very fortunate to be in some pretty amazing, amazing games. But I’ll put this top 10.</p>

  <p><b>[Moving from college to the pros should be a goal for players and coaches in this country. The pro game, with more pressure, more talent, more fans and more exposure is a crucible that, in theory, will produce better coaches]</b> You want to see more qualified women’s coaches in the women’s game definitely. I think Laura is an excellent coach and she’s proven time and time again with whatever team’s she’s on that she likes to play good soccer and I think we need more coaches like her<br /><br />We in NWSL deserve the best coaches and so I’d like to absolutely see more female coaches coming through the ranks</p>

  <p><b>[Becky Sauerbrunn on white privilege]</b> As a white person, there’s a responsibility for us. We need to educate ourselves and we need to learn and try to understand as best as we can. We, as white people, will never know what it is like to be a black person in America. And so it’s so critical for us to do what we can and, starting off on that, that’s educating ourselves. And so that’s kind of what I was trying to put out with the books that I recently ordered to add to my reading list</p>
