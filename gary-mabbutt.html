  <p><b>[Gary Mabbutt says <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> should bring <a href="jermain-defoe.html">Jermain Defoe</a> back in to fill <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>’s boots until the end of the season]</b> You can’t just go into a panic buy just because your star player is going to be out for two or three months, because when that player comes back the competition is going to be even greater. The player coming in may not want that. Ideally, you’d bring back in <a href="jermain-defoe.html">Jermaine Defoe</a> on loan just to cover that area<br /><br /><b>[Despite the fact Piatek has only scored 13 goals in 26 <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> matches for the <a href="ac-milan.html">Rossoneri</a>]</b> I’ve seen Piatek a number of times, he’s a classic number nine. He’s brave, he’s good in the air, scores with both feet. His control and first touch are good, he’s strong and he scores goals<br /><br />I think we’ve got a very good squad - last year in the Champions League in the game against <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> <a href="lucas-moura.html">Moura</a> stepped up and got a hat-trick which saw us get through to the final so we’ve got players there that can step up to the mark and now the opportunity is there for them again</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Mabbutt says <a href="harry-winks.html">Harry Winks</a> has all the attributes to inherit the captain’s armband at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in the future]</b> Last Thursday myself and Harry were visiting a care home for people with dementia, we went there with the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> football foundation with a company called Sporting Memories. Harry was a superstar, amongst all the elderly people in bad conditions and Harry was fantastic. I’ve got the belief that if he continues to improve as he is, I think he could be a future captain of the club<br /><br /><b>[Mabbutt was delighted to see <a href="steven-bergwijn.html">Bergwijn</a> giving everything to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s cause]</b> <b>[Bergwijn]</b> He came into this game knowing we’d be on the back foot, knowing he’d have to graft and work hard. There was no showboating, that’s not how we play. He came in and saw exactly what it was like, saw how we want to play to get results. We can play some fantastic football at times but initially you have to go out there and win the right to play and yesterday we had to exactly that.</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Tottenham captain Gary Mabbutt says <a href="eric-dier.html">Eric Dier</a> crowd altercation understandable]</b> I was at the game last night. It was a disappointing result. Eric saw his brother in the crowd apparently. Something was going on. There was an altercation. You never normally react to things in the crowd but it is a bit difficult when you see your brother involved. It is human nature to go in and try and help out. Of course you cannot do that as professionals. I am sure with the benefit of hindsight he would have handled things differently. Players have to keep their cool at all times. Every single game you play, you get abused in one way or another. You have to accept that. It is part of the game. You know full well you cannot react. There was evident disappointment at the end of the game. Frustrations boiled over. A moment of madness maybe. If he had second thoughts he would have gone to the security guard, sorted out his brother and then gone to the dressing room. It should not have happened. Stadiums now can pinpoint every single person. They will be able to find out what went on. Most football fans I come across the country are fantastic people</p>
