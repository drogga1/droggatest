  <p><b>[Kaka says he wants to extend MLS stay, but no progress made on new deal]</b> My first option is to stay here. I want to keep playing here in Orlando. But we haven’t talked about that yet. We’ll wait for the right time to speak about that. Now I just focus on playing, staying in shape and being happy on the field. Then it will be the moment to speak about that.<br /><br />It’s not good when you start the season with an injury, but to see the team winning every game and playing very well, that made it easy. For me, actually, it’s very good because I’ve always said the most important thing for a team to be a championship team is the group. To see the group playing very good without me - but not just without me, but without a lot other players because of injuries, cards and different things - shows me that we are <b>[heading]</b> in the right direction.<br /><br />The team has an identity, independent of the players. Of course there are a lot of players that can make a difference during the game, but the most important thing is the identity of the team, and the philosophy that we are playing. It shows me during this period that the team is in the right way<br /><br />Yes, I’m very happy here. This is the best part because it’s more than I thought. When I came here I knew that it would be a lot of different things on the field, off the field. In different countries, different cities, but I wanted to live this experience. Live in another country, live in another city, have this experience here in MLS, and it’s much more than I expected. I’m very, very happy with that and very happy to be part of this moment of the league, and see the stadiums full, everybody enjoying the league. And now our stadium, every game is full. This makes me happy and makes me proud of the choice that I <b>[made]</b><br /><br />For me, it’s winning. To come here to prepare myself to win tomorrow is the best thing that I can do. Of course I don’t know if we’re going to win or not, but preparing myself to win is something that is still motivating me. If we win tomorrow I’ll be so happy that everything we’ve done this week is very good, and we’ve had a very good result. So winning, I have targets with that. So, it’s winning against Kansas <b>[City]</b> tomorrow, make the playoffs, <b>[winning]</b> the league, and a lot of things with that. Help this project, and help the league. It’s something that is going very well<br /><br />We don’t have to wait until the end of the year <b>[to sign a new contract]</b>, but now the club hasn’t said anything yet. I think everybody’s just waiting and happy with this moment, and for sure the moment will arrive to discuss a renewal<br /><br />My future is on the field. I think it’s maybe two years more. It’s something I’m still looking at. And of course I will see every year what is my condition, my body, my motivation, my mind. So there are a lot of things to see, and if it makes me happy to come here every day and train, I will keep playing. This is something that I still love to</p>

  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid star Kaka has revealed his favourite young player in football is fellow Brazil star and Barcelona forward Neymar]</b> I would say Neymar is my favourite young player. I love the way that he plays. He makes everything so easy and he’s enjoying playing with Barcelona.<br /><br />Brazil are doing very good. Now <b>[head coach]</b> Tite has put the national team on the right track. They’re playing very good. They’ve qualified for the next World Cup and Brazil will probably be one of the favorites for the next World Cup. About my time with the national team, really I don’t know. I just think about <b>[Orlando City]</b> and if I think I’m playing good here, consistently every game doing good, maybe. If the national team coach thinks I can help in some way the national team, I’ll be ready to play for Brazil. It’s not a thing I think about every day. I’m focused here, but if I have a chance in the future to be back I’ll be glad to be back to the national team<br /><br />I think it’s natural. When the coach thinks I’m not part of the group and he doesn’t count on me anymore, it probably shows me as well. I think that needs to be good for both sides. If it’s good for me to go to the national team and play there, not just go there to give experience, but to play and be useful, I think it’s good. And for them, if they think that I can help them in both ways it’s good as well</p>

He was an amazing player, and he’s smart, he’s intelligent, but the results he’s been having this season is incredible. He can win the league and he can win the Champions League, so it’s very, very good results for just two years as a professional coach.

When we were <b>[at Real Madrid]</b> we talked a lot and he told me one day that when he stopped playing he didn’t want to be a coach, he just wanted to stay with his family and enjoy life a little bit, travel around<br /><br />And after two, three years he missed it … the field, the smell of the grass, and he thought, ‘No, maybe it’s time to get back and start to learn more about soccer off the field.’ Then he did the coach course, and he became Castilla and youth teams coach for Real Madrid. Then after that he became the first-team coach<br /><br />So I think that’s a good example for me, maybe, but now it’s not something I think about, but maybe in the future</p>

He’s a very good player, and what he’s doing this season so far, with Juve in the final of the Champions League - and playing for Brazil - he’s an example of how using the techniques and everything that we have today you can still play on a very good level <b>[at this age]</b>.<br /><br />He’s an athlete like the old days. He sleeps well, he’s healthy, easts healthy food. He takes care of his body and it shows that you can still play at a high level at 33 - he still has a lot of years to play. I’m supporting him and I hope he can still do very good in Europe<br /><br />Cristiano is an amazing professional. He takes care of his body, he takes care about his food, and he tries to sleep. Of course he’s a very talented player and he’s got his motivations to win every game, to win the Ballon d’Or every year, so he keeps moving, he keeps trying to score. This is something that he’s very strong in his mind<br /><br />Of course I will support Real Madrid, my ex-team, my former team. I have a lot of friends on both teams. Juve’s doing very good. They have very good defenders. They’ve conceded few goals in the Champions League so it will be an amazing game. But as I said, I will support Real Madrid</p>

The only thing separating City and I was my final word.<br /><br />It came to the point where all of the numbers and the finer details had been discussed. The wages I had been offered were much, much higher than what I was earning with Milan.

They had gone straight to Milan<br /><br />I came to the conclusion that it was not quite the right time for me to go to City, and the main reason was the uncertainty over the squad-building process. It wasn’t clear to me how the squad would be reshaped and I wasn’t convinced it would work. I was being asked to swap one of the most historic and successful clubs in Europe for a team who were only at the beginning of a new project, where I was supposed to be the first big player.

It’s only natural.<br /><br />I’d finally come to the conclusion that it wasn’t quite the right time for me to go to City, and the main reason was the uncertainty over the squad-building process that they were about to undertake. It wasn’t clear to me how the squad would be reshaped and I wasn’t too convinced it would work<br /><br />When I finally left Milan a few months later, I went to Real Madrid to make my dream come true. That was one thing that had always been quite clear in my head: if I had to go to another club after Milan, it would be Real Madrid. But life has its own ways and at that moment the offer came from Manchester City. I guess my decision to deny City’s offer is proof that the money was never a priority in my decisions</p>

  <p><b>[Kaka may be the next AC Milan icon to join a reunion of legends at San Siro]</b> My rapport with Milan has always been very close and now with the return to Leo and Maldini, figures I played with and have a good relationship with to this day, my bond with the club is even tighter. My priority is to remain in Brazil with my children, but the doors are always open and I could see how the world of a director of sport works. I wouldn’t necessarily have to remain in Italy or have particular responsibilities. It’d be more getting to understand the market.</p>

I’ve seen so many of them in recent days, with me, with <b>[Alexandre]</b> Pato, with Ronaldinho, Cafu, Rivaldo … with all the Brazilians who have been part of Milan’s history. We need to avoid these comparisons so he can come here and play calmly and peacefully. But I’m confident.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Brazil star Kaka claims that Jose Mourinho is partly responsible for his disappointing spell at Real Madrid]</b> The problem in Madrid was continuity. First, it was because of the injuries. The first year I had a hip problem. I pushed to reach the World Cup and then I had an adductor injury. After the Cup I have a knee operation and I’m out for six months. And when I return I have Mourinho. My problem in Madrid was continuity. First for the physical issue and then for the choice of the coach. I spent three years trying to convince Mourinho that he could give me opportunities. But it was his choice, it was beyond my reach.<br /><br />There is no problem between us. I was in Manchester for a sponsorship gig and I stayed at the hotel where Mourinho lived and we talked for two hours. At some point we had a misunderstanding because I believed that I had to play and he believed that I did not. But they were respectful disagreements. I never rebelled and told him ‘I’m leaving here’, nor did I go before the press to complain. I told him: ‘It’s your choice, but I think you could have other options because I think I should have a chance to play. Now, you must choose’. He had no arguments. He told me he was not going to play because the position was for Ozil. I thought I could contribute. Mourinho is really what you see in the cameras. He has his explosive moments, but he’s a very smart guy. What people see at press conferences is all prepared and planned and knows exactly what they are going to say. The problem I had with him was because of his choices. I thought he was wrong. But the team worked. We won a league and we reached the Champions League semi-finals</p>
