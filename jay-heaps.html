  <p><b>[New England Revolution hope two-striker look of 2016 can form foundation for 2017 success]</b> It was across the board. I think maybe we got a little stagnant. Maybe we didn’t adapt well enough. Maybe we became too predictable.<br /><br />When we decided to make the change, it felt like a big change because of how we’d been playing and we’d had such success in the other formation. But in reality, the players took to it really well<br /><br />We had spent a lot of time working on it, so when we did make the switch, players were revitalized, showing up in a little different positions, creating a little different angles for themselves. The passing lanes became different and we had to be a little tougher defensively<br /><br />When we played with the diamond, the No. 6 stayed as the No. 6, and really stayed and protected the two center backs. I think we’ll incorporate that more across all formations</p>

  <p><b>[On Kelyn Rowe]</b> Kelyn’s been excellent. He’s clearly been versatile for us. He’s played a couple of different positions, but he’s been very consistent in those performances. Every week he’s putting in a good shift going forward and defensively.<br /><br /><b>[Versatility]</b> got him back on the radar. You look at midfield, outside back and in the course of one game he can play both positions, it makes a coach’s job a lot easier, especially when you’re filling out a roster and trying to compete internationally</p>
