<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Marcel van den Berg believes Mahathir’s stance on the matter has nothing to do with evidence but is rather a consequence of the country being politically sidelined after the MH17 probe began without its participation]</b> From the start of JIT <b>[Joint Investigation Team]</b> there has very likely been a lack of trust between Ukraine and Malaysia. The reason why Malaysia became a full member only four months after <b>[the downing of MH17]</b> has never been made public. Ukraine likely did not trust Malaysia because its close relations to the Kremlin. The way the black boxes were recovered might have also done harm to the relationship <b>[in reference to a covert operation undertaken in late July 2014 by a Malaysian team to secure the flight data recorders and bodies of victims in cooperation with separatist rebels in Donetsk and their then leader Alexander Borodai]</b><br /><br /><b>[When the Netherlands and Australia announced last May that they would hold the Russian state legally responsible for the downing of MH17, Malaysian authorities were only notified just prior to its announcement]</b> It is to prevent leaking that intention to Russia. It shows a lack of trust. It could be Malaysia is not given all evidence to prevent leaks. It could be a reason for <b>[Mahathir’s]</b> statements … Malaysian experts did attend the session in the UK where the data of black boxes was downloaded and listened to. However, Mahathir states this was not the case, contrary to what is documented in the final report of the Dutch Safety Board (DSB). Malaysia should have trust in the Dutch prosecution and judges and wait until the evidence is presented in court. JIT is a neutral body. If Mahathir disagrees, he should present facts and not make statements on, for example, the black boxes, which are not true</p>
