  <p><b>[Guatemala U-15 players denied U.S. visas amidst Trump administration’s threats toward Central American nation]</b> Concacaf has provided the Guatemalan soccer federation the customary visa application process support we provide all of our Member Associations for competitions taking place in the U.S. We do not know why certain applications by the Guatemalan Federation have been denied. While ultimately this is a matter for the Federation to address with the U.S. State Department, we will continue to provide any necessary assistance to to the Federation so they are able to participate in our Concacaf Boys’ Under-15 Championship</p>

  <p><b>[Concacaf postpones 2020 Nations League Finals due to coronavirus outbreak]</b> At Concacaf our thoughts are with all the communities affected by the spread of Covid-19 at this difficult time. As we continue to assess our competitions scheduled to be played in the coming months, the welfare of everyone involved in football across our region remains our first priority. Given the ongoing public health situation, and following consultation with <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> regarding the international football calendar, we have made the decision to suspend the Concacaf Nations League Finals, which was scheduled for June 4th - 7th 2020 in the Houston and Dallas areas. The event, which includes the Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico and USA men’s national teams, will be rescheduled to take place at a later date in venues to be determined. This will be confirmed following further discussions with <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> regarding the remaining international windows in the football calendar, and will obviously be subject to public health authorities deeming it safe for professional sports events to resume</p>

  <p><b>[CONCACAF forced to change World Cup qualifying plans as <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> cancels September international break]</b> CONCACAF welcomes the decisions made by <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> regarding the men’s and women’s international match calendars. Many of our Member Associations and their communities continue to face significant challenges due to COVID-19 and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time. The rescheduling of competitions, and agreements on new international match dates, provide some encouragement across the football world and enable Concacaf to progress our planning to resume men’s and women’s international football when it is safe to do so<br /><br />The challenges presented by postponements to the football calendar, and the incomplete <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> rankings cycle in our confederation, means our current World Cup Qualifying process has been compromised and will be changed. We will now work with the new framework provided and liaise with <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> to finalize a new World Cup Qualification format for the CONCACAF region. We will also work with our stakeholders to reorganize the CONCACAF Road to Gold Cup Qualifiers (originally scheduled for March and June 2020), the Concacaf Nations League Finals (originally scheduled for June 2020) and a range of other suspended competitions. A further update on World Cup Qualifying and other CONCACAF men’s international competitions will be provided in the coming weeks. We will also continue to work with <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and the other Confederations on the international match calendar process for women’s football to ensure we are well placed to support the return of the international women’s game as soon as possible</p>
