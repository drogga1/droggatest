  <p><b>[Chris Ikonomidis is hoping the goals will flow in the second half of the Danish Superliga campaign]</b> I’ve scored one goal in a cup match to get us through but something I want to improve is the goals in this second half of the season. So I’ve been working a lot in training on that but overall I’m pretty happy. I’ve played heaps of games and getting heaps of match minutes, so that’s exactly what I came here for, is to improve and to go back to Lazio next season with a lot more experience and hopefully push for a starting spot there.<br /><br />They’ve expressed positive feedback for the last six months and they’ve seen me grow a lot as a player.<br /><br />I think last year, making the cup final, it kind of made it all feel a bit real and made everyone feel like that they can win something important. The fans that came, it was really amazing for the club and I think it really left a mark on everyone that was there. So I think that’s another incentive to push for that final</p>
