I have three children, a happy life, so I can afford to take a decision to help me go further in that direction. In the coming years in the national team I want to give up the total sum I would be entitled to from the national team. I will donate it to charities that are special to me. This will motivate me even more and especially get me more fun moments with our fans and with this fantastic team. All that looking ahead to 2018, and why not further?</p>

His time in Manchester was brief but I got to witness first hand what makes for a true champion. I particularly remember setting up a few drills for myself. It was a dark, windy, rainy, Manchester day and everyone had ran in, as training was finished. I started off my session but here came grandpa, looking to join in. His ability as a player is beyond discussion but what left me inspired here was the relentlessness, commitment and desire to improve from a player who had done it all.

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany has targeted silverware in his first season with Anderlecht, but acknowledged he has ‘everything to prove’ as he embarks on his first coaching job]</b> The idea of ​​becoming a player-manager has grown gradually. The chance was too big for me not to go in and I think this was the right time to make this decision. Returning only as a player was not an option, but as a player-manager. I have everything to prove. As a manager, I have not yet proved anything, but I am confident that this story can and will succeed. I want to be a champion with Anderlecht. Let that be clear - I didn’t come here to be second. I can’t and won’t say that. I can start something incredible here. People who know me a little know well enough that I would not start something like this without a plan.<br /><br /><b>[Anderlecht finished sixth in the Belgian First Division last season]</b> There are huge talents around here and I am looking forward to working with them. There are more talents at Anderlecht today than when I started. Much more. We finished sixth last year, so we have to get better than five other teams in one season. But my opinion is that with a few changes we can get there. I’m convinced of that. <br /><br />If Anderlecht had become champions last year, or even second, then this story would not have happened. Or months of negotiation would have preceded. There is no better time to jump in than now. No one would have been open to a change in mentality. I understand that there is a lot of work, but I am really looking forward to starting. I have learned a lot in recent years and I now have the opportunity to make my mark here. I am proud that I have that opportunity<br /><br />I believe I told Guardiola the day before the FA Cup final that it would be my last game at City. I wanted to thank him for everything he taught me. The farewell was emotional. Working with Guardiola was as if I was suddenly in college. He explains everything in such a clear way and I learned a lot from him. I am not yet a Guardiola, let that be clear. But I think I am a good student. Let City be City under Pep, which is an awesome club. I think they will win the Champions League eventually, soon hopefully, and behind Pep there is Mikel Arteta who has a lot of knowledge, who is probably the right man to look at. I will just build my career and be as driven as Pep has been or the best managers have been that I know. Will I be as good? We’ll see</p>

Not only is Frank a great guy but someone who I learned so much from at a stage in my career. He was a bit older when he joined Manchester City and Frank was an incredible professional. What he brought at the time, he stepped the level up for everyone else so I know the impact of Frank Lampard on a team and I’m trying to have the same impact when it comes as an older player for Anderlecht. He’s up there with the most intelligent players so it’s a natural match with Chelsea, I completely support him.</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany admits that he could have left <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> much sooner]</b> I could have ended up at another club, and out of four league titles you could have maybe turned it into eight, depending on which club you go to, and how successful it is. It’s a competitive club, City. It’s not like you can sit down for a year and wait around for what happens. Every transfer window, every six months, you are competing with the rest of the world. Anyone better in the world, they have the responsibility to get to improve the team, and so nobody gives you the gift of staying at City for 11 years, you have to earn it for 11 years. Doing this, while being impeded by your body, my mother would have been proud of me<br /><br /><b>[He is rightly proud of all that he achieved, with the club left in a much better shape than when he arrived]</b> I know I played a role in shaping the culture of the club, and probably the future of the club, and that means a lot. There aren’t many clubs where you can do it like this. It was a special journey. The owners came in, and they were owners who give you time to build, the perfect type of owners for the club. So many come in and say they’re going to pile money in, be successful, but never achieve it. That ownership group came in and said they were going to build a plan and vision, and can anyone doubt they did that? Not everything was bad when I arrived, we had to change some of the players to become a winning team, but it was a great club with a fantastic history, and I think that’s the thing I tried to keep sharing<br /><br /><b>[Among the more memorable experiences that Kompany took in during his time with City are <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a>’s dramatic title winner in 2012 and his own stunning effort against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> which helped to seal another crown in 2019]</b> Typical City fashion would have been to lose the game <b>[against QPR]</b> and blow it. That’s what typical City meant in those days. Now typical City is defined by the <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Kun Aguero</a> moment, you don’t give up, you come back and win games. Was my goal against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> more important? His goal was more important! Mine, well, looked better, which I never thought I’d have on him! But his was crucial. He did do his best to wait until that time, because he had the worst 93 minutes of his career, and I would have had a word to say about this after the game if he didn’t score, but that’s the beauty of his job! One second can always turn it around</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany became the perfect captain to control an ego-crazy dressing room as it evolved from a top-four challenger into a title winner for the first time in 34 years]</b> I think I walked through the door being humble still. I was a leader from the first day but being a legend, you can’t predict those things. Now I am a much calmer leader. In my first year at City, if I saw something wrong then I had to act. I was pushing, pushing, pushing constantly, fronting people and if I needed conflict I would until we got it right. From the first day I have always put the team before my own good. There were many players who were bigger players than myself or were promised a better future or earning more money than I was. There was a core, including <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> and Nigel de Jong, in the early days we were really holding a lot together, making sure the club was bigger than any individual. That looks normal now, it wasn’t the case back then. I think as a group of players, we had a big impact in shaping the culture from the inside<br /><br /><b>[United stars like <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a>, <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> and <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> will soak up a night of pantomime boos to support Kompany and the event, which has already raised more than £300,000 for a Manchester homeless charity]</b> It is about celebrating the 11 years I have been able to build into this with some of the players. I have got <a href="craig-bellamy.html">Craig Bellamy</a>, he shaped my ideas about the club without a lot of people knowing it. I think Mario is coming, he should be but with Mario everything can go wrong. I remember looking up to so many players <b>[at other clubs]</b>. The first years at City we were getting consistently beaten. And then we turned the tables and we were going to Old Trafford <b>[and winning]</b><br /><br /><b>[A six-hour meeting with Anderlecht director of football Frank Arnesen - where he spelt out his philosophy - convinced the Belgian club to give him his first opportunity in management]</b> I am a City fan, I am not saying farewell. I am here as an ex-player, here as a fan and we are supporting a great cause. I spent 15 years with Anderlecht and 11 with City and I think it sums me up on who I want to be as a person. I put a lot of effort into helping this club be successful. There is the same idea behind me being at Anderlecht - consistency, loyalty, building a process and achieving.

He’s already achieved a lot, let’s not forget that. He’s not a young defender anymore that hasn’t got any experience. He’s a multiple Premier League-winning central defender that is growing and the one thing I wish for him is consistency - consistency of games and consistency of fitness - and then he will show the world how good he is.

In the past we had the luxury of four. I’ve not seen many teams have four top, top centre backs. It wasn’t normal. It only happened because of circumstance. ‘OK, Vinny could break down, so we’ll bring in another one’. You saw throughout the season that no matter which pairing played, it was always solid</p>

Each player knows what to do. I think these guys are there to stay and the other ones will have to improve fast or otherwise that gap will remain.

I said that on Super Sunday, you’re fighting 25 years of not winning at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and that’s difficult, it’s two games in one game - you’re playing a great team and you’re fighting history.

As soon as they start reconnecting with the best performances, I’m convinced that we can see a sustainable amount of wins<br /><br /><b>[Kompany admits he is still baffled as to why <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a>’s opening goal was not chalked off and a penalty awarded to the Blues after <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> handled inside his own box]</b> The incident happens and I’m confused. That’s the problem. I’m confused. I’m thinking ‘Okay, I’m not the expert in everything’. Then I look to my right at <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>, <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a> and Graham Souness. We’re all confused. Surely that says something about the process? The fact that this could still be for debate when there’s a VAR system that is meant to make football simpler and fairer. <b>[The]</b> goal happens 20 seconds later. My feeling remains that although <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were great, and both teams tried to play the way they are known to play, I felt this first decision was so important to get right</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany admits to having had second thoughts about walking away from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, with <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> and <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a> among those who tried to talk him into staying]</b> I’d already decided to move to Anderlecht - but it still flashed through my mind. One thing is for sure, winning is addictive<br /><br />The biggest compliment I’ve ever had was from David. He tried to convince me not to leave City. Sergio did the same. To have big players like that asking me to stay was absolutely the best thing<br /><br />The wheel of change is powerful, you can’t stop it. You might be able to slow it down a bit - but it took everything I had to keep it at bay. That’s why I decided when I did to get out from under that wheel. That’s how I thought about it. I had no idea if Pep felt the same, or if he’d have been happy for me to carry on playing beyond that season. It was this ongoing fight to prove myself as being worthy of a place in the City team that led me to my conclusion - ‘I’m going to have to leave’.</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany says <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a> is a <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> legend in the making]</b> I think everyone looks at Bernardo as a top player. He’s still so young, having only turned 24 during this amazing season. I believe he’s at the start of something very special for City. He’s been at the club for two seasons and everything he has done so far has been tremendous. He’s going to go from strength to strength. When you look at Bernardo, you can recognise all the signs of a future City legend, depending on whether he decides to stay for that long or not. It’s all in his hands.<br /><br />What makes him a special player, and not just a gifted player, is he’s such a positive guy. It’s very natural to him. I also call him a leader. I’ve told him that and he laughs at me when I say it. There are so many different types of leadership. His natural ability to be positive all the time, and to influence the group by being like that, makes such a difference.<br /><br />He’ll come to training, or the dressing room, always ready for action. He trains at 100 per cent and he does it with a smile. It’s infectious. That’s a very important quality to have as a leader. When he’s on the pitch, he’s one of the most talented players and yet he always works as hard, if not harder, than anyone else. That’s another side of leadership. He might laugh at me but maybe that’s the next step for him to realise what he needs to do to be in the highest category of leader one day.<br /><br /><b>[Kompany claims Silva could one day be considered one of the finest talents in world football]</b> Bernardo is an artist as well. his positive energy and personality turns into creativity when he is on the pitch. He’s like a kid. He plays more football than anyone I know. He plays football in the dressing room. I’m not saying that senior pros lose that but sometimes you start to look after your own body in different ways which can mean you don’t always get as much joy out of the extra football you play. All the extra bits ‘mess with your programme’ but he doesn’t care. His ability and creativity make him do stuff that not many people can do, if I’m being honest.<br /><br />He’s walking in the footsteps of some unbelievable players at the club such as <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>, <a href="samir-nasri.html">Samir Nasri</a> in terms of the sort of player he is. If he can carry on like he was when I was playing alongside him at City, there’s a chance for him to be on a par with the greats of this club. Could he one day win the Ballon d’Or? Of course. He could achieve anything but the problem for Bernardo is that he’s so humble. He’ll always drop a couple of places in the contenders’ list just because of that. There will always be guys that are better at self-promotion and have better PR machines around them</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany says he has learned more from moments of adversity than at any other time in his life]</b> Every chapter in my life has started with a setback and a struggle. But there has been success or glory at the end. That doesn’t come by doubting yourself. It doesn’t come by giving up in difficult circumstances. Quite the opposite. It’s learning and staying calm in adversity. There is such a beautiful side to adversity.<br /><br />I don’t struggle with enduring adversity. I embrace it. The beautiful side to adversity is you will never learn as much as when you get your arse kicked. It’s the best moment to learn. If you’re able to stare it in the face - rather than shedding tears or closing your eyes - you can try and solve the problems. And if you have a problem-solving mind, what can stop you?<br /><br />My mum and dad instilled this in me. My mum was a <b>[white Belgian]</b> union leader fighting for the rights of the deprived. Justice was crucial to her. And when we talk about justice, we need to remember my dad fought the regime of Mobutu <b>[Sese Seko - former president of Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo]</b>. My dad protested in the streets of Kinshasa which saw him lose lots of his fellow students. He had to go to a labour camp for fighting for what he believed in<br /><br />So what right do I have to sit quiet? My world is easy in comparison. I just try to do the right thing. If you draw the comparison with the project at Anderlecht, I feel it’s the right path to follow. I’ve analysed and cross-checked and made sure the plan is entirely achievable. So, from that moment, nothing will change my mind. I won’t compromise</p>

Then I come back and I feel I am ready, despite not being ready. That is the belief that has got me through so many comebacks. I shouldn’t have been able to really, with all the setbacks, have the career I have had. Especially in this competitive <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> squad.
