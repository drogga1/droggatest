It has worked out well here in Belgium and we are ready for what is to come.<br /><br /><b>[The 29-year-old was impressed by Belgium’s performance against Israel]</b> It was the best first half of our campaign, we just did not score. In the second half we just had a dip, but we still scored suddenly three times. This team has always shown that we can get difficult beyond difficult moments. That has been the story of the last four years and we should be proud</p>

There are no small games and I have given everything I have for City, I will always do this, but I do the same for my country.<br /><br /><b>[On Kevin De Bruyne]</b> I’ve known him for a long time now, but just it’s a natural development.

Innocent people paying the price again. My thoughts are with the families of the victims. I wish for Brussels to act with dignity. We are all hurting, yet we must reject hate and its preachers. As hard as it may be.<br /><br />There’s a sense of me that really believes that it was predictable, really predictable. I think it was inevitable, because I only used to see politicians in our neighbourhoods once every six years when they needed to come for votes. Now and then something would pop up out of the ground and somebody would cut a red ribbon to say that we’ve done this for the community. But I have really struggled to see a real concern, a genuine desire to be a part of making those neighbourhoods. The reason why <b>[the Paris attacks]</b> hurt me so much is because they’re not people of a religious faction, they’re people that have been able to fall off the grid and people have been able to indoctrinate them</p>

When I started, I was 17 years old and wanted to achieve a lot, obviously on the field, but also beyond. I have three children, a happy life, so I can afford to take a decision to help me go further in that direction. In the coming years in the national team I want to give up the total sum I would be entitled to from the national team. I will donate it to charities that are special to me. This will motivate me even more and especially get me more fun moments with our fans and with this fantastic team. All that looking ahead to 2018, and why not further?</p>

His time in Manchester was brief but I got to witness first hand what makes for a true champion. I particularly remember setting up a few drills for myself. It was a dark, windy, rainy, Manchester day and everyone had ran in, as training was finished. I started off my session but here came grandpa, looking to join in. His ability as a player is beyond discussion but what left me inspired here was the relentlessness, commitment and desire to improve from a player who had done it all. Simple things that separate the greats from the masses</p>

I have been lucky I can make use of a tremendous amount of experience. Where I am at physically does not matter. I know what I have to do and as long as I can organise the people around me, I can always get a performance. The main thing is self-belief and experience. I cannot say how valuable it is because if I was 20 years old I would not have done it that way but I am lucky to have good players surrounding me. I follow a lot of what is happening and in training so I understand what needs to be done. I can kind of help to implement it but other than that, I stay really calm because it is always about the next game.</p>

If you’re not fit, you don’t have many opportunities and not many clubs. If I stay fit, I’ll want to play football at City. And if I’m not fit, I won’t have other options. I don’t know if I could muster the same motivation elsewhere. It may seem that I’m high maintenance, but I’m a good professional and I work so hard on my return. The longer I’m available, the more chance I’ll get to play more matches.<br /><br /><b>[On Belgium]</b> The opportunity for us is great - but we still have work to do. In 2014 and 2016, we had a right to failure, because we had a young team. But over the next few years we can’t use that excuse. We need to be tactically stronger, which will help us physically and technically</p>

I still have a contract for 18 months and I feel that I can contribute something to the team.<br /><br />On the other hand, I also have to be honest with myself. If I cannot cope with the level anymore, I will say: ‘Boys, it’s been enough, I’ll retire’. I don’t want to push myself into the role of a victim. There are more important things than Vincent Kompany’s injuries. The man in the street realises that too. I love football. My passion for the sport knows no limits. I have sacrificed a lot to get to this level. If I have to go through all these injuries again to lift a few more trophies, so be it<br /><br />When you’re playing football at the top levels, even managing your personal finances starts to become like running a business.

What he gives us is that incredible amount of knowledge he shares, and he is really good at delivering his message as well.

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany appears to be planning for the future at Manchester City]</b> I don’t have any sort of doubt in my mind, I know how I’m going to come back. The great thing for me, I know that if I don’t play for three months or four months I can within a week and do well. I have that belief in myself. I’m not worried about getting extra game time, extra minutes, and all this kind of stuff that so many other players will worry about.<br /><br />Last season we developed a similar game, we played really well. But in key moments we just weren’t as effective as we were this year. And, on top of that, I think youth. We have a young team, lots of legs, lots of positive desire to do well. And all these guys needed to achieve something and they’ve done it now. And now it’s Mr Grumpy’s role to tell them they’ve done nothing yet! Let’s do more<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on whether De Bruyne should have got the nod in the 2018 PFA Player of the Year vote]</b> I’m going to be biased. I’m going to say yes, of course. But how can you take away from Salah what he’s achieved? He’s an African player, which I’m happy about as well. It’s important for a lot of <b>[reasons]</b>. It’s going to have a big impact in his country and for the continent as well. But Kevin is a master brain of football. The way he sees and understands the game is beyond what you can see in terms of ability from any player and that’s why it’s difficult to categorise Kevin’s performance. If you take the full package, the passes, the amount of actions he’s made that were so clever and different from what anyone else would’ve done you would put him on another level</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany has warned Manchester City’s Premier League rivals that the club can take things a step further]</b> He’s quite intense. He’s extremely good at communicating what he wants from his players. And you know, some of the things he says are quite complex, but he makes it simple for everyone to understand. And with intensity like I said, every single day, whether it’s training or a game, it’s about winning and about getting better. He has the right group of players together to take it a step further than he even wants next season.<br /><br />We have a lot of young guys who are hungry in the team. Many of them just won their first trophy. But at the same time, it’s only their first. With the ability and the talent, we can win a lot more - and that gives me much confidence they’ll be able to pick it up again next season<br /><br />It goes back to the same thing: hard work. We’ve put in so much effort on the pitch and off. We were committed and had a clear vision of what we wanted to accomplish and where we wanted to go. And then sometimes things come together like they did this season. It’s a record-breaking season, so it’s history for us as well</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany is not thinking of leaving the Premier League champions]</b> I think what people have never really understood with me is that aside from having had some injuries I’m actually really lucky to be a really good athlete naturally so I still feel mobile, I still feel strong, that I’m improving and I’m learning so much more about the game. I’m enjoying the game more than I’ve probably ever enjoyed the game. Probably my first year at City and this last year now have been the best in my career so you want to make it last as long as you can, for sure<br /><br />Every club you sign for they give you the same pitch: ‘We’ve got a big project, big ambitions, we want to achieve this and that, we want to kick on,’ and I just happen to be lucky that City was the one club that didn’t lie about it. When City came calling I researched the club, but when I first came through the door it was weird, it was a big club but at the same time a small club. A big club because of the history, the fanbase, the stadium, and small because of the state of the facilities where we were training, the culture a little bit towards winning, and the lack of pressure there was</p>

  <p><b>[The making of the modern Man City]</b> We had a lot of staff members from Thailand, they were the ones who welcomed me when I signed for the club. From one day to the other, they were all gone and Robinho was in the dressing room. That’s when you realised things were changing. We went away for international games around that time and they changed everything. It was like those shows where they’re building stuff and next thing there’s a reveal. I can’t even describe it. Probably like a before and after picture. Everything changed within two weeks. We came back and the standard was set.<br /><br />What is fair? The status quo? Should City be in the third division and say we’ve got awesome fans with 30,000 in the stadium but we’re never really allowed to have success? What is fair then? That’s always been my question. Any kind of investment that’s been made by City over the years is to overtake 20 years of an advantage by any other club. Of course if you take a lens at it and you say, ‘Well City have invested in the last five or 10 years,’ of course, because you’re trying to avoid 20 or 30 years of dominance from another club. The last thing I’m going to say is that nobody can convince me that Manchester City has not had a tremendous benefit to Manchester as a city, the north west as a region and the Premier League as a league</p>

We have to deal with the fact we lost against Lyon, never mind winning the Champions League. If we get momentum then anything is possible. All I know is that it’s the last step that we haven’t achieved yet. The club is always aiming to progress. There is nothing left to achieve, but it takes time. I don’t want to put pressure on the manager here, for the next few years, but we will see and do our best.<br /><br />Every single year that you lose you just have to start again, but we don’t want to think about the past - we just have to play at our level. You can’t ask for much more than that. I’d love to win a European trophy with City, but I’m being realistic, it’s such a tough competition to win. It’s okay to say we want to win it but there are seven or eight other teams thinking the same. They have just as big claim - if not a bigger claim - than us</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany is still hoping to extend his stay at Manchester City]</b> First of all, the situation with City is very simple. I am in a club where I feel so comfortable. I have an extremely good relationship with every single member of the club so there is absolutely no need for me to constantly go on about a contract situation. I am in a comfortable situation with good people and we will make the decision when it needs to happen. The good thing is I feel comfortable on the pitch too. It’s a trade-off as I get older. On the one hand, everything becomes easier because of experience. My mind thinks faster and my age and experience means I can anticipate so many things before they are happening. But also, with age, I have come to learn that I do not want or need to chase every single ball down like I might have done five or six years ago. It is a trade-off but it allows me to be a centre-back in a great team.</p>

  <p><b>[Man City don’t need to retain title to be remembered as Premier League greats]</b> No, I think it’s just two different things. It depends who you listen to. Reaching 100 points - good luck to anyone who wants to do it over again. That stands in isolation as an incredible achievement. You can’t know until we’ve passed the time and we’ve played. We’re playing as well as we can, nothing is going to take away from that. If Liverpool ends up being even better than us then that’s credit to Liverpool. It can’t be something that we’ve done wrong in this case, not with the amount of points we’ve got at this point and the way we’ve played so far and with the way we’ve approached every game. I think we’re doing as good as a team can do but sometimes, if you want to talk about having back-to-back seasons, I’m sure that not a lot of teams had to face the sort of opposition we have now with Liverpool. Liverpool are having the best season I’ve ever known them to have since I’ve been following the Premier League so it’s a strong team and we just need to raise our level every time.<br /><br />I think we compete with ourselves to reach a standard and to even make the pitch sometimes because its such a big squad. It’s difficult because there’s still so much to play for this season. It’s really difficult to say, ‘Okay let’s just focus on the league or just the Champions League or the FA Cup - everything kind of blends into one big competition. But ticking those games off time after time that’s really the mindset<br /><br />There’s four competitions and I couldn’t care less about anything other than winning games at the moment. It has to be about that. When you’ve been 11 years at the club, you’re pretty relaxed about the situation</p>

  <p><b>[Kompany warns Man City not to ‘overthink’ Palace trip]</b> I don’t expect that we will ever see a non-familiar City again before the end of the season. That’s it now, the one game that we could have afforded to lose is done. Now it’s all about every single time preparing well, relaxing and going into the game and doing what you know to do best. It’s cliched to say but every game is going to be a final, but it doesn’t mean that because it’s a final that you have to overthink it too much. We’re going to look at the strengths and weaknesses of the opponent, probably base a plan on those factors and then make sure on the day as a team, not just as individuals, that we turn up and play well, and that’s the key to getting these wins and trophies over the line, if we can. I just feel that this game … the big mistake would be to overthink it. We are a good team, preparing well, if we do that we will create chances and the only thing that stands in the way of you winning a game when you’re creating chances is the form of the day or bad luck, but that should still be the key to us approaching that game<br /><br />Ultimately you’re playing against a good team that you’re going to face three times. I do think there’s a different depth to that fixture than maybe the other ones, because you face a team three times, is it realistic to think that approaching the game the same way three times is going to give you victory? I don’t know, but I can see why it’s a more difficult game to manage. But this one is now, Selhurst Park, it’s a one-off against a good team, we have everything to play for and that makes me more confident in the team. I like this situation, I like it when our backs are against the wall and have to perform, I feel a certain level of calmness in that</p>

If you look back 18 months ago when we did some of the performances that have ever been done in the Premier League, and if you can name me one player who stood out the whole year, it’s impossible. We stood out for a couple of weeks, months, whatever, but ultimately it’s a machine, and it’s the machine that’s brought us so far. He knows that whenever he needs anyone in the team he can just rotate the positions and based on form or whatever he usually doesn’t see a drop. That’s the strength of this team.<br /><br />You need to embrace it, that’s the only way I can look at this run of fixtures and make any sense out of it. You need to embrace it. You look at the run of games and think ‘difficult’ but if you look at every single game and break it down individually, I see opportunities. I’m sure it’ll transpire to the team and I’m sure that’s how we will approach these games<br /><br />We have 90 minutes still to just prove everything we are, who we are and how we want to be remembered. After the game it’s difficult sometimes to have the exact perspective when you’ve just finished the game and you feel as if the result and everything that happened within the game is the be-all-and-end-all, but now looking at it … God it’s a night of opportunities on Wednesday, I only see opportunities.

Quite unexpectedly, they offered me the position of Player-Manager. Michael and Frank explained to me in detail how they saw it working in practice. They had thought it through.

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany became the perfect captain to control an ego-crazy dressing room as it evolved from a top-four challenger into a title winner for the first time in 34 years]</b> I think I walked through the door being humble still. I was a leader from the first day but being a legend, you can’t predict those things. Now I am a much calmer leader. In my first year at City, if I saw something wrong then I had to act. I was pushing, pushing, pushing constantly, fronting people and if I needed conflict I would until we got it right. From the first day I have always put the team before my own good. There were many players who were bigger players than myself or were promised a better future or earning more money than I was. There was a core, including <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a> and Nigel de Jong, in the early days we were really holding a lot together, making sure the club was bigger than any individual. That looks normal now, it wasn’t the case back then. I think as a group of players, we had a big impact in shaping the culture from the inside<br /><br /><b>[United stars like <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a>, <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a> and <a href="paul-scholes.html">Paul Scholes</a> will soak up a night of pantomime boos to support Kompany and the event, which has already raised more than £300,000 for a Manchester homeless charity]</b> It is about celebrating the 11 years I have been able to build into this with some of the players. I have got <a href="craig-bellamy.html">Craig Bellamy</a>, he shaped my ideas about the club without a lot of people knowing it. I think Mario is coming, he should be but with Mario everything can go wrong. I remember looking up to so many players <b>[at other clubs]</b>. The first years at City we were getting consistently beaten. And then we turned the tables and we were going to <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> <b>[and winning]</b><br /><br /><b>[A six-hour meeting with Anderlecht director of football Frank Arnesen - where he spelt out his philosophy - convinced the Belgian club to give him his first opportunity in management]</b> I am a City fan, I am not saying farewell. I am here as an ex-player, here as a fan and we are supporting a great cause. I spent 15 years with Anderlecht and 11 with City and I think it sums me up on who I want to be as a person. I put a lot of effort into helping this club be successful. There is the same idea behind me being at Anderlecht - consistency, loyalty, building a process and achieving. It has been the story of my life</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany has no doubts about the quality of former <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> team-mate <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> and says the defender just needs to add consistency to his game]</b> I’ve always said John is one of the most talented defenders, he’s got such a bright future. He’s already achieved a lot, let’s not forget that. He’s not a young defender anymore that hasn’t got any experience. He’s a multiple Premier League-winning central defender that is growing and the one thing I wish for him is consistency - consistency of games and consistency of fitness - and then he will show the world how good he is. By the end of it, if City can win a Champions League or something, all of a sudden he’ll mentioned in a completely different category<br /><br /><b>[And with <a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a> set for such a long spell on the sidelines, it presents an opportunity for Stones to cement his place in the side, but Kompany insists he does not have anything to worry about]</b> Honestly I don’t think we should look at it in that way. He just has to get himself on the pitch, be himself and he’ll be fine. I’ve not seen signs of weakness I need to be worried about. He’s just a top class defender. If now he gets to play games, things will sort themselves out, no doubt<br /><br /><b>[<a href="aymeric-laporte.html">Laporte</a>’s injury at the back leaves City short of options, but Kompany said they only had four top centre-backs because of his persistent injury problems]</b> Three world-class centre backs is awesome by any standard. In the past we had the luxury of four. I’ve not seen many teams have four top, top centre backs. It wasn’t normal. It only happened because of circumstance. ‘OK, Vinny could break down, so we’ll bring in another one’. You saw throughout the season that no matter which pairing played, it was always solid</p>

Each player knows what to do. I think these guys are there to stay and the other ones will have to improve fast or otherwise that gap will remain. It seems that even if they don’t have a great day, it’s still a comfortable game and there aren’t many teams in recent history who’ve been able to have comfortable games in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> don’t need to sign another defender]</b> I don’t think they need to sign another defender. We always struggle at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>. I said that on Super Sunday, you’re fighting 25 years of not winning at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and that’s difficult, it’s two games in one game - you’re playing a great team and you’re fighting history. Flip it around and the same will happen for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> - they will fight the history of not winning the league for 30 years. That should be to City’s advantage I still think. As to the defence, the best way for City to defend in the past has been to attack. They have no reason to change that. As soon as they start reconnecting with the best performances, I’m convinced that we can see a sustainable amount of wins<br /><br /><b>[Kompany admits he is still baffled as to why <a href="fabinho.html">Fabinho</a>’s opening goal was not chalked off and a penalty awarded to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">the Blues</a> after <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> handled inside his own box]</b> The incident happens and I’m confused.

I had no idea if Pep felt the same, or if he’d have been happy for me to carry on playing beyond that season. It was this ongoing fight to prove myself as being worthy of a place in the City team that led me to my conclusion - ‘I’m going to have to leave’.</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany says <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a> is a <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> legend in the making]</b> I think everyone looks at Bernardo as a top player. He’s still so young, having only turned 24 during this amazing season. I believe he’s at the start of something very special for City. He’s been at the club for two seasons and everything he has done so far has been tremendous. He’s going to go from strength to strength. When you look at Bernardo, you can recognise all the signs of a future City legend, depending on whether he decides to stay for that long or not. It’s all in his hands.<br /><br />What makes him a special player, and not just a gifted player, is he’s such a positive guy. It’s very natural to him. I also call him a leader. I’ve told him that and he laughs at me when I say it. There are so many different types of leadership. His natural ability to be positive all the time, and to influence the group by being like that, makes such a difference.<br /><br />He’ll come to training, or the dressing room, always ready for action. He trains at 100 per cent and he does it with a smile. It’s infectious. That’s a very important quality to have as a leader. When he’s on the pitch, he’s one of the most talented players and yet he always works as hard, if not harder, than anyone else. That’s another side of leadership. He might laugh at me but maybe that’s the next step for him to realise what he needs to do to be in the highest category of leader one day.<br /><br /><b>[Kompany claims Silva could one day be considered one of the finest talents in world football]</b> Bernardo is an artist as well. his positive energy and personality turns into creativity when he is on the pitch. He’s like a kid. He plays more football than anyone I know. He plays football in the dressing room. I’m not saying that senior pros lose that but sometimes you start to look after your own body in different ways which can mean you don’t always get as much joy out of the extra football you play. All the extra bits ‘mess with your programme’ but he doesn’t care. His ability and creativity make him do stuff that not many people can do, if I’m being honest.<br /><br />He’s walking in the footsteps of some unbelievable players at the club such as <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>, <a href="samir-nasri.html">Samir Nasri</a> in terms of the sort of player he is. If he can carry on like he was when I was playing alongside him at City, there’s a chance for him to be on a par with the greats of this club. Could he one day win the Ballon d’Or? Of course. He could achieve anything but the problem for Bernardo is that he’s so humble. He’ll always drop a couple of places in the contenders’ list just because of that. There will always be guys that are better at self-promotion and have better PR machines around them</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Kompany says he has learned more from moments of adversity than at any other time in his life]</b> Every chapter in my life has started with a setback and a struggle. But there has been success or glory at the end. That doesn’t come by doubting yourself. It doesn’t come by giving up in difficult circumstances. Quite the opposite. It’s learning and staying calm in adversity. There is such a beautiful side to adversity.<br /><br />I don’t struggle with enduring adversity. I embrace it. The beautiful side to adversity is you will never learn as much as when you get your arse kicked. It’s the best moment to learn. If you’re able to stare it in the face - rather than shedding tears or closing your eyes - you can try and solve the problems. And if you have a problem-solving mind, what can stop you?<br /><br />My mum and dad instilled this in me. My mum was a <b>[white Belgian]</b> union leader fighting for the rights of the deprived. Justice was crucial to her. And when we talk about justice, we need to remember my dad fought the regime of Mobutu <b>[Sese Seko - former president of Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo]</b>. My dad protested in the streets of Kinshasa which saw him lose lots of his fellow students. He had to go to a labour camp for fighting for what he believed in<br /><br />So what right do I have to sit quiet? My world is easy in comparison. I just try to do the right thing. If you draw the comparison with the project at Anderlecht, I feel it’s the right path to follow. I’ve analysed and cross-checked and made sure the plan is entirely achievable. So, from that moment, nothing will change my mind. I won’t compromise</p>
