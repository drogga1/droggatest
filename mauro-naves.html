  <p><b>[The World Cup starts now - Neymar and Brazil arrive at training camp]</b> Tite’s big challenge is to make the team play how they did in qualifying. He has 20-odd days to do that. His preparations must go well to ensure Brazil arrive at the World Cup in form.</p>

  <p><b>[Remembering Neymar’s Brazil debut]</b> It was only the beginning of what we already knew he would achieve even since he first appeared at Santos. I was covering football in Sao Paulo and I had several opportunities to see him before he arrived in the Selecao and there was no way it was going to go wrong. It was a promising debut and we were filled with expectation, confident that he would have four years to mature before arriving at World Cup 2014 firing on all cylinders. It was a long-awaited moment, we thought that Dunga could have taken him to South Africa Cup, both Neymar and midfielder Ganso, but Dunga felt they were too young. Mano Menezes brought them both in at the first opportunity following the World Cup and Neymar instantly looked at ease, as if he had playing for Brazil for some time already.<br /><br />I do not know if Neymar sees this a new start, but we see that this is a new cycle for the group and that many are also getting their first opportunities. For those who were at the last World Cup, they have another chance. I see Neymar looking relaxed and it will be interesting to see if he can play well, quite the circus a little, but he looks calm. He usually plays well for the national team and has the numbers to back it up - he has the chance to take over the others in list of top scorers<br /><br />We are really looking forward to seeing the midfield. It’s a good thing that Everton is doing well Gremio, and there’s Richarlison, but I’m curious to see Andreas Pereira, Arthur and Lucas Paqueta, though I don’t know if you can play all three at once. I think that Tite will look at one or two, maybe they will see more minutes against El Salvador. I think Arthur will soon arrive for Brazil and stay with them for a very long time. Andreas is a player we don’t see that much and Lucas Paqueta is very versatile. They are three newcomers I want to see</p>
