  <p><b>[Winning by an incredible 13-0 scoreline]</b> It is a tournament and goal difference matters so at the end of the day, you can’t feel bad for scoring as many goals as possible in whatever game you’re playing. If you’re just knocking it around the back and playing keep-away that’s not the best form, especially in a tournament.</p>

  <p><b>[Asked about the news regarding their lawsuit on Saturday, Kelley O’Hara looked to deflect any attention from the courtroom away from matters on the pitch]</b> We’re here to win a World Cup and the lawyers are at home to do their thing, so we both have our jobs. This team has always been good at compartmentalizing. We focus on the task at hand and I haven’t paid any mind to anything that’s been going on, and that’s something that we’ll pick back up when we get home.</p>
