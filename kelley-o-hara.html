  <p><b>[Kelley O’Hara will be sidelined 8-12 weeks after undergoing ankle surgery]</b> It’s all good. These kinds of things come with the territory. This is just the best time to get the procedure done so I’m 100 per cent heading into 2019 and physically ready to perform at the level I want to and need to. It’s a bummer that I won’t get to Europe, but the most important thing is to be healthy for next year.</p>

  <p><b>[USWNT gets cushy World Cup draw]</b> I’m excited to play Sweden. They obviously knocked us out of the 2016 Olympics, so there’s going to need to be a little bit of redemption there and I think that’s going to be a very good game to evaluate us for the rest of the tournament.<br /><br /><b>[O’Hara is looking forward to matching up against different styles of play]</b> They are actually a very diverse group, I’d say. Sweden is very different from Chile who is very different from Thailand. Chile is very technical, a smaller team. Sweden has some taller ladies on their team. I would say that the styles vary drastically. That’s kind of exciting<br /><br />The way I approach tournaments is one game at a time, and I think that’s how our team has always been and I think that’s a very important strategy. There’s no sense in looking towards the final or even worrying about, ‘If we go here or this team wins this or they lose, we’ll play this’. It’s just not worth stressing over. Like I said before, we concentrate on ourselves, focus on what we need to do and I think that’s the best approach to it</p>

  <p><b>[USWNT aiming for back-to-back World Cups]</b> I would never place us as ‘favorites’, or put it on us. But we do hold ourselves to a very high standard and, yeah, we want to win. Who doesn’t want to win the World Cup? Being the defending champions, I absolutely want to go back to back<br /><br />The gap between the top-ranked team and the lowest in this World Cup is much closer than it ever has been, in terms of just level of play. That is attributed to federations investing more time and money into their female program which, I think, needs to continue. It’s just starting and it’s only going to get better, but it does need that investment from the federations. I think they’ll be pleasantly surprised to see that the competition is going to be stiff and exciting<br /><br />Obviously we went through a pretty big transition period after the Olympics and <b>[head coach Jill Ellis]</b> was very transparent about that to the media and to us. Since then, it was growing pains growing through that. It’s been a consistent group now and that’s important for us to grow in terms of chemistry. These next six months leading into the first game, starting in January, this will be the time we come together as a team and focus on ourselves, on the style of play and honing the tools we already have<br /><br />I’m pumped. So excited. It’s nice to finally know who our competition is going to be in those first three games. We can start to prepare and envision who is going to be on the other side of the field. It’s just nice to know. It feels real today. I have a headache after watching that. I think that my stress levels went up a bit just because of the excitement, knowing what it is. Now that the draw has happened, the brackets are filled, the groups are filled, it’s real. It’s happening. It’s going to be here before we know it</p>

  <p><b>[U.S. women’s national team defender Kelley O’Hara admitted she is not yet at 100 percent in her ongoing recovery]</b> Ever since I had the little hiccup with my ankle earlier this year it’s been about being ready for June 11 and that I can go starting then through the World Cup and be 100 percent. It’ll be working back in and I’m still working up to 90 minutes. But it was good to get some minutes with Utah, get that under my belt.<br /><br />I’m excited for Sunday and the last two send-off games in the U.S. and then it’ll be full-go when we’re in France</p>

  <p><b>[USWNT enters new phase with World Cup squad now all together]</b> When it comes to this team it’s about playing your role in whatever you’re asked to do. Whether you’re a starter, whether you’re coming off the bench, whether you’re getting into training and being that opposition that we’re trying to prepare for, so everyone plays a role. At the end of the day, 23 players win a World Cup so that’s really all that matters<br /><br />It is definitely a bit different feeling because this is our group. This is our squad and these are the people that we’re going to win a World Cup with</p>

  <p><b>[Winning by an incredible 13-0 scoreline]</b> It is a tournament and goal difference matters so at the end of the day, you can’t feel bad for scoring as many goals as possible in whatever game you’re playing. If you’re just knocking it around the back and playing keep-away that’s not the best form, especially in a tournament.</p>

This team has always been good at compartmentalizing. We focus on the task at hand and I haven’t paid any mind to anything that’s been going on, and that’s something that we’ll pick back up when we get home.</p>
