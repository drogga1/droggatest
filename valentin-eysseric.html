  <p><b>[Nice’s Valentin Eysseric has said that team-mate Mario Balotelli’s attitude is the only thing preventing him from becoming indispensable to his side]</b> When I see him miss a shot or not scoring, he lowers his head, grumbles and doesn’t want to talk. e goes into his corner and it’s a shame because he’s stronger than everyone, runs faster, is stronger, shoots harder. It’s a shame he’s like that and he lets his head drop. We know he’s had a good career and we hear a lot about him, but I don’t think he’s got a bad frame of mind. It’s true that when he misses things he shuts up too much and it becomes difficult to talk to and advise him. That’s not my role. He wants everything to be perfect and that’s not possible. It is up to him to think more collectively and work more from us. It will open up more situations and chances to score goals.<br /><br /><b>[On Lucien Favre]</b> With this coach, we know we’ve no right to let our standards slip in terms of collective effort. The proof is that I’ve only scored one goal but Mario has quite a lot. But today maybe the coach thinks I’m doing more than him. It’s surprising to see him on the bench. But that doesn’t mean Mario is not important - he’s won us many games. He was very disappointed after the defeat in Monaco. He was annoyed not to have scored, I think</p>

  <p><b>[Valentin Eysseric suggested that Balotelli is not the ultimate team player]</b> We see him every day in training - we know he’s a great player. He’s really at a level above us. He knows how to be decisive.</p>

  <p><b>[Is Balotelli playing as badly at Nice as he was at Liverpool?]</b> I am sorry but I was honest. It is a shame he lets his head drop, you see him in training every day. He is such a great player. I think he looks like he wants nothing to do with us. It is really disappointing. We could have really used his help in a game like this. We know the coach demands enormous effort from his squad. He will not accept anyone taking their foot off the gas and you saw that with Mario.</p>
