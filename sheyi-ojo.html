Glasglow Rangers are set to complete the signing of Sheyi Ojo on a season-long loan deal from Liverpool.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Glasglow Rangers winger Sheyi Ojo has laid down a marker in the battle for the Scottish Premiership title this season, claiming Steven Gerrard’s side are the best team in the country despite Celtic’s recent dominance. Asked if any of the other clubs in the division had impressed him in pre-season thus far] Not really, to be honest. I think Rangers are the best team in the league. It is just about us proving we are the best team and doing really well this season. I think the most important thing, and the gaffer has told us this, is just to focus on ourselves. The difference last season was nine points. It proved we’re pretty close to Celtic. It’s just about concentrating on ourselves and then we’ll be able to make up those fine margins. The season hasn’t started yet. We haven’t played Celtic yet. For me, coming here I feel like Rangers is the best team in the league. It’s one of the reasons why I came here. I want to be part of a winning team and I think Rangers can do that this season. It’s just about us focusing on every game and in training. All the new players are focused on the new system the gaffer wants us to play and taking it game by game. So far it’s going really well. I think we’ve only conceded one goal in pre-season, so we look forward to the upcoming games<br /><br />[The 22-year-old, who has previously enjoyed loan spells at Fulham and Wolves, is keen to improve on his goal to game ratio under the tutelage of Gerrard] The gaffer has told me to focus on numbers. I like to get the ball to feet a lot. He has told me to focus more on getting in the frame of the goal. I feel if I keep on doing that throughout the course of the season then more goals will come. I spoke to Liverpool before I came and they have high expectations of me. It’s about me staying fit. In the last couple of seasons I haven’t been able to do that. I want to stay fit and healthy to express myself. That’s the most important thing. If I can do that then I think everyone will see how good I can be</p>

  <p>[Progres Niederkorn vs Glasglow Rangers. Buoyed by wins over the likes of Marseille and Derby, confidence in the Ibrox club’s camp is at a high, as on-loan Liverpool attacker Sheyi Ojo epitomises] I think Glasglow Rangers are the best team in the league. It is just about us proving we are the best team and doing really well this season. We haven’t played Celtic yet and the season hasn’t started, but I feel like Rangers are the best team</p>
