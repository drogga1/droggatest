      <td>Ognen Zaric worked with Karim Adeyemi in Unterhaching’s Under-17s side and has never been in any doubt that the striker is destined to achieve great things. Zaric’s faith in Adeyemi is understandable, given the 18-year-old Munich native spent the first half of this season scoring freely during a loan spell at FC Liefering before being recalled by parent club Red Bull Salzburg, who beat <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to his signature in 2018.</td>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Karim Adeyemi remains one of the hottest teenagers in world football]</b> That’s right. Many successful footballers who play in the national team today have also received this award. One day I want to play for the national team. I want to achieve what these players have already achieved. That is why this award makes me very proud and is also a great motivation to continue on my path. Playing for the national team is always a great honour. It is always special for my family to see me play in the national team jersey. It motivates me enormously when I am invited to the national team and can play for Germany</p>
