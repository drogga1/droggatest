  <p><b>[Chivas-Monterrey pits two Argentine managers who have taken to Mexico]</b> There’s a generation of interesting guys, but there’s also a generation of new managers who copy others who have a lot bigger names. They even copy the way they walk. I don’t think that’s a good thing. They should have their own personality.<br /><br />Yes, take the best of everyone because the new generations are nourished by the previous ones. You learn from the models you choose but walking with your hands behind your back, sitting on an ice chest or using the same words as other people to me is copy and paste. You have to copy and learn. I’m dying to one day go manage and face the new generation of Argentine managers. I’d love it, but I also feel really good where I’m at. We’ll see if our paths cross, if not maybe they’ll come here like Chacho <b>[Coudet, who managed at Tijuana]</b> and Almeyda. I’ll catch them at home.<br /><br />I don’t want to come in like a parachuter, I don’t see myself doing that. To come in Week 14, stand in front of the squad and tell them, ‘Today we’re playing against La Coruna,’ and not having any idea who plays for La Coruna. What am I going to tell them? I’m not going to feel comfortable. I’d been champion in Mexico, gotten to the semifinals of the Copa Libertadores with Tijuana. I got to Huracan and I thought just by being there I was going to reach the goal. Soccer gave me a terrible punch. It was painful, but at the same time a huge lesson. I never played in Europe. I don’t know how they do things. I’d like to go but I don’t want to go, bounce out and come right back. I’d like to go prepared, well-equipped</p>

  <p><b>[Can a hot start erase Liga MX final loss memory for Monterrey?]</b> To me it didn’t make up for anything. We wanted to win both titles. We lost in the final, the Clasico against Tigres and the only revenge is to meet them again. We’ve got a thorn in our side about it. At the same time, we really enjoyed the campaign. We were the leaders of the tournament for a long time, the team with the most goals and the fewest allowed. Even so, it hurt a ton, a ton. For me, the most important thing is what’s coming. I always tell the players, if you lose a ball, the most important is the one to come because if you stay there feeling sorry about it the train passes you. Life passes you.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a> manager Antonio Mohamed knows there’s no excuse for his club to miss the playoffs, especially with momentum needed for the Club World Cup]</b> The investment, infrastructure and players Rayados has doesn’t allow you not to get into the Liguilla. For an institution like <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a> not to achieve a first objective is a sporting failure, totally. Not getting into the final eight with what the club has here is failure. There’s no doubt about that. Everyone working in the group has that clear, it’s that obvious.
