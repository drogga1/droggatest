  <p><b>[Antonio Mohamed returns as <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a> manager]</b> Football Club <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a> Rayados informs that Antonio Mohamed will take over as manager of the team. Mohamed will come to take charge of the commitments we have in the current semester, the 2019 Liga MX Apertura and the Club World Cup which will take place in December in Qatar. Mohamed and his coaching staff will take charge of the team from Monday</p>

  <p><b>[Antonio Mohamed returns as <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a> manager]</b> Honestly, the happiness I have is enormous. We’re going for the rematch. We need to support of the best fans in Mexico to go for glory together. See you soon</p>

  <p><b>[Monterrey manager Antonio Mohamed knows there’s no excuse for his club to miss the playoffs, especially with momentum needed for the Club World Cup]</b> The investment, infrastructure and players Rayados has doesn’t allow you not to get into the Liguilla. For an institution like <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a> not to achieve a first objective is a sporting failure, totally. Not getting into the final eight with what the club has here is failure. There’s no doubt about that. Everyone working in the group has that clear, it’s that obvious. Although it sounds harsh, that’s how it is</p>

  <p><b>[Vincent Janssen did well in both legs of the quarterfinals, scoring from the penalty spot in a 5-2 first-leg rout and also assisting one of Dorlan Pabon’s two goals.]</b> Vincent played, like everyone, a great game. There were some standout players, two or three if we look at Charly (Rodriguez) and Dorlan - and Janssen had an amazing game</p>

  <p><b>[Brave <a href="monterrey-fc.html">Monterrey</a> get tactics right but fall just short of massive Club World Cup upset over Liverpool]</b> We’re going for a goal. What did we come here for? To defend inside our own area? If that happens, it’s because they’re better than us. We’re going to attack how we always do. We’re putting the players out there who can go up front. That’s our essence, and we’re not going to change it. The opponent can make us change if they’re doing better than us and pinning us back</p>

  <p><b>[Monterrey relishing <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> clash]</b> We have full respect to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, one of the best sides in the world. But we should be concerned with ourselves. We have great drive to win, we didn’t come to test ourselves and lose. We will enjoy the match, but we are here to win. There’s nothing impossible in football</p>

  <p><b>[Monterrey coach Antonio Mohamed has accused <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> of disrespect during last month’s Club World Cup semi-final against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and has admitted directing an expletive-laden rant at the Reds boss]</b> What happened is that I was disrespected. <b>[Klopp]</b> kept asking for yellow cards because he said we were hitting <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah all the time. Then when I asked for a card to expel one of their players, he stuck his tongue out at me like a p<em>ssy. When I saw him, I laughed at first and then I got a little angry and rose to his bait – then my neighbourhood came out and I lost all elegance and composure. If I have to tell you what I said to him <b>[…]</b> I can’t even remember, because I thought if I swear at him in English I won’t be myself. So I think I said to him ‘Your f</em>cking mother’s c<em>nt, who have you been f</em>cking? Q<em>**</em>’. I went away because I never fight with the substitutes’ benches, but I went crazy because I felt he was trying to disrespect me. I don’t know if I reacted well or badly, but it came from inside</p>
