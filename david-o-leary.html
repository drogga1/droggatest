  <p><b>[David O’Leary has stated that he is keen to make a return to top-level management as soon as possible, and <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> might be only to happy to provide him with a reference]</b> I’ve had requests to go back into football and it’s not me bigging myself up or thinking I deserve a bigger job but I just felt that the jobs weren’t right in any way. I’ve had lots of offers mainly from abroad and I think that can only come from people remembering <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> in the Champions League. Some with loads and loads of dollars. <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> was very good and recommended me for a really big job but I just felt I couldn’t live where it was with the family really. That was about six or seven months ago<br /><br />We’re not friends but Jose has always kind of rated me if you know what I mean. He was asked a question to recommend somebody for something or put them up and I was very grateful that he did it. When I thanked him he said, ‘David, I wasn’t doing you a favour even though I like you, it’s because I rate you’ and that’s his attitude.<br /><br />I saw <b>[Fabio]</b> <a href="fabio-capello.html">Capello</a> at the soccer writers’ function the other week and he came down from the top table and said ‘when are you bloody getting back in the game’?. It was nice getting that from <a href="fabio-capello.html">Capello</a>. A lot of them know that you’re too good to be out of it. That’s not me trying to big myself up. People in the game know how difficult Doug Ellis and <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> was<br /><br /><b>[O’Leary also feels that his record at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> stands up against that of his successor <a href="martin-o-neill.html">Martin O’Neill</a>, especially with regard to the funds which were available to him to spend in the transfer market]</b> I came in thinking Doug Ellis would go and I’d be the lucky one that <a href="martin-o-neill.html">Martin O’Neill</a> is now. I gave honest opinions at the end of that year <b>[2005-06]</b> saying we need investment here. I was hoping I would be the one that was there when Randy Lerner came in. I read people now and they like Martin. He’s media savvy and he’s saying he’s dealing with a young, small squad. Yet, when I said that it was ‘Oh, he’s making excuses’. I said the club needed investment to keep it alive. Why did Martin need £50 million this summer? At the end of the day, Martin, for all the money he has spent over three years - and they’re raving about him - hasn’t finished any higher than what I finished. Those are the facts</p>

  <p><b>[Al-Ahli sack former <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds United</a> &amp; <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> manager David O’Leary after eight months in charge]</b> We have decided to sack David O’Leary and his assistant Roy Aitken and now Ahmed Al Mistaki will take over as coach until the season finishes, after that we will decide on how to take things forward. It wasn’t going too well with O’Leary and the board took a decision to end his contract. Ahmad has been at training and knows the boys, so the club is looking forward to working with him now</p>

I would also like to thank <a href="richard-bevan.html">Richard Bevan</a> and the LMA as well as my outstanding legal team, led by Paul Gilroy QC, and Michael Kennedy from Herbert Reeves &amp; Co, for their support and hard work in bringing my case to this very satisfactory conclusion<br /><br />I hope my case provides reassurance to all managers and coaches working all over the world that there is a formal system in place that provides employment protection</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> allowing <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> to run down his contract and leave as a free agent would be criminal]</b> I think the club has learned in the past that letting people’s contracts run down and walking out on free transfers, top players have done that, it’s not financially right for the club. Personally, I hope he signs again because his goal-scoring record is unbelievable, but the club has got to find out does he want to stay, and if he doesn’t then I think they have got to cash in on him. You cannot afford to let contracts run down now, particularly a player like that. If he runs his contract down and just walks out on a free, that would be criminal in many ways<br /><br />But we all have to have our own structures on the financial side of things. I don’t know what he’s looking for. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> pay fantastically well, whether that is good enough for him. If it’s not going to be, I hate to say it, I think they have got to go and get the best price for him and use that money to bring in someone young and hungry and hopefully do great for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Football Club. I hope it doesn’t come to that</p>

  <p><b>[David O’Leary says <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> has not put a foot wrong since taking charge of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> I don’t think he’s put a foot wrong off the field. There are things that he’s done that nobody knows about. But what you can say, what he’s come in behind the scenes and done has just been absolutely fantastic. The way he’s handled himself, the way he’s handled himself through this crisis and the things he’s done without seeking publicity, the things he’s implemented structurally at the club, I don’t think he’s put a foot wrong. I think he has a hard task, without a doubt, he’s come in and taken a hard job on. He needs players. The squad he has he will make better. Will that push them towards being a top-four club? No, I don’t see that. I think where he is going to be judged is on recruitment. It’s easier said than done, but you’ve got to get players out. That’s hard to do and he’ll be judged on that, but he’ll also be certainly judged on the personnel he brings in.</p>
