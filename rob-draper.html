  <p><b>[Clubs must reflect on how they deal with instances]</b> All the clubs will sign up for anti-racism campaigns and they’ll all wear Black Lives Matter next week but when it comes to a player in their club accused of racism, you see the response and it can be quite different. We saw how <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> reacted to <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> being accused of racism and I think <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Jamie Carragher</a> apologised to <a href="patrice-evra.html">Patrice Evra</a> for his part in that. And I think on reflection many people in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> say they called that very wrong. We all sign up for campaigns, and say racism is a bad thing but when it actually affects our life, or our player or our friend, we think ‘they’re quite a nice guy’ and we don’t think they’re racist. <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> defended <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a>’s tweet earlier in the season and that was slightly problematic. I think most of us could see why the tweet was a problem and was offensive. I think what Pep was probably trying to say was, ‘you don’t know <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a>, he’s not a racist’. When we get to these situations it needs a more nuanced system. The FA charge given to <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a>, is not saying you’re a terrible racist, it says this caused offence. Then you’d like to see some reflection from <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> and maybe Bernardo himself to say, ‘I didn’t mean to cause offence but I can see that might be offensive’. The rush is to defend your player - and of course the player deserves a fair hearing and a defence - but it’s not always the right response</p>

  <p><b>[The Supplement panel discussed how the lockdown period will have given teams ample time to analyse other teams and their own tactics]</b> The lockdown generally has exposed bad leadership and validated good leadership. Good leadership thrives in a crisis time like this. Particularly if you are across technology, and know how to use it well, you’ll have had a good lockdown. I think it will be intriguing to see who responds to this well; so I would guess that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, who are across technology brilliantly, will have had a good lockdown</p>
