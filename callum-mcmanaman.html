  <p><b>[Callum McManaman says No fan or player would swap the FA Cup for staying in the Premier League]</b> It’s funny. bumped into Ben just before Christmas and he was joking with me, saying ‘I’m the one who got the glory, everyone remembers me more than you! I think at the time, you probably don’t realise how big a day it was, what a big achievement it was. But as the years go by - and around this time of year obviously it always comes up as a memory - you start to understand what it meant. It’s nice to look back and think ‘wow yeah, we did that!<br /><br /><b>[He credits <a href="roberto-martinez.html">Roberto Martinez</a> for Wigan’s success]</b> He never gets the credit he deserves for that game. His tactics that day were unbelievable. He had James McArthur playing right wing-back and Roger Espinoza left wing-back. He had no strikers, with me and <b>[Arouna]</b> Kone playing like high wingers. City didn’t know what we were playing, they didn’t know who to mark. I’ve never been one for watching games back to be honest, but I watched this one recently on YouTube, and <a href="gael-clichy.html">Clichy</a> didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know whether to go forward or to stay. Martinez did an unbelievable job there<br /><br /><b>[He had scored at Wembley in the semi-final win over Millwall, but it is the quarter-final which really sticks in his mind]</b> That was the best day of my life. I turned a bit bitter towards <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> for a time. I was a massive Blue and I’d joined the academy at the age of six. I’d come through with the likes of Jack Rodwell, Adam Forshaw, Jose Baxter and Jay Wallace. I was much smaller than those players. They were men, I was a baby. The club had told my mum and dad that they’d wait for me to grow, but they let me go and it killed me. Everyone at my school knew I was at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and thought I was going to make it, so I was embarrassed to go back and face them. I stopped going. I went off the rails a bit, to be honest.<br /><br />That took the shine off a bit. The final should be a showpiece occasion, the end of the season, 3pm kick off. Instead, we get home late on the Saturday, then we’re back in for a recovery session on the Sunday afternoon and on the Monday we’re travelling back to London for a make-or-break league game. There was no time to properly enjoy what we’d done<br /><br /><b>[Martinez left for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, taking with him four members of his cup-winning team]</b> I do think I kind of missed the boat. There were rumours of <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs but nothing concrete. And at the time I was happy, I’d just moved house, I was settled. And I thought we were nailed-on to come straight back up<br /><br /><b>[That set up another Wembley trip, a semi-final against Arsenal]</b> Rosler took me off right after. I will never forgive him for that. We tried to hang on, and <b>[Per]</b> <a href="per-mertesacker.html">Mertesacker</a> scored late on. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> won on penalties. I still regret that to this day. We’d have played Hull in the final, and I think we’d have beaten them. We could have won two straight FA Cups as Wigan. Imagine that<br /><br /><b>[McManaman, finally, got his move back to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but chose his club - or rather his manager - poorly]</b> West Brom yeah. I kind of knew at the time it was a risk, but it was the only move on the table at the time for me. It was a good offer, and it was <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Wigan needed the money, and you could kind of see where they were headed. I should have gone to West Brom in the summer under Alan Irvine, but I wanted to stay at home. I still regret that now. Then in the January, I’m thinking it could be my last chance to get back to the Prem<br /><br /><b>[Irvine, of course, had been sacked by the time <a href="steve-mcmanaman.html">McManaman</a> got to the Hawthorns, replaced by Tony Pulis]</b> It just didn’t work. Training was just shape, shape, shape, every day. I hated it. The first six months I was in and out, doing OK. And then the start of the next season (2015-16) I played against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It was <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a>’s debut, I remember, and I played well. I thought it was my chance, but I was on the bench for the next game and thought ‘what can I do here?’ A few days later we played <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. He knew I was a big Blue, and he’d promised me I was playing. I didn’t start, so I was fuming. Then we were 2-0 up, so I thought ‘no chance I’m getting on now, he’ll go defensive’. Then <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> make it 2-2 and he’s got one sub left. It’s me or <a href="rickie-lambert.html">Rickie Lambert</a>, and he sends <a href="rickie-lambert.html">Lambert</a> on. My head was gone from that point. I went in to see him the next day, we had words and I never started another game for him.<br /><br /><b>[McManaman watched his career drift, his enthusiasm for the game waning with each passing week]</b> They were tough times. I never spoke to anyone about it, but I probably should have. When I wasn’t even in the squad, watching Gillette Soccer Saturday every weekend, and then having to go into training of a Monday, knowing I’m not going to play, that was hard. I wasn’t able to enjoy football<br /><br /><b>[Now, he’s back in the Championship at Luton]</b> I think I’ve suffered from being seen as an impact player. Because I’m explosive and I try things, I’ve almost played myself into this role as a sub. I’m trying to change that perception. I basically lost three years of my career after going to West Brom, and it has been hard to get that rhythm back. You need a run of games, and I’ve not really been able to get it. But I’m definitely enjoying it more now than I have for a few years. I’m 28, but I’ve not got too many miles on the clock, if you get me? I’ve played less than 250 games, so physically I feel fit and strong still. I don’t know if I’ll ever get back to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but I know I can still play to a decent level. I just want to be playing consistently now. I’ve lost enough time.<br /><br /><b>[We finish by returning to that FA Cup final. A career high, one that, looking back, even relegation cannot diminish]</b> I saw <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> saying a few years ago that teams didn’t want to end up like Wigan, winning a cup but going down. Is he for real?! I guarantee you not one Wigan fan, or player, would swap that FA Cup for staying in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. They’ll remember that day forever. I know I will</p>
