  <p><b>[Natasha Dowie says Maybe I’m not the style of player Neville wants for England]</b> I feel like I’m probably performing the best I’ve ever performed. I think that’s since I’ve started travelling, playing in different countries and testing myself against different styles of play. I think I’ve grown a lot and matured a lot as a player. I’ve become captain of the club as well. I would love the opportunity to get back involved with England and to show that I can compete at that level. If I’m not Phil Neville’s choice for England, then I have to respect his decision. Maybe I’m just not the style of player that he wants in his England team or, who knows. If you think about it too much, it’ll get you a little bit down. I’ve always just tried to enjoy my football, play and train as hard as I can, give everything that I can and that’s what I pride myself on<br /><br />We’ve reiterated that to all the players who weren’t involved last year, that this is what happens. It’s a great achievement for the club to have got to the finals two years in a row, but we also have that bitter taste in our mouths from last year, falling short. It really hurt. <b>[Sydney]</b> won the Championship last year so, this is their title to throw away now. They’ve been there, they’ve done it, they’ve won it. This kind of occasion won’t phase them. If we’re going to get to that Grand Final, we need to be at the top of our game<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether that makes Sydney the favourites]</b> Maybe a little bit, but I also think as players, we put pressure on ourselves because we’re Melbourne Victory. In my eyes, it’s the biggest club in Australia. I think we went through a bit of a transitional period when we were really successful, and then Melbourne City came along and most of our players then went over there. For <b>[my]</b> first three or four years, it was just building the squad again from nothing. I think Jeff <b>[Hopkins, manager]</b> has done a terrific job in building a team and a squad over the last two years that has been able to compete and actually win things. One hundred per cent, every year, Melbourne Victory have to be competing for silverware<br /><br />I think, in an ideal world, you want to see the W-League try and stand on its own. Personally, I would love to play in Australia full-time and have a longer season. That’s a big ask, and how they go about that, I don’t know. But I think, from a player who is very passionate about the W-League, loves Melbourne and loves Australia, I would love to see that happen<br /><br />At the end of the day, I’ve had a great career. I’ve loved every minute. I’ve had the opportunity to play in five different countries and I’m going to carry on playing, trying to become a better player, achieve more things and win more things. If that England call comes up, I’ll be absolutely over the moon and ready for it. But if not, I’ll carry on doing what I’m doing, which is scoring goals, which is what I’ve always done</p>
