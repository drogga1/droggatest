  <p><b>[Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope has admitted that he is targeting the England No.1 spot, which is currently held by <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s <a href="jordan-pickford.html">Jordan Pickford</a>.]</b> One of my main things is not to look too far ahead. I’m really looking after myself at <a href="burnley-fc.html">Burnley</a>. England is so far away, even though being the No.1 is something that I want. It’s a real dream of mine to play at Wembley and to represent England as many times as possible<br /><br />Although I didn’t play a game at the World Cup, to be part of that was still one of the greatest things of my life. The biggest moment? <a href="eric-dier.html">Eric Dier</a> scoring the winning penalty against Colombia. As one of the goalkeepers, I’d done a lot of work with Eric and the other lads on the penalties, so to see them perform as they did was incredible. If you could stop time and rerun the adrenaline and everything you had for those couple of moments, it would be unbelievable<br /><br />We could score in the 89th minute to go 2-1 up and, for me personally, you don’t want to run round doing knee-slides. At that point, I’m thinking about getting over the line. That’s the feeling I want. The game is done and you’ve got the three points. I don’t really have a temper and I like to be very relaxed. I’ve found it’s the best way for me to perform at my best. If a goalkeeper can have a calming influence, it’s something that can run through a team</p>
