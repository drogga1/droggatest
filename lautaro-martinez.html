  <p><b>[Lautaro Martinez says Mauro <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a> did not want to leave Inter for <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>]</b> I have a good relationship with him and we talk a lot. He wanted to stay and in the talks with the club he always said he wanted to play but now he is in another team and I wish him the best because since I arrived in Italy he has been a key person that has helped me integrate better<br /><br /><b>[Romelu <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> arrived from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in a £75 million deal and was immediately handed the No.9 shirt once occupied by <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a>]</b> <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a> immediately adapted to the coach’s ideas and the team’s style of play. He’s a striker with incredible characteristics, he’s very powerful. I was surprised by his sheer stature<br /><br /><b>[Martinez said while preparing for Argentina’s friendly date with Mexico]</b> I am happy to be here, especially as many of the squad were also my team-mates during the Copa America. I know that I have to work even harder, but the Copa America this summer was my first major tournament with the national team and it was very positive. On a personal level, I was surprised by just how much playing time I had in the Copa America. I started off expecting to be on the bench and slowly became a first pick. It was remarkable, as I hadn’t played that much for Inter during the previous season, but that made me happy and boosted my confidence. When playing with <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Sergio Aguero</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Leo Messi</a>, obviously you have to work harder to protect the midfield and defence, but I do more or less the same at Inter when we have two strikers</p>

  <p><b>[Inter forward Lautaro Martinez says his side deserved to beat <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in their Champions League group stage encounter on Wednesday]</b> The coach is right. We produced a great display and didn’t win because of fine margins. Now we have to think about <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. We leave here disappointed because we deserved to win. We have to be alert in this competition because players of this calibre are unforgiving if you make a mistake. With all the good work that we did, we didn’t deserve to lose. The referee also played a role, but we have to be more focused. I do think we produced a very good performance and we can be pleased with that albeit disappointed with the result</p>

In the national team a great friendship has been forged between us. He is an example to us, he is vital as a person to our team. Being part of Argentina is an honour.

  <p><b>[Inter forward Lautaro Martinez had given his side an early lead at Westfalenstadion but could only look on helplessly as they let a two-goal lead slip]</b> We did well in the first half, but we were a completely different team in the second. We’re disappointed because we showed a bit of immaturity in the second half. There were mistakes in concentration - these are things that cannot happen, conceding three goals in one half. We were missing a bit of maturity in the second half. We have to continue doing well. Hope is not lost</p>

Last year, I didn’t play as much as I wanted, I didn’t have time to prove my worth. Romelu and I are getting to know each other and we’re getting better and better<br /><br />The thing that makes me happiest is the clean sheet. It was a good defensive performance and that is very important because we knew we would score sooner or later. If we can be more hermetically sealed at the back then we’ll be in good shape</p>

  <p><b>[Lautaro Martinez is delighted to be delivering success for <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> and insists he is happy in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> despite reported interest from some of Europe’s biggest clubs]</b> Last year, I played in a team with a coach who played with only one striker in attack. I knew that in front of me there was the captain, <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a>, the most important player for Inter, and obviously it was very complicated for me to play. I always trained to the maximum, but I knew it was like that. I had the chance to play a few minutes but not like I would play now. This year, I had a great Copa America, then I met <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>, who works at high intensity and treats all players in the same way. This makes everyone train to the maximum. Then there is Romelu, who is a great person on and off the pitch. We are working hard to follow the coach’s instructions and take Inter to the top<br /><br /><b>[Martinez has been linked with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in recent weeks but described his happiness at <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a>]</b> Inter is my home.

  <p><b>[Lautaro Martinez says it is a privilege to play with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> for Argentina]</b> For us Argentines, Leo is as important as <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> was. It’s something that goes beyond football. He is the best in the world; playing with him in the national team is a privilege. He is generous; he shows me his movements, he teaches me to find spaces that apparently do not exist. <b>[Winning the World Cup with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b> would be wonderful. He got very close to it. He has come close to the Copa America, playing three finals. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> as world champion, together with his team-mates, would be a great thing for all Argentina<br /><br /><b>[Lautaro has 13 goals in 22 appearances for Inter this season]</b> It means that I’m working right. It means that I’m getting better and I’m doing well for Inter and for me, that’s the most important thing. I’m happy here, it’s my home. <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> is helping me improve. He gives me the minutes that you need as a player. He trusts me and I feel safe. We have gotten to know each other quickly. It seems incredible to me that only five months have passed. The thing I appreciate most about him is his passion for football. It’s deep, contagious<br /><br /><b>[Lautaro believes his childhood prepared him well for the challenges of professional football]</b> I thank my parents. My father played football when he was young and passed on his passion to me and my brothers. There was no money, but there was never an empty plate on the table and we had a ball. For a while we all slept in one room - we three children, mom and dad. But the football was sacred. We went to training by bicycle, by bus, often on foot. Living through hard experiences strengthens you. It helps you keep your feet on the ground and work with humility. In this way, we are similar. Romelu is only 26 but has so much experience in life and football. He has scored so many goals for great teams and still has a noble heart</p>

I am very calm, I live day to day and I am happy and comfortable here<br /><br /><b>[Lautaro credits <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> as a driving force behind his rapid progress]</b> Many things have changed since he came in. He has a special way of doing things and has taught us so much from his first day in charge. He has convinced us to all give our best and the results are there for all to see. I have had to adapt to a new culture in another country and learn another language.
