  <p>[On Adrien Rabiot] Adrien loves PSG, he’s attached to the club. He wants to make a career there, but it’s not possible. He’d need 35 full games a season to continue his progress and that won’t happen. Since he can’t make his way, it’s better to leave.</p>

  <p>[The mother of Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot has confirmed that the player will be vacating the French capital at the end of the current season] Rabiot’s decision to leave? It is firm and definitive. The current situation has completely deteriorated, there is no going back now.<br /><br />[Rabiot also rejected the notion that her son had betrayed PSG] During the summer transfer window I told Mr Henrique [Antero, PSG’s sporting director] that he wanted this. Adrien is on the transfer list because Adrien wanted to leave the club and that was said clearly. The club did not want to sell Adrien, there was an offer from Barcelona during the transfer window. The club refused, the club has every right to refuse, but they cannot say they were not aware. I have always respected rules and protocol, everyone knows that, we do not have the right to talk with any club before January 1 and I will not speak to any club before January 1</p>

  <p>[Adrien Rabiot’s mother and agent, Veronique Rabiot, has hit out at Paris Saint-Germain’s treatment of her son] I do not want to cry about it, or to weaken even more Adrien saying he is not good. We are attacking the human side here. We are modest. I can only tell you that he feels very badly [about] everything that happens.<br /><br />Adrien is a prisoner! He is even held hostage by PSG. Soon it will be dry bread, water, and a dungeon! This environment is cruel<br /><br />I can already say that we blamed him for liking the wrong video. This is not the one where Patrice Evra ‘celebrates’ the elimination of Paris. And then, there is this nightclub outing … But PSG wants to take care of Adrien’s private life too, when they don’t even want him anymore! They want him to put on his pajamas at nine o’clock, before the game, in front of his TV, to go to bed at eleven o’clock! These people do not know the rhythm of life of the players? When a player plays, which is his job, he has a training rhythm. In this case, nothing happens for Adrien. Adrien is not going to take a pottery class until something happens. He must take care of himself, let him live!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Rabiot’s mother accuses PSG chairman of ‘poisoning’ team] The president [Al-Khelaifi] has made a completely unfair decision and everybody knows that. By doing this, he has instilled a poison in his team, which has done its work over the past five months – Nasser has broken his own team up because he forgot about the human factor. When you make decisions in life, there are short, medium and long-term consequences. Failing to understand that when you are the president of a football club is to not know football, nor football players. Above all, it shows that you do not know men<br /><br />His team-mates know that Adrien is suffering, even if he says nothing – that suffering resonates. I am not saying that it is a conscious thing, I actually think that it is totally subconscious from the other players. However, there is a gangrene there. Nasser has taken away their serenity – you cannot ignore it when one of the best players in your team is abused in front of your eyes</p>
