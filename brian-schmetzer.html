  <p><b>[Stefan Frei returns to Toronto hoping to win MLS Cup]</b> He’s really turned into a guy who makes the normal save, but he’s been able to come up with really good saves to keep us in games at the right moments. There have been plenty of occasions this year where he’s come up with something that leaves you scratching your head thinking, ‘How did he do that?’.<br /><br />A change of scenery from Toronto helped him, some players are good players but they need a change of scenery. He comes to Seattle, starts working with <b>[Sounders goalkeeper coach Tommy Dutra]</b>, gets a chance to play and you see the maturity now. Goalkeepers in general, they get in that late 20s, early 30s, that’s kind of the sweet spot for them. They’re a little more cerebral, they’re a little calmer. We’re obviously reaping the benefits of <b>[Frei’s]</b> development, for sure.</p>

  <p><b>[On Chad Marshall]</b> On the field, his contribution, you guys can all see. Off the field, he’s a really good character for our locker room. So he’s helped on both fronts, and you couple that with <b>[the fact that]</b> he’s a really tremendous human being and you’ve covered all three of those really important bases.</p>

  <p><b>[Jordan Morris tunes out then silences critics in Seattle Sounders’ run to MLS Cup final]</b> I think you’ve seen that he already has the physical tools to be a good pro, but we’re continually working on his strength and his speed and his ability to be a physically imposing player. His growth is steady. It’s going in the right trend and he’s got a high ceiling - he’s got a really high ceiling.</p>

  <p><b>[The clash of systems between TFC’s 3-5-2 formation and Seattle’s 4-4-2]</b> If you’re talking Lodeiro, <b>[Osvaldo Alonso]</b>, Jordan <b>[Morris]</b>, Giovinco or whoever, wherever those players are, and whatever system they’re in, they still have to make plays. On that given day, if Bradley and Lodeiro are going to be matched up on a similar area of the field, one of them has to win that battle for one of our teams to be successful.<br /><br />Whether it’s a 3-5-2, whether it’s a four-man back line, yes, you work on that, you watch film, you try to get your team as prepared as possible. I don’t think it’s too big of a challenge because now we do watch a lot of film. All of the games are televised, we have a whole sports science staff at Seattle where we can digest the statistics and all of that. The preparation will be there. At the end of the day, it comes down to the players, how they define their roles within our system or <b>[Greg Vanney’s]</b> system</p>

  <p><b>[Sounders originals Osvaldo Alonso, Brad Evans and Zach Scott finally lift MLS Cup]</b> They’ve been resilient for a long time. If my memory serves me correct, guys like Zach Scott are very resilient. Guys like Brad, guys like Ozzie - they’re all pretty resilient.</p>

  <p><b>[A closer look at Sounders-Dynamo]</b> I would put Nouhou in a race against any of their players, Joevin’s got speed, Kelvin’s got speed. I think the way the game manifests itself is just which players can make some plays. If you look at the Vancouver series. Again, a counterattacking team gave us a little preparation for this. But it still comes down to the guys have to make plays. If Elis can get the better of our left side, then okay fine, fair enough, but if our guys can shut him down then that’s a big loss for them.</p>

  <p><b>[Will Bruin returns to Houston having recharged his career in Seattle]</b> Will has come here and, like a second chance for him to start fresh, he’s really done well. He’s done everything we’ve asked. He had the elbow dislocation, and he’s such a tough kid that he powered through that and was able to give us minutes even playing with that brace. He’s got 11 goals, and that speaks volumes.</p>

  <p><b>[Seattle Sounders exploit Dynamo’s right side as reigning champ dominates underdog]</b> I like the pair of Nouhou and Joevin Jones. I think both of them are pretty dynamic, although in different ways. Nouhou is all power and speed and Joevin has a bit more subtlety to his game. I think what you find is when Dempsey plays in between the lines and Nico goes over there and you have overloads on that side of the fields, it creates problems for the opposing defense.</p>

  <p><b>[On Gustav Svensson]</b> He’s played probably more positions than he would like. As he’s grown into the group, and the season has progressed, he has played a big role in a lot of our successful matches.<br /><br /><b>[On Tony Alfaro]</b> <b>[If]</b> Tony gets on the field, he’ll do fine. He’ll be able to handle it.<br /><br />You have to remind them that this isn’t finished. This game could take a turn for the worse. If they score early then they think they have a chance</p>

  <p><b>[No shots in 120 minutes! Sounders confident their attack will be better in MLS Cup rematch]</b> That’s the one thing that always rankles me a little bit because here’s the deal: No coach is going out there to not score goals. So when I watch the final in 2016, Joevin Jones had gotten down the left, he didn’t finish the play. Tyrone Mears had a naked early cross to Nelson <b>[Valdez]</b> early in the game. We were trying to score. It was just on that day Toronto was very good defensively, we couldn’t get out of our half.<br /><br />You fast forward now to this year and the team is playing at a high level. Clint <b>[Dempsey]</b> is playing at a high level. Victor <b>[Rodriguez]</b> is playing at a high level, and he’s been good for us because he’s goal dangerous. Will <b>[Bruin]</b> is obviously in a good run of form. You’ve got <b>[Nicolas]</b> Lodeiro, and our guys on set pieces are pretty good. We do have a few weapons where we’re hoping, again, same as last year, we’re going to play the same. We’re going to try and get the ball up in their half of the field and score<br /><br />We will have a better squad maybe, from the soccer perspective, yes. From the mentality side, I think the 2016 and the 2017 team are similar. They both have a really strong mindset.</p>

  <p><b>[Cristian Roldan has evolved into fierce young leader for Sounders]</b> I would say it’s the natural evolution of a player who is super dedicated, super fit, serious about his craft, and just wants to be part of a successful team. The kid’s drive to win is tremendous.</p>

  <p><b>[Long-time USMNT teammates Clint Dempsey and Michael Bradley set to battle in quest for first club title]</b> It is going to be an interesting battle. Michael tries to orchestrate the game from his position but he will also have to deal with what Clint can do in that same area of the field when we have the ball.<br /><br /><b>[Schmetzer echoed Vanney’s thoughts on Bradley’s Best XI snub]</b> I don’t know what these people see. I see a great player. He’s got the engine to run all day. You can look at the goal he scored against Mexico. Look, there’s 11 spots and you can’t always make those accolades. I’m sure he would push that aside if he could win MLS Cup.<br /><br /><b>[On Clint Dempsey]</b> He is absolutely hungry to get out on that field and make a contribution to the team to help the team win. In that sense, I think you will see vintage Clint Dempsey, a very motivated, deadly goal-scorer when he’s motivated. And I’m anxious for the game to start because I want to see a couple of U.S. players going after each other</p>

  <p><b>[Can TFC-Sounders be the Lakers-Celtics rivalry of MLS?]</b> I think they’ve had plenty of motivation after losing a final here last year. There’s a lot of accolades that Toronto should certainly be deserved of. At the same time, our club, we’re very proud of what we do. <b>[…]</b> We all set a standard for ourselves in whatever department we have and we set that bar very high, and it’s something that we will continue to do.</p>

  <p><b>[On Greg Vanney]</b> Getting to know <b>[Vanney]</b> on a personal level is great. The course itself is a great opportunity not only to get to know and understand some of your fellow coaches, but just being among your peers you want to try and compete against them.<br /><br />Just look at the last round. He changed his formation against Columbus in the second half <b>[of the second leg]</b>, and pulled off <b>[Eriq]</b> Zavaleta and went a different way because he didn’t like the way the team was going. I’m not sure I would do that, not at 0-0, but it shows that he’s confident in what he does.</p>

It’s hard to put into words all of the positive things he has brought to the club and his teammates. It has been an honor to coach such a fantastic American player, arguably one the best defenders in MLS history. I’d like to thank him for what he’s done in the Sounders community and wish him the best in whatever he decides to do next. We, the players and staff will miss him, and our league has lost a great player</p>

It just shows that his growth, his maturity in these big contests, in these big games, maybe <b>[playing with the USMNT]</b> helps him, but he’s been always a good student. <b>[Assistant coach]</b> Preki has been working with him. Preki makes Jordan find the <b>[video]</b> clips he wants to talk about, then they discuss it, so we’re making him think about the game and think about how he can be better. I think some of those things are working</p>

Is Alejandro Pozuelo going to play as that false No. 9, what does Carlos do, where are the heat maps of both players? They are pretty similar. I think that the team Toronto vs. the team LAFC poses different challenges so we’ve kind of looked at it from a team perspective. Later in the week, we’ll make sure that the individual players get enough film on Pozuelo, his movements, his style and we’ll make some adjustments</p>
