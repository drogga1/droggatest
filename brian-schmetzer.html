  <p><b>[Sounders head coach Brian Schmetzer said about <a href="jordan-morris.html">Jordan Morris</a> after the game]</b> He’s grown. Jordan is such a nice kid, he has so much talent. It just shows that his growth, his maturity in these big contests, in these big games, maybe <b>[playing with the USMNT]</b> helps him, but he’s been always a good student. <b>[Assistant coach]</b> Preki has been working with him. Preki makes Jordan find the <b>[video]</b> clips he wants to talk about, then they discuss it, so we’re making him think about the game and think about how he can be better. I think some of those things are working</p>

  <p><b>[Miracle or mind game? <a href="jozy-altidore.html">Altidore</a>’s injury status vital in buildup to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup]</b> <b>[It’s]</b> not mind games because <a href="greg-vanney.html">Greg Vanney</a> is a good guy, I don’t think he plays mind games. But look, whether Jozy plays or not, we’ll be prepared. I expect - again, it’s the last game, this is it, it’s the last game of the year - I expect him to be involved in some way<br /><br /><b>[The Sounders, meanwhile, are prepared for that scenario given the one they just experienced. Having taken down Los Angeles FC in the last round, the Sounders went against the league’s MVP in <a href="carlos-vela.html">Carlos Vela</a>, a player that also tends to play as a false nine]</b> They’re a little different players. Is Alejandro Pozuelo going to play as that false No. 9, what does Carlos do, where are the heat maps of both players? They are pretty similar. I think that the team Toronto vs. the team LAFC poses different challenges so we’ve kind of looked at it from a team perspective. Later in the week, we’ll make sure that the individual players get enough film on Pozuelo, his movements, his style and we’ll make some adjustments</p>

  <p><b>[In the aftermath of the news on Roman Torres’ 10-game suspension by <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> for violating the league’s substance abuse policy]</b> If there is any avenue to shrink the sentence, we want to be supportive. I don’t know what our process is, what our rights are, I believe that the Union (MLSPA) takes care of that for the players</p>

  <p><b>[The Seattle Sounders have signed Josh Atencio and Ethan Dobbelaere as homegrown players]</b> Josh and Ethan are good young players who have performed well in training with the First Team when given the chance. I look forward to bringing them more into the fold and continuing to see them develop as professionals</p>
