  <p>[Miroslav Stoch relishing ‘dream’ Chelsea clash] They got in touch when I was about 15, and I went there for a few trials, then I transferred when I was 16. It was a huge step for me, a whole different world. I couldn’t say a word in English, so the first three or four months were tough for me. They put me, along with two Finnish and one Swiss player, into an English family who helped us to fit in. Once I started to talk, it was all good. I eventually made it to the first team. My team-mates are all huge legends. I am honoured that we shared the same dressing room. It was the best experience. To learn as a young player from the very best is a great opportunity for every young player and I am grateful for that. I always wished to draw Chelsea [in the Europa League], not just because I played there, but because I have been a Chelsea fan since I was a kid.<br /><br />We are enjoying the fact that we made it to the quarter-finals. To play against an English team is a dream for everyone who hasn’t played against them before. Chelsea is such a great opponent that it feels like a Champions League match. We see it as a reward that we will play against a club like Chelsea. We beat another team that has won the Europa League [Sevilla]. Why were Slavia so successful over two legs despite being considered underdogs? They [Chelsea] have top players, in some positions maybe even the best in the world. But, of course, they would probably imagine having better results in the Premier League. Of course [Chelsea are favourites], but we aren’t giving in. Everyone knows that the biggest stars of Chelsea are Eden Hazard and N’Golo Kante, I am looking forward to playing against them. I believe that, if we prepare well, choose the right strategy and play the same way that we did against Sevilla - together as a team and put our hearts into it - then we can succeed, even against Chelsea..<br /><br />[Stoch says he has no regrets about choosing to leave Chelsea for Fenerbahce in 2010] We were discussing all possible options, and we decided for the Netherlands, which was a great choice in the end,” he said. “I believe that when I left on loan to Twente, it was the right time to go. Then Fenerbahce offered me a transfer and we decided to take that chance. I don’t regret it at all. I have just the best memories, not just of the club but also the city and my life in Istanbul. The whole nation lives only for football and religion. I am really honoured to have this experience. I love Turkey and Istanbul. I don’t regret any of my decisions. It is true that I could have gone to Galatasaray before I went to Fenerbahce. But, back in the day, Fenerbahce were a better team, so I decided to go there. I follow all the clubs that I played at. I wish them all the best, and I wish they would get back to the top where they belong<br /><br />I am enjoying playing for Slavia enormously. I hope that we will win as many trophies as we can. Prague feels like home, I bought a flat here, and I would like to settle down here in the future</p>
