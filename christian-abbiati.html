  <p><b>[<a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>’s Christian Abbiati says his save against <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> wasn’t his most important one]</b> It’s good to know that people still remember my save against Perugia in 1999, because it was definitely more important than the one I made at <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a>, because it came in the last round, in the last minutes of the game<br /><br />Definitely, it had special importance, also because it was my first year in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> with Milan. My save on Saturday was big, but I think the one in Perugia was far more difficult than the one on Diamanti<br /><br /><b>[Abbiati also said that Marco Amelia, who is on loan from Genoa, could not be blamed for Milan’s lack of positive results when he has deputised]</b> It’s a just a bad coincidence that with Marco between the posts the team have won only once. Marco is a great goalkeeper, he’s always played at high levels and it’s normal that when someone plays less he has a bit of a difficulty getting back his match fitness<br /><br /><b>[Abbiati attributes Milan’s table-topping form to every player in the team - including himself - in just playing their part and contributing when it counts]</b> I feel like saying that this year I’ve been just doing my job, what I’m supposed to do and what the boss and the club expect me to do. The contribution of those who have played off the bench and had limited playing time has also allowed us to reach the top of the standings. Everyone who’s been given the chance this season has played his part in Milan’s success. Definitely, this is a big season for us, because the team is doing well and our final objective is so close we can almost touch it. But let’s not forget that the championship is not over yet and it would be very important to win on Sunday</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>’s Christian Abbiati says It will be difficult to retain the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> title]</b> For us it will be very difficult to retain the title, as for the rest, it is always hard to repeat success. All the other teams have been strengthening their squads, and so we all start on the same level. We have to start well from the first game of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Abbiati says <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> have been the cornerstone of success since 2000]</b> Everyone talks about the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> model but we have been the model to follow since 2000 and we don’t even know it. We won the Champions League in 2003 and the year after we slipped up. We were in the final of 2005 and two years later we were European champions again. We are competitive. Last year we won the Scudetto and went out of the Champions League because of a single shot in two games. Only Real and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are superior to us. For the league, apart from us I see Inter, <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> <b>[competing]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Christian Abbiati contemplating retirement]</b> Will I stay another season? It’s normal at the age of 37 that some injury problems will catch up with you. We train every day and even the younger players have problems. I’m available though and it’s not written that I always have be the first choice.<br /><br />I’m available like I said. Obviously if the club says enough is enough, then that’s it. I’d say that if I don’t a sign a new contract here, it’s 90 percent sure that I’ll quit playing</p>

  <p><b>[Milan goes into Sunday’s derby with city rival Inter nine points adrift of its neighbor and 24 behind <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> leader Juventus]</b> The derby is always a spectacular match and we probably need this win a bit more than them (Inter) at the moment. We’ve been doing alright recently. We got the draw on Monday (against Roma) and there was some disappointment because at the end we could have even won it but a draw was probably the right result</p>

  <p><b>[Abbiati blasts <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> players over poor attitude]</b> There are four or five players that didn’t do what was asked of them, and I’m not talking about making mistakes on the field. The fact is that if it was just one player we could have isolated them, but because it was so many players, it was tough to do so. The fact is that if it was just one player we could have isolated them, but because it was so many players, it was tough to do so. I look at things by thinking about what Demetrio Albertini, <a href="alessandro-costacurta.html">Alessandro Costacurta</a> and <a href="paolo-maldini.html">Paolo Maldini</a> taught me.

  <p><b>[Abbiati hopes <a href="gianluigi-donnarumma.html">Donnarumma</a> can work out new Milan deal]</b> The boy wants to stay and now the club, him and his agent will decide on his future. I hope with all my heart that he can stay, he’s loved by all the fans and he’s shown his value by playing at a high level for a year and a half. Looking at his young age and what he’s done, he’s shown he has great quality. He still has some improving to do, though, because he’s only 18. I don’t know. What I can say is that it’s good to bring champions to Milan. The more experience and the more technical ability there is, the better it is for the team.</p>
