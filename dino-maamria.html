<blockquote>
  <p>[Tunisia will always have 1978. They were the first African and Arab team ever to win a match at a World Cup finals] That inspired me and had a big impact on my life. For lot of Tunisia players and a lot of Tunisian people, that what football really did. It inspired a generation.<br /><br />When we talk about England, we talk about the 1966 World Cup. For Tunisians they talk about 1978 team because it was brilliant. They played fantastic football and had a great campaign. Only one team qualified from Africa; it’s not like now where there are six. They had to go through a gruelling campaign to qualify. People are still talking about it now<br /><br />It’s a tough game against England, and a tough group but they’re very optimistic and they’re looking forward to it. They had good preparation before the World Cup. There’s a positive vibe there. They’re going to be looking for a point against England and beat Panama in the second game. That might be enough for them to go to the second round. That’s their main focus<br /><br />[Tunisia’s ability to repel attacks will impress observers] They’re tactically quite switched on and they’re quite physical. They play passing football and they’ve got technical players that play in European leagues. Where they are lacking is that Msakni was their biggest threat going forward and he did his ACL just before the World Cup and that’s going to be a big blow to them. They are going to rely on Khazri and he’s not actually a centre forward. They’re going to be compact, they play with one front man. They’ll struggle to score a goal but I think they are capable of nicking a draw<br /><br />It’ll be absolutely fantastic. It’ll be a carnival. The Tunisian nation is obsessed with football. It’s their first sport. They think they can get something because England always struggle at tournaments. Being the first game of the World Cup, they are thinking they are going to try and capitalise on it. They have nothing to lose after that<br /><br />[After more than two decades in Britain, Dino admits to some split loyalties when these two nations collide] If England win, that’s great. I hope they win the World Cup. I love it so much I decided to stay and settle here. I had to work very hard to get where I am and I want to stay in this country. Ideally, I want England to win the World Cup and Tunisia to qualify for the second round</p>
