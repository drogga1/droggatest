  <p><b>[Jean-Philippe Gbamin has opened the door to a summer transfer away from Mainz]</b> I basically feel ready for the next step and can well imagine starting a new chapter. Through my achievements, I have made clubs aware of me, where I see a good chance to go to this next stage in my sporting and personal development. At the moment I give 100 per cent for Mainz and I am very satisfied with how much we have improved. What will happen after the season, we have to wait and see.<br /><br />I have taken the development that I had hoped for myself. The first season was a year of apprenticeship in a league unknown to me. In the second year, I’ve been able to implement what I’ve learned a lot better and show what I really can do. That’s why I went to Germany. But I can promise that this is not the end. I am convinced of my abilities and I am getting even better!<br /><br />Of course, the stance of the club initially frustrated me. Anything else would not be normal, I would say. I assumed that a transfer was possible. That’s why I made that public. It ultimately turned out differently. That was not a problem for me, because something like that happens in football. As soon as I realised that the door was closed, life went on. Afterwards I trained as usual and I think I can say that my performances did not suffer. Mentally, that did not stop me at all.<br /><br />When <b>[Herve]</b> Renard called, I had just signed my first professional contract and wanted to consciously take the time to decide. At the time, that was just too early for me. I just wanted to develop myself as a player. It was logical for me to commit three years later. I never wanted to wait for France. My entire family comes from the Ivory Coast, so it was a matter of the heart for me.<br /><br /><b>[Gbamin is unable to help guide The Elephants to the 2018 World Cup]</b> That was the biggest disappointment of my career so far. After all, only one victory was missing to be in Russia. All the players were devastated, the entire country suffered with us. We must now make sure that we improve as a team, because once again I do not want to miss a World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> have signed midfielder Jean-Philippe Gbamin from Mainz for £25million]</b> It’s a big moment with a lot of emotion and now it’s on me to prove on the pitch why they bought me. I’m excited because <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> is a great club here in England with a big history and ambition so I didn’t think for more than a moment - I wanted to come here<br /><br /><b>[Gbamin, who played for Lens for three seasons before spending the equal amount of time at Mainz, hopes that his style of play will excite his new supporters]</b> I like to go in the duels. I like to run a lot and tackle. I also pass good and have a good transition. All the rest, the fans will see. I will give everything on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> midfielder Jean-Philippe Gbamin suffers serious Achilles injury]</b> Gbamin is set to undergo surgery next week after suffering a serious Achilles injury in training. The injury, sustained in a non-contact situation at USM Finch Farm, is unrelated to the quadriceps problem Gbamin had been working his way back from since August last year. Everyone at the club is devastated for JP and we will ensure he gets all the support he needs throughout this challenging time</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> midfielder Jean-Philippe Gbamin suffers serious Achilles injury]</b> It is great to be back at Finch Farm with my teammates. I have my feeling back that I can get playing again. I am training with a view to playing this season if <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> returns. I feel good, fully recovered and I am ready. We are taking it slowly because it was a big injury. It was not easy but I think if the games start to be played in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> then I think I can play. My focus is to get back up to 100 per cent. I won’t get there straight away because I’ve not had much football in my legs but that will come.</p>
