  <p><b>[There were full out shouts for Rubens Sambueza as he exited Club America in the winter]</b> I’m very happy to score in the Toluca shirt. It’s going to be the first of many scored to help the team win. It was a beautiful goal that helped us win and that’s what we wanted.</p>

  <p><b>[Toluca midfielder Rubens Sambueza and Leon midfielder Andres Andrade will miss an indefinite amount of matches]</b> The committee…determines that players Rubens Sambueza and Andres Andrade are suspended, in a temporary manner, from participating in any division or competition of the Clausura 2017 tournament because they’re involved in a process of investigation <b>[because of injury]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Rubens Sambueza again at the center of the storm against Chivas]</b> They’re making it personal. I think it’s a personal situation. They can be as hurt as I am about what happened to Conejo Brizuela. Well, I don’t know about as much as I am because I know Brizuela, he grew up in Toluca next to us. I know what he’s learned, whe he’s done, what he’s gone through. It hurts us. We’ve also suffered injuries because of bad tackles, accidents. I know what happened. I think Chivas are taking it personally.<br /><br />I am how I am. I have my way of doing things. I’m not going to change, and I don’t want to change. To each his own, gentlemen</p>

  <p><b>[Fellow surprise team Necaxa standing between Leon and Liga MX history]</b> It’d be really great to go down in history, not just Club Leon history but Mexican soccer history, but sincerely it’s not the priority for us. The priority is a different goal. First, to get into the Liguilla, to which we’re very close, and after that to fight for the championship with teams that definitely are going to be really strong in the Liguilla as well</p>
