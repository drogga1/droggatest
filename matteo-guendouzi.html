  <p><b>[Matteo Guendouzi says Arsenal have improved too much over the last year to suffer a repeat of last season’s 5-1 thrashing by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> Last year was not our finest hour but it’s very different to last season, it’s a new game and new team so I don’t see why it would be the same result. We’ve had a much better start as well - last year we started with two losses but this year we are already six points up. We have a better team overall and we’re feeling good about ourselves, we have a good team and we believe in ourselves. I know we can do really well, we are going there to win and I believe we can beat any Premier League side<br /><br /><b>[Mesut Ozil and <a href="sead-kolasinac.html">Sead Kolasinac</a> are also due to return to the squad after their security issues]</b> David Luiz brings a lot of experience and is a very comprehensive defender. <a href="dani-ceballos.html">Ceballos</a> is a very technical player and played excellently against Burnley, while Pepe is a player I know well from France. I think all three bring a lot of strength and positive aspects to the team</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s Matteo Guendouzi says he’s happy with his progress this season and that there’s more to come, but has also acknowledged he has a lot to learn]</b> I’m really happy with how things have gone. This last season has been extremely important to me in terms of how I’ve played and the progress I’ve made. I’m really satisfied with how the season has been. Now of course in terms of the season to come, I feel like I’ve got a lot to show. There’s a lot to learn too, in terms of the team dynamic and style of play. I feel like I need to work on my defensive and tactical positioning, being closer to the ball. It’s something that I’ve been working on in training but also by watching videos of myself as well as studying the stats, and working with the coaches on a programme<br /><br /><b>[The midfielder was fulsome in his praise for Emery, saying the former Sevilla boss has had an impact on his game and his life off the field]</b> Unai has really helped me, he gave me a lot of game time last season and this season as well. My relationship with him is really based on a mutual trust. He’s really invested a lot in my progress since I arrived at the club, which has been extremely important for me. He’s given me a lot of advice on and off the pitch, which is something that I really appreciate. We talk a lot and this has helped me grow on a personal level but also within the team</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal midfielder Matteo Guendouzi has revealed he was taking an afternoon nap when he was called up to the France squad for the first time]</b> I was having an afternoon nap, someone knocked at my door, but I didn’t hear it, because I was asleep. Then the coach. Sylvain Ripoll, rang me, he said it was me who knocked etc, so I went to see him directly. He said: ‘We need to speak, I really like you, but you need to go’. I was confused, I was like, where? He said: ‘The A team’. In my head I was like wow, I didn’t believe it initially because 10 minutes earlier I was sleeping. I thought I was still in a dream. Then the coach spoke to me some more, explained the situation that I was with the senior team and it’s a dream. Thankfully I took a shower after, so that it could properly sink in. I think the coach can describe my reaction better than I can, but my eyes popped out of my head. It is a big surprise for me today. This is a dream of mine since I was a kid. This is extraordinary, I think that any French player would want to be in this team. It is ginormous. There aren’t enough words to describe how it feels</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Guendouzi believes he has improved massively during his time at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and is determined to make the most of his big chance with France]</b> It was always a dream to be called up one day for the national team. I have played in all the youth teams since I was 16 years old. I have worked so hard to get here, with the France A team. It is maybe a bit of surprise that it has arrived so quickly but I knew that if I was performing with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, one of the biggest clubs in Europe, then I would have a chance. My chance is now and I want to take it<br /><br /><b>[Big things are now expected from a player with plenty of potential to still unlock]</b> I have a strong temper with a lot of determination. I believe in myself and in my qualities. I don’t take anything for granted because I know that only hard work pays off. That’s why I am here. I really feel that I have improved massively in the last year or so. Tactically, I am more mature, technically and physically, I have taken my game to the next level</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal midfielder Matteo Guendouzi has explained his ‘rugby tackle’ on <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> in the Gunners’ 2-2 draw with <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>]</b> I had to foul <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> at the end, otherwise he is through on goal on his own. I’m the last defender but I’m far from our goal as well. I had to do it. We really wanted to win the game, so we attacked a lot towards the end to get the third goal. We allowed spaces <b>[for Palace on the break]</b> but it’s because we really wanted to win<br /><br /><b>[Guendouzi insisted that it was not mental fragility that saw <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> throw away their advantage]</b> It’s not a mental issue. We didn’t manage to hold our advantage. We knew they were a good team, with individual quality, and they played well for their goals. <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Zaha</a> did well to get a penalty. It’s down to us to work so we win these kinds of matches after taking the lead. I’m not sure what happened on our disallowed goal. It’s like last Monday at Sheffield <b>[United]</b>. The ref didn’t check with VAR then on Sokratis and Saka. This time he checks, and it goes against us. I haven’t seen it again yet, but we lose two points because of that today and a point at Sheffield too</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s Matteo Guendouzi has claimed participating in karate as youngster has helped to improve his football skills]</b> I think it really helped me in terms of my mentality, being a fighter on the pitch, and always wanting to win and get stuck into duels in a bid to really help the team. Karate has helped me a lot in that regard. When I was young, I came third in a karate competition in France, which was great, but it was difficult to combine football and karate. I certainly have very fond memories from doing karate. In terms of flexibility. I’d say I’m more flexible on the pitch which is a great help. As for my fitness, karate is very intense, so I think that’s why I’m able to make such a big effort and have that warrior-like mentality</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Guendouzi says about Unai Emery]</b> Coach, Thank you for all that you have done for me, I would never be grateful enough. You made me grow up as a football player but also as a man. I have progressed enormously and you helped me to take many steps forward. If I reached those levels today it’s thanks to you and your huge work you have done for me. You are a great man and a great coach. I wish you a lot of happiness and success in your future projects. Thank you for everything coach</p>

  <p><b>[Guendouzi: Nobody knew who I was when I arrived at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> but expectations are high now]</b> The fans definitely expect different things from me now. Right at the beginning, last year, I arrived as a new player, a young player who had just arrived and who was unknown. Then, inevitably, my playing well from the beginning last year was something new but I was still seen as a young player and new player that they did not know. Now, I have shown them what I am capable of.<br /><br />I have shown them that I can help the team a lot. So it is normal that they now expect a lot more from me, especially as I have played a lot of games last season. Then, since the beginning of the season, I have started in numerous games so it is normal that they expect a lot from me. In any case, I will always try to meet <b>[those expectations]</b> on the pitch.<br /><br />I think that I have a certain status in the team now. I have been able to show that I can perform well so I now need to be consistent, always help the team, always give it my best and always play well on the pitch. I think I improved and that my level increased a lot this year. I really think that I have hit many milestones and moved up a good few notches. I am even better than last season. My objective is to always keep making progress and that is what I will do in the years to come, keep on improving so I can be the best</p>
