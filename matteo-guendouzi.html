  <p><b>[Arsenal have confirmed they have signed 19-year-old Matteo Guendouzi from Lorient]</b> Arsenal have always been the team closest to my heart and a side I’ve wanted to join since I was a child. gives me great pride - it’s incredible. I hope I can do great things here. It doesn’t get any better than coming to a club like this, with so much history, like Arsenal. I’m hugely proud. My hope is to become a top player here at Arsenal. A lot of great players have played here. I want to become part of the club’s history and to achieve great things here. I want to win titles, titles, titles. I want to establish myself here, which would be amazing. Winning silverware, as I said, is very important to me and winning things here at Arsenal would be incredible.<br /><br /><b>[On himself]</b> I’m a player who likes to get on the ball and use it. I like keeping possession and to play too. Playing the ball, linking up with my team-mates, battling for the team. I want to win every game - that’s really important to me. I’d say my main quality is keeping the ball and my passing</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Guendouzi insists Arsenal can win the Premier League this year despite Manchester City’s dominance last season]</b> Yes, I believe we can win it this season because of the players and staff we have. We truly believe and will do everything we can to win as many games as we can and to have a fantastic season. I truly believe we can do it. Man City are a top team but there are a lot of top teams in this division because the Premier League is the best league in Europe. There are plenty of others but we can be very positive and achieve good things this season. We can win titles because of the environment we have here and the quality of the players at our disposal.<br /><br /><b>[On Jeremie Aliadiere’s help]</b> It’s true there were a lot of clubs interested in me - I had talks with some of the biggest clubs in Europe. But as soon as I heard from Arsenal, the decision was very simple and I’m very happy to be here. I did speak to Jeremie about Arsenal and he said it’s a place where I can progress and learn a great deal from the staff here. It’s the club of my heart. There have been a lot of French players here and Thierry Henry is a symbol in France after his long career here. I used to watch Arsenal games with my father and it has a special place in my heart</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Guendouzi did not expect to be on Arsenal’s books at 19 years of age]</b> PSG was the club of my heart in France because I played there between the ages of six and 15. Growing up, I watched other teams and I fell in love with Arsenal. I wasn’t really interested in posters but I saw many, many videos. Players like Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira made me love the club and I dreamt of going there. When I see the Emirates and the statue of Henry, I think back to those videos. From the moment Arsenal made an approach, everything was clear for me. I’m not going to lie, I thought it would happen later in my career. But joining such a club at 19, any player would like that.</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Guendouzi has declared himself to be very happy with the start he has made at Arsenal]</b> I’m very happy about my start. After that, the most important thing for me is the team, we’re on a good run of 15 or 16 games without a loss, which is something we need to continue on. We’ve drawn the last three games in the league, but we’re a very solid team, and I hope we can do great things. There’s a really good togetherness in the group, and that’s why we’ve made a good start to the season. It really is everyone together. There’s no specific groups, and it shows on the pitch</p>

Maybe he can’t accept the fact that he chose to go back to short hair!<br /><br />I try to give my best each game. I didn’t start this game very well. I needed 20-30 minutes to get used to the intensity but after that it was great. I’m happy about what I did <b>[in the game]</b>. It’s true that we had many situations to score. We could have killed the game off later I think. United were efficient. They scored two goals that we could have avoided. We made some mistakes but we did a great game</p>

There were lots of discussions. But for me, the best choice was to join Arsenal. As soon as they approached me, I did not hesitate a single second and I concentrated solely on their proposition.</p>

  <p><b>[Matteo Guendouzi admits to having been left pleasantly surprised by his impact at Arsenal]</b> Let’s be honest, apart from the players here who follow a bit of the French leagues, no-one had ever heard of me! So it was very important for me to show what I was capable of as early as possible. I had a chance during the pre-season tour and I took it. I showed I could be part of this team. I still didn’t expect to play so much because I know I’m at a top club with great players. I’m a bit surprised that everything has been going so well. I’ve played well when I’ve featured. I think I showed that I could bring something to the team. I am very happy with how things have gone for me at the club so far and if I can keep playing as much in the second half of the season, it would be great.<br /><br /><b>[Guendouzi acknowledges that he owes Emery a debt of gratitude]</b> I owe him a lot because he has trusted me from the beginning. He has a lot of faith in me and it is boosting my confidence. To give so much playing time to a 19-year-old at Arsenal is rare. I always want to repay his faith by doing well on the pitch. I have much more to learn with him. We talk a lot, he gives me a lot of advice on my positioning, playing forward. I can feel how much better I am now compared to the start of the season. I know all the teams we face better. I know myself better and my game is stronger</p>

We’ve had a much better start as well - last year we started with two losses but this year we are already six points up. We have a better team overall and we’re feeling good about ourselves, we have a good team and we believe in ourselves.

This last season has been extremely important to me in terms of how I’ve played and the progress I’ve made. I’m really satisfied with how the season has been. Now of course in terms of the season to come, I feel like I’ve got a lot to show. There’s a lot to learn too, in terms of the team dynamic and style of play. I feel like I need to work on my defensive and tactical positioning, being closer to the ball. It’s something that I’ve been working on in training but also by watching videos of myself as well as studying the stats, and working with the coaches on a programme<br /><br /><b>[The midfielder was fulsome in his praise for Emery, saying the former <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> boss has had an impact on his game and his life off the field]</b> Unai has really helped me, he gave me a lot of game time last season and this season as well. My relationship with him is really based on a mutual trust. He’s really invested a lot in my progress since I arrived at the club, which has been extremely important for me. He’s given me a lot of advice on and off the pitch, which is something that I really appreciate. We talk a lot and this has helped me grow on a personal level but also within the team</p>

Then the coach. Sylvain Ripoll, rang me, he said it was me who knocked etc, so I went to see him directly. He said: ‘We need to speak, I really like you, but you need to go’. I was confused, I was like, where? He said: ‘The A team’. In my head I was like wow, I didn’t believe it initially because 10 minutes earlier I was sleeping. I thought I was still in a dream. Then the coach spoke to me some more, explained the situation that I was with the senior team and it’s a dream. Thankfully I took a shower after, so that it could properly sink in. I think the coach can describe my reaction better than I can, but my eyes popped out of my head. It is a big surprise for me today. This is a dream of mine since I was a kid. This is extraordinary, I think that any French player would want to be in this team. It is ginormous. There aren’t enough words to describe how it feels</p>

I have played in all the youth teams since I was 16 years old. I have worked so hard to get here, with the France A team. It is maybe a bit of surprise that it has arrived so quickly but I knew that if I was performing with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, one of the biggest clubs in Europe, then I would have a chance. My chance is now and I want to take it<br /><br /><b>[Big things are now expected from a player with plenty of potential to still unlock]</b> I have a strong temper with a lot of determination. I believe in myself and in my qualities. I don’t take anything for granted because I know that only hard work pays off. That’s why I am here. I really feel that I have improved massively in the last year or so. Tactically, I am more mature, technically and physically, I have taken my game to the next level</p>

I’m the last defender but I’m far from our goal as well. I had to do it. We really wanted to win the game, so we attacked a lot towards the end to get the third goal.

It’s down to us to work so we win these kinds of matches after taking the lead. I’m not sure what happened on our disallowed goal. It’s like last Monday at Sheffield <b>[United]</b>.

I haven’t seen it again yet, but we lose two points because of that today and a point at Sheffield too</p>

Karate has helped me a lot in that regard. When I was young, I came third in a karate competition in France, which was great, but it was difficult to combine football and karate. I certainly have very fond memories from doing karate. In terms of flexibility. I’d say I’m more flexible on the pitch which is a great help. As for my fitness, karate is very intense, so I think that’s why I’m able to make such a big effort and have that warrior-like mentality</p>

Right at the beginning, last year, I arrived as a new player, a young player who had just arrived and who was unknown. Then, inevitably, my playing well from the beginning last year was something new but I was still seen as a young player and new player that they did not know. Now, I have shown them what I am capable of.<br /><br />I have shown them that I can help the team a lot. So it is normal that they now expect a lot more from me, especially as I have played a lot of games last season. Then, since the beginning of the season, I have started in numerous games so it is normal that they expect a lot from me. In any case, I will always try to meet <b>[those expectations]</b> on the pitch.<br /><br />I think that I have a certain status in the team now. I have been able to show that I can perform well so I now need to be consistent, always help the team, always give it my best and always play well on the pitch. I think I improved and that my level increased a lot this year. I really think that I have hit many milestones and moved up a good few notches. I am even better than last season. My objective is to always keep making progress and that is what I will do in the years to come, keep on improving so I can be the best</p>
