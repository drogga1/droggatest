<blockquote>
  <p>LASK are a very good side, they were runners-up in the Austrian <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> last season. <a href="jesse-marsch.html">Jesse Marsch</a> made eight changes from the game against Genk, so to take a point after being 2-0 down against a team like LASK was a very good result. I think <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are definitely the favourites, but the people have hope; this is a really good Salzburg team, with confidence and a very strong mentality<br /><br />They have an amazing scouting system, signing players from Africa and Asia and all over the world, often lending them to <b>[feeder club]</b> FC Liefering and turning them into top players.<br /><br />Junozovic is a bit older than the others but a very good player, an Austrian international who played for a very long time with Werder Bremen in Germany. The goalkeeper Cican Stankovic recently made his debut for Austria and they also have a new Danish right-back called Rasmus Kristensen, who arrived from <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> in the summer.<br /><br />As for Szoboszlai, he is only 18 years old but in two years’ time he could be a €50million player.<br /><br />And Salzburg don’t just develop players, they develop coaches. <a href="marco-rose.html">Marco Rose</a> was a perfect coach for them, and he’s a good friend of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jürgen Klopp</a> <b>[having played under him at FSV Mainz]</b>.<br /><br />But then Rose joined Borussia Monchengladbach in the summer, and <a href="jesse-marsch.html">Marsch</a>, he has the same way and it’s been very good so far. He was at New York Red Bulls, so it’s all one system where these coaches are developed. They all have a similar mentality and a clear concept, it’s about pressing and attacking<br /><br /><b>[…]</b> We all had the thought, ‘It’s the end of Salzburg’ in the summer. But it’s not the end.</p>
