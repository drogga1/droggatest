  <p><b>[Karren Brady says <a href="benni-mccarthy.html">Benni McCarthy</a> was a ‘big, fat mistake’ for <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham United</a>]</b> <a href="benni-mccarthy.html">Benni McCarthy</a> was a big fat mistake. <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> were in desperate haste for a striker to help avoid relegation (again) and we bought him for more than £2 million only to have to repent at leisure.<br /><br />Rather than the super scorer we hoped for, we acquired a super size, a player devoted to filling his belly more than filling the net.<br /><br />As time went by he grew bigger and bigger and although in time he made a great effort to slim down, he’d passed the waistline of no return. A total of 14 games, 11 of them as a sub, and no goals, isn’t a statistic on which to base confidence in the future. So we cut our losses and let him go<br /><br /><b>[Brady highlighted the large amount of money McCarthy’s troubled stay cost the club, and the vice-chairman, compared him to <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a> who has failed to score at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> since joining them for £50 million in January]</b> When he comes to see me to sign the paperwork, he apologises for things not working out and gives me a hug. The overall cost to us is more than £5 million but in such circumstances you just have to say ‘no hard feelings, not everything in life goes the way you want’. sIt could be worse as across the river <a href="fernando-torres.html">Fernando Torres</a> at £50million, remains as thin as two yards of pumpwater and has not scored either</p>

That wasn’t there when my chairmen took over<br /><br />I was honoured to be invited to take part in the Leaders Sport Business Summit, where I was delighted to take the opportunity to speak about our unique football club.<br /><br /><a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham United</a> has a strong heritage and culture that are unique, not just in English but European and world football - characteristics that my joint-chairmen <a href="david-sullivan.html">David Sullivan</a> and <a href="david-gold.html">David Gold</a> recognised, first as fans and, since 2010, as owners and custodians of this special club.<br /><br />Those same characteristics are, I told the summit, the thing that sets <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> apart and what has made us so attractive and special to supporters beyond our core UK fan base. As I said, its not the stadium that makes the club, it’s the supporters.’<br /><br />That we have grown to be one of the biggest 15 clubs in world football is down to a wide variety of factors, all of which are rooted in our loyal, committed and ever-growing fan base, which now stretches across the globe</p>

Chelsea are in the same boat <b>[with Diego Costa]</b> and holding firm like us. My chairmen and the manager keep repeating they want to keep Payet. I can assure you they won’t be bullied into agreeing anything that is not in the best interests of WHU.</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham striker Marko Arnautovic’s future at the club remains unclear]</b> It’s the same with every player - their future at the club is determined by the manager. Not by the chairman, not by the board and certainly not by me. If he <b>[Manuel Pellegrini]</b> decides he wants him at the club and he wants to offer him a new contract, like he did a few months ago, then that’s what happens. The board support whatever decision he makes and that’s the way it should be.<br /><br />It’s never ending; we spent over £100 million ($127m) last summer. The transfers are always dealt with between our chairman David Sullivan and the manager directly. My role is much more in relation to the commercial side of the club; the stadium and so on. I know they have already had meetings, I know they’ve got a plan and I know they’ve got targets</p>

  <p><b>[Brady admits <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> all but own title]</b> It is a paradox that at a time football would be a great comfort to millions, it must not be played because, rightly, people’s health is our priority. What is going on in our country and the world is unprecedented and the game is not a necessity - like food or healthcare. But to millions upon millions of us, football’s disappearance from life is very relevant indeed. So, we all want it back in a hurry.<br /><br />There’s <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> to be decided although, obviously, not the title - which is all but owned by <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. But neither <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> nor the EFL have finished this season’s games. Plus, there is <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup, continental leagues, European competitions, European Championship and almost everything in between.<br /><br />The next <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> meeting is on Friday and the main topic of conversation will be when games can restart. When we - all <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs - last spoke, we agreed to get going again as soon as possible. And that games will run into July, if req­uired, to get this campaign finished. This is the plan. This is what we want to deliver.<br /><br /><b>[Brady also revealed eight <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> players went into self-isolation after showing mild symptoms of the virus]</b> Players are currently not in training and housebound to comply with social distancing rules currently in place until April 13, when we expect training to restart. And following further Government guidelines, we have eight <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> players in isolation. Although I am relieved to say they are all showing mild symptoms and, along with their families, seem to be well.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> vice-chairman Karren Brady insists that deferring players’ wages is a necessity, otherwise clubs will go out of business]</b> There is no matchday revenue, no sale of season tickets for next season, no retail outlets open and online retail businesses have closed as it is not essential work. With no date for restarting the league, this is having severe financial implications.<br /><br />Bearing in mind the majority of the broadcast revenue goes to pay the players’ wages it is unthinkable that the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> don’t seem to understand this. They seem to suggest that the players taking a pay cut means the money somehow goes into the owners pockets which is totally ridiculous.<br /><br />I applaud Andros Townsend’s tirade against people who make players out as ‘villains’ just as I dislike the <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> claim that a pay cut settlement will ‘only serve the shareholders’ interests’. The <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> may believe its responsibilities end with the players but they really don’t, they owe a great deal to the structure of professional football as well.<br /><br />No one wants to be having pay cut discussions with anyone because no one wants to be in this position.<br /><br />It is a global pandemic and extremely serious. And without any revenue - and no games being played - how on earth do we ensure the ongoing business survives? And, take it from me, unless a pay cut is put in place a number of clubs will be ruined<br /><br />This is not an easy time for anyone and we are not immune to the fact this will affect each of them differently. I wish there was another way but, without income and matches, there really isn’t. I for one will take the same cut as they will, after all we are all in this together</p>

  <p><b>[Brady criticises <a href="pfa.html">PFA</a> chief <a href="gordon-taylor.html">Taylor</a> over <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> wage cuts]</b> We have the players’ union chief executive <a href="gordon-taylor.html">Gordon Taylor</a> stubbornly resisting collective reaction to football’s Covid-19 crisis. I wonder why? Surely it is in the interests of his members from the elite to the everyday that as many clubs as possible remain intact. Keeping players’ jobs is one of his duties.<br /><br />Some have, rather nastily, suggested that it’s because his annual salary is a union world record £2.3m, which gives him earning power a 75-year-old working man can only dream of and he would face losing his ever-lasting job should he fail to replicate the contribution of his top players in his own wage packet.<br /><br />I don’t think this can be right as he has already said he is stepping down and has donated £500k of his own money to the cause. <a href="gordon-taylor.html">Taylor</a>’s no-cuts, no-deferral decision is deeply harmful to the cause he professes to serve, and now each club is having to have their own conversations with their own players. This will result in different outcomes for each club. Some clubs will defer/cut more than others, which seems unfair<br /><br /><b>[Brady had a stark warning for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs as the suspension of fixtures continues]</b> If this suspension goes on for months, eventually there will be grasping for any straws to try to prevent many more clubs from drowning. The prospect of this possibility is the reason why I have cut my own salary by 30 per cent, just as our manager <a href="david-moyes.html">David Moyes</a> has. We continue to work through all the questions and queries - the ifs, the buts, the maybes. But one thing I know is that if you try managing an apocalypse you can’t. You must have the foresight to plan for when things will return to normal, whatever ‘normal’ will mean in the future</p>

We have to ensure that training is as safe as it can be - and they have to agree</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> vice-chairman Karren Brady says <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> clubs will have to disinfect the grass they play on if play resumes]</b> The first and guiding <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> principle is that it will only recommence when it is safe to do so. Whatever you might be told, all 20 clubs are united in this objective. And it’s the first matter we must get right before we consider when the whistle will blow for kick-off on the final part of the most unfortunate season in football history. If lockdown is lifted and government and PHE (Public Health England) give us permission to resume non-contact training, there are to be new rules for players and staff. This includes not sharing cars, to limits through to the time a small group training session should last (75 minutes) and standing two metres away from each other. In this phase, tackling is prohibited but passing and shooting is allowed. We will also need to disinfect the corner flags, goalposts and even the grass - although how remains a mystery as that usually kills it<br /><br />The games will look and feel very different and there’s no getting away from the fact the final nine rounds of matches will be played in unusual circumstances. Clubs on the brink are understandably concerned about giving up home advantage, let alone playing without their vital 12th man - their supporters. The will to play is the essence of every club and player but they want a level playing field</p>
