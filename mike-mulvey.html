  <p><b>[Thai League club Police Tero have unveiled former A-League championship-winning coach Mike Mulvey as their new manager]</b> This is an opportunity that excites me because of the vision of the people involved and I share their excitement with what can be achieved. Right now the club is in mid-table, lost a few games, probably should have a few more points than it has, but my job now is to meet the players and gain their trust. You do that by working with them, speaking with them. So I’ll be doing that from tomorrow in our training camp and I’m really looking forward to it.</p>

  <p><b>[Mariners coach Mike Mulvey has been putting distance between the club and Usain Bolt]</b> Last week I asked the club to keep me at arm’s length with what was going on. I was briefed when we got back after the game, saying negotiations are ongoing and that’s basically the end of it. He’s not at training, I’m concentrating on the lads that we’ve got here who are focused on this game on the weekend, which is how it should be</p>

  <p><b>[Central Coast Mariners striker Ross McCormack has returned to parent club Aston Villa to have his knee injury looked]</b> We’ve decided to send Ross back to Aston Villa to check in with a specialist. We expect him back just before Christmas and the best situation we can see at this stage would be having Ross eligible for selection for our New Year’s Eve game against Perth Glory.</p>
