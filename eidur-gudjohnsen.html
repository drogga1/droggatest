  <p><b>[Iceland’s Eidur Gudjohnsen reflects on their win over England at <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> EURO 2016]</b> We had belief.

  <p><b>[Eidur Gudjohnsen drawing inspiration from <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> &amp; <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> as he embarks on coaching career]</b> I had already decided to do my coaching badges and then this, with the Under-21s, coincides with that. I get my experience while doing my badges as well. It is the perfect set-up really. It’s great. It gives me the experience to be on the pitch with good quality players. You try to take little bits from every manager and you try to mould it into your way of playing. Whether it is <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s man-management, <b>[Sam]</b> <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Allardyce</a> was vocal, direct and preached hard work, while <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> was about movement off the ball and possession<br /><br />Under <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, it was definitely the most attractive football I played, with the style of play. They have the players coming into their first team who have played a certain way since they were kids. They feel comfortable in the first team because they have been doing it since they were kids. They know exactly what the style is. If you want to come in as a manager and try to emulate that overnight, then I think you would be in trouble. I was also blessed to have <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Allardyce</a>. Over the course of my career, all the managers were people I have had great respect for. <a href="sam-allardyce.html">Allardyce</a> was slightly different in that he was more direct. He loved the passing game as well, but reminded us that it doesn’t always have to be pretty. My work-rate rose under him. I went to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and had <a href="gianluca-vialli.html">Gianluca Vialli</a> who signed me. <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Ranieri</a> came in and I learned a lot from him. These were the people who helped me as I grew as a player. At the end of the day, you can only use the players you have and play to their strengths. If you overthink things and try to play one certain way, then you have to have the players to do it<br /><br /><b>[Gudjohnsen enjoyed his most productive spell at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and although a lot of his former team-mates - including <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, <a href="claude-makelele.html">Claude Makelele</a> and <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a> - have returned to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> in backroom roles, the Iceland legend believes the time is not right for him to return]</b> If I said I was ready for it, I would be lying. I am just taking my first steps and I need to gain some experience. Eventually, what the future holds for me as a coach or manager is down to me and what effort I put into it. There is always more to learn. The game is developing so fast and you have to be on top of everything. For the future, who knows? At this moment, it has not crossed my mind. I have just started this and I have had my first qualifiers with the team. I have a lot to learn. I hope to go into something bigger in the future. I hope I get a big opportunity but I have to be ready for that step. I think it is great to see others get the chance. It shows that ex-players have great respect from the club and the fans. It is great that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are building this identity by bringing back ex-players. They are not only ex-players but they are people who really care for the club, who know what it means to be at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. It means a lot to them</p>

  <p><b>[Gudjohnsen backs <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>’s <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> youth revolution as he tips <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> &amp; <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> to shine]</b> It has not been the best of starts but that is to be expected. I think this year will be the perfect opportunity for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> as a club to mould the players, like they did with <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> who came in at a young age. <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Claudio Ranieri</a> played him constantly until he was the player he was. When <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Ranieri</a> signed him, <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>’s first season was pretty average. I think he would say that himself, but every season he grew. Once he played every game, then you could see him growing and becoming more important to the team. Then he became arguably the best player in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s history. It is an incredible record he had and it shows that if you are given the time, then you can reach the absolute top. Maybe this situation at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> not being able to sign players is a blessing in disguise. I think we have to be patient and not focus on results too much this year or where we are going to end up. Of course, a team like <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> should be pushing for at least a Champions League place. <br /><br />I think next season we will see the benefits of the experience that these players are going to get this season. All the youngsters excite me. The bad thing was that sometimes the young players wanted to leave <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because they didn’t believe in a first-team opportunity. <a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Loftus-Cheek</a> and <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Hudson-Odoi</a> got their chance. New players are coming in now. They have the feeling this is their time to shine. The players have a great opportunity. It is about developing and becoming the players that everyone expected them to be at a young age. I have the sense that Frank will do the same with Abraham, Mount and <a href="fikayo-tomori.html">Tomori</a>. He is fearless to give them confidence and believing in them to play. If he is given the time to do that, then I think the benefits from that will be bigger than just focusing on results this year</p>

  <p><b>[Eidur Gudjohnsen feels <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> would have been a brilliant signing for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> as his arrival would have taken some weight off <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>’s shoulders]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is still the top player at the moment. If he has an injury, as we have seen at the start of the season, then <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> can be someone to step in. With <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, that might be more of that thinking, even though it didn’t happen. I think <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are looking to other players to take the pressure off <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. How can we have other players around him to draw attention in a different direction. As soon as your attention goes off <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, he pops up and scores you a few goals. They went through a period where all the attention was on him and he was the man who had to do everything. When Suarez and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> came in, that took some of the attention off him and freed him up even more. That was probably the best strike force of <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> or in modern-day football. It was lethal. I think <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> will always challenge anyway. They have <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a>, <a href="ousmane-dembele.html">Ousmane Dembele</a> and Suarez. Good players like <a href="gerard-pique.html">Gerard Pique</a> at the back. They have great talent and as long as they keep them at a high level, they will be difficult to beat. Whether they can reach the heights of a few years back? It is difficult to say. There’s a lot of teams across Europe getting stronger but <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> are always a team to watch out for. Not only the way they play, but when you have <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> in your team, you always stand a chance<br /><br /><b>[Gudjohnsen added of Messi]</b> Without a doubt, I knew it. Everyone in the dressing room knew it. Everyone around the club knew it. You could simply see that this guy was exceptional. He is getting a little older so he might not be as quick as he was. He has become more clever and picks his moments. He might play a bit deeper on the pitch but look at his stats, it doesn’t affect him. It is almost a bad season when he scores 30+ goals. That is almost ridiculous. It is all about how you get the best out of him. You mould the team around him and make players realise that they have to do the dirty work for him. He will always allow your team to win a football match</p>

  <p><b>[Gudjohnsen slams ‘disrespectful’ <a href="ross-barkley.html">Barkley</a> after <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> penalty miss. <a href="ross-barkley.html">Barkley</a> immediately stepped up to take the kick despite the presence of regular takers <a href="jorginho.html">Jorginho</a> and <a href="willian.html">Willian</a> on the pitch, with the latter in particular appearing to protest his call]</b> It’s almost disrespectful to your team-mates to do something like what <a href="ross-barkley.html">Ross Barkley</a> did this evening. I’m pretty sure it’s clear who is the penalty taker before the game. Just to create all the fuss, the tension between your team-mates and yourself and then go on to miss the penalty, you just put yourself under so much more pressure than actually just taking a penalty<br /><br />If you’re the manager in a situation like this where you’ve got one, two, three, four players standing over the ball, and there is a question on who is going to take the penalty, don’t you want your captain to step in and say, ‘Listen, it’s been decided before the game who is the penalty taker’?<br /><br />Show that authority as the captain to make the decision for everyone who’s on the pitch</p>
