  <p><b>[Lautaro backed to shine with <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> &amp; Suarez at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> as former coach says he’s already one of the world’s best]</b> In February we went to play a tournament in Mar del Plata and he scored nine goals in six games. Normally you need to wait for a period of adaptation but you could see that he was very good because he stood out from the first moment. Manuel Fernandez was a magnificent coach for him at Racing. He emphasised improving his attributes and correcting little mistakes that young forwards make. Still, Lautaro already had the raw materials - he’s a player that we call ‘A’ Class. There are those who say that he looks like Kun (Sergio Aguero) but I see more of a similarity with <a href="diego-milito.html">Diego Milito</a> or Juan Eduardo Esnaider. He’s great technically and has incredible power but he looks like <a href="diego-milito.html">Milito</a> with how he moves, how he feints and plays with his back to goal. We’re talking about an elite player that, although he may look like <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> when he’s driving with the ball, Lautaro has the advantage over him with his aerial game<br /><br /><b>[Radaelli believes the Inter star should already be considered amongst the best in the business]</b> <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Mauro Icardi</a> is one of the best strikers in the world and <b>[Lautaro]</b> replaced him very well. He was summoned to a national side where <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> and <a href="mauro-icardi.html">Icardi</a> had already been, forwards with impressive careers, and he just does it. We’re talking about one of the best strikers in the world. What caught my attention the most - because we already saw him play with his back to goal and hold the ball up - is the power that he has acquired. He gives the feeling that he’s walking all over his rivals in one-on-one situations, dragging them around, and achieving that at a superlative level. At 22, he has accomplished what others would find dizzying over a 15-year career<br /><br />In Argentina, we feel devotion to Leo because he can make everyone play better. Lautaro can grow a lot with him - also because he would have competition with <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> <b>[if he moves to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b>. There could be many combinations between the three of them. Lautaro and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> played with <a href="sergio-aguero.html">Aguero</a> for Argentina - I think it would be similar</p>

  <p><b>[Fabio Radaelli says <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> could prove to be the perfect place for <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a>]</b> I believe that those of such quality can play anywhere. Lautaro is a player for the big leagues. I liked it when he went to Inter, I felt that he was going to an ideal place because there is <a href="javier-zanetti.html">Javier Zanetti</a>, who works very well, I know him and I know the human quality he has because we were partners at Banfield. With him, Lautaro was going to feel content but the truth is that when one is linked with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, ​​a club related purely and exclusively to <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, a player from another planet, it seems that one forces themselves to go there<br /><br />At Racing, in two years he scored 50 goals, at Inter he got 26 in one year. Imagine if he goes to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and he will be in a team where <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> leaves you alone at any time, where there is <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>, with whom he can also play. It seems to me that Spain is a league in which defensively they give you advantages that you don’t have in Italy because they are more rigorous there, so perhaps <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is the perfect place for him<br /><br />He is a winner, with a barbaric character, he plays very well with both feet, he is intuitive because the ball goes inside the area and falls to him not by chance but because of his intuition and ability. He has a great aerial game, for me he is an animal of the area. It seems to me that he will always be linked to the great teams and undoubtedly spend the next 10 years in the national side</p>
