  <p><b>[The Argentina icon’s lawyer says <a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a> is close to taking charge of Gimnasia]</b> He’s very happy. It’s been a while since he was taken into consideration to coach in Argentine football. His intention is to lead and that of the president is that he be in charge. The fans sent him love through the <b>[social]</b> networks. We are on a positive path. Only formal procedures remain. We have to close it quickly because the matches are immediate … <b>[on Thursday]</b> at 11 we will get together. There is an 80 per cent chance</p>

  <p><b>[Earlier on Wednesday, <a href="diego-maradona.html">Diego Maradona</a> posted on Instagram that he had not been in contact with anyone at Gimnasia about the position]</b> I want to clarify that I did not receive or reject any proposal from Argentine teams, as they are saying. I had no official contact with any club. I am in good health and of course it would be an honour for me to lead in my country</p>

  <p><b>[Diego <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> has pledged to work with all of his heart and soul for Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata after taking over as the club’s head coach]</b> Finally, now it is official. I’m very happy to be the new coach of Gimnasia. I want to thank president <a href="gabriel-pellegrino.html">Gabriel Pellegrino</a> for this opportunity and I want to tell the fans that I will work with all my soul and heart for El Lobo. A hug and thank you very much!</p>

  <p><b>[The club’s president <a href="gabriel-pellegrino.html">Gabriel Pellegrino</a> believes <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>’s appointment is the boost Gimnasia require following their poor start]</b> I have a huge satisfaction because I found a father figure for the club. We talked about the details and he was constantly talking about the fans. It’s all positive. We are in a difficult time and we need someone really strong. We thought of him, we called him and he was the first to say that he wanted to take care of this moment for Gimnasia</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> leaves Gimnasia after just two months at the helm]</b> I spoke with him yesterday and he told me that if there was unity, he would continue, but that failed. We informed him and he did not want to continue. <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>, <b>[his assistant Sebastian]</b> Mendez and his coaching staff were men of their word. We arrived together and we left together. He was more up to the task than us as leaders<br /><br /><b>[He explained the reasons behind <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a>’s departure in more detail]</b> <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> stopped working today, he’s no longer Gimnasia’s head coach. <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> worked in a collective scheme. He said he was here to add, not to rest. He’d love to continue, but he wants unity. It just didn’t happen. Today’s meeting failed. There will be elections on Saturday. <b>[Diego]</b> <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> gave his will and he gave his time. He had an enormous will. There will be elections on Saturday and <b>[the candidates]</b> will look for a head coach</p>
