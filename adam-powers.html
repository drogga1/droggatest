  <p><a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> was handed his debut by <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> in February 2016, scoring twice against Midtjylland in the Europa League, which was followed by a brace in his <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> bow the ensuing weekend. <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">Louis van Gaal</a> was fired at the end of the 2015/16 campaign and replaced by <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>, who <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> then played under for two-and-a-half years.<br /><br />The former <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> manager constantly defended his use of <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> during his tenure.
