<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Orlando Pirates club chairman Irvin Khoza has revealed that they will announce a new head coach next week Monday]</b> Next week Monday we will be announcing a new coach. We were restricted to do so in January by prohibitive buy-out clauses. It’s not easy to find a coach for the Club, and even less so when people you are looking for are held by contract obligations. The coach we were looking for, that we promised to announce in January is now available in May. We won’t wait that long.<br /><br />It’s easy to point fingers at Augusto Palacios because we are losing. You forget that he delivered us trophies when he came as a buffer. Palacios is a Professor. That’s why he must guide us. Complaining of things you should be controlling shows your shortcomings. You need to factor in different things when you release a player. There needs to be a fuller understanding in these things. I don’t buy the story that Palacios is complaining about discipline in the team. If there’s a problem then he must fix it.</p>
