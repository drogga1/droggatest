  <p><b>[West Brom chairman John Williams hailed Grzegorz Krychowiak for his impressive European resume]</b> This is a fantastic loan agreement for Albion and we are very pleased to have completed the transfer. Grzegorz arrives with an impressive reputation that is well-earned and a CV in European football which clearly displays his qualities.

  <p><b>[West Brom’s chairman, John Williams, said Regis was the a ‘crusader against bigotry’ and the ‘ultimate hero’ of Albion fans. His statement in full reads]</b> This is terribly shocking and upsetting news and our thoughts and condolences are with Cyrille’s family. We also know Cyrille’s passing will be felt deeply among all our supporters for whom he was the ultimate hero - a wonderful, exciting centre-forward who remained in close contact with the Club beyond his playing days. Everyone will have their precious memories of him as a family man, as a crusader against bigotry - which can never be under-estimated - and as a man who threw considerable energy into a series of worthy causes. But for me, I will never forget Cyrille the footballer - a wonderful, wonderful player who had everything and who defenders of the time would have hated facing. He will be deeply missed. Rest in peace, Cyrille</p>
