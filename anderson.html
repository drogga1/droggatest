  <p><b>[Former Golden Boy and <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> midfielder Anderson retires at 31]</b> Anderson spent the camp period very well, but was not involved in squad planning. Anderson got a job, he went to work and decided to quit football. Anderson reduced his contract which was €600,000 for this season to €200,000. Anderson will continue to work at our club. I think it will be especially effective in our foreign relations</p>

  <p><b>[After starting an attack straight after the penalty, Anderson drew a foul down the left flank. The subsequent free-kick was taken quickly, allowing Anderson to cut in ahead of two defenders and slot the ball home in the 16th minute of added time]</b> It was the best match of my life. My team-mates truly had faith in me and told me I was going to score the goal which would make us win<br /><br /><b>[He had lost his father in 2001 and seen many old friends fall victim to drug use. He already knew how rough life could be]</b> I became used to being a man very young. When I was 15, I was already thinking as if I was 22, 23 or 24 and making very tough decisions about my future. I had to help the family and that I still do today and hope to be able to until I am 60. Football helped me out in my life. I can tell you that from my first group of friends, only two or three are still alive. All the others passed away, mostly from drug addiction or being involved in drug dealing. I took the path of joy and happiness<br /><br /><b>[Despite his questionable output, Anderson remained a favourite of Ferguson. The feeling was mutual too]</b> He’s the god of football. I played through injuries for him, stayed on the pitch when my legs were cut. He looked after players so well. I felt that he cared for me. I can’t thank that man enough for what he did for me. He trusted me in big games when I was 18</p>
