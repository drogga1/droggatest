It’s hard to explain but there was a great motivation for the first game and only a normal amount for the second. We have only scored the goal by chance. Once we got the goal we have stopped, we played slowly to feet and without any depth. We can not defend anyone, we played a little football but when it came to coordinating the three main issues of football - defending, creating and finishing - we have not done so.<br /><br /><b>[David De Gea was preferred to Iker Casillas in goal]</b> He is a mature guy and I had no fears that he would fail</p>

I hope we can reach that standard again. We come here at an ideal time. We’ll play with complete courage and interest in the game. Ukraine are looking to qualify but, as sportsmen, we have to try to stop them.<br /><br />We come to Kiev having qualified but that doesn’t mean we’re not motivated for tomorrow. I’ve decided the starting XI and there will be changes from Logrono. I think it’s the best that we can do. Paco Alcacer will start. He’s on a good run of form and we need to take advantage of that. Nolito opens up the space and gives us good depth. He’s able to help us unlock tight defences. Ukraine are a strong team. They have good width</p>

It is good to look at other players and ensure that they can help us. It will be a problem to choose just 23 players for Euro 2016, but there’s still a long way to go until then. We have solutions and that offers plenty of encouragement, because we have to see the options ahead of the Euros. The experience was a good one with all the changes we were able to make. We are happy. It is true we had more control of the game but they had their chances, with Andriy Yarmolenko and Yevhen Konoplyanka on the counter-attack. Ukraine played really well. David de Gea was great - so was Thiago Alacantara.</p>

I think it is similar with Iker Casillas when he was booed by <b>[Real Madrid]</b> fans last season. I don’t give it much importance. I don’t know why he has been booed.

I will have been the national team coach for eight years and I do not intend to cling on to the post. My greatest desire is for us to go out on a high. I could have retired a long time ago, but I wanted to serve my time just like your average Spaniard and work to the age at which most Spaniards retire. I consider myself privileged to have had the chance to enjoy my biggest passion, football, as a career. Right now, when the time for me to retire does not appear far away, I’m not looking to the future.</p>

We’ll see what happens with Saul Niguez.<br /><br />At the moment I don’t see myself on the bench at the World Cup in Russia, but there’s a lot of time to arrange a possible natural replacement. I have an excellent relationship with all the people in the Spanish Football Federation. I’ll be where they ask me to be. I don’t want to go against a majority opinion.

All goalkeepers make mistakes, it’s impossible not to. <b>[He]</b> doesn’t normally face a lot of shots <b>[and it]</b> requires more concentration<br /><br /><b>[Del Bosque hinted Athletic Bilbao’s Aritz Aduriz and Paco Alcacer of Valencia could make his squad]</b> Many Spaniards are scoring goals. Aduriz is fantastic and Alcacer has not lost his eye for goal. We will look to forwards who have had a good season and complement what we want. I would not say there are three teams that are very good because a few others are having excellent season, making it a very tight league, which is what you want.</p>

But for some reason he has not yet found the necessary regularity and it’s not the fault of his coach <b>[Massimiliano Allegri]</b>. The player has his own responsibility. I don’t know if he lacks belief. He is a nice guy, he’s not spoiled, he is humble and quiet and this is an important thing. He lacks consistency in games. We hope he finds it both with Juventus and with us. He needs to appear more during games.</p>

  <p><b>[Spain head coach Vicente del Bosque has tipped hosts France as the biggest threats to his team’s defence of their European crown this year]</b> There are many rivals and there is no clear favourite. If I have to only say one name, I would say France because they are playing at home. All the seeded teams can win. One thinks of Italy, Belgium, England, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, but it sure appears that someone else will find the right form. It is a short tournament with 24 teams, so it will be unpredictable.<br /><br />No, Italy have not found a world-class striker, however, but they remain a difficult team to face. Italy’s defensive structure is that of his <b>[Conte’s]</b> Juventus side and that is the basis of everything. Frankly, I do not see big differences between this and <b>[Cesare]</b> Prandelli’s Italy</p>

  <p><b>[Spain coach Vicente del Bosque has dismissed suggestions Barcelona and Real Madrid have been trying to convince him not to use any of their players]</b> It is absolutely not true that some clubs have been pressuring us not to use their players in these friendlies. Absolutely no-one, from no club whatsoever. Not from one of the big clubs, nor someone from one of the small clubs. It infuriates me when I read stuff like that. We have never received any recommendations not to call up or field any players. In Busquets’ case, he was sent home because of a problem with his finger. We all saw what happened in the match against Villarreal. As for Iniesta, he is not in the squad because of a minor problem. He could not play for Barcelona against Villarreal either.<br /><br />You are always aiming for the best, which is the title. We want to achieve the best thing possible, without losing sight of reality. The differences between the various teams are very small. We will be defending the title we won four years ago against Italy. That final was probably our best game</p>

Whatever I decide will in no way harm the federation or the national team.<br /><br />We have two months ahead of us to decide which strikers make the squad.

Everyone who shows us that we can not leave them out will come with us.<br /><br />We have a great responsibility and past events give you a great responsibility.

Our objective is to think further than the two European Championships we’ve won, because people are only going to value what we do in the next one. For some it will be their last big tournament and for others the first and to get that mix you can’t look back nor forward. We have to live in the immediate present.<br /><br />Diego Costa is among the established players whose place is under threat, with young stars such as Alvaro Morata and Paco Alcacer breaking through, while experienced pair Fernando Torres and Aritz Aduriz have enjoyed stellar seasons. Diego can be judged on whether he plays well or not but he hasn’t committed any crime - his conduct with us has always been correct. There have been some episodes which haven’t been edifying, but he has always shown a great attitude with us and we appreciate that</p>

  <p><b>[Vicente del Bosque on Silvio Gazzaniga’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup trophy]</b> It is curious because when Silvio Gazzaniga died I was at Las Rozas looking at a picture of both of us with the trophy in 2010. He was so old when we took the picture and a member of <a href="rfef.html">RFEF</a> press staff told me he was just died. I felt so sad<br /><br />He built the most important and interesting trophy there has ever been. What this trophy means is something absolutely symbolic, especially to us Spanish; we have been true football lovers for a long time but we never were able to win the World Cup before<br /><br />It was weird for us - with a huge football tradition. It wasn’t normal. But having this trophy in the hands is something unique. When I had the trophy for the first time in my hands I felt like we finally accomplished our mission after a lot of years; I think it is going to be very difficult for another Spanish team to win and we all are proud after being the first ones to avoid quarter-final damnation in a lot of decades and the first ones to win it.</p>

  <p><b>[100 matches &amp; seven trophies - the secrets of Zidane’s success at Real Madrid]</b> We enjoyed his talents as a player very much in Spain. But I didn’t see him excessively worried with tactical matters, with coaching. He wasn’t like other players that you perhaps note that they have it in them. He was quiet and respectful.<br /><br />He has done everything in a phenomenal way: from his communication plan, the way he works with the player and also in his sporting strategy</p>

  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid manager Vicente Del Bosque insists that no Liverpool player would get into Los Blancos’ team]</b> Real Madrid have a great squad, and it’s the best club in Europe right now. They have to ratify that on Saturday. Real Madrid will beat Liverpool 4-1. I cannot find a single Liverpool player that improves Real Madrid, <b>[not even]</b> Salah. <b>[Gareth]</b> Bale and <b>[Karim]</b> Benzema are very good. Benzema is a great player too, sometimes <b>[he can go]</b> cold, but he has given an extraordinary performance, and Cristiano Ronaldo makes them all better..</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo was wrong to steal the headlines by hinting at a Real Madrid exit in the wake of their historic Champions League triumph]</b> It did not seem right to me. Maintaining good personal relationships within a group is important and his words did not help. The best ones have to be the most generous in relation to others.<br /><br />The national team are one of the favourites in the World Cup, as well as Portugal and Argentina, who have Cristiano and Messi</p>

  <p><b>[Former Spain and Real Madrid head coach Vincente del Bosque believes Isco must show exemplary behavior when he is left out of the team]</b> Isco? The coach must do his homework and the player must know when he is playing and when he does not play, he must know how to behave in an exemplary manner within a group.<br /><br />For all clubs, when they have to put a new coach is one of the more delicate things. There’s always disorder. Either <b>[Lopetegui or Solari]</b> can lead the team, but this is very bad because it is a lack of belief in the coach</p>

  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid boss Del Bosque rates Barcelona star above Ronaldo]</b> He <b>[Messi]</b> almost always plays well. There are players who never do it wrong. He has an impressive regularity. He is a great player. I’m staying with Messi. I see a more natural soccer player, from his time in the neighbourhood, playing with friends on the street. Even so, Cristiano has extraordinary courage, with physical and technical conditions as a great scorer, but I’m staying with Messi.<br /><br />He <b>[Ronaldo]</b> is a player who guarantees many goals and now it is harder for Madrid to score them. Even so, there are other very good players, like Bale, who is a special boy with great conditioning, or Benzema, which has been badly spoken about but has fantastic qualities</p>

  <p><b>[Vicente del Bosque defended the standard of Spanish football after La Liga clubs missed out on European success]</b> Well, if you saw the last 20 years, the Spanish clubs have won 50 per cent of the Champions League titles. Also, we’ve had very good performances of Sevilla and Atletico, who win the Europa League. Villarreal, Deportivo La Coruna and others contributed to a great hegemony of Spanish football during the past two decades</p>
