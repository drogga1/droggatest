  <p><b>[Vicente del Bosque on his Spain squad heading into <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> EURO 2016]</b> The list is not perfect, we are sure that there are players who deserve to be here by their great season, but I leave it clear that I have no sympathy when choosing. I am fully confident that we have the best group. Now we must prepare in the best way. There are 11 or 12 that were not in Brazil, which speaks well of the renewal we are having and what we want is to adapt. We have no obligation to be champion, but we dream that we could</p>

  <p><b>[Vicente del Bosque on Silvio Gazzaniga’s <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> World Cup trophy]</b> It is curious because when Silvio Gazzaniga died I was at Las Rozas looking at a picture of both of us with the trophy in 2010. He was so old when we took the picture and a member of <a href="rfef.html">RFEF</a> press staff told me he was just died. I felt so sad<br /><br />He built the most important and interesting trophy there has ever been. What this trophy means is something absolutely symbolic, especially to us Spanish; we have been true football lovers for a long time but we never were able to win the World Cup before<br /><br />It was weird for us - with a huge football tradition. It wasn’t normal. But having this trophy in the hands is something unique. When I had the trophy for the first time in my hands I felt like we finally accomplished our mission after a lot of years; I think it is going to be very difficult for another Spanish team to win and we all are proud after being the first ones to avoid quarter-final damnation in a lot of decades and the first ones to win it.</p>

Whilst I’ll say he is a brilliant player, I don’t think very highly of him for other reasons<br /><br />With <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> he did not behave well, in fact he behaved badly, very badly.
