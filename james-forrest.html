  <p><b>[Brendan Rodgers’ links to Arsenal and other big clubs comes as no surprise to James Forrest]</b> The manager has been different class for me and for a lot of the other boys as well. Since he has come in he has given us all confidence and made sure we’ve all been working hard and that’s what we’ve done. I think we’ve done really well since he came in winning trophies, winning cups and we want to keep progressing and hopefully we can keep doing that. He’s done a great job himself, he’s getting linked to big clubs and that’s only a good thing for Celtic and him personally. Obviously the players and everyone associated with the club wants him to stay and we hope that happens<br /><br />We just take it a game at a time, we want to make sure we tie up the league as quickly as we can now and obviously look forward to the cup final. We want to do that, it would be incredible if we could do that, but we know that it is going to be difficult and Motherwell will make it hard for us. There is always pressure at Celtic in every game. There’s pressure to win trophies, to win cups and it is always going to be the case</p>

He played for Scotland at an early age and he has already captained Scotland as well. KT loves playing for his country but he was out for a while and is just getting back in the fold at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I think Scotland and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> will both want what is best for KT. The main thing for him is just to keep doing what he’s doing at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and be ready for the Nations League play-off games in March</p>
