  <p><b>[It was <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s £30 million flop, <a href="andriy-shevchenko.html">Andriy Shevchenko</a>, who helped him through those tough early months as he soon got to grips with life in London and the Premier League]</b> I can’t forget what Andriy did. He really helped me. He tried to give me confidence. He told me about the style of play in England, what I had to do as a defender and where I could improve</p>

  <p><b>[Ivanovic leaves <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to join Zenit]</b> I can say I’m very happy to come here, and to be at a big club like <a href="zenit-st-petersburg.html">Zenit</a>, I hope together we’ll have success. I had a very big hope to come back to Russia and to play here. I am motivated and I think that I can play for many more seasons at the top level. I can say that I am excited to be here and everything went smoothly. I am happy just to play. I am happy in the centre or on the right. That’s probably a question for the manager but I am happy to play in any position</p>

  <p><b>[Ivanovic says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> can be the best again, but they need Abramovich back at Stamford Bridge]</b> This is a new <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team. The club didn’t have the perfect season last year, but still finished third.<br /><br /><a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> need Roman Abramovich back. That’s the most important thing for all the fans. We want to see him at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>, then <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will be among the best teams in Europe once again.<br /><br />He’s been one of the most important people in my career, and I appreciate everything he’s done for me. Whenever I had a difficult moment at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, he always believed in me. I owe him a lot.<br /><br /><b>[His former manager <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> later referred to him as one of the club’s best ever signings, a compliment he took with pleasure]</b> When the greatest manager in <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> history, and one of the best managers ever, says that, it means a lot. I’m lucky I had the opportunity to work with him. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> was the best part of my career and a massive part of my life. I was so happy in London and am proud to have been there for such a long time<br /><br /><b>[Ivanovic understood his struggles - and thinks the culture shock played a part in the frosty relationship between manager and fanbase]</b> I’m not saying he struggled because he was a new manager in a new country, but it’s so difficult to learn, adapt and understand English football. Everyone who comes to England has difficulties at the start. It’s hard for the players to adapt and react to a new coach, too</p>

  <p><b>[Branislav Ivanovic reflects on getting to befriend one of his idols in Andriy Shevchenko]</b> When I was young I was part of the <a href="andriy-shevchenko.html">Sheva</a> generation. He was one of my idols, one of my favourite players. When I came to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, met him and saw what a good person he is, I was obsessed with him. Because of the language, he was next to me all the time. I learned everything from him, every training session and even off the pitch. He couldn’t play on that level in England and when I arrived he was already near the end of his career. I was so happy to have an opportunity in life to be his friend</p>
