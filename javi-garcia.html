<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Javi Garcia says <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> now boast the best players in the world]</b> I spent two years at City and it’s true that we noticed the difference in the transition from Mancini to <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Pellegrini</a>. I will always be grateful to Mancini, who was the one who signed me (but) their ideas about football were a bit different. With <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Pellegrini</a>, City began to forge an identity, which was to have much more of the ball, to attack more, to have the ball a lot of time in the opponents’ half of the pitch and, yes, it is true that the current City began there. Lately, City started to sign practically the best players in the world, players to whom you have to give the ball to because they are happy with it and they can show their full potential<br /><br />What City have achieved is outstanding. As I mentioned before, the English league is the most difficult one. Being able to win it two times (in successive years) like City did is incredible. Maybe people out there do not give it the credit it deserves, but, in my opinion, City have to be very proud of what they have achieved. Winning is never easy, to keep winning is even more difficult and demanding</p>
