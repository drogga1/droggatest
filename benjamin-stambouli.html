<blockquote>
  <p>[Stambouli on life as Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s team-mate] We were at physiotherapy and news was on TV. Zlatan asked me to translate it because there was something about him on. So I explained that they said that Zlatan is the King of Paris. I thought he would be happy about it, because it’s great that the people love him so much. But he was different. He was very angry and shouted at me: ‘What the f***? I’m not the king, I’m god’. This guy is totally crazy<br /><br />His character, his strength on the pitch and his leadership. He is an incredible person that reads situations faster than everybody else. Zlatan is very clever and tests you in every situation, only to analyse you. He loves to play things with you and is able to control some people this way<br /><br />Zlatan wants to win every single time. It doesn’t matter if it’s on the pitch or when we try to throw plastic bottles into the bin. Zlatan would do everything to win. When he was at PSG he was the king of Paris and had already won a lot of trophies, but he was still hungry to win. He wants to win every day and wants to win everything you can win<br /><br />I talked to him about life in general, friendship and life as a professional footballer,” he said. “When you’re a famous footballer you have many false friends. Zlatan explained to me that you should not pay for everything for your friends. It’s not good for them if you buy them expensive clothes or take them to the best clubs. It doesn’t make them happy for long. If your friend is worth it, you should use the network you’ve got as a footballer and try to get him a job. It makes people much happier if they earn their own money</p>
