  <p><b>[Luton saw their hopes of survival improve with a shock 1-0 victory at 10-man <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> thanks to a second-half header from striker James Collins]</b> We thoroughly deserved it. To come here as the away side and with <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> flying high means it’s a wonderful result. We had belief we could stay up before we came into this game, but we have to instil it with results. Results rubber-stamp the belief and that’s what today will do<br /><br />If we had no belief, why come here? I could have stayed in my garden and had a barbecue. We believed we have enough in this squad. Now, we have to pick up the points to prove that. We came here to win. As an away performance from a team at the bottom of the league, it was an outstanding display. <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> have a front four as good as anything at this level, so we had to be tight and subdue them. We did that</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> extended their lead at the top of Championship but by only one point after being held 1-1 at home against relegation battlers Luton]</b> It’s a great point. I’d have liked to have been a little bit more penetrative, but I’d have taken that. This is the hardest place to come to in the league. These are the best side in the league for me. They come at you, they are relentless, they know what they are doing, they’ve got good players and structurally they are superb, they’ve been together for two years - and it’s a great point</p>

  <p><b>[Yakou Meite scored four goals, including a first-half hat-trick, as Reading heaped further pressure on struggling Luton with a thumping 5-0 win at Kenilworth Road]</b> We’ve had two massive away games where we’ve had to put in real shifts - at <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> to win the game, then <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a>, and that has taken its toll. We were flat today and defensively they probably had six chances and scored five<br /><br />We were just really, really flat. We lacked energy, we lacked real drive in our performance and I can only put that down to the effort put in. It’s very difficult for me to really have a go at them, I’m bitterly disappointed. These were opportunities these home games, but to be fair they’ve given me everything and it showed today that they probably lacked that little bit of energy from the exertion they’ve had over the last week</p>

  <p><b>[A late goal by Barnsley substitute Aapo Halme saw the Tykes salvage an important point at Luton in the battle of the Championship’s bottom two teams]</b> I’m disappointed because of the lateness of their goal and how it came about, because I couldn’t see them scoring. You always fear the worst as a manager but I couldn’t see them scoring, I really couldn’t. First half we gave them a little bit too much space and we didn’t get close enough to them to meet balls in our box, but in the second half I thought we were excellent. Tactically we were really good, it’s just late on, it came from a corner, that’s the really frustrating thing. And then having the best chance of the game straight after to win it, you’re just frustrated then. You want to hold out and make sure you win the game, I thought we were a lot better in the second half and just disappointed that we didn’t hold out</p>

  <p><b>[Luton moved off the bottom of the Championship table and to within two points of safety after a 2-0 win at <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a>]</b> The result is everything but the performance, I thought, was magnificent. To come here against a side who were in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> last year and do what we did to them, I thought that was excellent. It’s a massive win<br /><br />We’re disappointed because if we hadn’t conceded late against Barnsley it would be even more interesting. I know it’s a cliche but all we can do is play the games in front of us and pick up the points that we need to pick up. This is a group that gives me everything, with the honesty and the desire to do well. You can’t ask for anything more.</p>

  <p><b>[Luton missed the chance to move out of the Championship relegation zone as they were held to a 1-1 draw by QPR]</b> They’re a very difficult side to play against. They had the luxury of some wonderful, wonderful players and were able to experiment being on 53 points.<br /><br />They caused us problems in terms of being able to press, so we had to stay solid and make sure we didn’t concede, then I probably made changes a little bit too late, but it’s another point. We have got to make sure that we are in games to win them, and at the minute we are giving ourselves an opportunity, we are picking up points every game and that’s all we can do</p>
