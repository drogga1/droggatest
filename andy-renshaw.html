  <p><b>[<a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> stars walking fitness tightrope as football returns]</b> It is going to be a really challenging time. There will be a lot of pressure on medical staff, I’m sure. I think everyone is expecting the workload to go up significantly. They’re huge. The simple fact is that their bodies are not used to tolerating the level of load that is going to be demanded of them when they go back. The managers and the staff will have tried to monitor the levels of players while they’ve been off, but the moment they come back, everything is different. They’re training on grass, in their boots. They might have been wearing trainers for the last 10 weeks. There’s the surface, the ground will be quite hard at the moment too given the weather, and they’ll be changing direction, accelerating, decelerating, chasing a ball round at full speed. They haven’t done that for a considerable period of time, so there is huge potential for load-related problems - Achilles tendons, hamstrings, adductors, patella tendons, anything in the lower limb which is having to readjust to the demands. And as a result of everything - the reduced strength, reduced endurance - the players’ proprioceptive levels are reduced as well, so you could well see an increase in the more serious kind of ligament injuries, including ACLs</p>

  <p><b>[The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a>, following the lead of the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, will permit five substitutions per side for the remaining fixtures, but that alone will not offset the risk]</b> There’s always a spike in injuries during congested fixture periods. At Christmas, for example, we know that the injury incidence always goes up. So shortening the period we’ve got to prepare players for a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> game, that causes a lot of problems. I think we’ll end up seeing a ton of hamstring injuries. The muscle injuries are a much greater risk. We don’t know by how much, because we’ve not had anything like this before, but we know that the risk is greater because players are not as conditioned. They can’t be. And look, everybody in the game knows this fact; match injuries are way more prevalent than training-ground injuries. Way, way more prevalent. And the players are going to resume this season without having had a competitive fixture to prepare them. Players’ bodies are used to tolerating a certain amount of load during a week. A certain amount of distance, accelerations, decelerations, high-speed runs and changes of direction. You don’t have to work at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to know that Jurgen demands a lot from his team, and that demand is carefully managed by staff so that they don’t spike that workload. Now, they have to spike. They only have three weeks to get ready for the season. You can’t just steadily increase it like you would in a normal pre-season, because there isn’t enough time.</p>
