By sticking together, they can get through this situation. We know that the result in Paris hurt, but if there is any team that can turn something like this around, then that team is <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. It is a difficult result, but not impossible. This team has done a lot in recent years and they deserve every confidence in the world. I am with them to the death, not just because they are friends of mine but because at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> we are all in the same boat. We cannot afford to have doubts. We have to fight to the end</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona star Gerard Pique is the best centre-back in the world]</b> Right now, Pique is the best centre-back in the world. He’s the perfect age and physically he is in great shape. He’s always been very intelligent, but you notice it more now. The same with his leadership, which he’s always had but now he’s in complete control on the pitch, especially at the back. That’s a plus. His positioning has improved as well. He hardly ever loses his position and he knows how to read the game and to anticipate what’s going to happen. He never loses his head. He seems more responsible, too, something which comes with time and age.<br /><br />Now he picks his moments <b>[to join in attacks]</b> much better. Maybe he will only go forward once in a game now but he has a gift, something intangible that very few players have. It’s called goal-scoring instinct and that allows him to be in the right place at the right time. It happened against Roma, he went forward once and he scored</p>

  <p><b>[Puyol puts Barcelona star above Real Madrid rival]</b> It’s weird Leo is not on the list. I don’t have any doubt that Leo is the best in the world. You never know what they analyse for these individual awards. We must respect it, but football people know absolutely who is the best. He <b>[Modric]</b> is a great player who had a very good season but for me the best is Messi. Congratulations for Modric. Leo can’t always win. Otherwise, we should create an award for him and another for the rest<br /><br />Barcelona are expected to win every week and if they lose once then you criticise. They have to fight for all titles, but if you have to choose between the Champions League and Copa del Rey then you choose the Champions League. Above all though is La Liga, which is very important<br /><br />Barcelona have always fought for everything. If Barcelona had a season like Real Madrid last year, they would kill us. They focused on the Champions League, they played heads or tails but at Barcelona you cannot do that, we have another mentality</p>

  <p><b>[Carles Puyol has remained loyal to his Barcelona roots when placing Gerard Pique above Sergio Ramos and Virgil van Dijk]</b> Gerard Pique, without a doubt. We’re different. He is key to Barcelona in everything he contributes, in his leadership. He’s a phenomenon and a great friend.<br /><br /><b>[On Lionel Messi]</b> When you have the best player in history it’s logical that you depend on him. However, there have been great players around him who are making history too<br /><br />I don’t believe Messi reacts to anything. It’s just his way of playing, he’s always decisive. To say Messi played well against Lyon because of Ronaldo’s hat-trick just doesn’t make sense. In 10 matches where Messi plays, nine will be spectacular and the other one will just be very good.</p>

  <p><b>[Carles Puyol says Lionel Messi is the best player in football history]</b> He is playing at an incredible level. For me, he is the best ever player in the history of the game. He has shown that season after season and you can see how his game has evolved, all the things he now does. And you can see he’s improving every year with new attributes he has brought to his game. He has improved in every way and he is taking a step forward on a personal level. He has always been a leader on the field but now, you can see that he is a leader on and off the pitch. He is an introverted person but now you can see that he is leading from the front as the captain of Barcelona.<br /><br />It’s been very good in the Champions League and also in all the other competitions. They’re playing really good football and they have the chance of winning everything. Right now it’s great because the best is yet to come this season. Barcelona are one of the favourites for the Champions League because there are only four teams left. It is going to be a really tough semi-final against Liverpool because they having a great season but fans will want to see these kinds of games, that’s what the Champions League is all about. Players have come and they have left but the style of Barcelona has stayed the same. They’ve got a great generation of players who have made amazing results. The most important thing is the ambition of the club to keep making history.</p>
