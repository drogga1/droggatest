  <p><b>[Carles Puyol on Samuel Eto’o]</b> People think that there is a time bomb in the dressing room, but that isn’t true. Frank Rijkaard has got the team under control. <b>[Samuel Eto’o]</b>(samuel-eto-o.html) has a good relationship with the rest of the group and the atmosphere is good</p>

It has been a very tough shock</p>

By sticking together, they can get through this situation. We know that the result in Paris hurt, but if there is any team that can turn something like this around, then that team is <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. It is a difficult result, but not impossible. This team has done a lot in recent years and they deserve every confidence in the world. I am with them to the death, not just because they are friends of mine but because at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> we are all in the same boat. We cannot afford to have doubts. We have to fight to the end</p>

  <p><b>[Carles Puyol says Barcelona should ignore what happened with Neymar in the past]</b> In the end, you have to value the present, not so much the past. If the player is on the market and you need him, you don’t have to be thinking about what happened a few years ago<br /><br /><b>[However, Puyol believes the star forward can still deliver plenty for Barcelona]</b> Neymar is a great player who can make a difference. He’s not been able to play his best football <b>[at PSG]</b> because of injuries, but he still has a lot to give to football</p>

We all know him, we know he says what he thinks, he goes straight… I liked to talk the same as <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, so would have acted just like him<br /><br /><b>[Puyol also clarified his decision to turn down the sporting director post at Barcelona]</b> think the statement was very clear, you can’t interpret much more. I am at a time when I develop new projects, the next one will come out in a few days and will be related to the Danone Nations Cup, with football and values, an online programme designed for fathers and mothers who want to share time with their children. I have many more. I had been working on them for many months and I don’t think it’s time to leave them. It was not the time to join Barca<br /><br /><b>[Puyol’s former team-mate Victor Valdes was sacked as coach of the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> Under-19 side this month, the ex-goalkeeper having reportedly clashed with La Masia head Patrick Kluivert]</b> Victor still doesn’t have much experience as a coach. Last season he did very well and has a lot of knowledge about soccer to teach children. I do not know the reasons for what happened, I am not in the club, but I know that he will have a good career as a coach and that he will train great players. Youth football is not easy. Many times you look more at the results and you also have to think about the development and training of the children</p>

  <p><b>[Carles Puyol says Van Dijk is a complete defender &amp; <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> the best ever]</b> Van Dijk is one of the best in the world. He is the complete defender, always calm, a great player. The spotlight usually goes to the strikers, so it is nice to see a special defender get deserved recognition<br /><br /><b>[Puyol added, with Van Dijk competing alongside two modern-day greats]</b> It’s true that in recent years <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> for me is the best, and it’s difficult to compare to him because to me he’s the best player in history. We’ve also had <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> who’s a great player. And the two have always been there, and few players have had the opportunity to win an individual trophy.

Iker is a friend and if he calls me, I will listen; another thing is joining him. I’m also a friend of those from Barcelona; they called me and I didn’t join them. They’re positions that you have to convince <b>[people]</b> because it’s a big responsibility. It depends on the vital moment which each person can get involved in or not.</p>

Why are we talking about a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> without <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> when he’s here now? What we have to do is try to win as much as possible with him.<br /><br /><b>[Puyol for his part still misses being a player and admitted management doesn’t particularly appeal to him]</b> I’m more interested in being a sporting director than a coach. There’s a lot of competition in coaching. I have a thing for football, but what I would prefer is to play again but that’s impossible</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona icon Carles Puyol ‘convinced’ <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> will win the Champions League again]</b> For me, Pep is the best coach I had and the best coach in the world. You can immediately tell that a team is coached by Pep by the way it plays. That’s why I’m convinced he will win that title again. I can’t say whether it will be with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, but they will focus a lot on that competition as it is practically impossible to catch <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in the Premier League<br /><br />Bayern are always among the favourites. They have an experienced team and will certainly be motivated to win that title again. In the knockout stage, the little details are decisive - I know that from my own experience. Whoever is the most focused and stable will progress<br /><br /><a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and Madrid always have great teams with extraordinary players. Still, it’s correct that they haven’t played as consistently as we’re used to. Both have been eliminated from the Copa del Rey, so there are only two chances left to win a title. The decisive weeks of the season have arrived with the knockout stages in the Champions League, the Clasico and the final stages of <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>. We will see what answers the teams come up with for the challenges that await. Of course, I hope <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> will win it, but at the moment everything is wide open</p>
