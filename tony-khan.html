  <p><b>[Aleksandar Mitrovic has signed a new five-year contract at Fulham to put an end to rumours suggesting he was on his way out of Craven Cottage]</b> Aleksandar Mitrovic has been a huge part of Fulham Football Club since he first arrived here in 2018 and helped fuel our run of 23 consecutive games unbeaten and our subsequent promotion to the Premier League. Mitro is a world class goal-scorer at any level and an amazing talent, but he’s also an incredible person off the pitch, he’s a leader at this football club and a great friend to his teammates and our entire staff, and he’s such a beloved hero to our supporters. Likewise, he loves Fulham and our awesome supporters and playing at Craven Cottage, we’ve all made him feel that Fulham is his home. I’ve been clear that keeping Mitro in our squad was our top priority, and I’m grateful to him for his loyalty that he’s committed to our club and this promotion campaign ahead</p>

  <p><b>[Harry Arter is targeting promotion back to the Premier League with Fulham after joining the Cottagers on loan from Bournemouth]</b> Harry Arter’s arrival at Fulham will strengthen our midfield and gives us another experienced and proven player who’s contributed to his former club’s promotion from the Championship. Harry’s a great fit for our squad, and we believe he’ll help us achieve our main objective, a return to the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Anthony Knockaert joins Fulham on three-year deal]</b> I’m pleased to announce that we’ve exercised our option to convert Anthony Knockaert’s loan agreement to a permanent, and now Anthony will be with us at Fulham for the future. Anthony has become important to our squad since his arrival. Our loan deal with Brighton expired this month, and exercising our option ensures that Anthony will be with us for the remainder of our push for promotion this season and beyond</p>
