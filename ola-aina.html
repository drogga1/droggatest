  <p><b>[Ola Aina will spend the season on loan at Torino from Chelsea]</b> Torino have been following me for some time. I hope to do well; I know this is a club that believes in young players and that is very important. I know I can learn a lot in Italy, above all in terms of positioning and organisation, which are fundamental here. I really want to experience this new adventure to the full. Thank you to the Toro for choosing me: now it’s up to me and I can’t wait to get started.</p>

  <p><b>[Nathaniel Chalobah has been backed to make it at the highest level by his former Chelsea team-mate Ola Aina]</b> It is really good that he is back in the fold and in the eyes of the England set up. Let’s hope he can progress and become the player that always gets picked for England, he has good qualities and he can go all the way. He is so level headed. His temperament is good. He is very strong and physical, and he is not slow. He has got everything that you need in a midfielder. That’s why I think he can probably go all the way. He needs just more game time at Watford and fewer injuries. I am close to everyone who has been through Chelsea. Tammy <b>[Abraham]</b>, Fikayo <b>[Tomori]</b>, Kasey <b>[Palmer]</b>, <b>[Charlie]</b> Colkett, Dominic Solanke and Michael Hector. The group that have come from Chelsea are like a family. We all communicate and we all get along.<br /><br />He said it will be difficult, obviously. He said if I absorb the culture and go in with an open mind that it shouldn’t be too hard. That’s what I have tried to do. He has told me how Italians are, what they do differently on the pitch and how they prepare before games. The advice he has given me has helped. I always message him, we always talk<br /><br />I think so <b>[that Nigeria’s young squad will improve]</b>. We are working hard every day. The team is working hard. The team bond is really good. Let’s just hopefully get to the AFCON and then hopefully we will have gelled well and be able to play our best football. Even some of the younger players have already earned such experience. There’s a lot of players who are experienced despite their young age. It is good for my development to be here, this is a vibrant squad. I enjoy the football aspect too. Of course, everyone helped to make my transition into the team smooth. It has been very helpful to me. I am enjoying myself every time I join up and I enjoy meeting up with the squad every time. To be on the international scene is good for me because I am playing with such good players</p>

  <p><b>[Ola Aina has offered his gratitude to John Terry for helping aid his development]</b> Of course, he was always a leader. He didn’t have to reach out to us young ones all the time as he has his own things going on but he does it anyway. That’s what we can really thank him for and what’s really nice about him. I was 15 and it was my first time training with the first team and he was very welcoming and friendly. I thought it would be a thing where he is a fellow defender and not really chat to us but he was really good and throughout the time I spent with him, he has been top notch. He is a top guy.<br /><br />I remember when I got a little knock in the game on my Chelsea debut and he came on for me. It was good to come off for him, even though I didn’t like coming off, it was a good feeling to be replaced by such a legend. I think he wouldn’t have minded sitting out the game to see me do well, but he is a professional and he was ready to do his job. It was surreal just to come off for him. I think he will develop defenders wherever he is. I think all Villa’s defenders will learn a lot from him, especially the centre backs. I think he will bring a different type of knowledge because he has done it at every level; on the European stage, international stage and in the Premier League for so many years. Villa are really lucky to have him, especially their defenders.<br /><br />My time has been spent playing with him at Chelsea and against him at Villa. With the young ones he was always good, he would text us every now and again. He would give us advice and just watching him on the pitch helped. Just playing with him and then training with him every day. That was more how I got the knowledge that he gave to me. It might not be verbally all the time but just watching him on the pitch and how he was. Even off the pitch watching him helped me as a young defender.</p>

  <p><b>[Torino loan a step towards Premier League future]</b> It is a step up. Playing top flight football offers me different challenges. It has helped me to become a better player and my development, just all the things that I have learned abroad in Italy, I am bringing what I have learned here into the national side and I hope it will pay off in the long run. The players are really established and experienced so it was good to come up against that calibre of footballer. It will just make me better. I am working on the tactical side, positioning, staying concentrated and just being able to effect the game higher up the pitch as well. I have played both left and right whenever I am called upon. I don’t think it is a problem and I enjoy it as well. Chelsea agreed it would be good for my development to focus on the tactical side. I have just been talking to Chelsea, I know they would keep tabs on me. I know they are watching and paying attention to me. I think that it could be my final loan move <b>[before playing in the Premier League]</b>. It is my aim for my career to play in the Premier League, I don’t know when but I think this is a step that’s going to help me to get there. Hopefully it helps.<br /><br />It wasn’t that he promised me game time as such,” Aina explained. “We have a lot of players who are good so everyone is fighting for a position. He was just telling me that he can develop me, that I am a good player but that he can make me better on the tactical side of the game. That’s something I think I need at this point in my career. It was really appealing to me and it was a really positive discussion. I had a few options. I chose Italy and Torino because I am a little bit more familiar with Italy because I like to go every year on holiday. It was just more appealing to me to work with their coaches really. Mazzarri was eager to get me on board and help me with the different aspects of my game. He just really wanted to work with me so it was an easy decision for me to go there. Even just in my first game I was up against the likes of <b>[Daniele]</b> De Rossi, <b>[Stephan]</b> El Shaarawy. <b>[Edin]</b> Dzeko and <b>[Aleksandar]</b> Kolarov, all these top players that have had really good careers so far. The first game <b>[against Roma]</b> was a bit difficult because of the language, but as the games have gone on I have learned the language a little bit. It was a good game but unfortunately we lost 1-0. But it was a really good game for me. It is getting easier for me to communicate with the players on the pitch. The game time is helping me, obviously. Every time I play I am developing and learning<br /><br /><b>[On Andrea Belotti]</b> He is a good guy, he works hard for the team and he obviously scores a lot of goals so he is a key player for us. He is our captain. He leads by example, he may not talk a lot on the pitch but his football does a lot of the leading and he is really good for the team. I would say they all helped me. The language thing is hard so they have really tried to help me and teach me a few words I need to know on the pitch. Some of them speak English so they have tried to adapt to me also. It is really good, they helped me a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Aina: I want to win AFCON with Nigeria after pain of missing World Cup]</b> I just missed out on the World Cup last time, that was hard to not go. African Cup of Nations is around the corner and to play in it is a big thing for me. To compete and play after two times not qualifying for it, it’s really special for me to be involved in it. After I missed the World Cup, I bounced back quickly and moved on. You take that disappointment and turn it into hunger and desire to be in this tournament and be selected. It has just pushed me to be even more determined. Now I’m ready to go and do my best.<br /><br />We are going well. Training is at a high level. There’s a good spirit. The preparation has been good. I think everyone is confident. Everyone is happy. Everyone is at ease and it’s a good vibe to be around. We are raring to go. We would love to win it because the nation has missed out on two of these tournaments and the one before, we won. So, we want to go there, do our best and to try to win this tournament. I think everyone has improved in our young squad. I have improved in certain aspects. I have still got a lot more to improve on. I’m not the finished article. Mentally, I have been able to improve to deal with setbacks better and quicker. I’m better physically and definitely tactically. I am always improving and you feel the improvements.<br /><br />Everyone would say Senegal are one of the favourites. They have a very good team and they did very well at the World Cup that just went. They will be very difficult. I don’t think we are looking at our opposition too much, we are trying to focus on ourselves and be the best we can be. You have players like <a href="john-obi-mikel.html">John Obi Mikel</a> and <a href="wilfred-ndidi.html">Wilfred Ndidi</a> in our team. Then there is <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="naby-keita.html">Naby Keita</a> all at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, the European champions. There are a lot of big players in these African teams. To go up against them and compete with them is a good thing for me. You see these guys on TV all the time and achieving great things, then you play them, it is surreal at times. It is my job though and you keep it professional</p>

  <p><b>[The former Blues full-back Ola Aina has backed <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s young players to make an impact as they attempt to cope with a two-window transfer ban]</b> With the ban coming in I think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> should give the youngsters a chance. I say should, because with the season gone I think that a lot of loan players have proven themselves. On merit, I think it should happen. I think the young ones can come in and show what they are about. I think it would be good for them because I don’t think there would be as much pressure on with the ban. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have to make do with what they have which is a talented bunch of guys out on loan and in the academy. I think a lot of the guys are ready. <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a>, <a href="fikayo-tomori.html">Fikayo Tomori</a>, <a href="tammy-abraham.html">Tammy Abraham</a> and even young <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a>. He has only had one season on loan but if you throw people like that into the deep end then they will come out for you. We already know <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Callum Hudson-Odoi</a> can handle the pressure of playing for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.<br /><br />Eden will definitely be missed. I don’t think fans should think that just one of the academy guys or loan guys can replace <a href="eden-hazard.html">Hazard</a>. That’s too much pressure and replacing Eden will be very difficult. It should be a relaxed situation for everyone where the young ones do their best, which I think they will do. He has been a great player for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> over the past seven years. He is also a great character, a great person. I have enjoyed my time with him in the changing rooms. It has been a pleasure to play with him.<br /><br />A pleasure to watch him in training and in matches. There is a time when people have to move on and he has chosen to move on. No one will hold that against him because he did everything for us. He tried his best for us. I am sure everyone wishes him the best. I just pray that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> can manage without him. I don’t have a favourite moment but I have collective moments of him being who he is in life. He likes to joke and banter. He was always happy. I never once saw Eden angry and he is a good character. With Eden, as a defender all you can do is hope for the best. You have to hope he makes a mistake. If he doesn’t you just say ‘good luck’ to any defender really<br /><br />I don’t count <a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Loftus-Cheek</a> as an emerging talent <b>[anymore]</b>, I think he is already established even though he is young and from the academy. He’s been at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for four years, so he is an established first-team player. He has proven himself already and it is exciting to see. Ruben has been ready to play at this level for a long time, so seeing him this season, before his injury, getting the recognition and playing time that he deserves was really good. He has proven himself once again that he has been ready and he is ready. If he signs a new deal then that’s great for him and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and he will do fantastic. It is up to him, though. Whatever happens, happens<br /><br /><b>[For Aina, his chapter in west London has ended]</b> Things are a lot clearer. I had not been thinking about moving. I just think about what’s ahead of me and that’s the national team. We can achieve something great. I just had to do what’s best for me and my family. Hopefully it is the right decision</p>
