  <p><b>[The Brazilian can understand why his long-time team-mate, with whom he has played at four different clubs, has always dominated the agenda]</b> It was always been a circus around <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> since the time we played together at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. We were just 19 then. <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> always gets a lot of attention. He deserves it. He is a great player with a beatiful career. He seems to get better every year. I’ve known him for 13 years and he has definitely changed. He is more mature than during our time in Amsterdam. <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> always has had the same drive. He still surprises me. The second goal was really amazing. Unbelievable. Sometime you don’t believe what you see when he scores</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> defender says the Selecao have to concentrate on their own game throughout if they are to have any chance of collecting a sixth World Cup]</b> We’ll only have great teams (in the tournament). Eight previous world champions will be in play, but we have to think about our first three group opponents first: Croatia, Mexico and Cameroon. But it all comes down to us. It all comes down to how we will behave once we get on the pitch. But it all comes down to us. It all comes down to how we will behave once we get on the pitch. It’s important to have a staff with such experience. And we have been trying to profit from the motivation the people give us. Let’s try to do our best on the pitch, with energy and dedication. This is what matter the most right now
<br /><br /> <b>[But the 32-year-old says he hasn’t given up on playing in front of a home audience this summer, even if <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> may take some moving]</b> I know that <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> got the place. It’s hard to imagine that I could get my place during the World Cup, but if the chance comes, Felipao knows he can count on me. I have built my career in Europe, so I have been trying to get the people’s trust. The important thing is trying to add something here, to be acknowledged. It will come in time, you can’t force this kind of thing, (but) I have an unique opportunity to win an unique competition. That’s what I’m aiming for here. It’s hard to see some fellow players who are going to miss the World Cup. The important thing is to work well, and try to prevent any setbacks. And, when the matches come, to be 100 per cent focused and forget any problems. We have been doing our part on trying to prevent some situations, and getting in better shape physically</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain defender Maxwell says he is amazed to see teammate <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> getting criticised for his early-season form]</b> For me it’s funny to hear what everybody is saying about Ibrahimovic after all he has done in his career and even this season. He has been injured and is still lacking a bit of rhythm, but he has found his confidence and us scoring goals. He only needs to play some more games. It is ridiculous to criticize a player like Ibrahimovic now<br /><br /><b>[Ibrahimovic will be looking to add to his tally for 2015-16 when <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> take on Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday, but Maxwell has stressed <a href="mircea-lucescu.html">Mircea Lucescu</a>’s men should not be underestimated]</b> Shakhtar have some very strong attacking players. We have made some mistakes, but we are satisfied with our season so far. This <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> is the most competitive team I have been part of, together with Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[Maxwell says <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> squad is strong enough to win the Champions League]</b> The aim is to go further than last year, that is for sure. We have started the Champions League well, with two wins, but for us to make the situation more favourable, we need to get points against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. For a while now we have had a lot of motivation, confidence. To go far in the Champions League, you have to give everything. It could be for us, like last season. It always depends on the moments and who you play in the two-legged ties. We will need luck, for the whole squad to be available. Unfortunately, last year, we had some problems which stopped us from playing our game against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. I think that this year, with the team that we have, we have more of a chance<br /><br /><b>[The former Brazil international suggested he would be open to challenges outside Europe if this is his last campaign with PSG]</b> In Europe, yes, it is practically certain. We never know in football. In Europe, I am very happy with my career up until now. Aside from that, I think I could have an adventure in another continent. We will see. We must know what <b>[PSG]</b> wants. It is not always my decision, so we will see with the club and the other possibilities. I am happy with what I have done up until now. I am 34, so at one moment or another you have to think about stopping</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain defender Maxwell believes <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is a more difficult proposition under new coach <a href="guus-hiddink.html">Guus Hiddink</a> than former boss Jose Mourinho]</b> The opinion of people doesn’t matter. We’ve never felt inferior or superior to anyone. We’ve never felt inferior or superior to anyone. We know <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> well, and like us they have not changed much. It will be very difficult, particularly since they have changed manager. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have more enthusiasm. There will be two fantastic matches to play in, to watch or to commentate on… but we want to continue our adventure<br /><br /><b>[Laurent Blanc’s side made it to the quarterfinal stage last season where it lost to eventual winner <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> 5-1 on aggregate, but Maxwell feels the team has learned from the experience]</b> We have the experience of the last three seasons, which will help us a great deal. We’ve played <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, the best team in Europe, several times. We more or less know all the players and teams in Europe… we know our qualities.

We have a philosophy that we keep. We have player who allow us to play this type of game. Why change? I think it would be a lack of respect towards my team-mates if I respond to that question. We have players of quality, with youngsters who are here to progress. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> also have great players but we’re content with our squad</p>
