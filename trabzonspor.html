  <p><b>[Trabzonspor handed one-year European ban]</b> On 5 July 2019, the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) Adjudicatory Chamber determined that Trabzonspor AŞ (TUR) failed to be break-even compliant as required by a settlement agreement, which it entered into on 20 May 2016 and sanctioned the club with a conditional exclusion from participating in one (1) <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> club competition for which it would otherwise qualify in the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons. The sanction would not take effect if the club fulfilled certain conditions, including meeting a target with respect to its financial results for the 2019 financial year. The CFCB Adjudicatory Chamber has now determined that Trabzonspor AŞ failed to meet the target fixed for the 2019 financial year. As a result, the CFCB Adjudicatory Chamber has ordered that the club be excluded from participating in one (1) <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> club competition for which it would otherwise qualify in the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons.<br /><br /><a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> concluded with the decision today that our club did not comply with the reconciliation agreement we have signed with them. Although we respect the decision, we would like to emphasize that we disagree with this decision in our evaluation with club lawyers. We would like to announce that we will object against this decision within 10 days</p>
