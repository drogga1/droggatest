<blockquote>
  <p>[Youthful USMNT squad’s final exam will be a brutal one as full-strength France awaits] I think we were a little bit afraid to play when there was some pressure on us. I think we just have to work on getting in good spots for one another when we have the ball. This way it makes it easier for the next guy.<br /><br />We just want to make the game tough for them. I think we want to put on a good showing for ourselves, but obviously not make it easy for them.</p>

  <p>[Underrated Tim Parker has helped transform Red Bulls defense into the toughest in MLS] That means a lot, especially coming from an opposing coach. It shows that what we’re doing here is getting recognized, not only as a team, but as individuals.<br /><br />We want to be labeled as the best defense in the league. We take pride in our goals against, and everything that goes into being a good defense</p>

  <p>[Red Bulls more focused on stopping Ibrahimovic than potential trash talk] He’s got a presence to him as well. His presence can intimidate people. And then on top of it if he’s talking to you I’m sure it can get to you in a way, but we’re not going to let that happen</p>
