  <p><b>[Vancouver Whitecaps use rivals’ success as motivation after disappointing campaign]</b> You want to do just as well as your rivals and you hope that that motivates and pushes us. I think the pressure <b>[to succeed]</b> comes from within, and I think we just want to do our thing and hit the right strides at the right points in time to put ourselves in successful areas.<br /><br />Obviously 2016, looking back on it we had our disappointments. I think the way the club went about the offseason, I think they did a great job. I think they brought a lot of the guys back that we wanted to have back and I think this is a group of guys that we want to fight for one another, and that’s what we want within this locker room<br /><br />I don’t want to say it changes the seriousness of preseason, but it changes the timeline, for sure. And obviously it makes for less mistakes, it makes for tighter boundaries and everyone wants to make sure that they’re doing the right things right away, because that game <b>[Wednesday]</b> is going to be coming quick. From day one we wanted to address that, and obviously make sure that everyone’s head was right for that game coming up<br /><br />It’s just about hitting those playoffs and running with it. I think that’s really important for us this year, to just make sure that hitting that playoff spot and having that momentum behind you that you can run with through the playoffs <b>[is achieved]</b>, just like Seattle did this <b>[past]</b> year and Portland did two years ago</p>

  <p><b>[Tim Parker aims for bigger Whitecaps role, return to USMNT]</b> I definitely would love to do that and I think that’s something that’s important to me and important to my growth as a player as well. In terms of my position and in terms of my character, that’s something that I want to install in my game and install in myself, because I think that’s something that I’ll continue to push for this year.<br /><br /><b>[On leadership role]</b> I think it comes from within. It’s something that I wanted to do by myself without being asked about it<br /><br />I want to stay healthy, play a majority of the games <b>[for the Whitecaps]</b> and hopefully continue to find myself in the mix for the national team. I hope that I have a good enough year in order to put myself in an opportunity there, and if that opportunity comes then I’ll hopefully take advantage of it</p>

  <p><b>[Youthful USMNT squad’s final exam will be a brutal one as full-strength France awaits]</b> I think we were a little bit afraid to play when there was some pressure on us. I think we just have to work on getting in good spots for one another when we have the ball. This way it makes it easier for the next guy.<br /><br />We just want to make the game tough for them. I think we want to put on a good showing for ourselves, but obviously not make it easy for them.</p>

  <p><b>[Underrated Tim Parker has helped transform Red Bulls defense into the toughest in MLS]</b> That means a lot, especially coming from an opposing coach. It shows that what we’re doing here is getting recognized, not only as a team, but as individuals.<br /><br />We want to be labeled as the best defense in the league. We take pride in our goals against, and everything that goes into being a good defense</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bulls more focused on stopping Ibrahimovic than potential trash talk]</b> He’s got a presence to him as well. His presence can intimidate people. And then on top of it if he’s talking to you I’m sure it can get to you in a way, but we’re not going to let that happen</p>
