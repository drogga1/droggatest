<blockquote>
  <p>[Would Murdoch have been even worse for Man Utd than the Glazers?] The two main motivations were preventing Rupert Murdoch getting his hands on the club, and ensuring it remained independently owned in a guise that the support could directly influence matters [albeit as a plc]. The link between a club and its support was still seen as something important, with clubs being much more embedded in, and central to, their local communities. In 1998, this was still true of United, even if it was to a lesser extent than it might have been for much smaller, less commercial clubs like Manchester City. The fear raised at the time was that decisions about United would be taken far away from Old Trafford in foreign-based boardrooms where the fans would hold no sway. Those predictions have come to pass under the Glazers.<br /><br />Despite what Murdoch’s propaganda sheets such as the Sun claimed at the time, there were never any plans for Sky to buy up all the game’s stars for United. Murdoch even admitted as much after the buyout had been officially blocked - it was all about Sky gaining a seat on the other side of the negotiating table when it came to bidding for Premier League TV rights. Given that, there’s nothing to say that the club would be any better off, even in light of the fact that the Glazers subsequently bought the club. I’ve often heard people comment ‘I bet they wish they’d welcomed Murdoch now’ in the years since 2005, but you can only fight the battle that’s in front of you at the time, and the groups of United fans who saw off Murdoch helped ensure the club was free from his ilk for another seven years. If the support didn’t ultimately take that opportunity to ensure the club couldn’t be bought - shares went down to £1 each at one point, valuing the club at one-third of the eventual price the Glazers paid - then so be it. There’s nothing to say that Sky wouldn’t have sold it to a buyer like the Glazers after a few years anyway<br /><br />Back in the ’90s and beyond fans were paying a fraction of the money they are today to be treated like sh*t, and getting a far greater, more communal matchday experience for their cash. And back then fans could at least abuse Martin Edwards and the like in person. Nowadays the Florida-based Glazers don’t hear any dissent, nor care about any, even if there was to be any, which there very rarely is.</p>
