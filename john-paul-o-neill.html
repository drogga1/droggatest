  <p><b>[O’Neill tips Beckham, Giggs and Class of ‘92 to take over at Man Utd]</b> I honestly think that the Class of ‘92 have got their sights fixed on owning United one day. I am sure they would deny it at the moment - but it really does make sense when you put all the pieces together. The Neville brothers, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have taken over a small non-league club in Salford City and are now finding out what it is like to run a football club from a practical point of view. Why? Is Salford City really the summit of their ambitions as football club owners? They are obviously on a much smaller scale than United, but going in at that level is giving the Class of ‘92 a really practical education in football club ownership.<br /><br />When you look closely you will see they have got some huge financial backers. Most people are aware that Valencia owner Peter Lim has invested heavily in Salford City. But Lim is small-time compared to some of the Chinese investors who have been helping Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs buy up huge swathes of Manchester city centre for redevelopment. Even if Manchester United are now worth between £2 billion and £3 billion, I don’t think buying the club would be a problem for the kind of investors that they are now doing business with</p>
