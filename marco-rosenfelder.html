<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Marco Rosenfelder, a former team-mate of Umtiti at youth level]</b> Lucas Digne played on the left, and that made it difficult, but to be a replacement in the middle of the defence has surely done him much good. When I saw that that Barcelona were interested in him, at first I was surprised. I told myself: ‘Olala! Barcelona!’ But he is exactly what they are looking for: a true defender. I even think that he’s better than Jeremy Mathieu. Barca are not in the habit of forming their own defenders and it’s a good thing for them to sign Samuel. He’s 22 and has played a long time in the senior game already. How many players of his age have the same experience?.<br /><br /><b>[How Rosenfelder saw Umtiti when they played together]</b> He had everything for a modern defender, he was a little Spanish in his style. He goes forward very quickly and likes to play short passes. Even when he has to go long, he rarely does it badly</p>
