  <p><b>[Pogba’s gesture raises Libya slave trade awareness ‘100-fold’]</b> There has been a 100-fold increase in interest in this after the simple gesture Pogba made. He could have celebrated any other way that he wanted but he chose to do that. That resonated so much with so many young people around the world - especially people who look like him and whose background could be like his.<br /><br />What it meant was that most people who follow football around the world and the young people who adore these football stars like Pogba had their attention piqued. These young stars can mobilise so many young people around the world and get so many people interested in a topic that a few weeks ago no one really knew or cared about. Now we are talking about it and that can only be a positive thing.<br /><br />It’s always one of our dreams to get as many of these football stars especially from the continent or who have African heritage to work with us and shine a spotlight on the terrible things which are happening when it comes to irregular migration. Now that the attention is on this fully we expect something will happen. We need more support from these very influential young men who have a huge amount of followers. The majority of them, especially those of them born in Africa, are migrants in one way or form. So really, they are very ideal people to work with us and make a better world for migrants<br /><br />It’s also quite interesting that he had that level of awareness. These young multimillionaires live in a bubble of some sort but through social media there was a huge outpouring of anger and people were concerned that this was happening in 2017.<br /><br />The IOM is currently the only international organisation that is getting sub-Saharan migrants out of Libya back to their countries of origin through the humanitarian voluntary return programme that we are running. So far we have taken out 13,000. We hope to take out another 15,000 before the end of the year which is quite an undertaking<br /><br />We have been working on this for years but the difficulty we have when we try to publicise things is we are not like Unicef, who have Messi and Barcelona. The issue of children in need is quite an emotive one. Whereas it’s more difficult to get that kind of support for migrants because many misconceptions about irregular migration exist. Are they deserving or not to come to our country? You get that kind of dynamic. As a result, we find less and less ambassadors that we can work with.<br /><br />We would certainly welcome them being more involved. They don’t have to; they are living wonderful lives earning lots of money from their skills but as we have seen before some of them when they do set their mind to doing charity work they do it very well and it’s quite effective. We hope we get more of them stepping in and helping<br /><br />All we ask for is for migration be safe, humane and legal. It would certainly be very useful to get more of these young superstars - especially those from Africa because lots of very good players come from West and North Africa. These are kind the locations where a lot of people who are migrating regularly and facing the kind of challenges we are talking about now come from</p>
