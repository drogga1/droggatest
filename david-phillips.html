<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Liverpool and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have been offered hope in their reported pursuits of Todd Cantwell and Ben Godfrey, with <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> legend David Phillips expecting sales to be sanctioned at Carrow Road]</b> You have got to be very careful whenever you’re thinking of moving clubs. There are five or six players at <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> that are very much going to be in demand. Daniel will want to keep hold of all of them I’m sure but will know that if someone offers a lot of money then some will leave. Ultimately it will come down to what clubs come in for them and how much they are offering. But the players would be wise to look at someone like <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a>. He left <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> when he was 21 and you could see he was ready for it.<br /><br /><a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> do things the right way and they are already investing in the future – they have got a really excellent player in Sam McCallum. That shows to me that if someone like Jamal was to move on, then Sam is instantly ready to come in and do a very good job for them. He is a very talented boy and the latest to come out of a system at Coventry that’s produced players like Maddison and Callum Wilson in recent years</p>
