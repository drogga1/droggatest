  <p><b>[Ex-Liverpool starlet Jay Spearing on his Merseyside derby debut]</b> I will always remember it. With Kenny, you found out the team the day before. We went into a meeting at Melwood, and he literally just put the team up on the board. I looked at it for a second and thought, ‘Hang on a minute, I’m in it!’ The first thing I thought about was my dad. He’s a Red and his brother is a Blue. That was the first thing that came into my head. I couldn’t wait to ring him and tell him. God knows what Kenny said during that team meeting, by the way!<br /><br />If you worry about it, you ruin it for yourself. My dad said to me, ‘You’ve worked all your life to be involved in something like this, so here it is, have a go!’ I enjoyed every second of it.<br /><br />If anyone ever asks me about my career, that’s the first game that comes to mind. Obviously, you look at your debut and the Champions League games I played early on, Real Madrid for example. They take some beating. But, as a game, to play a full 90 at Wembley, 80,000 people in an FA Cup semi-final, all your friends and family watching, the hype all around it, that’s the one. You live for days like that<br /><br />I had Steven Gerrard as my captain, Jamie Carragher behind me and Kenny Dalglish on the sideline. What more could you want?! When I look back on my career, I can say I did what I dreamed of doing, I played with the players I dreamed of playing with and for the club I dreamed of playing for. Not many can say that, can they?<br /><br />Those pics are all up in my house now. I pulled my hamstring in the semi against City, but I was on the bench in the final. That was my dream, to win a trophy for Liverpool. I might not have played in the final, but I won a medal for Liverpool. It’s still hanging up on my wall and I’m very proud of it, trust me. I worked hard for it. I remember the train home. My mates were on it, and I went and got the trophy so they could have their picture taken with it. Kenny was there giving them all hugs! Things like that, memories like that, you can’t take them away<br /><br /><b>[Brendan Rodgers replaced Dalglish]</b> He just told me I might not play as much as I wanted. And, at that stage, I wanted to progress. I wanted 35-40 games, and he couldn’t guarantee that. He had Joe Allen as one of his first signings, so I was pushed back down the order. It was just one of those things, so I went out on loan <b>[to Bolton, whom he would later join permanently]</b>. For me, it was always about progression. I’d been two or three years playing off the bench, the odd game, then I got that run of games. That was what I wanted. I didn’t feel I would get what I wanted at Liverpool, so I made the call to leave. To be happy, I need to be playing football<br /><br /><b>[On Martin Kelly]</b> I messaged him the day he passed 55. It wasn’t a nice message!<br /><br /><b>[training sessions at Melwood with the likes of Gerrard, Carragher, Javier Mascherano, Fernando Torres and Jay Spearing]</b> If you asked me to pick a dream team, I could name a pretty good one!<br /><br /><b>[On Jordan Henderson]</b> He’s earned everything he has now. He should be respected a lot more than he is, in my eyes, and even today I feel he’s a better player than people make out. He’s still a big player for Liverpool and for England, and all those managers who keep on picking him and making him captain can’t be wrong, can they?<br /><br /><b>[He regularly holds fundraising events for SCBU]</b> The work they do there is life-changing. I saw it first hand<br /><br />I don’t mind the criticism from social media. It’s just people’s opinion, isn’t it? I care about what my dad thinks more - and the gaffer!</p>
