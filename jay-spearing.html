  <p><b>[<a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> also used Jay Spearing off the bench in the famous 4-0 victory over Madrid at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> in the last 16]</b> I could hear the crowd singing my name and I couldn’t think straight. Quite a few of the lads said congratulations at the end of the game and if I keep working hard I might get another chance<br /><br /><b>[While he remained on the bench during the League Cup final against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, Spearing achieved an honour that most footballers never do: winning a trophy with his boyhood club]</b> Those pics <b>[from the League Cup final]</b> are all up in my house now. I pulled my hamstring in the semi against City, but I was on the bench in the final. That was my dream, to win a trophy for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I might not have played in the final, but I won a medal for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It’s still hanging up on my wall and I’m very proud of it, trust me. I worked hard for it<br /><br /><b>[there were no regrets for Spearing upon his <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> departure]</b> I had <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Steven Gerrard</a> as my captain, <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Jamie Carragher</a> behind me and <a href="kenny-dalglish.html">Kenny Dalglish</a> on the sideline. What more could you want? When I look back on my career, I can say I did what I dreamed of doing, I played with the players I dreamed of playing with and for the club I dreamed of playing for. Not many can say that, can they?</p>
