<blockquote>
  <p>[Claudio Suarez says Clasico Regio can exceed the hype] A lot of media outlets underrate it and don’t realize that Tigres and Rayados lately have done things really well. The proof is in the numbers. They’re always competing, fighting for titles. Yeah, it’s local but it’s transcended that just with the quality of the players. If you want to see a good game, I think this is going to be among the best matches of the season with the quality of the players and how the teams are coming into it.<br /><br />There’s a lot of passion in these types of matches. In those games, you don’t want to lose because you know that the importance goes behind three points. The fans want you to win this game, to not lose it and a lot of times they’re waiting the whole season for it. In Monterrey, honestly, for me, they’re among the best fans there are in Mexico because they live with a lot of passion, they’re always talking about football and they wait for matches with a lot of excitement. The important thing is that both teams, for me, are among the most important in Mexico for the squads they’ve put together and the money they’ve invested<br /><br />[Rayados used two goals from Dorlan Pabon to sink Chivas last weekend and he was back at it again with a golazo in the midweek victory over Atlanta United] That’s what happens. When you have stars that are so important and have a lot of talent, they figure out the game for you. Right now, it’s Dorlan Pabon but there are times when it’s Funes Mori, Maxi Meza coming in, Aviles Hurtado. Really, going forward, Monterrey has players who make things really tough and are really talented. Tigres have the same<br /><br />They have (Tuca’s) style of play really clear in their minds. I think that a bit of an advantage over Monterrey because Diego Alonso is still trying to implement his philosophy of how to play, although little by little the players are getting it. For me, it should be a spectacular game. Hopefully it is, because sometimes the Clasicos can be tight and end up 0-0!</p>
