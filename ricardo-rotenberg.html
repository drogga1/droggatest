  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> legend turns down Brazilian club Botafogo]</b> I chatted today with Yaya all afternoon and now on the phone with his English agent. Yaya told us that he really wants to play in Botafogo but this is a very impactful decision for him and his family for an immediate decision. Moving to Brazil. In conversation with the agent that for now we will end the negotiations but the doors are open in Botafogo. To be clear, Yaya did not accept - saying no. We’ve closed it but I still believe in Botafogo. Please, we will continue to send good messages to him and his wife.</p>

  <p><b>[Botafogo shows interest in signing Arjen Robben]</b> There is a risk because he has been out of the game for a while. But I enquired and he answered me. He was happy about our interest. It’s going to be difficult. Apart from the fact that he hasn’t played for a long time, he can earn four times more at another club.</p>
