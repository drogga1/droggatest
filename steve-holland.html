  <p><b>[Antonio Conte is unlikely to leave Premier League champions Chelsea for a return to Serie A]</b> The speculation is normal when a manager has had the success that Antonio has had. When you think back to the success he had at Juventus and the great job he did with Italy in the last European Championship and add to that the success he has had in his first season in England, it is normal that there will be attention. There has been a lot of Chinese money that has gone into Inter so it is a club that whoever is at the helm will start to make significant progress and challenge more than they have done in recent years. It is a natural consequence, but I would be very surprised if Antonio isn’t at Chelsea next season</p>

  <p><b>[England boss Gareth Southgate is as good a coach as the likes of Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho and Chelsea tactician Antonio Conte]</b> Gareth ticks so many of the boxes that the best that I’ve worked with tick. I worked with Mourinho, I worked with <b>[Carlo]</b> Ancelotti, I worked with <b>[Rafa]</b> Benitez, Conte…it was an incredible environment. All of the managers I worked for had different qualities, different strengths and different weaknesses, but they were all the same in that they were totally single-minded. Very, very clear on how they wanted things to be done. Gareth is very clear on what he wants and has been right from the start.<br /><br />I loved working for Chelsea. It’s the most exciting club in the world, never a dull moment. In the six years I worked with the first team, I experienced a World Club Championship final, a Champions League final, a Europa League final, an FA Cup final, a Capital One Cup final, two successful Premier League title run-ins. Why did I leave? Because of this. To be at a World Cup with England, wow</p>
