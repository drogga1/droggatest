<blockquote>
  <p>[On himself] I had to retire at 27. No qualifications and 14 years of football on your CV doesn’t get you a job. I put everything into football and had to retire early. It’s a swinging door; one player out and one player in. You’re valued for as long as you’re valuable to the club.<br /><br />Club or job, it’s the same for us. We help them to get a job and with interview skills. Any new player that comes in I send them straight to our recruitment officer. Classroom based learning is coming in September with extended diplomas for ones with GCSEs<br /><br />There’s that many development centres and kids think they play for Premier League clubs but they don’t even know who you are. Clubs attach themselves to colleges and they wear the kit but it’s nothing to do with the clubs. It’s deceitful. It’s not fair to put them into that position<br /><br />At academies there’s not much emphasis on whether they’re completing their assignments, whether they come out with a distinction, a merit or a pass. As long as they do their work the clubs are not really bothered. But this is a commitment they have to make here. If your schoolwork is not hitting its targets or you’re not handing in your assignments you don’t play in games. That could be the game the Leeds United scout comes. We are embedding in them you have to work hard and you’ll get rewards. You’re not just going to get handed a contract<br /><br />Most of it is to do with mentality, attitude and application. I try to instil that into the players<br /><br />There’s a support network here to advise the right things at the right time through my own experiences, what I’ve seen from other players. This is the kind of opportunity I didn’t get - to sort your frame of mind. They don’t realise what they’ve got at the minute. They’ll look back and ask why didn’t I just give it everything I’ve got? I’ve seen gifted players who didn’t make it and are now tarmacking on the streets. So I tell them: Don’t become a could have, should have, would have. I want to make them realise now what it takes to get there</p>
