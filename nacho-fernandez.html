  <p><b>[Real Madrid’s one-club man Nacho has underlined his commitment to the Liga giants]</b> Real Madrid mean everything to me. Other people in my position would have probably made different choices. For example, back in 2016. That was a summer in which I had to make a decision because I wasn’t playing as much as I wanted to. But I talked to the club, to Zidane, they showed faith in me, and I think the easy thing would have been to leave, because then you get to play for certain. But in the end, you never know. I was looking at other offers from clubs and then I looked at Madrid, and chose home! Don’t ask me why. Some might say it is settling, but no way! I was the first to feel sad when I didn’t get playing time, and the man who most wanted to make it at Real Madrid. It was the best decision I have ever made, no doubt. After that I won two more Champions Leagues, I’ve played around 70 more games with Real Madrid since then, I am in the Spain team. I prefer to live and enjoy the present. But it would be fantastic, a dream to finish my career at Real Madrid. But football has a lot of twists and turns, I have a long contract at Real Madrid and I hope I can see it out.</p>

  <p><b>[Critics of Cristiano Ronaldo continue to bemuse Real Madrid team-mate Nacho]</b> The truth is that he scores everything he touches. We finished the match with the Spain national team <b>[against Germany]</b> and saw that he had scored twice in five minutes with Portugal. That is great for us. I hope he maintains this level until the end of the season.<br /><br />I do not understand how people can doubt Ronaldo. He is the one who always makes the difference, he has goal stats in his career that are not normal for a player. I do not understand how there can be people doubting him. The commitment he has to this club is 100 per cent and I, as his teammate, think there is nowhere better for him than Real Madrid<br /><br />There are times when teams have bad moments. We are people and it is true that before playing against PSG they were labelled as favourites, but we have always shown that we are competitive. We had full confidence in ourselves, even when taking into account who we were facing. We shut up many people with those two wins. I think they were some of our best games this year, and we’re happy. Even so, it has not been the best of seasons because of what has happened in La Liga and the Copa del Rey, but not all seasons can be a 10 like last year. Now we have the opportunity to continue in our competition <b>[the Champions League]</b>.<br /><br />It’s true that they are very good in La Liga, in the Copa final and in the Champions quarter-final round, like us. But we do not think about them, honestly. We want to play well against a complicated opponent like Juventus <b>[in the quarter-finals]</b> and move forward one step at a time. Who knows what will happen, but if we win another Champions League it would be spectacular<br /><br />I talk to Pique about many things. I’m not going to talk about the WhatsApp group because he is the one who has to talk about it. He said that last year we were kidding them about how we were going, and this year it’s the opposite. But seriously, these are things that happen in football, especially between friends and in our case because we are all players. The relationship is very good and that is healthy for, among other things, a positive coexistence in the national team.</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo can already put his name alongside Alfredo Di Stefano’s at Real Madrid]</b> I do believe that Cristiano can already be equated with Di Stefano. Ronaldo has marked <b>[himself as]</b> a legend, he is a spectacular player with all the Ballons d’Or he won. When the years go by surely people will value things even more.<br /><br />Well, if we focus in the last three <b>[titles]</b> … I would say the ‘<b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane Real Madrid’ for sure. It is true that we also won one in 2014 with <b>[Carlo]</b> Ancelotti, which was very important. Surely that was the beginning of this era, with the players and the group that was created then. But Zidane is vital for us, for the club, and we are here thanks to him</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale would be a target for Real Madrid if he played for Liverpool]</b> For sure! I think he’s an extraordinary player. I understand that in football everything is discussed and the best, the worst are classified… But I am sure that if Bale were in another team, Real Madrid would like to sign him.<br /><br /><b>[On Jurgen Klopp]</b> I never really got to talk to Klopp. I think he’s a spectacular coach. It is true that there were contacts with Liverpool, but my idea was to stay in the club and it was the best decision of all</p>

  <p><b>[David de Gea remains world class in the eyes of Spain team-mate Nacho]</b> He seems fine to me. He knows what happened but, as players, we are always exposed to these things. When mishaps happen, we unite and we’re all with him 100 per cent. He is a world-class goalkeeper and we are lucky to have a player of his calibre. He has no doubts about his own ability and he will bring a lot to the team in the future.<br /><br /><b>[Nacho was responsible for Cristiano Ronaldo opening the scoring from the penalty spot after tripping him inside the box]</b> These kinds of moves are very difficult for a defender, there was contact, I touched Cristiano but I tried to withdraw my foot. It happens so fast that it’s more difficult than it might seem<br /><br />We’re not having any problems scoring, we have a lot of faith in our forwards. Yesterday we had good sensations and we managed to overcome difficult moments. We’re confident and we’ll be going out to beat Iran. We’re 100 per cent ready for the game</p>

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale has nothing to prove to anyone]</b> It’s not a question of him following Ronaldo’s path. Cristiano left his mark on a whole era here. Bale is a really key player for us and he’s won many trophies here and has nothing to prove to anyone. Everyone knows they can count on him and I’m sure that he’ll continue to perform well. The fans are fully behind Bale and he’s very happy at Real Madrid. We’ve got some fantastic strikers here.<br /><br />We picked up the three points and now we have to work towards next week. This is the way forward, limiting the opposition’s chances to score will help us pick up lots of points. For the team it was important to start off with a win and every match will be important because the points are as decisive in August as in they are May. La Liga started at the Santiago Bernabeu against a difficult opponent, who will cause others problems, and my assessment of the performance is a positive one. Last year we swept up in the Super Cups but it was harder for us to get into the winning dynamic in the league, so we don’t want that to happen again this season and we want to get every possible point</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid’s Nacho has confessed that he would love to see Cristiano Ronaldo continue to strut his stuff at the Santiago Bernabeu]</b> It is a difficult subject for us. I’ve said it several times. If it were up to us we would love to have Cristiano in the squad because we had him for many years and he is a player who makes a difference. But it is a situation where we cannot feel sorry for ourselves because of Cristiano. He chose to leave. We are grateful for everything he did for us and we wish him the best of luck. But we cannot feel sorry for someone who is no longer with us. It isn’t our fault he left, nor was it up to us to make him stay. I hope he has the best of luck and we have to work through the present and future in the best way we can with what we have.<br /><br />Well, Cristiano left and the club decided not to sign anybody. We have a lot of faith in the players we have. You win titles with the players you have in the squad. To start with, when we were winning everything looked rosy and now it doesn’t. But we have to keep our cool in this sport, and save our analysis for when the season finishes. But we have a lot of confidence in the players we have</p>

The end of the season will be very difficult because we are not used to not playing for anything at this point.<br /><br />It ‘s the worst night of the last few years. We won many Champions Leagues and we are not used to not making it to the quarter-finals. I think that for many years did not happen, so it is is still a very difficult season for many reasons<br /><br />We understand that the fans are upset with us, but we are locked in. From within we live it very strongly. We noticed it, because we are people, we have been through bad things and this is a very hard one for us.</p>
