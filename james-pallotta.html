  <p><b>[James Pallotta on <a href="medhi-benatia.html">Mehdi Benatia</a>]</b> <a href="medhi-benatia.html">Mehdi Benatia</a> has obviously continued with his pattern of outright lies over the last couple of months. We had a verbal agreement on compensation and a raise back in July in Boston. He personally said to me that he was happy after I told him flat out, with no exceptions, that we wanted him to stay. Over the following month he lied about wanting to stay and about the details of his compensation to both <a href="rudi-garcia.html">Rudi Garcia</a> and his team-mates. Lying to me was one thing which I can somewhat handle. Lying to <a href="rudi-garcia.html">Rudi Garcia</a> and his team-mates was completely unacceptable to me. I told <a href="walter-sabatini.html">Walter Sabatini</a> he was becoming poisonous and I wanted him gone, and Rudi and Walter agreed. It wasn’t about the money; it was about having character in our locker room. We are in a very sound financial position</p>

  <p><b>[James Pallotta on Roma’s decision to appoint women’s football legend <a href="mia-hamm.html">Mia Hamm</a> as the club’s new director]</b> The potential of having Mia on the board of Roma to me was a no-brainer. What she’s forgotten about football over the last 30 years I still have to learn</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> owner Jim Pallotta has insisted that stars such as <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">Daniele De Rossi</a>, Kostas Manolas, Aleksandar Kolarov and <a href="edin-dzeko.html">Edin Dzeko</a> did not conspire to get former coach <a href="eusebio.html">Eusebio</a> Di Francesco sacked]</b> Some aspects of that article made <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">Daniele De Rossi</a> look bad, which is not fair because Daniele has been a warrior for Roma for 18 years. He deserves respect and I have always respected him. The notion that Daniele was out to get <a href="eusebio.html">Eusebio</a> Di Francesco sacked is 100% false from all of my conversations with him. In fact, with 12 games left in the season, I had a phone conversation with Daniele and he personally asked me to keep the coach until the end of the season. So if anyone is suggesting that he was asking for Di Francesco to be sacked, that couldn’t be further from the truth. If not <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">De Rossi</a>, did <a href="edin-dzeko.html">Dzeko</a>, Manolas or Kolarov ask for the coach to be sacked? No. I’ve never heard any of those players say that they wanted us to sack Di Francesco. They never came to me either directly or indirectly.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">De Rossi</a> will be leaving Roma 18 years after making his professional debut for the club in the off-season]</b> We may have had some differences of opinion on how his playing career at Roma has ended but I’m not going to get into that in the public domain; that’s between Daniele and myself. Daniele was emotional but he’s emotional because he cares and has cared about Roma forever. He plays with his heart - we’ve seen it for 18 years with Roma. Was he upset that someone was being brought in to play in his position, as stated in the article? Yes, he was - but that was because a day before he was told by <b>[former sporting director]</b> <a href="monchi.html">Monchi</a> that we weren’t bringing in somebody</p>
