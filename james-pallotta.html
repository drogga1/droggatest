  <p><b>[James Pallotta on <a href="medhi-benatia.html">Mehdi Benatia</a>]</b> <a href="medhi-benatia.html">Mehdi Benatia</a> has obviously continued with his pattern of outright lies over the last couple of months. We had a verbal agreement on compensation and a raise back in July in Boston. He personally said to me that he was happy after I told him flat out, with no exceptions, that we wanted him to stay. Over the following month he lied about wanting to stay and about the details of his compensation to both <a href="rudi-garcia.html">Rudi Garcia</a> and his team-mates. Lying to me was one thing which I can somewhat handle. Lying to <a href="rudi-garcia.html">Rudi Garcia</a> and his team-mates was completely unacceptable to me. I told <a href="walter-sabatini.html">Walter Sabatini</a> he was becoming poisonous and I wanted him gone, and Rudi and Walter agreed. It wasn’t about the money; it was about having character in our locker room. We are in a very sound financial position</p>

  <p><b>[Roma have warned the likes of Liverpool, Barcelona and Real Madrid that they have no intention of selling Alisson and Cengiz Under]</b> It’s frustrating for me because people believe Roma is a supermarket. We do not want to sell players; these guys are on long-term contracts and we have no intention of them leaving the club. They have been incredible with us from day one and this season they have both been fantastic, they have big futures - just like Patrik Schick. Monchi faces the difficulty of financial fair play but we have identified a plan and strategy to continue to improve the team.<br /><br />It’s true that Barcelona have an interest in the player. Bayram Tutumlu <b>[Under’s agent]</b> has a strong relationship with Barca and he informed me that there is definitely an interest there. We have not received any offers for the player but it would not surprise me if he was being tracked - he is a young, talented player who is scoring a lot of goals</p>

People tell me it’s a bit like David against Goliath, but I don’t agree: we can play against anyone. My players have nothing less than the Catalan ones. If I think with my head, I say it’s hard, but if I do it with my heart, I think we’ve got a chance of success.</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool and Real Madrid have been warned that a sack of money will not be enough to land in-demand goalkeeper Alisson]</b> Alisson? I don’t have any intention of selling Alisson. I know that several clubs have said that they want him, Liverpool being one of them, but he has a contract with us. I’m sure some team will come up with a sack of money to sign him, but for now the decision lies with the coach and Monchi, and we don’t want to sell him. He’s an important pillar, with whom we want to build. We want players like him. Sales? If we thought about selling <b>[Miralem]</b> Pjanic and <b>[Mohamed]</b> Salah, it was because we didn’t have a choice. We didn’t suddenly say ‘we want to sell Pjanic’, it wasn’t like that. If I’d spent more time with him and if he’d said that he wanted to stay, I’d have tried to convince him to stay, although maybe we’d have sold him anyway. Salah wanted to go to test himself in the Premier League. We’ve sold a lot of players in recent seasons, but it’s not something I want us to do now.</p>

  <p><b>[Roma chairman James Palotta has joined their voices to the chorus of those calling for Video Assistant Referees to be added to the Champions League]</b> It’s absolutely clear that VAR is needed in the Champions League because you just can’t let stuff like this go. You can all look at it yourself on the film. I know it’s difficult to ref, but it’s really embarrassing when we lose on aggregate like that. By the way, it should have been red card, which would have been 10 men in the 63rd minute. Again, Liverpool’s a great team - congratulations going forward. But if we don’t get VAR in Champions League stuff like this is an absolute joke.</p>

  <p><b>[Roma coach Eusebio Di Francesco has signed a contract extension to keep him with the Serie A club until 2020]</b> Last summer, when we appointed Eusebio, I went on record as saying that we wanted someone who could come in and get the very best out of our first-team players and also help bring through some of our great young talent.<br /><br />I think it’s clear that he achieved both those objectives in his first season here as coach. It’s important to have the continuity and stability that Eusebio brings to the project and the contract extension that he has signed is testament to our belief in his abilities to take Roma forward</p>

  <p><b>[AS Roma chairman James Pallotta says he wants 22 guys like Aleksandar Kolarov]</b> There’s no question for me he is just the absolute ultimate professional. Every single day he is the first guy in there, he’s pretty much the last guy to leave. He’s just a tough, tough footballer. He doesn’t go on social media, he’s not out drinking, he just plays hard and he trains hard. And sometimes he’s going to make a mistake like all of us do. I hope the fans realise that guys like him, you want to have 22 guys like that in your team! You just know the guy is going to go out there and bust his ass. He doesn’t complain, and when he is injured he still wants to go out there.<br /><br />I’m not <b>[happy]</b>, because I feel we should be in second or third when you really look at it. We gave up an awful lot of points this year, and near the end of games. That’s been pretty frustrating for me. Going 3-0 up against Atalanta and then tieing it. If I look at it - and even if we just take two-thirds of the points that I think we messed up on - then we would be pretty close to second place with Napoli. So I’m not happy from that point of view at all. We have to, the next bunch of games, just do our job. Hopefully, we are healthy and, you know, finish in the top four.</p>

  <p><b>[Roma president Pallotta slams VAR decisions in Porto defeat]</b> Last year we asked for VAR in the Champions League because we got screwed in the semi-final and tonight, they’ve got VAR and we still get robbed. Patrik Schick was clearly clipped in the box, VAR shows it, and nothing is given. I’m tired of this crap. I give up.<br /><br />It is very clear VAR is needed in the Champions League because you just can’t let stuff like this happen. You can all look at it yourself. Stephan El Shaarawy in the 49th minute wasn’t offside and he gets taken down by the goalie; the 63rd minute was a handball that was obvious to everyone probably in the world except people on the pitch; the 67th minute Schick gets taken down in the box. I know it is difficult to ref but it is really embarrassing that we lose on aggregate like that. By the way, it should have been a red card which would have been 10 men in the 63rd minute. Liverpool are a great team, congratulations going forward, but if they don’t get VAR in the Champions League stuff like this is an absolute joke.</p>

We have one objective remaining this season and that is to finish in the highest possible league position and secure qualification for the Champions League. At this stage of the campaign, it was important to bring in a coach who knows the club, understands the environment, can speak the language and is able to motivate the players. Claudio ticks all of those boxes and he’s very excited to take on this challenge.</p>

  <p><b>[Roma president James Pallotta has hit back at former sporting director Monchi for suggesting he left the Italian club because of disagreements between the two]</b> I was kind of surprised to read Monchi say at his press conference that he wanted to go one way and I wanted to go another way. I appreciate that Monchi never set out to fail at Roma but I want to make something very clear: right from the start, I was very clear about the direction I wanted us to go in and that’s why we spent a lot of money bringing Monchi in. From the start, I said I wanted first class coaches, first class performance staff, first class medical staff, first class scouting and recruitment and a first class football organisation. I gave Monchi the keys to deliver that. I gave him 100% control to appoint the coach he wanted, to employ the assistant coaches and the performance staff, to manage the scouting and to bring in the players he wanted. If you look at our results and our performances, it’s clear that this hasn’t worked<br /><br />In November, when our season was going from bad to worse and everyone could see that the coach was struggling to get a reaction out of the players, I asked Monchi for his Plan B should things continue to get worse. He had sole responsibility for football operations at Roma but he didn’t have a Plan B. That was November. He said his Plan B was just to keep doing the same as Plan A. So, if I read or listen to the radio interviews he’s giving where he says that the idea of the ownership was different to his and that is why he left, please let me know what Monchi wanted to do differently? He asked me to trust him and let him do it his way. We gave him complete control and now we have more injuries than we’ve ever had and are in danger of missing out on finishing in the Top 3 for the first time since 2014</p>

  <p><b>[Daniele De Rossi is to bring an 18-year career at Roma to a close this summer]</b> For 18 years, Daniele has been the beating heart of AS Roma’s team. From his debut in 2001 to taking on the responsibility of the captain’s armband, he always represented the Roma fans on the pitch with pride as he established himself as one of the best midfielders in Europe. We will all shed tears when he pulls on the Giallorossi shirt for the last time against Parma but we respect his desire to prolong his playing career - even if, at almost 36, it will be away from Rome. On behalf of everyone at Roma, I’d like to thank Daniele for his incredible dedication to this club and ensure him that our doors will remain open for him to return to the club in a new role whenever he wants.</p>

He deserves respect and I have always respected him. The notion that Daniele was out to get <a href="eusebio.html">Eusebio</a> <a href="eusebio-di-francesco.html">Di Francesco</a> sacked is 100% false from all of my conversations with him. In fact, with 12 games left in the season, I had a phone conversation with Daniele and he personally asked me to keep the coach until the end of the season. So if anyone is suggesting that he was asking for <a href="eusebio-di-francesco.html">Di Francesco</a> to be sacked, that couldn’t be further from the truth. If not <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">De Rossi</a>, did <a href="edin-dzeko.html">Dzeko</a>, Manolas or Kolarov ask for the coach to be sacked? No. I’ve never heard any of those players say that they wanted us to sack <a href="eusebio-di-francesco.html">Di Francesco</a>. They never came to me either directly or indirectly.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">De Rossi</a> will be leaving Roma 18 years after making his professional debut for the club in the off-season]</b> We may have had some differences of opinion on how his playing career at Roma has ended but I’m not going to get into that in the public domain; that’s between Daniele and myself. Daniele was emotional but he’s emotional because he cares and has cared about Roma forever. He plays with his heart - we’ve seen it for 18 years with Roma. Was he upset that someone was being brought in to play in his position, as stated in the article? Yes, he was - but that was because a day before he was told by <b>[former sporting director]</b> <a href="monchi.html">Monchi</a> that we weren’t bringing in somebody</p>
