  <p><b>[James Pallotta on Mehdi Benatia]</b> <a href="medhi-benatia.html">Mehdi Benatia</a> has obviously continued with his pattern of outright lies over the last couple of months. We had a verbal agreement on compensation and a raise back in July in Boston. He personally said to me that he was happy after I told him flat out, with no exceptions, that we wanted him to stay. Over the following month he lied about wanting to stay and about the details of his compensation to both <a href="rudi-garcia.html">Rudi Garcia</a> and his team-mates. Lying to me was one thing which I can somewhat handle. Lying to <a href="rudi-garcia.html">Rudi Garcia</a> and his team-mates was completely unacceptable to me. I told <a href="walter-sabatini.html">Walter Sabatini</a> he was becoming poisonous and I wanted him gone, and Rudi and Walter agreed. It wasn’t about the money; it was about having character in our locker room. We are in a very sound financial position</p>

  <p><b>[James Pallotta on Roma’s decision to appoint women’s football legend <a href="mia-hamm.html">Mia Hamm</a> as the club’s new director]</b> The potential of having Mia on the board of Roma to me was a no-brainer. What she’s forgotten about football over the last 30 years I still have to learn</p>
