  <p><b>[Kevin Phillips about introducing <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> star <a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Riyad Mahrez</a> to the ways of English football]</b> It was cruel to be kind. If we’d have kept giving him foul after foul that’s what he would have expected at the weekend. We wanted to see a reaction. To begin he was a bit sulky, but as time went on he learnt to deal with it. He grew to know when to pass or when to take someone on<br /><br />When I went into coaching the amount of times I had to tell him to go home or leave the ball alone, because he’s a kid who just loves football. It is refreshing to see<br /><br /><b>[<a href="riyad-mahrez.html">Mahrez</a>’s English was scarce at first, but player liaison officer Jon Saunders helped him settle and find an apartment, while Anthony Knockaert, <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>’s other French player, offer friendship]</b> You have to give credit to Anthony Knockaert because Riyad was there to take his place. He helped him off the pitch, they did everything together. I think they still remain good friends</p>

  <p><b>[Wilfried Zaha may not get the move away from Crystal Palace that he reportedly wants]</b> At times he would run down cul-de-sacs and players used to double up on him, sometimes even three players and he would still try to take them on. But when you watch his game now, he has learnt that he can track one or two players and he can pop it the other side and go again. His finishing has improved, but it can get better. His end product and his crossing can get better, but he is 100 times better now. For me, he is an outside winger, when he is running at people and cutting in, whether it is from the right or the left. He can play both. He played on the right when I played with him. He has got the ability to go both ways. He is right footed, but he can cross with his left foot, and he can finish with his left foot as you have seen this season. The only question mark is who would spend £60m or £70m for him</p>

Those world’s best players want to come and play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>. He plays a certain style and he will not buy someone unless it fits his system. The obvious one is <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a>. If Villa go down I am certain he will move on<br /><br />Could he play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>? He is the only one out of the bottom three or four teams that could fit in that team. They will certainly be targeting players from top abroad teams and around the world</p>

  <p><b>[Former Sunderland and <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> striker Kevin Phillips has predicted that <a href="pablo-zabaleta.html">Pablo Zabaleta</a> will leave the London Stadium when his contract expires in June]</b> I think this is his last season in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He has been an unbelievable servant for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and has done a great job down at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> with his experience. <a href="pablo-zabaleta.html">Zabaleta</a> will be allowed to move on and he will probably end up in China, finish his career out there on unbelievable money. He will not be a <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> player next year. The player strikes me as having great attitude and he looks like he loves playing football. He will not be guaranteed a game next year so he will want to go somewhere where he can play week in, week out.</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Phillips says <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> would like to be one of those Steven Gerrards and spend his entire career at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>]</b> I am not sure about this because <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> loves Villa so much so it really would not surprise me if he wants to stay with his boyhood club in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I can see him being one of those Steven Gerrards. On the other hand, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> look like they are really going to have a go and sign some players to get them back to where they once were. It is difficult. If I am <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> and I had the chance to go to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, I would go. Simple as that. No matter what league I am in. But he is such a diehard Villa supporter, a local lad so I could see him staying.
