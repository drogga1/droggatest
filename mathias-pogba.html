They are missing my brother and I think he needs another midfielder. Of course, Florentino <b>[Perez]</b> can get him, nothing is impossible in life. I don’t think he’s worth €200 million, but now the football world is like that, Manchester are going to ask for a lot, but not €200m. It’s a delicate situation but the player has his personal goals, if you have to leave, well, that’s it.<br /><br />I can’t assure you that he is going to stay at United. We know he wanted to move, but he’s not to blame. He’s waiting. He works hard and we’ll see what happens. In football, you never know. Until September 2 everything can happen. My brother’s dream is to win the Champions League<br /><br /><b>[Despite his struggles, Mathias is sure his brother will remain professional in his current surroundings rather than force a move]</b> Paul will never do as <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, he is not a professional.

It’s not easy right now, because he has a lot of responsibility in the team. A lot of big players have left.
