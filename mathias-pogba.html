  <p><b>[Paul Pogba would strengthen Real Madrid if he makes the move from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> I feel my brother could help any team. If he plays for Madrid, he will help Madrid. I always want what’s the best for my brother. If he feels Real Madrid is the best club for him, he will come<br /><br /><b>[Guinea international Mathias, 28, completed his own move to Spain over the weekend, signing for fourth-tier Manchego Ciudad Real after a spell at Tours in France]</b> I’m in Spain because I want to be and it has nothing to do with the possibility of my younger brother securing a move. We can’t do anything about the rumours</p>

  <p><b>[Mathias Pogba says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> midfielder Paul Pogba is ‘waiting’ for Real Madrid to launch a formal offer for his services]</b> <b>[<a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine</a>]</b> <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> is one of the greats and I think that if the club give him what he wants, he won’t have a problem, but if they don’t give it to him, he’s going to have a hard time because what he wants is not going to happen, because right now it’s a little late. They are missing my brother and I think he needs another midfielder. Of course, Florentino <b>[Perez]</b> can get him, nothing is impossible in life. I don’t think he’s worth €200 million, but now the football world is like that, Manchester are going to ask for a lot, but not €200m. It’s a delicate situation but the player has his personal goals, if you have to leave, well, that’s it.<br /><br />I can’t assure you that he is going to stay at United. We know he wanted to move, but he’s not to blame. He’s waiting. He works hard and we’ll see what happens. In football, you never know. Until September 2 everything can happen. My brother’s dream is to win the Champions League<br /><br /><b>[Despite his struggles, Mathias is sure his brother will remain professional in his current surroundings rather than force a move]</b> Paul will never do as Neymar, he is not a professional. My brother is a professional, he has a contract with the club and as long as he does not sign for another club he will do his best<br /><br /><b>[Paul Pogba endured a fractious relationship with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> before the Portuguese was sacked in December last year]</b> Who is <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>? ‘No, a player does not always have to be with his coach. If the coach is not with his players, his players do not have to be with him. He <b>[<a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>]</b> was not with the team and the team was not with him</p>

In football you never know. He is very well, as always. No one expects me to say something bad about United. He is a professional and his present is there. The future?

  <p><b>[Mathias Pogba has suggested that the World Cup winner will see out the season in England, but feels a lack of talent is holding <a href="manchester-united.html">the Red Devils</a> back]</b> Paul knows that he cannot leave <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> so he’s going to focus on this season. It’s not easy right now, because he has a lot of responsibility in the team. A lot of big players have left. The only great player is David De Gea, the goalkeeper, which means he’s going to have to put a lot of effort in every game</p>
