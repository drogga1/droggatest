  <p><b>[Kyle Walker, who worked with <a href="gary-speed.html">Gary Speed</a> as a young player at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, was also full of praise for manager]</b> I heard the news yesterday morning when my mum called me and I was gutted. I worked with him at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> where he was a coach and it was a big step for me in my playing career. He was exactly as he came across, he was fantastic and it was a privilege to know him. My thoughts are with his sons and his family, my heart goes out to them. He was a great guy and this is a sad time</p>

I’ve learned a lot, especially under the current manager (Mauricio Pochettino), he’s been fantastic with me. But sometimes your path isn’t there and you have to move on and what a place to come and take a different path. Just win trophies - that’s all I’m about and all I want to do. Hopefully we win titles, that’s what I’ve come here for; the most important thing is actually winning a title<br /><br />What a manager to work under. I’m excited, and a little bit nervous, I’m not going to lie.<br /><br />It’s the next chapter in my career where I can go on and learn. I think I’m at a good age now where I’m probably at the peak of my career and I just want to try and be the best player I can be.

  <p><b>[Arsenal still ‘fierce rivals’ for Kyle Walker despite leaving Tottenham for Manchester City]</b> Spurs is a club which belongs to my heart and to get one over on their bitter rivals, and mine for a long time, would be a fantastic feeling. But it’s a game of football and anything can happen in 90 minutes. They’ve made some excellent signings in January which we need to be careful of, and we need to just say: ‘Let the best team win’<br /><br />Spurs will always have a place in my heart, they gave me a chance to play Premier League football and I’ll be forever indebted to them. But it was something I needed to do for myself, the manager told me of his plans for the season and I wanted to be a part of it. Working under Pep Guardiola, a chance like that doesn’t come along too often. That’s no disrespect to Mauricio Pochettino, but the people that Pep has worked with grow as players. Every game I see something and think ‘how have you done that?’ Playing behind Kevin De Bruyne you wonder what he’s seen when he makes a pass and it just comes off but it’s not only him, there’s a number of special players here. I think that’s put us where we are in the league, and coming into the cup final too. Tottenham were in a fantastic position when I left, they’d finished second twice, and people might ask why I left then and it was kind of a gamble, but it has paid off now. I gambled when I left QPR to go to Aston Villa half-way through the season when we were winning every Championship game, and that paid off. You just get a sense inside you and you have to go</p>

  <p><b>[Kyle Walker speaks about the Three Lions’ expectations for Russia 2018]</b> I hope we can go as far as we can go, but we need to be realistic. To win the World Cup is going to be a miracle, but we have got the players to do it. There are a lot of good teams out there and our record in tournaments has not been fantastic. We’ve had a lot of conversations inside the camp - England haven’t won a knockout game for God knows how many years <b>[their last victory was in 2006]</b>, so for us to go there and win a knockout game, that would be a step in the right direction</p>

  <p><b>[England defender Kyle Walker was bemused by the decision to give a penalty against him in the first half of the Three Lions’ World Cup triumph over Tunisia]</b> In the Premier League it probably wasn’t a foul, but in the World Cup it was. I got a call from Kieran <b>[Trippier]</b> to leave it so I tried to make myself as big as possible, and he ran into my arm. We have worked hard and all of us deserve those three points. We played some good stuff and created a lot in the first half. We are not the finished article. I’m not a big talker, I don’t like to voice my opinions but I said I will run and give everything for this team. It’s good to win. A pat on the back for us. There were ups and downs for me personally, but I think it <b>[the result]</b> just shows the work we have done for the last three weeks prior to the game. The important thing is we got the three points and it’s always nice to win it at the end.</p>

  <p><b>[Kyle Walker has lauded the management of Gareth Southgate following England’s World Cup exit]</b> The man’s a gentleman. That’s the best way to describe him. He’s lived in our shoes. He relates to us massively. He knows what to say at the right times and he makes you feel like you’re the best player in the world. He gives you that confidence. And I think he needs to take the most credit out of every one of us. We’re the guys that are running on the pitch but he’s the backbone of this team. He’s made sure everyone’s stuck together through good and bad moments and made sure our feet are on the floor. I can’t put into words how much credit he deserves for this.<br /><br />There’s still something massively to play for, to be the third-best team in the world, it’s a massive thing. And who would have thought that come the start of the tournament? Everyone was writing us off, everyone didn’t have much expectation about us. To get to there and be in a third-place play-off… it’s fantastic. We need to take that. There’s a big pat on the back for us and we’ve still got a very important job come Saturday to go and beat the Belgians and kind of get the bragging rights over them because they got one over us in the group stage<br /><br />I was there in France, at the Iceland game, and it was completely different to that. For them to still be singing, when we’re seeing friends and families chanting our names, seeing them chanting the manager’s name, it’s completely different. And I think we need to take full credit for that. We’ve changed that. I think the team’s brought the nation together. People are going out to pubs and celebrating it and everything like that and that’s what football should be about. It’s an enjoyable sport, we all love to play the game and fans love to support it. So it’s hats off to us but unluckily we couldn’t bring it home for them but hopefully there’s time in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City wing-back Kyle Walker has revealed he would have been stupid to snub an early return to club football]</b> To not be a part of this would have been stupid, for me to not want to come back. The gaffer gave me the option, he said you can either come back on August 6 after this, or you can come back and to play. There is no doubt in my mind that I wanted to be here to achieve what I have achieved. Luckily the risk paid off. Come Christmas I might be saying to you that I’m absolutely knackered, but that is just football. I’m not looking into the future, I take every game as it comes, and as long as I am on the pitch and playing football, that is what keeps me happy.<br /><br />I know the gaffer wants to win everything he possibly can and so do his players. We need to drive each other on. It’s up to us to achieve those dreams. We achieved big things, but we can’t stop there. We have to keep going and trying to improve, that’s individually and collectively. We set the bar last year. We set it so high that we have to try to raise it. Everyone in that dressing room is not going to settle for anything less this year and we want to pick up more trophies</p>

I wanted to tell you before I tell my agent that I want to leave this summer<br /><br /><b>[Walker does not think much of Pochettino these days]</b> I was hurt a lot by that. He said his door was always open and I thought it was a private meeting we had. So, I kept quiet but then he went and wrote about it… or his version of it. If he was going to do that he might as well have called a press conference and told everyone. He told one side of the story, but it’s a side of a story I don’t agree with. He said he had a witness in there, but he didn’t tell the correct story, no way</p>

  <p><b>[Kyle Walker says that Manchester United supporters have made a habit of approaching him and expressing their preference for Manchester City over Liverpool]</b> United fans are in a difficult situation obviously. When I’m out and about or walking my dogs, United fans are coming up to me saying, ‘We’d rather City win the league than Liverpool’. It’s strange to hear but I can assure you the United players aren’t going to leave a red carpet and say, ‘Go on City, score past us’. They’re going to make it difficult because it’s a game of football and they’re fighting for the top-four as well so they need the points.<br /><br />Obviously we could have won it against them last season and they scored a couple of good goals and got the victory. That was probably what every United fan wanted with City not winning the title at the Etihad against United. We don’t owe them one because we won against them <b>[3-1]</b> earlier in the season but it’s one for the fans and it’s one for us to get closer to being the Premier League champions</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> defender Kyle Walker hopes <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> season can resume]</b> Football has to take a back step for now because that is the least important thing on everyone’s mind in the football world. The health of family members and other people’s family members is the most important. But, I hope, and I am sure everybody else hopes, that football will come back and we will be able to finish off the season, but if it is not a possibility, then everyone does understand that people’s health is more important than a game of sport.<br /><br />Obviously Pep is not in the group chat! I dropped him a text message last night saying hope you are ok, and I hope the family is well and fair play for donating the amount of money that you have donated. That says a lot about him as a person. Put football aside, that has come from his heart and it is something that should definitely be recognised</p>

Footballers are global role models, and our staff and players have been working to support the incredible efforts of the NHS and other key workers in fighting the effects of the COVID-19 Coronavirus, in any way we can. Kyle’s actions in this matter have directly contravened these efforts. We are disappointed to hear the allegations, note Kyle’s swift statement and apology, and will be conducting an internal disciplinary procedure in the coming days</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> right-back Kyle Walker has issued an apology for breaching the UK government’s coronavirus protocols]</b> I want to take this opportunity to issue a public apology for the choices I made last week. I understand that my position as a professional footballer brings the responsibility of being a role model. As such, I want to apologise to my family, friends, football club, supporters and the public for letting them down</p>

  <p><b>[Kyle Walker defends himself after breaking lockdown to visit family]</b> I feel as though I have stayed silent for long enough. In light of the most recent article published about me and my family, I feel as though I have no choice but to address things publicly. I have recently gone through one of the toughest periods of my life, which I take full responsibility for. However, I now feel as though I am being harassed. This is no longer solely affecting me, but affecting the health of my family and my young children too. In relation to the events on Wednesday, I travelled to Sheffield to give my sister a birthday card and present, but also to speak to one of the few people I believe I can trust in my life. She hugged me to remind me how much she cares and that I am loved. What am I meant to do - push her away?<br /><br />I then travelled to my parents’ house to pick up some home-cooked meals. Again, it’s been an extremely tough couple of months for them: everything I’ve gone through in my life they have gone through with me. What have my parents and sister done to deserve their privacy being invaded by photographers following me to their homes? I constantly feel as though I am being followed. I don’t even feel safe in the confines of my own home - why should they have to feel like that too? Who deserves that?<br /><br />I am in a privileged position as a role model and a professional athlete, and can assure you from my upbringing that I do not take it for granted. But at what stage do my feelings get taken into consideration? My family has been torn apart, this has been dragged through the press, and I ask: when is enough enough? At a time when the focus is understandably on Covid-19, at what point does mental health get taken into consideration, an illness which affects every sufferer differently? I am a human being, with feelings of pain and upset just like everybody else. Being in the public eye as a professional athlete does not make you immune to this. It is sad, but I feel as though my life is being scrutinised without any context. I understand if people are upset or angry with me, but it was important for people to have a better understanding of my life. Thank you for taking the time to hear my feelings</p>

  <p><b>[Kyle Walker exclusive: <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> can beat anyone in the world as historic treble chance looms]</b> We’ve come back and hit the ground running. I think the momentum is on our side, we’ve got the rhythm, players are looking sharp, feeling great, and hopefully we can just continue this great form we’re on and take it into the competitions we want to win.<br /><br />We all believe in ourselves, we all believe in the manager, his philosophy, his way of playing. I feel on our day we can beat anyone in world football. It’s going to be a very exciting six weeks. In my first season I picked up three trophies here, and in my second season I picked up four. Obviously we’re just missing the Champions League, that’s the only one I haven’t got<br /><br />Missing out on <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> was a big blow for us as a team, but you have to take your hats off to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, they played fantastically well throughout the season and deserved it, so fair play to them. But hopefully now we can go and do what they did last year by winning the Champions League, and put all our eggs into that basket now<br /><br />I think it would come on par. I think last year gets really overlooked in terms of what we’ve achieved. Our first season we got 100 points, and that was: ‘Oh my gosh’, but to kind of conquer England last year, take everything, we thought that was a massive achievement for the team and where we’ve come from. To win it back-to-back, something a team hadn’t done for many years<br /><br />But I think if we win the Champions League it would be right among that, because it’s something I feel this club needs to step up again into the right direction. We’ve proved we can be <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> winners, but one thing missing is the Champions League, and that’s one thing us as players want, and definitely what the manager wants again.<br /><br />It’s strange because when I first signed here and someone would have asked me what do you want … <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or Champions League? And for me it was <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Obviously it’s all I’ve grown up watching. But now I’ve got that, and have two of them, which I’m fortunate to have, I do really want this.<br /><br />I do think for some of the players in there, it’s to kind of finish their career - the likes of <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>, <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> - and not have picked up a Champions League, for the types of players they are, I think that’s the least we can do and we owe it to them. And as well we owe it to this club, which has supported each and every player to achieve what they wanted to achieve. For the club I think it’s what they need as well<br /><br />Obviously the news is what we all want, and what we all deserve, because this club has worked hard, especially us as players, to get to where we are. I think the right decision has been made, but we’ve just had to concentrate on football, do what we do on the pitch, and let people who are a bit higher up than us deal with the legal side of it.<br /><br />It’s what we deserve. I think the players in the changing room are world-class, and we want to be competing at the very highest level, which is the Champions League<br /><br />This year was always going to be tough, and I felt in some games we’ve just thrown points away. No disrespect to the likes of <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>, but we shouldn’t really be going down there and losing. But we will come back stronger, we’re hungry to not just sit on what we’ve done, we want to build on that<br /><br />You have to show your appreciation for what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have achieved this year, and the way they’ve done it; they’re not just three or six points clear, they’re a lot of points clear of us, and that just shows they are deserved winners. Since then, it’s about being professional; they’ve won the league, but let’s not make the gap silly. Let’s try and close the gap down</p>
