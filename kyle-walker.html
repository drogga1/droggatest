  <p><b>[Kyle Walker, who worked with <a href="gary-speed.html">Gary Speed</a> as a young player at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>, was also full of praise for manager]</b> I heard the news yesterday morning when my mum called me and I was gutted. I worked with him at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> where he was a coach and it was a big step for me in my playing career. He was exactly as he came across, he was fantastic and it was a privilege to know him. My thoughts are with his sons and his family, my heart goes out to them.

To win the World Cup is going to be a miracle, but we have got the players to do it. There are a lot of good teams out there and our record in tournaments has not been fantastic. We’ve had a lot of conversations inside the camp - England haven’t won a knockout game for God knows how many years <b>[their last victory was in 2006]</b>, so for us to go there and win a knockout game, that would be a step in the right direction</p>

  <p><b>[England defender Kyle Walker has signed a two-year contract extension to keep him with Manchester City until 2024]</b> I’m thrilled to have signed a new deal. Playing for City has been everything I’d hoped it would be and more. It was an easy decision. I want to be competing for trophies, playing at the highest level, and I feel I have improved hugely as a player during my time here. The club’s vision - both on and of the pitch - matches mine perfectly and I’m looking forward to spending the next five years here, hopefully winning more silverware.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City’s game-winner Kyle Walker said his rare goal felt great, but the fact it secured three <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> points in a come from behind 2-1 win against Southampton was more important]</b> It <b>[the goal]</b> is a great feeling that I can contribute but more importantly it was about the three points. Anyone could have scored, I didn’t care who it was. It was just a case of hit it and hopefully get the ball in the back of the net. I don’t score many. We had to stick to our game plan, stay patient and it worked as we’ve come away with three points. It’s tough when teams put 11 players behind the ball. We have players who can spin a game on it’s head and we did that today<br /><br /><b>[Despite his moment of glory, Walker was keen to share the spolight with his team-mates]</b> The talent in the changing room is in abundance. I look around and I’m amazed sometimes at the amount of quality players we have. We have players who can spin a game on its head. We’ve got the quality. It’s about the mental strength of every player, and the older ones in the group try to keep things positive. We try to feed positive energy. We know it only takes one moment of brilliance to get a goal. Sometimes, your mind gets you over the line and that was the case. We kept knocking on the door and thankfully, the door opened for me!<br /><br /><b>[Their next <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> game is against LIverpool, who lead them by six points in the table]</b> We have a big game next week - we have to go to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and try and get something out of the game. I 100 per cent relish it. We know that their fans will be fully behind the team in the fight for the title, as we are</p>

There are still so many games to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Obviously, a lot of people talk about the title race, but anything can happen in football as you have just seen. We just need to keep doing our job, keep getting the three points and that’s all we can do really<br /><br /><b>[City turned around a 1-0 deficit at the Etihad to overcome Southampton and keep the pressure on <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> thanks to a last-minute goal from Walker.

They got one shot and they put it in the back of the net. That’s football. We had most of the ball possession and we caused their keeper lots of problems. I think the key was our patience and persistence, also being positive. Luckily, I was there at the right time. We know we have a very important week before the break so we have to stay positive and work hard for the next game, and then after doing our job in the week we will focus on Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[Kyle Walker believes that the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> ‘family’ will pull together to rescue their title challenge]</b> I have just said in there: ‘I look at you guys, you are my family’. I see the lads on the bus more than I see my own kids. We are going to experience ups and downs throughout our playing careers together at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. Fortunately up to now it has been plain sailing. We have gone on and done what we have done. We are only human. We don’t go on to the pitch expecting to draw or lose but there are going to be mistakes in games. Some things will cost you games. But now I feel we have got to pull together as a squad and get the belief going again and make sure we do go on a run to put some pressure on the people above us<br /><br /><b>[Last season a defeat at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> proved to be a turning point, as City went on a 14-game winning streak to win the title by a single point]</b> That is what it will take. The points gap is getting bigger now. We know we have the ability in the squad to go and do what we have done two seasons running. Hopefully we can do it again. We have to take our hats off to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at this moment in time. They have been fantastic and credit where it is due. They deserve to be top but it is not over until it is over as they say. We have the ability in the dressing room to go and catch anyone on our day. We have to take it game by game and keep chalking them off, getting three points and moving to the next one<br /><br /><b>[Walker says they can’t use injuries as an excuse for their disappointing form]</b> They are a great miss - both individually and collectively for the team. If you look back to our first season <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> and Nico Otamendi played centre-half for most of the campaign and we destroyed the league. If you look at last season compared to the season before, Bernardo Silva didn’t play but he comes back and gets player of the season. With the quality we have anyone can come in and fill the spots. We are missing these players because they are good players. But there is more than enough ability on that bus to go and frighten any team</p>

The health of family members and other people’s family members is the most important. But, I hope, and I am sure everybody else hopes, that football will come back and we will be able to finish off the season, but if it is not a possibility, then everyone does understand that people’s health is more important than a game of sport.<br /><br />Obviously Pep is not in the group chat! I dropped him a text message last night saying hope you are ok, and I hope the family is well and fair play for donating the amount of money that you have donated.

  <p><b>[Kyle Walker defends himself after breaking lockdown to visit family]</b> I feel as though I have stayed silent for long enough. In light of the most recent article published about me and my family, I feel as though I have no choice but to address things publicly. I have recently gone through one of the toughest periods of my life, which I take full responsibility for. However, I now feel as though I am being harassed. This is no longer solely affecting me, but affecting the health of my family and my young children too. In relation to the events on Wednesday, I travelled to Sheffield to give my sister a birthday card and present, but also to speak to one of the few people I believe I can trust in my life. She hugged me to remind me how much she cares and that I am loved. What am I meant to do - push her away?<br /><br />I then travelled to my parents’ house to pick up some home-cooked meals. Again, it’s been an extremely tough couple of months for them: everything I’ve gone through in my life they have gone through with me. What have my parents and sister done to deserve their privacy being invaded by photographers following me to their homes? I constantly feel as though I am being followed. I don’t even feel safe in the confines of my own home - why should they have to feel like that too? Who deserves that?<br /><br />I am in a privileged position as a role model and a professional athlete, and can assure you from my upbringing that I do not take it for granted. But at what stage do my feelings get taken into consideration? My family has been torn apart, this has been dragged through the press, and I ask: when is enough enough? At a time when the focus is understandably on Covid-19, at what point does mental health get taken into consideration, an illness which affects every sufferer differently? I am a human being, with feelings of pain and upset just like everybody else. Being in the public eye as a professional athlete does not make you immune to this. It is sad, but I feel as though my life is being scrutinised without any context. I understand if people are upset or angry with me, but it was important for people to have a better understanding of my life. Thank you for taking the time to hear my feelings</p>

  <p><b>[Kyle Walker exclusive: <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> can beat anyone in the world as historic treble chance looms]</b> We’ve come back and hit the ground running. I think the momentum is on our side, we’ve got the rhythm, players are looking sharp, feeling great, and hopefully we can just continue this great form we’re on and take it into the competitions we want to win.<br /><br />We all believe in ourselves, we all believe in the manager, his philosophy, his way of playing. I feel on our day we can beat anyone in world football. It’s going to be a very exciting six weeks. In my first season I picked up three trophies here, and in my second season I picked up four. Obviously we’re just missing the Champions League, that’s the only one I haven’t got<br /><br />Missing out on <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> was a big blow for us as a team, but you have to take your hats off to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, they played fantastically well throughout the season and deserved it, so fair play to them. But hopefully now we can go and do what they did last year by winning the Champions League, and put all our eggs into that basket now<br /><br />I think it would come on par. I think last year gets really overlooked in terms of what we’ve achieved. Our first season we got 100 points, and that was: ‘Oh my gosh’, but to kind of conquer England last year, take everything, we thought that was a massive achievement for the team and where we’ve come from. To win it back-to-back, something a team hadn’t done for many years<br /><br />But I think if we win the Champions League it would be right among that, because it’s something I feel this club needs to step up again into the right direction. We’ve proved we can be <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> winners, but one thing missing is the Champions League, and that’s one thing us as players want, and definitely what the manager wants again.<br /><br />It’s strange because when I first signed here and someone would have asked me what do you want … <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or Champions League? And for me it was <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Obviously it’s all I’ve grown up watching. But now I’ve got that, and have two of them, which I’m fortunate to have, I do really want this.<br /><br />I do think for some of the players in there, it’s to kind of finish their career - the likes of <a href="david-silva.html">David Silva</a>, <a href="fernandinho.html">Fernandinho</a> - and not have picked up a Champions League, for the types of players they are, I think that’s the least we can do and we owe it to them. And as well we owe it to this club, which has supported each and every player to achieve what they wanted to achieve. For the club I think it’s what they need as well<br /><br />Obviously the news is what we all want, and what we all deserve, because this club has worked hard, especially us as players, to get to where we are. I think the right decision has been made, but we’ve just had to concentrate on football, do what we do on the pitch, and let people who are a bit higher up than us deal with the legal side of it.<br /><br />It’s what we deserve. I think the players in the changing room are world-class, and we want to be competing at the very highest level, which is the Champions League<br /><br />This year was always going to be tough, and I felt in some games we’ve just thrown points away. No disrespect to the likes of <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a>, but we shouldn’t really be going down there and losing. But we will come back stronger, we’re hungry to not just sit on what we’ve done, we want to build on that<br /><br />You have to show your appreciation for what <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> have achieved this year, and the way they’ve done it; they’re not just three or six points clear, they’re a lot of points clear of us, and that just shows they are deserved winners. Since then, it’s about being professional; they’ve won the league, but let’s not make the gap silly. Let’s try and close the gap down</p>
