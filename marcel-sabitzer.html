  <p><b>[Marcel Sabitzer believes that the Red Bulls will have to play to the best of their abilities]</b> It’s not a nice feeling to lose top spot after two games like these. We now need to pull together and get back on track. Going to Munich is never easy. We’ll prepare well, in order to get a result there</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> midfielder Marcel Sabitzer has opened the door to a possible move to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> Football lives on rumours. And when you play good games internationally, it’s normal that something like this comes up and there is interest. But right now, I’m only focusing on the upcoming tasks. Above all, I want to finish the season first. That’s my top priority. And then we’ll see how things stand. It’s definitely an appreciation of your performances. That feels good, and it’s fun right now. That’s why I would have liked to continue after the games against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. But I’ll try to keep going as hard as I can. I’m generally open to everything (regarding alleged interest from the Premier League). I don’t want to rule anything out. We’ll see.<br /><br />I’m doing very well financially here, too. It’s not my motivation to move there and build a money bin. I like playing for RB. But I have played in England a couple of times, with the national team as well, and the atmosphere inspired me. The way the fans read the game and cheer shows that they understand football. A tackle is sometimes cheered, as is a diagonal ball. I like watching <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and I can imagine that it’s fun to play there</p>
