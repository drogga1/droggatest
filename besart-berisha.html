  <p><b>[Melbourne City goalkeeper Dean Bouzanis will apologise to Melbourne Victory striker Besart Berisha after calling him a fucking gypsy]</b> Bouzanis admitted making the remarks out of ignorance; however, has since understood the seriousness of his comments. Once informed of the gravity of his actions, Bouzanis committed to redressing the offence at the earliest opportunity. As such, he will issue a formal and personal apology to the player and begin an appropriate educational course to rectify the gaps in his understanding.</p>

  <p><b>[Besart Berisha conceded he was very relieved to have scored the winner in Melbourne Victory’s 1-0 semi-final triumph over Brisbane Roar]</b> It was a great assist. He <b>[Ben Khalfallah]</b> was looking for me in the first half. He tried, he told me ‘I’m looking for these balls’ and in the end I was there … I’m very happy, of course. This is my job. I love to score goals, especially in the finals.<br /><br />The most important is, which team will be ready for this moment when the whistle starts in the final. We have experienced players in our team, who have played in finals, scored in finals - not just in A-League but in the Socceroos too - and that’s really important<br /><br /><b>[Berisha added of Victory’s performance against Roar]</b> We played great football, right from the first minute. I thought we had possession, every duel we won, every tackle we won. I think it’s one of the best games we’ve played <b>[this season]</b> I thought, and in the final that’s even better. I think it will help us now for the <b>[grand]</b> final</p>

  <p><b>[On Thomas Broich]</b> I don’t like to see him go. He’s fit. I mean if I see him, he plays like a 22-year-old man. I don’t know why he should go, he should stay and I just told him <b>[after the game]</b> I wish him all the best whatever he decides and I’m very sad to hear he’s not staying in Brisbane</p>

  <p><b>[The A-League returned last weekend after a five-month hiatus with plenty of positives and negatives to come out of the first weekend of games]</b> Derbies are very special, special to me and special to the supporters. Games like this, you have to be ready. It’s a special game. One thing is for sure, we are fit, we are strong and we are very confident going towards this game.</p>
