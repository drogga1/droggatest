<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ultimate journeyman Tim Melia savoring career year for Sporting KC]</b> It knocks you down in your place real quick being a pool goalkeeper. I think it makes you a little bit more appreciative of what we do every day. We get to play soccer for a living for as long as we can, and we really need to just appreciate that and be humble about it.<br /><br />You just have to be prepared, work as hard as you can and wait for that opportunity to come because it’s going to come short and quick, and you’ve got to grab it with both hands or it’s going to disappear.<br /><br />I was really raw, and I was just an athletic goalkeeper. If I’m sitting in the same situation <b>[as my coaches]</b> years ago, I’m not playing me anyway. Those guys deserved to play and got their stripes for a reason, and they should have been playing<br /><br /><b>[He spent a week and a half with FC Dallas at one point, and dressed for four matches when Sporting KC came calling. DC United summoned him for a playoff game that fall, only to send him home a day later]</b> That was a difficult time for sure. But that was the situation I was in, so I could try to make it as positive as possible and maintain a good attitude about everything or I could have been really negative. I just tried to be the best professional that I could, do whatever was asked of me and get myself out of that situation</p>
