<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Socceroos pair Robbie Kruse and James Holland have parted ways with Chinese Super League club Liaoning Whowin]</b> The PFA has provided ongoing support to James and Robbie following the club’s repeated failure to honour its contractual obligations to the players. The players had placed the club on notice to remedy the situation, however the club has failed to do this. As a result, both players have terminated their respective contracts for just cause, in accordance with FIFA regulations. As a consequence, they are now free agents and entitled to sign with clubs of their choosing.</p>

  <p><b>[Robbie Kruse thrilled with 50 Socceroos caps]</b> I think it’s <b>[50 caps]</b> a nice accolade for me to get. I’ve been through some really terrible injuries over the last five years or so. Unfortunately, I missed the World Cup and then did another injury when I finally got back for the Asian Cup. So that was disappointing and I’m very proud to be able to come back from those setbacks, and to get 50 caps for my country is a huge honour. I’ve been fit for a while now, so hopefully I can continue this and keep building and have good performances at the Confeds Cup and hopefully make the World Cup.<br /><br />I’m sure we’ll get the result we need <b>[against Saudi Arabia]</b> because we’ve been building the way we’ve been playing, this structure that we’ve been playing. A few little tweaks and we’ll really show what we’re capable of</p>
