  <p><b>[Ruben Sosa says Inter should be looking to keep <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> for another year]</b> I was with him in the hotel where he lived in Milan. For me he’s a great player, with a long career, especially with his national team, he’s very respected. He hasn’t been given the right time, he can’t play so little, he needs to stay on the pitch for several games, for ninety minutes. He needs time to go back to be the player he is. He needs two games to gain confidence, but he needs to do it whilst starting and playing the full game. I’d keep Alexis for another year at Inter. He’s a goal scorer, physically he’s very well and still has a lot to give. He’s a guy who has scored a lot of goals and will continue to do so.</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Sosa claims Financial factors may be driving <a href="lautaro-martinez.html">Lautaro Martinez</a> towards Barcelona]</b> I don’t know what he wants. He’s a guy who’s part of a great team like Inter. I don’t know what the players think, they go to a team for four years and after a year they want to change to get more money. They’re thinking a lot about money. He would be very useful for Inter, he’s a stellar reinforcement. <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> knows him very well, he also chooses players very well. Should he arrive, <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> would give hierarchy to the team as well as a plus of grit and dynamism. He’s a complete footballer</p>
