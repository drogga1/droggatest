  <p><b>[Omar Abdulrahman has stressed the importance of a win against Japan in Thursday’s crucial Group B 2018 World Cup qualifier in Al Ain]</b> Yes, all the matches are difficult no doubt, but this one is the key to move forward. Our previous win will give us confidence in our ability to defeat Japan again. Three points will enable us to move beyond them and approach the top of the group.<br /><br />We are counting on several assets to win the encounter. Playing at home and among our fans that support us always with all their might, motivates us to do well for them. We have the spirit of challengers and the ability to fight over the 90 minutes<br /><br />This generation of players has a lot of experience. We have fought a lot in the same competitive matches and this strengthens our confidence in dealing with all the circumstances and enough gives us incentive to reach the World Cup finals in order to fulfil our potential</p>

  <p><b>[Omar Abdulrahman lauds Khalid Eisa’s display in Al Ain’s win over Zob Ahan]</b> All the players contributed to the win especially goalkeeper Khaled Eisa who delivered a great performance but that is not strange for someone of his calibre. I hope he continues his good form for our remaining fixtures.</p>

  <p><b>[Omar Abdulrahman shines as Al Ain win Group C]</b> I may have a lot of opportunities from set-pieces this year and when the moments come I can take the chances. But I cannot do it without the help of my teammates.</p>

  <p><b>[Omar Abdulrahman reveals Al Ain players’ ‘vow’ before 6-1 win over Esteghal]</b> We vowed as players in the locker room at the Azadi Stadium last week, that we would be celebrating qualification to the next round with our fans after the return leg.<br /><br />We qualified thanks to the efforts of everyone and made six goals. To end the season by reaching the quarter-finals of the strongest tournament on the continent is positive but it is not consistent with the ambitions of the club. We used to get to this point in several seasons ago and the real achievement for The Eye is to strengthen the balance of local and continental tournaments</p>

  <p><b>[Omar Abdulrahman confident ahead of Thailand clash]</b> The national team still has a chance and we are playing in order to maintain this opportunity and increase our chances of qualifying. Most of the teams in Group B are still fighting for the qualification spots. I am confident that if we play the way we are capable of playing, we will prosper.</p>
