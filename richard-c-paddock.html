<blockquote>
  <p>The billionaire leader of the Future Forward Party, <a href="thanatorn-juangroongruangkit.html">Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit</a>, was ordered on Wednesday to submit to the police for questioning in the case, which initially opened four years ago. He is accused of helping protesters flee arrest at a demonstration and faces up to seven years in prison<br /><br />The summons <b>[of Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit]</b> came Wednesday, a day after Thailand’s Army chief, Gen. <a href="apirat-kongsompong.html">Apirat Kongsompong</a>, warned that the military would not tolerate threats against the country’s constitutional monarchy, in which the king is deemed head of state. Some considered his comments to be directed at Future Forward<br /><br />At one news conference, the commission’s president, <a href="ittiporn-boonpracong.html">Ittiporn Boonpracong</a>, told reporters that he could not work out the party list percentages because he did not have a calculator with him. At another, the commission released 208 pages of election data and told reporters to figure out the seat allocations themselves<br /><br />More than 5.6 percent of the votes cast were invalidated, including some for not being marked properly. If they had gone to a single party, that party would have finished sixth over all. Another 24 percent of the votes were spread among more than 70 other parties, fulfilling the military’s goal of fragmenting the vote<br /><br />In the 2011 parliamentary election, more than three quarters of the vote went to two parties, Pheu Thai and the Democrat Party, which finished second and fourth in last week’s election. (An election held in 2014 was ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court)<br /><br />The military has another edge, as well: the timing of the coronation of a new monarch, <a href="king-rama-x.html">King Maha Vajiralongkorn</a> Bodindradebayavarangkun, expected May 4 to 6. That is only a few days before the election results become official. And the effect, in a country with strict laws against criticizing the monarchy, has been to make pro-democracy leaders reluctant to stage any major protests before the coronation<br /><br />Palang Pracharat will hold about 118 seats in the House while the opposition Pheu Thai Party is likely to get about 137<br /><br />Mr. Verapat Pariyawong, the University of London visiting scholar, pointed out that the Constitution gives military-appointed officials the power to remove members of Parliament any time for violating broad ‘ethical standards’. The standards include adhering to democracy with the king as the head of state, pursuing the public interest over private interests and conducting oneself in an honest manner. Government officials and courts will have wide discretion under the law to decide what violates the ethics standards, he said</p>
