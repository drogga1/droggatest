  <p><b>[English <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> star and France international Florent Malouda felt moved to visit the country to support the Yele Haiti charity, founded by his friend, hip hop star Wyclef Jean. The <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> midfielder was stunned by what he saw]</b> We went to Port-au-Prince and it was chaos. People were trying to rebuild their lives but there was no water, no electricity. Some of the first tent camps on the road from the airport had already been destroyed by the wind<br /><br />I wondered how they could live in such difficult conditions. But when you spoke to people you could feel that, no matter what happens, they were still positive and they still believed in life. It was really inspiring<br /><br /><b>[For Malouda, Haiti’s love for soccer remains despite the crisis]</b> I’d say football must be their second religion. They know everything about football. They just love it. That’s the power of football. It’s all about joy and passion, and it lets them forget their problems</p>

  <p><b>[on <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>]</b> He is a legend. Playing with him was very easy, and he was the kind of guy you learn a lot from while training with him. He was a fighter, and you need that fighting spirit because not every game is going to be easy</p>
