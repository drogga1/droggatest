  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has been urged by Liam Rosenior to stop complaining about Manchester United’s transfer policies]</b> Instead of talking down about his centre-halves, maybe he should be saying that what he has is good enough. We speak about Guardiola and the money he’s spent, but the season he had a fantastic season <b>[in his first season]</b> and he had Vincent Kompany and Nicolas Otamendi who he didn’t sign himself. Sometimes as a coach you want to bring in the best players but sometimes as a coach you have to improve the players you have. We’ve seen the likes of Lindelof and Bailly be signed over the last two years - two young centre-halves that were probably thought of as coming into their prime now. Bailly I’m really impressed by but he’s been injured and Lindelhof hasn’t produced the form that he might have been looking for. Is that down to the player, or is that down to the environment, the tactical element of the team and the coaching that goes on? I’m looking over at Man City and seeing what Guardiola is doing with Otamendi who didnt play anywhere near the level until Guardiola came in. Part of coaching is getting the best from your players and I need to see that from Manchester United.</p>

  <p><b>[Derby first-team coach Liam Rosenior lifted the lid on <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>’s impact on the pitch and training ground]</b> He’s an outstanding player. You don’t realise how good he is until you work with him every day. He’s not a striker anymore, he’s a deep-lying midfield player - almost like a quarterback. He dictates the tempo, the flow of the game. We want to play from the back and dominate possession and he’s become a key part of that. What’s been great for me to witness is his effect on the other players around him. His standards in training and what he expects from others, it’s been a joy working with him. He came back from Washington and had a month’s break but he wanted to come straight in and get to know the lads. What shocked the players - it didn’t shock me - was his determination and drive to win. You need to be around it; it makes you a leader and winner<br /><br />He’s not a big talker - he does it on the pitch; he’ll have little one-on-one conversations - but he lets his football do the talking. We needed more leaders and characters, especially for the younger players. You need to have that competition, that winning ethic every day in training and Wayne brings that in abundance. It’s lifted everyone in the squad</p>
