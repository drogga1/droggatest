  <p><b>[Ex-Wigan Athletic Striker Julius Aghahowa Open To Nigeria Comeback]</b> Realistically, we have a number of very good young players who can deliver. As a human being I cannot predict what will happen tomorrow. If I am recalled, I will definitely answer. Anybody who does not want to sound political will tell you the truth. As for me, I never knew they would make it, not because I do not like Nigeria, but I must be sincere that I lost hope about them qualifying, because qualification was out of our hands. I did not like the team’s approach, especially that they had to wait till the last game before making it. So our qualification was a miracle, it was sheer divine intervention. Again, if you looked at the team critically, their results were not bad. They did not lose a game in the qualifying series, except they recorded too many draws. I think Tunisia’s leadership of the group from the beginning created tension among the coaches and the players. It is important for the team to commence early preparation, because this is crucial for success. I do not understand why some people are calling for the sack of Amodu. What else do we expect from a team who went through the qualifiers without losing a match? I cannot decide for the Nigeria Football Federation, but if we are to tell ourselves the truth, Amodu and his team should be allowed to stay. They have done well to be given the chance and should be given the required support to do more for the nation</p>

  <p><b>[Former Super Eagles and Wigan Athletic star Aghahowa explains why he shunned coaching]</b> First of all, I’ll say it’s not compulsory that after your football career you must be a coach. Looking at how some of my senior colleagues were treated during their time as coaches, that’s enough to discourage me from wanting to be a coach. Some of them were even owed until they died. May their souls rest in peace. Look at what is happening in the league. Is it the players that are hungry that you’ll go and coach? Even the coaches demand money from players before they’re given a chance to play, mind you most footballers are from poor homes and the hunger to succeed is very high because of where they are coming from. I am talking from experience. As for the football business, not too long ago I got licensed by the Nigerian Football Federation as an intermediary agent and I work with a lot of other agents to scout young talents across the country</p>
