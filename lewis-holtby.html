  <p><b>[Lewis Holtby on <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s visit to Tiraspol, which is a self-announced breakaway state]</b> I had never heard of Sheriff Tiraspol before – I thought they were from Northern Ireland! I only found out 20 minutes before we landed. I got told it was a country within Moldova. That was a new one for me, but it has improved my geography! I am very pleased to be here. I can tell my grandchildren that I played in a part of Moldova that isn’t Moldova</p>

  <p><b>[Lewis Holtby’s impassioned response to criticism after going to confront the Hamburg supporters following their loss to Wolfsburg]</b> I’ll tell you one thing, man: I work my backside off and I’m working my backside off. Come and watch us in training – look what I am doing. I don’t want to relegate HSV. I have some good games and, sometimes, I have a bad game too. I’m just trying to work my backside off, but I’m also just a human being, you know?</p>

  <p><b>[Following a serious injury to Sandro in January 2013, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> turned to a young and talented German by the name of Lewis Holtby to solve their injury woes. As he struggled to deal the pace and physicality of the football, Holtby was left frustrated by a lack of game time and, in hindsight, admits he reacted poorly]</b> It was definitely frustrating because I had good spells where I felt I deserved more game time. But I did expect more of myself, I had more expectations to succeed. I thought I had the quality but maybe I was a bit naive. I made too many rash decisions. I wasn’t as professional as I am now in a lot of things. There’s a lot of things that I’ve gained now over the years and I think if I was there now, I would act differently<br /><br /><b>[Fate has now brought him back to England, with Championship side Blackburn]</b> It’s never too late to come back to high standards like the beginning of my career. I used to play in the Champions League, for the national team. Then, you’re a hotshot. You always want to come back to that. I think I’ve still got that in my locker</p>
