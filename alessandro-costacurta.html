  <p><b>[AC Milan and Italy legend Alessandro Costacurta has praised Antonio Conte]</b> The most important thing is the coach. The coach is, for me, the best coach in the world and I think it’s showing in Euro 2016. Entering the Euros, the team was not so united, not so organised. After two or three training sessions I think the team improved. It’s about Conte, because the players are not so good, are not world class players, so the coach he is. For me Conte is the best in the world<br /><br />Italian coaches are always speaking about tactics, it’s our quality in Italy. We know the defensive way, but Conte brings something new about the offensive way. Against Belgium, against Spain we were good in transition with <b>[speed]</b>, with players always going in the box. It’s something new for Italian people, for Italian football</p>

  <p><b>[Neymar is a Ballon d’Or winner in waiting and currently a better player that Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> As for Neymar’s personality, I think he’s very similar to Ronaldo. He’s very active on social media but he doesn’t have the same qualities of Ronaldo. I think, more or less, they will make the same amount of goals at the end of their careers. Neymar is already Ballon d’Or material. Actually, I believe in this moment Neymar is better than Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi, he’s the best player in the world now, in 2017. If we take a look at his performances and we compare them with those of Messi and Ronaldo, I think Neymar is just better at the moment.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea boss Antonio Conte is the best option available to Italy in their ongoing manager search]</b> Of all the potential candidates, for me, Antonio Conte would be the best. I’m sure we will find a new man within a couple of months. I have not made my final decision yet. Conte has already been in charge of the national team but that does not mean that I will ignore people like Roberto Mancini, Carlo Ancelotti or even the likes of Claudio Ranieri, Gian Piero Gasperini or Marco Giampaolo. They would all do well</p>
