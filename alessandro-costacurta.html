Which players have won the most Champions League titles? Juventus ace Cristiano Ronaldo is tied in second place with the second-most number of UCL trophies at five, won during his time at Manchester United and Real Madrid. He joins the likes of AC Milan legends Alessandro Costacurta, Paolo Maldini and Clarence Seedorf as well as other Los Blancos giants in Hector Rial and Marquitos.</p>

You can start again from there. Until a few months ago, we all thought there were too many managers at Milan, too many people who would have been able to say something.<br /><br />We are talking about the removal of my brother; we know the quality and the temperament of Zvone. <a href="ivan-gazidis.html">Gazidis</a> is not stupid, let’s not forget what he has done. With Paolo by his side, I believe that Milan will return as winners, perhaps not soon, but they will return</p>
