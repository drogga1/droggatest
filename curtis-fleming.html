  <p><b>[<a href="ali-curtis.html">Curtis</a> Fleming on why <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> Rule is important]</b> I have been in work quite a bit since I stopped playing. I worked at Middlesbrough then went down to <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>. I have put in for some <b>[manager]</b> jobs and haven’t heard anything back. There has to be a transparency. A letter back to explain why you didn’t? For everybody. People say it isn’t racism so tell us why? Tell me why? I have coached for 16 years, I have played for 16 years, I have played at a decent level and coached decent players, very good players. Players better than me, that’s for sure. If my face doesn’t fit or it’s the colour of my skin then I have a problem. But if it’s because you’re bringing in <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>, then no problem. It’s why I think the <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> Rule is so important. I want to manage in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, why not dream? I want to manage Ireland. Why not dream? If I’m a young black coach tomorrow. If I keep hearing a mantra that black managers don’t get any jobs then I might as well go and play snooker with my mates. Then you are stopping a whole generation of future coaches<br /><br /><b>[He says he was hurt by the abuse he received as a player but feels, in today’s game, it is widely condemned]</b> As a coach, I haven’t experienced <b>[racism]</b> as much. Years ago, that’s the way it is. Now, I am willing and able to stop and look around and say ‘Excuse me, I heard that’ and report them. I think it’s unacceptable today. As a player, I have been at a few games where I am ‘black Irish this’ and getting spat at, couple of coins getting thrown at me. As a full-back, it wasn’t a very good position if you were a black player when you were running over to the touchline to get the ball<br /><br />The vitriol coming at you for the colour of your skin. It hurt. Sticks and stones can break your bones but words never hurt you? I’m not having that. Until you’re in the position when someone is making a monkey chant, saying going back to your country or spitting at you and stuff. Don’t tell me it doesn’t take a little bit of you away<br /><br />Now people are brave enough to point people out in the crowd and even some of the crowd are brave enough. There was a real willingness and want from the kids to go. They were the ones that were pushing. I wasn’t sure if they were thinking about it as much as that. It was quiet. There was no trouble. We felt like we were apart of something. It was quite inspirational. Education is the key. I think there has to be a story and people have to know the history. They are hearing it from other generations and reading in newspapers ‘Don’t talk to blacks’. I think education is the way for me</p>
