  <p><b>[Vieira was sent off for the second time in just four days at the start of the season against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Highbury</a>]</b> The day after the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game I spoke to the manager <b>[<a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>]</b>. What we talked about was enough for me to keep going and to want to stay at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. The sending off was frustrating. I said things straight after the game and that is the time when you are emotional. You can’t make an important decision when you are feeling like that. But I want to make one thing clear - I will never leave <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a><br /><br />I hear stuff after the game. I know that some players <b>[Darren Williams]</b> in the other team are told their job during the game is to wind me up. I feel sorry for managers who feel they have to do that.<br /><br />But I will never change because, basically, I don’t want to change. I really enjoy English football and the life in England. I am happy here. I am not going to leave a place where I am happy because of that. The ban has finished now and I am so pleased about that. All that happened, that is behind me. I will not forget what happened but all I want to do now is look forward with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because I feel we can have a fantastic season</p>

Losing Manu and <a href="marc-overmars.html">Marc Overmars</a> was a mistake of the club. Of course it was good business but it was a big disappointment for me. If we still had the same team now and put <a href="marc-overmars.html">Overmars</a> and Petit in it, we would be even better and stronger.

We have a really good team but that doesn’t stop us missing Petit and <a href="marc-overmars.html">Overmars</a>. They have contracts and if the club wants to keep them they can. If you want to win the Premiership and Champions League you have to keep your best players<br /><br />I have a contract with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> until 2004. But, as we know, anything is possible in football. From today I will say nothing more about my future<br /><br /><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> must now ensure they finish second in the Premiership and beat <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup final]</b> But I have to be honest. Even if we manage to reach these two objectives, I would qualify our season as average. In the championship we are 15 or 20 points adrift of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, so for me it’s really a season to be forgotten</p>

  <p><b>[When Ferguson want to buy Patrick Vieira]</b> I am in talks with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to make a decision about staying or not.

When you spend nine years at the club, like I did, it is a difficult decision to leave. But in the end you have to make a choice for your future. It was a very difficult decision, but I am happy with it<br /><br />I made the decision to leave because I felt it was time for me to have a new challenge.

It was just that I had the feeling I needed to grow and meet a new challenge, and I feel <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> was the best challenge for me<br /><br />I’d like to thank the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans. They have been fabulous. Even recently in the street they were saying ‘if you are going, then thanks for the last nine years’. That is really touching and it makes me feel that I gave my best for the club. I can go with my head held high.

  <p>My dream was to play in the World Cup and my dream was to play in the biggest team I can. My first advice <b>[for young players]</b> is not to be scared to make a move. I think it’s really exciting when you’re a young player that you have a big club who are interested in signing you. You have to make a decision to go and if you go and see that it doesn’t work, don’t be scared to move on<br /><br /><b>[Vieira looks back fondly at his time with the 23 man squad in 1998]</b> You had players who understood that the team comes first, who understand that <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinadine Zidane</a> was the main man, everybody understood where their place was. Being in the national team, being one of the 23 players was a dream. As a kid, all I wanted to do was to be with the national team.

He has the right to make this decision himself.<br /><br />If there really is someone who loves this club and wants this club to succeed, it’s Arsene. Then we can discuss how the team plays or something else, but I find that the criticisms that fall on Arsene on a personal level are difficult to accept. It may have been becoming a coach myself that makes me feel differently. I remember very well every time he refused the biggest clubs to stay at Arsenal. I know what I’m talking about, because the same clubs contacted me and told me, when I met them, that their number one goal was to bring in Arsene. He said no to everyone to stay at, and today people forget about it<br /><br />Let’s say that someday it might interest me. But one day. I cannot say anything more because there is nothing to say about it and I do not want to offend Arsene, whom I adore and for whom I have a lot of respect.

  <p><b>[French football’s fight against homophobia went worldwide on Wednesday as Nice’s 2-1 loss to <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> at the Allianz Riviera became the most high-profile game to date to be suspended because of displays of intolerance from certain sections of the crowd]</b> The referee was right to interrupt the match. It’s unacceptable. The message has been clear and the referee had no choice. Maybe he could have given us a little more time to go to see the supporters and ask them to remove the banners. But I hope that this won’t happen again, here or elsewhere<br /><br /><b>[Nice published an official statement condemning this ban and Vieira also spoke out against it]</b> It annoys me because it happens quite often. It’s a lot easier to give a ban to everyone than to have plans to control the few troublemakers. And I think football loses there</p>

It’s his passion, it’s his life. So, I hope he can find another club to coach. It didn’t work out with <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, maybe it will work out with another team</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> captain Patrick Vieira admits he feels sorry for <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a> and backed the midfielder to bounce back from recent drama]</b> I feel sorry for him because he <b>[was]</b> the captain and he’s going through a really difficult period and really difficult time at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I think we have to remind ourselves that he’s achieved a lot since he’s at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and he deserves a lot of respect. When you’re a player and don’t perform the way you expect, you get frustrated about yourself. And sometimes you say things or do things you regret. I find it really difficult a lot of ex-footballers have jumped on him and being really negative towards him - it’s too too easy. I know how good he is and he will come through this difficult period because he’s a strong man, he’s a good player. And he will show how good he is.</p>

  <p><b>[Vieira: It was really difficult for <a href="mario-balotelli.html">Balotelli</a> and I to work together]</b> Mario’s mindset was difficult for a collective sport.

Nothing came of it.<br /><br />It is a lot of pressure and expectation. People expect you to do well because you are a World Cup winner. But being a World Cup winner only gives you one or two weeks’ grace as a coach. My legacy and the confidence of the fans, the players, the people around the football club will come with what I deliver on the pitch - and I want people to talk about me as a coach, not as a player. The player was what I did and what I achieved. I am really proud of that, it is fantastic, but I put it to the side. I use it as an experience to talk to the players or give them advice, but I want people to look at me as a coach</p>

What is really interesting with <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> is that he brings the energy back and it looks like they are playing for the club, but for the manager as well, and I think that is really important<br /><br />I really don’t know what the future will be, but doing this job it was like being a player. I wanted to play at a high level, I wanted to play for the national team, I wanted to go to the World Cup, I wanted to play with the best players and there is no doubt as a coach I have the same kind of ambition. I would want to manage a team that will have a chance to win the Champions League, to play the Champions League competition. But at the moment, honestly, right here at Nice I am in the perfect place, perfect place because I can fulfil my ambitions, the club is really ambitious and the club give me the tools to grow as a manager, but to be a part of a winning team and to play good competitions as well. The team is growing up really fast, really quick and hopefully I can get my ambitions with <a href="nice-fc.html">OGC Nice</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[Why are European stars like Henry &amp; Stam choosing <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to revive their coaching careers?]</b> I just think that coaching in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is, of course, harder than in Europe. That is because of the salary cap and the roster, and the way you have to make things balanced in the squad, making sure you have the players you need. In Europe, if you want a player, you just go out and buy them. Here, you can’t do it unless you have all these certain criteria. It is really interesting, really fascinating. This is all about coaching as well - having the balance in your roster and spending your money the right way. I like it. I really do like it.</p>
