  <p><b>[Vieira was sent off for the second time in just four days at the start of the season against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Highbury</a>]</b> The day after the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game I spoke to the manager <b>[<a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>]</b>. What we talked about was enough for me to keep going and to want to stay at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. The sending off was frustrating. I said things straight after the game and that is the time when you are emotional. You can’t make an important decision when you are feeling like that. But I want to make one thing clear - I will never leave <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a><br /><br />I hear stuff after the game. I know that some players <b>[Darren Williams]</b> in the other team are told their job during the game is to wind me up. I feel sorry for managers who feel they have to do that.<br /><br />But I will never change because, basically, I don’t want to change. I really enjoy English football and the life in England. I am happy here. I am not going to leave a place where I am happy because of that. The ban has finished now and I am so pleased about that. All that happened, that is behind me. I will not forget what happened but all I want to do now is look forward with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because I feel we can have a fantastic season</p>

Losing Manu and <a href="marc-overmars.html">Marc Overmars</a> was a mistake of the club. Of course it was good business but it was a big disappointment for me. If we still had the same team now and put <a href="marc-overmars.html">Overmars</a> and Petit in it, we would be even better and stronger.

We have a really good team but that doesn’t stop us missing Petit and <a href="marc-overmars.html">Overmars</a>. They have contracts and if the club wants to keep them they can. If you want to win the Premiership and Champions League you have to keep your best players<br /><br />I have a contract with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> until 2004. But, as we know, anything is possible in football. From today I will say nothing more about my future<br /><br /><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> must now ensure they finish second in the Premiership and beat <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup final]</b> But I have to be honest. Even if we manage to reach these two objectives, I would qualify our season as average. In the championship we are 15 or 20 points adrift of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, so for me it’s really a season to be forgotten</p>

  <p><b>[When Ferguson want to buy Patrick Vieira]</b> I am in talks with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to make a decision about staying or not.

When you spend nine years at the club, like I did, it is a difficult decision to leave. But in the end you have to make a choice for your future. It was a very difficult decision, but I am happy with it<br /><br />I made the decision to leave because I felt it was time for me to have a new challenge. But that does not mean I was unhappy or that I was having a problem at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. It was just that I had the feeling I needed to grow and meet a new challenge, and I feel <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> was the best challenge for me<br /><br />I’d like to thank the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans. They have been fabulous. Even recently in the street they were saying ‘if you are going, then thanks for the last nine years’. That is really touching and it makes me feel that I gave my best for the club. I can go with my head held high. I did my best every day in training and in every match, and I left shaking the hand of <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> and Mr <a href="david-dein.html">David Dein</a>.

I got into football when I was in France – just playing on the street. A guy who was living not too far from our house saw me playing and asked me if I wanted to play in the system, in a club.

And when you look at their performance lately in the league it’s been good. I think this is a team who have a clear idea and a clear philosophy and I’m really looking forward to the game<br /><br />I think it’s just about the goals that we conceded. Obviously we conceded a few against them, but it was more about overall than just one specific game. I think we have to see how can I help the team make less mistakes and coming up with a way to not be in danger as much. I think jumping the line is one of them, but we still need to play and we’re going to play against the Red Bulls</p>

  <p><b>[On his team’s performance in Saturday’s 4-0 Hudson River Derby]</b> This is the reason why I’m really quite frustrated. I’m really frustrated about the competitiveness, about the desire we had on the field. You know, I’m prepared to accept that we can lose games, but the way we lost today, with the lack of conviction, the lack of competitiveness is something that I can’t accept.<br /><br />If I had the chance to change all the 10 players on the field, I would have done it at halftime. I wasn’t really happy with every single player on the field. I just made these two changes and tried to change the tactical side of the game and went three at the back, but it didn’t work.<br /><br />I don’t want to talk about a single player. I think it was tough for David. He didn’t have the support that he normally had. We didn’t play as well as we could from the back. I think it was more a collective nightmare than just an individual<br /><br />This is something I will have to reflect on. When you play the Derby you know that you will have to compete. We know the way that they are playing, and it will be important for myself, but overall for the players, as well, to reflect on that because if we want to bounce back; if we want to keep doing well in this league, we have to change the attitude because the attitude wasn’t good tonight</p>

  <p><b>[Why are European stars like Henry &amp; Stam choosing <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to revive their coaching careers?]</b> I just think that coaching in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is, of course, harder than in Europe. That is because of the salary cap and the roster, and the way you have to make things balanced in the squad, making sure you have the players you need. In Europe, if you want a player, you just go out and buy them. Here, you can’t do it unless you have all these certain criteria. It is really interesting, really fascinating. This is all about coaching as well - having the balance in your roster and spending your money the right way. I like it. I really do like it.</p>
