  <p><b>[Roma captain Francesco Totti has lamented the dropped points against Cesena in their <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> opener that ended in a 0-0 draw]</b> We wanted to win, but didn’t succeed. We knew it wouldn’t be easy against Cesena as newly promoted teams get carried away with enthusiasm. There are no easy opponents, Cesena confirmed this at the Stadio Olimpico. I regret this because I wanted to dedicate the victory to my friend Daniele, who is no longer with us, my thoughts right now are all for him. We weren’t lucky, we created a several chances but the ball just didn’t want to go into the goal. It’s clear, however, that we must improve. It’s just the first match, we have the opportunity to foget this slip up</p>

  <p><b>[Francesco Totti says that CSKA Moscow’s late equaliser against Roma left him feeling like he had taken a punch from boxing great Mike Tyson]</b> It’s like I took a punch from Tyson today because it was completely unexpected. Until then it had been perfect for me; I’d scored, we led 1-0 and were on the verge of qualifying. But then what happened has happened<br /><br />The only thing we did wrong was holding the ball. From that one slip we have been broken down, they make the cross, it takes a roll and unfortunately it went in. We must think only of ourselves now. We knew we were facing a difficult group, where nobody gave us a chance, but, going down to the last game, we have our fate in our own hands. And we will try to get the three points, in front of our fans, who will definitely give us a huge helping hand</p>

  <p><b>[Totti confirms Roma exit in explosive press conference]</b> I never had the chance to express myself. I was never involved in a genuine technical project. In the first year, that can happen. In the second, I realised what I wanted to do and we never got together, never helped each other. They knew my intentions and what I wanted, to give so much to this club and team, but they never wanted me to, in all honesty. They excluded me from every decision. I will now take other paths. At the moment another club owner wants to trust in me, I’ll always be ready. I am not here to point the blame towards one or the other. We had started a journey, it was not respected, so I am moving on.<br /><br />Everyone knows they made me stop playing. I had a six-year contract already as a director. I started quietly, realising it’s a completely different sphere to being on the field. Many promises were made and they were never kept. The main focus of certain people has been to remove Romans from Roma. Over the last eight years, since the Americans came in, they tried in every possible way to shove us to one side. As the years went on, they tried everything they could … It’s what they wanted and in the end, they succeeded. What I can say is that I will never hurt Roma. This is far worse than retiring as a player. Leaving Roma is like dying. I feel like it’d be better if I died</p>

If I was the President of Roma and had two icons like Totti and <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">De Rossi</a>, I’d put them in charge of everything. They have ethics; they know everything about what it means to be Roman and Romanista. Pallotta has surrounded himself with the wrong people and he only listens to them. Everyone makes mistakes, but if you make the same mistakes for eight years, you have to ask yourself some questions. Something clearly is going wrong.<br /><br /><b>[When asked about his future]</b> I won’t be left unemployed. I received some offers from Italian clubs, including one this morning.

It’s not that I wanted to play all the time or was trying to force anyone to play me. I didn’t want to ruin my time at Roma, so it was better to just retire rather than go somewhere else for a year. I am not stupid, I’m not 10 years old, but if I am in good shape physically and mentally, I can see during training that I still have a lot to give and I’m second to no one. I would’ve been happy just being part of the group in the dressing room, helping the coach during difficult moments, working with the younger players to pass on my experience. Every time I came off the bench, the stadium would light up and that atmosphere helped everyone. There’s an end to everything, I’m not dumb, but the problem is that some people told me it would be my decision and then shoved me to one side. I was upset, because I would’ve cut my leg off for Roma</p>

  <p><b>[Roma legend Francesco Totti has reiterated his admiration for <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> midfielder <a href="sandro-tonali.html">Sandro Tonali</a>, admitting he would like to become the teenager’s agent]</b> Now that I am intensely involved in scouting, I can only say that there are many good young players. <a href="sandro-tonali.html">Tonali</a> is the most talented of all. I will definitely do everything I can to persuade him to join my agency. If he is smart, he will come if he doesn’t want to stand still. But even then it still depends on the market and when football resumes<br /><br />He will become one of the strongest central midfielders in the world, like <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>, <a href="daniele-de-rossi.html">De Rossi</a> or <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>. He’s a mix between <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Pirlo</a> and <b>[Gennaro]</b> <a href="gennaro-gattuso.html">Gattuso</a> too. He has everything a player can have. He has an incredible change of pace, he’s technically good and he’s always calm, both in important games and in easy games.<br /><br /><b>[Aside from <a href="sandro-tonali.html">Tonali</a>, the 43-year-old revealed he is also excited about the prospects of another young player on his books, but would not reveal the player’s identity]</b> My team tells me about the players and I have the last word. I am currently looking after an attacker from Argentina, but I won’t reveal the name</p>
