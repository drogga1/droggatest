<blockquote>
  <p>[On Sir Alex Ferguson] Fergie had spent big the previous summer. It was the most expensively assembled side in the club’s history. There was a tremendous amount of pressure. United were expected to win the league. There was a run around Christmas they lost four in six and they scored one goal in those six games. Those were dire times. He was on borrowed time a little bit because he spent all that money and, if anything, they had gone backwards from the Ron Atkinson era. They lost seven or eight games before Christmas<br /><br />He was odds on to be sacked before the end of the season. Speculation was raging. The pundits in the paper were saying if they lost against Forest he wouldn’t survive. It was the cup run keeping him alive<br /><br />Their league form was still rubbish. They lost their next two games after. His job was still at risk there.<br /><br />Getting there and winning the trophy was a massive boost because it was the first one under Ferguson and it bought him that little bit more time. It did a lot to give that squad confidence. It was a crucial moment in United’s history<br /><br />Because they hadn’t played in European football for a while, the English style of play was new to those continental players they were coming up against. They were caught cold by it<br /><br />It wasn’t like they didn’t have the talent. It’s just that they were so burdened by the weight of expectation. When they started winning games the confidence blossomed from that. Barcelona were widely considered to be the best team in Europe. It was a huge shot in the arm. Winning those games was enough to get momentum<br /><br />Because of what Ferguson did, as we saw with Louis Van Gaal, winning the FA Cup is no longer enough. It still is a big trophy but Van Gaal could have finished fourth and probably kept his job. If you look at Mourinho it’s not enough United are winning but they have to win in a certain way. It shows you what a complex job it is to coach at that level. Every single game is a cup final</p>
