<blockquote>
  <p><b>[On Barcelona]</b> Barcelona were very narrow in that first half and tactically, Chelsea did better. Luis Suarez hardly saw hardly any of the ball, while Leo Messi was restricted to occasional, albeit still dangerous, bursts. But although Chelsea hit both posts through Willian and will take confidence from their showing, they have nothing to show for it. Barca, meanwhile, tend to grow late in matches and will be very much a threat after the break. In the Champions League this season, seven of their nine goals have come in the second half of games.<br /><br /><b>[On Barcelona]</b> Barcelona’s modern history changed when they knocked out Chelsea in the semi-finals of the 2008-09 Champions League. Pep Guardiola’s side went on to complete a treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League crowns and then won six out of six competitions as they added the two Super Cups and the Club World Cup. Current coach Ernesto Valverde has complained of the high expectations at Barca, saying that the fans and press all talk of ‘trebles and sextets’, but that is a measure of the club’s success in recent years. Quietly and without fuss, Valverde has done a superb job at Barca and there is treble talk again around the club with the team leading La Liga and in the final of the Copa del Rey too. This trip to Chelsea, against whom Lionel Messi has never scored, represents perhaps his side’s toughest test this season, but with an unbeaten record in La Liga and the Champions League, they will approach it with no lack of confidence</p>

  <p><b>[VAR slammed yet again as <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> see <a href="serge-aurier.html">Aurier</a> goal controversially ruled out]</b> Am in favour of VAR. Technology is a positive addition to cut out mistakes where possible, but while so many things aren’t checked or overturned, this is given as offside. Farcical and goes completely against the spirit of the law</p>
