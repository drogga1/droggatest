  <p><b>[Brendon Santalab feels Western Sydney Wanderers have come closer than any other team to ending Sydney FC’s unbeaten run]</b> You can’t avoid the hype of the derby, it’s a special game for the players, fans and everyone involved. It’s about staying cool and getting on with the job. When the whistle blows it’s win at all costs. It’s about keeping emotions intact and keeping cool and calm. It’s not always easy with 50-60,000 people, which will be amazing again.<br /><br />We take great confidence from that performance. That was the closest anyone has come to beating Sydney this year. The way we played was great, we probably should have had a penalty as well, which didn’t go our way and on another night we could have stolen the points</p>

  <p><b>[emotional Brendon Santalab paid tribute to Western Sydney Wanderers’ togetherness after snapping Sydney FC’s unbeaten run in an enthralling derby]</b> <b>[Last week’s]</b> performance wasn’t us. We were very upset. To beat Sydney FC for us this season is incredible because they’re in super-hot form. Right now I’m just so proud of my team. We stuck together through the whole game, through difficult periods and we pulled through. This is for our fans, my family and my friends.<br /><br />I spoke during the week about staying cool and calm. I think that finish there was exactly that and I’m very happy with it. But my team-mates were unbelievable</p>

  <p><b>[Speaking after being crowned the Wanderers’ best player of 2016-17]</b> I have to hold my emotions in at the moment. This is the biggest achievement in my career. To be coached by the best, to have all the support from home, this is a dream come true. I hope next season I can take it to another level.</p>

  <p><b>[Brendon Santalab scores for Western Sydney Wanderers against Brisbane Roar in their elimination final he’ll be ecstatic]</b> We work very hard on the pitch. If you throw all your emotion, all your energy into a celebration, I don’t want to reveal any secrets, but you are letting go of a lot of precious energy. And it’s funny you have touched on that because it’s something I have in my mind as well. In the past I’ve probably been over-excited when I’ve scored and when a chance arrives I may be a little fatigued from the celebration. An example is, you might get a chance 30 seconds or a minute after you score. And you’re thinking ‘how the hell am I going to get to that ball in order to score’ if I’ve just sprinted around the pitch to celebrate. So it’s interesting. I try to stay calm… but the hat-trick I scored <b>[in March against Melbourne City]</b> was too much even for me!<br /><br />It just shows how important my role is within the team. If I’m firing and I’m playing well that it takes a great positive effect on the team and it’s great to have that responsibility. And be a leader and you know any time you score you have a big chance to win the game. The players around me when they know I score, it’s a big confidence booster knowing this statistic. It’s big for the confidence when you look at that stat. But it’s a collective team effort and some of the assists I’ve had this year have been exceptional with some beautiful passes through to cut open defence. Our movement up front has been great at times and teams are seeing how ruthless we can be in front of goal of late<br /><br />When I was younger, I did take it <b>[football and success]</b> for granted. But now is the time I realise you’re very lucky that you kept going. Because those that take it for granted when they’re young, stop <b>[playing]</b>. So I was just blessed to keep going</p>

  <p><b>[An emotional Brendon Santalab said a red card to the Wanderers cruelled their chances after an epic Elimination Final shootout loss to Brisbane Roar]</b> I’m heartbroken. The red card didn’t help us. It was a very courageous effort when you put it into perspective with ten men and the boys were dropping down in the last few minutes.<br /><br />I started cramping up in the in the last few minutes of extra time. It was probably a wise move to take me off. But that’s the way it goes, anyone could’ve scored, anyone could’ve missed. A brave season <b>[for Wanderers]</b>. We didn’t really start well but we made it to this but unlucky … <b>[Coach Tony Popovic]</b> will be very proud of us for what we did tonight. Like I said the red card really killed it for us and took a lot of energy out of us. But I’m sure he’ll be proud but obviously heartbroken and very disappointed at the same time. Congratulations to Brisbane Roar</p>
