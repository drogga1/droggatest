  <p>[Brendon Santalab feels Western Sydney Wanderers have come closer than any other team to ending Sydney FC’s unbeaten run] You can’t avoid the hype of the derby, it’s a special game for the players, fans and everyone involved. It’s about staying cool and getting on with the job. When the whistle blows it’s win at all costs. It’s about keeping emotions intact and keeping cool and calm. It’s not always easy with 50-60,000 people, which will be amazing again.<br /><br />We take great confidence from that performance. That was the closest anyone has come to beating Sydney this year. The way we played was great, we probably should have had a penalty as well, which didn’t go our way and on another night we could have stolen the points</p>

  <p>[emotional Brendon Santalab paid tribute to Western Sydney Wanderers’ togetherness after snapping Sydney FC’s unbeaten run in an enthralling derby] [Last week’s] performance wasn’t us. We were very upset. To beat Sydney FC for us this season is incredible because they’re in super-hot form. Right now I’m just so proud of my team. We stuck together through the whole game, through difficult periods and we pulled through. This is for our fans, my family and my friends.<br /><br />I spoke during the week about staying cool and calm. I think that finish there was exactly that and I’m very happy with it. But my team-mates were unbelievable</p>
