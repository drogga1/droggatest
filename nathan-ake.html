  <p><b>[The challenge Conte set Ake on his first day back at Chelsea]</b> On the first day when I was back he called me into his office and explained the different positions he sees me in and what he expects from me when I play there. <b>[He said]</b> that for him age doesn’t matter and I have to show him that I’m ready to be here. That’s what I do in training: I try to train hard, play well and hopefully he’ll see it. It was positive that he called me back and, of course, that gave me confidence. You have seen Nathaniel <b>[Chalobah]</b> and Ruben <b>[Loftus-Cheek]</b> getting games <b>[this season]</b> so it’s good for the club. A couple of times I trained there <b>[at wing-back]</b>. <b>[I’ve worked]</b> more as a left centre-back, but in the last couple of days I’ve been training at left wing-back. It’s a different position for me but I think it’s good to play different positions. It was good to get experience there. It’s a hard position. It’s different for me but I enjoyed it a lot. There’s a lot of up and down. You need a lot of energy but it’s good to play. You have to get forward a lot - if the ball is on the other side you’re almost a winger, basically. It’s kind of different but it’s good to get used to it and hopefully I can keep improving a lot of things.<br /><br />It’s nice to be back, to get 90 minutes and to finish it with a win as well - it’s a great day. It’s always good to be involved at a club like this. Great clubs always fight for trophies and it’s good to be here and yes maybe <b>[I am proof of what the Chelsea loan system is for]</b>. I think I’ve also developed more as a player. I gained a lot of experience in the last two years, played a lot of games. I feel a bit more experienced - maybe not too much, but more experienced than I was before. In the Premier League it’s tough. When I went to Watford I was still maybe a boy, but I learned a lot that season and this season as well. Playing centre-back you have to win balls in the air, and I think I’ve learned. I think I was 19 when I went <b>[on loan]</b>. That’s a good age to go and get experience and a lot of games. That was important for me, I needed it. You learn so much when you play week in and week out, and you come back a more complete player</p>

  <p><b>[Nathan Ake reveals Drogba advice not the reason he signed for Chelsea]</b> He <b>[Drogba]</b> was training outside. We saw him and he came over to say hello. My dad is a shy person but he was more shy than usual. Drogba just said: ‘If you want to win trophies and be at a big club then join us’. I’m not really one for following other people. I never really had heroes. I play my own game. I like to take chances. This was what I wanted. I know it’s not easy at a big club like this<br /><br />Everywhere I go people will say: ‘Hey look, it’s Gullit’s son. Of course, he is a big character in Holland but not really a player I watched. I’m too young. I’ve had my hair like this since I was about 12. First it was shorter and my dad used to do it for me every morning. Then it was my first tournament away in another country and he couldn’t be there. And he made me dreads so I didn’t have to do anything with it’. He said he’d been watching me and thought I’d done well and hopefully I can maybe make it into the national team as well,’ said Ake, a Dutch Under 21 international. There has been some interest from the Ivory Coast but I want to try and progress with Holland. It would be a dream to play for Holland. Hopefully they’re watching</p>

  <p><b>[Bournemouth defender Nathan Ake is refusing to read too much into talk of a possible £40 million move to Manchester United]</b> I’ve seen it pass by but of course it’s rumours. At the moment I play at Bournemouth and that is going well, so I focus on that. This does not say much about my status yet. They are rumours on the internet and as long as I do not hear anything myself, I will not go into that.</p>

  <p><b>[Nathan Ake claims he was left broken by Jose Mourinho at Chelsea]</b> I went to the first team at Chelsea and played under Rafa Benitez and I always thought, ‘why is everyone saying setbacks are coming because everything is going up, up, up?’. The season after Benitez left I thought, ‘this is going to be my season’. Then Jose Mourinho came and, without training, I got dropped into the second team. That was one of the toughest things for me, mentally. I was quite broken. Everything was going great, I played a few games, I was young player of the year and then I was in the reserves again.</p>

  <p><b>[Nathan Ake has backed his Netherlands international team-mate <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a> to shine at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> Every game <b>[De Jong]</b> plays he is so good on the ball, he wants the ball everywhere and he is technically so good that it is difficult to get the ball off him. He is a fantastic player. Yeah, I think he’ll <b>[do well at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>]</b>. 100 per cent. The way he plays, especially the way <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> plays, I think they suit each other really well. But he’s been doing this at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> as well. He’s very good.<br /><br /><b>[Ake said that De Ligt’s goal was testament to his mental strength]</b> For a 19-year-old <b>[De Ligt’s]</b> so mentally strong and I think you could see that straight away. The first action after <b>[the penalty incident]</b>, he dribbles with the ball again no problem. I think everyone was happy he scored. Maybe <b>[England were tired.]</b> I don’t know what happened. But it was also good pressure from us. We know how they like to play, so we tried to keep them on one side and tried to press them, so maybe that’s what put them off as well<br /><br /><b>[Ake also praised <a href="memphis-depay.html">Memphis Depay</a>’s role as the <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> man assisted both of the goals in the extra-time period when they defeated England 3-1]</b> He’s been very good for us over the last years. He’s scored so many goals and against England, two assists again. He’s always working so hard for the team and you could see that again</p>

  <p><b>[Nathan Ake thinks that Juventus’ <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a> has all the same gifts as Ballon d’Or frontrunner <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a>]</b> De Ligt is still so young but he has played so many games in top-flight football and for the Dutch national team. It’s amazing what he is doing at the moment. When you go to a new country and a new club, especially a big club like <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, and you’re 19-20 years old, it’s going to be a change. He scored <b>[against <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a>]</b>, which is really good for him, but everyone has full confidence in him. As you can see, he’s a great player. He’s quick, strong for his age, very good in the air and on the ball he is very good. He scores so many from set-pieces so he’s got a lot of the same attributes as Van Dijk<br /><br /><b>[<a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> will lead his nation into those games as captain and Ake explained why the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> star deserves to be named in the same breath as the likes of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>]</b> The way he has been playing in recent seasons in crazy. He has made <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and the Dutch team very good sides - it’s his presence, leadership qualities and the way he has been playing over the last few years. He deserves all the praise he’s getting. In my opinion, he 100% deserves to be among those players that are competing for the Ballon d’Or. Forwards score goals and stuff like that but he helps his teams in other ways.<br /><br />He has been one of the main guys making sure <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> get clean sheets. He helped them reach and win the Champions League final. He’s the captain of the national team. He’s such a big presence. He’s been an important player in every squad he’s been in. He has a massive personality but he is such a nice guy off the pitch. He’s calm and chilled. When he’s on the pitch, he’s a demanding leader. He’s not scary if you know him, but if you don’t know him… maybe! Our strikers would say that it’s very tough to play against him because he’s strong, fast and reads the game very well<br /><br /><b>[on Donyell Malen]</b> Donyell Malen’s a natural goalscorer. He’s been in the squad the last two times and he scored straight away. He’s a massive talent. He’s still young, but to be so young and score so many goals for <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> is great. If he keeps going like this with <a href="psv.html">PSV</a> and the national team then I think he can make the step to playing in a big league<br /><br /><b>[On a personal level, Ake is closing in on a dream of his own as he looks to qualify for his first major tournament with the Netherlands]</b> It would be great to make the Euros. <b>[Missing the World Cup]</b> was painful for everyone in Holland. The buzz at the moment is very good, the team looks good and the manager is doing well. To be around that, for me, is great. I hope to make the Euros and be a part of that</p>

  <p><b>[Nathan Ake insists that <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>’s best players realise what <a href="eddie-howe.html">Eddie Howe</a> is building at the club]</b> I am 100% happy with my decision. Looking back now I have learned so much and I have played so many <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games. I think it was a great decision, yes. I can only speak for myself. At the moment I feel like I am still learning. I keep developing and playing. I think a lot of the players feel this. We have good players like <a href="callum-wilson.html">Callum Wilson</a> and <a href="joshua-king.html">Joshua King</a> here as well.<br /><br /><a href="ryan-fraser.html">Ryan Fraser</a> did really well. We all stayed and we are all playing together. We feel like we can achieve good things if we keep working hard. A lot of the talk is just speculation anyway. The only thing we can do is work hard and perform for the club. This is probably the best squad we have had in the last few years. I think the players we have got, on the bench and injured… we have Junior Stanislas, David Brooks and Andrew Surman are still injured. We have so much talent. The signings like Philip Billing have come in and helped us so much. The manager never stops or stands still. He wants to go higher and make the club grow as a whole<br /><br />All the young players playing together is great to see and they are playing well. They play good football. The manager is helping them a lot. There’s a buzz over there. It is a special group. The players they have now are so good but you could see that from their youth. They were winning so many things all the time such as <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Youth Cup and the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Youth League. You can see that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s youth was great. You just wait for that opportunity and now it’s come. I am buzzing for everyone. I was so happy for the decision to go there <b>[to train with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b>. I think I learned so much there. I played with so many good players. I won things myself in the youth teams as well. So, for me, it was great to be there. I played with <a href="ruben-loftus-cheek.html">Ruben Loftus-Cheek</a>, Nathaniel Chalobah and Dominic Solanke. There are so many good players there<br /><br /><b>[Ake also discussed Solanke’s struggles in front of goal at <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a>]</b> I think with the games he has been playing he has been playing really well and working so hard for the team. The only thing that is missing is the goal but I am 100% sure it will come because he is such a naturally gifted player. Technically he is so good, he holds it up well, handles the ball well and his finishing is good. He has all the attributes so it will come for him. He just needs to keep doing what he is doing. Work hard and train hard. That’s what he is doing now</p>
