  <p><b>[Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has hit back at his critics following his match-winning display in the Champions League against Viktoria Plzen]</b> When I go out on the field I don’t just want to score goals. I want to give assists, play, score goals… what a striker does. It’s always the same but I play football to make history and sometimes people don’t understand what I do on the pitch. But it doesn’t bother me anymore because I’m 30 years old, I have children and I don’t think about these things<br /><br /><b>[Benzema went on to praise Santiago Solari for his immediate]</b> Sure, why not, we’re fine with him. I don’t see a coach coming for one or two months, so far Solari has to stay until the end of the season at least. He is a great coach, we now have more confidence and we are going to compete</p>

I played to help Cristiano, we formed a good partnership. I was always looking for him with the intention of helping him to score even more goals. Now though, I’m the leader of the attack. It’s up to me to make the difference. I’m very happy because now I can play my real football.<br /><br />For me, being an attacker is not just about scoring goals. Football is becoming a compilation of statistics and that’s all we look at. There are attackers who open up spaces for their team to play into, who offer opportunities to their team-mates, who tire out opponents…Football must be looked at as a whole<br /><br />It’s very important <b>[to be a role model]</b>. Youngsters remind me of when I started at Lyon - like Vinicius, for example. He’s only 18 years old so sometimes I ask him things and then I say ‘wait… he’s 18, go slow, remember how you were at that age’. But I speak to him like that because I know he can do it. He’s very strong</p>

I’m not talking about him <b>[<a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a>]</b> anymore. I just know that I’m F1. He has his career, he does what he wants and scores the goals that he wants to score. He’s in his corner and I’m in mine; I’m not thinking about him. If we’re talking about playing style, his suits France well. It’s good because there are fast players like (Kylian) <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> and (Antoine) <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> who play out wide or feed off the centre-forward. When <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> is up front, he’s a handful for defences, which gives the other two plenty of space to show what they can do.<br /><br />He occupies defenders and it works. It might not be brilliant to watch and you won’t say, ‘Wow, that was incredible.’ Does everyone like that style of play? I don’t know, but it suits France well</p>

  <p><b>[When asked to clarify his comments on Tuesday, Benzema doubled down on his criticism of <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a>]</b> About <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a>, I simply told the truth.
