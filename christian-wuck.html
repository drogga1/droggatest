  <p><b>[Germany <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-17 World Cup coach Christian Wuck speaking at the Francisco Reinisch Residential Home for Children and Youths in Chillan, Chile, where his team took time out from the tournament to visit children at risk of social exclusion]</b> If we didn’t show them, a lot of my players wouldn’t be aware there are a lot of children that aren’t as fortunate as they are, and it’s a good thing for them to find out. This visit is good for the kids but also for my players, because this World Cup’s not just about football. At this age, you have to teach them about life too. A lot of them might not make it into the pro game, and they need to know what real life is like</p>

  <p><b>[Germany Under-17 head coach ​Christian Wuck has cautioned against over-hyping Bayer Leverkusen prodigy Florian Wirtz, saying he should not be compared to team-mate Kai Havertz]</b> We at the <a href="dfb.html">DFB</a> <b>[German Football Federation]</b> believe that he is an outstanding player in the 2003 year. I have been able to accompany the 2003 year <b>[players]</b> over the past few years and think that there are some interesting players. Flo is certainly one of the top three. He can go a long way if he continues like this. And if the way leads to the senior national team, that would be a really great story. Flo is incredibly intelligent. He recognizes situations on the field within a very short time and draws the right conclusions. What makes him so special and what sets him apart from many other youth players is his excellent training in basic technology. He is two-footed and has incredibly good technique<br /><br />Flo can deal with such reports and statements. I don’t know whether you should already compare him with Kai, a current top player in Germany. My tip: Just let the boy play!</p>
