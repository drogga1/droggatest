    <meta name="description" content="Besides being a star for Nigeria, Yekini enjoyed years of success with Vitoria de Setubal where he helped them gain promotion to the Primeira Liga. The prolific forward then netted 21 times to end top scorer in his first campaign to show he could thrive in the top flight. However, things didn't go well for the 1993 African Footballer of the Year when he moved to Sporting Gijon in 1995 after a short spell with Olympiacos the year before. The Super Eagles couldn't replicate his success in Portugal in the Spanish top flight, scoring a paltry three times in 14 appearances over two seasons. Yekini headed to Vitoria after an underwhelming time in La Liga, but even a return to his old stomping ground didn't bring the renaissance he'd hoped for.">
