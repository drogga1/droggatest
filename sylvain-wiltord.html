  <p><b>[Former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> forward Sylvain Wiltord is apparently on the verge of leaving Stade Rennais after a run-in with head coach Guy Lacombe]</b> I never disputed his <b>[Guy Lacombe’s]</b> decisions. Even when two attackers left, I was not selected in the team. The last six months have been very tough to get through. I love playing but I have hardly been given a chance… I miss competitive football<br /><br /><b>[Although, by his own admission, last season was mediocre for Wiltord, he now feels that he is on the end of a personnel vendetta]</b> Even when Briand or Pagis tired last season, Lacombe would not give me a chance. The coach wanted me to believe that I was required this season. This was completely false. The situation is very simple. The coach said to me last week that he no longer required my services. On June 23rd, when we returned to pre-season training, he should have told me that. It was not difficult</p>

  <p><b>[Sylvain Wiltord blasts ‘unattractive’ France after embarrassing exit]</b> I went into the World Cup as les Bleus’ number one fan and I’m very sad. We kept waiting for some sort of reaction and it never came<br /><br />What happened is completely inexplicable and worrying. This team isn’t attractive to watch. There’s a real lack of desire and understanding between the players. That can’t be the fault of the coach alone.<br /><br />The new coach will have his work cut out. We’ll need to start again from the basics, but we have a big gap to make up and it’ll be complicated. Everyone’s got the right to play badly - that’s football - but we need to make the supporters happy again and restore their love for the team.<br /><br />This team belongs to everyone, to the whole country.<br /><br />I think <a href="laurent-blanc.html">Laurent Blanc</a> has the necessary experience to carry out the rebuilding work. He’s a man with integrity and sound values. He’ll need to restore order, which will undoubtedly mean putting supposed senior players on the bench sometimes</p>
