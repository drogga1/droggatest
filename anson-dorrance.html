<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Former Women’s World Cup-winning coach Anson Dorrance says The USWNT will lose its status as the best team in the world if the ‘starvation wages’ in their domestic league are not addressed]</b> An entry-level professional is paid $16,500 a year in the NWSL. That’s starvation wages. I would love to see more and more women start to make the sort of money we’re seeing on the men’s side.<br /><br /><b>[Dorrance wants to see equality, but also greater transparency over the revenue generated by the two teams given reports suggest the women bring in more than their male counterparts]</b> <b>[The USFF should]</b> have a very transparent set of accounting books to show exactly what happens. This is how many people watched this Women’s World Cup game in the United States, here were the sponsorship dollars and here’s how we’re going to reward our women that have just won the event. I would love for that to become clearer. In terms of per diem, there should be no difference, those should be the same, then your rewards should be based on what you make. I don’t think all of a sudden these women should be paid the amount of money <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Christian Pulisic</a> is paid <b>[by <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>]</b> because of the crowd he’s played in front of at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> and what he will play in front of at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. But I would love for it to be transparent and for them to be paid what they’re worth</p>
