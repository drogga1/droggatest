  <p><b>[Ugo Ehiogu: Former England defender dies after suffering cardiac arrest]</b> Words cannot express the shock and sadness that we all feel at the club. Ugo’s immense presence will be irreplaceable. Our heartfelt sympathies go out to his wife Gemma and his family. The Club sends its deepest condolences to Ugo’s family. Gemma has specifically asked that the family are given privacy at this difficult time. We should also like to place on record our thanks to all the medical professionals including those at North Middlesex University Hospital, Royal Brompton Hospital and Harefield Hospital for their care and supports<br /><br />While Ugo was officially in charge of the under-23s, he also worked across a number of age groups as all our full-time coaches do, and so his direct teaching and legacy to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> players extends far beyond the squad he was directly responsible for in the public domain</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have appointed former midfielder Ryan Mason as an academy coach as part of a reshuffle of their backroom staff]</b> We have always tried to assemble a blend of staff who know what the demands of the game are at the highest level.<br /><br />It’s also important to have a mix of experience through internal promotions and external appointments, including coaches who have recently retired and are current with the modern player, plus coaches who have been in the cauldron of professional football - not just Academy football - and can pass on their wisdom of what the real game expects in terms of behaviour and performance<br /><br />All five of these members of staff understand the incredible standards set for young and senior players at this club and they will be invaluable in driving our players to become the best young men and players that they can be. Four of these staff have spent many years at the club and know how we function. Only Matt is completely new to the fold, so the experience for the players will be seamless</p>
