  <p><b>[Former <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle United</a> goalkeeper Steve Harper reveals why he ‘thinks the world of’ <a href="chris-hughton.html">Chris Hughton</a> ahead of <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>’s Brighton clash]</b> He came in at an incredibly difficult, turbulent time after relegation. It was a fractured club and he was the perfect man for the job, very respectful, but a very good, tactically astute football man and he made some big decisions that year. At times he left out Kevin Nolan, <a href="alan-smith.html">Alan Smith</a>, <a href="joey-barton.html">Joey Barton</a>, <a href="nicky-butt.html">Nicky Butt</a>. There was a myth at the time that the players were picking the team but that was complete nonsense. Chris was the man at the centre of a perfect storm who steered us through some very choppy waters. He did a wonderful job and I don’t think he got enough credit. It was no surprise to me to see him go on to do an excellent job at <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham City</a> and then at Brighton<br /><br /><a href="kevin-keegan.html">Keegan</a> and <a href="bryan-robson.html">Robson</a> were both brilliant man managers. <a href="kevin-keegan.html">Keegan</a> just made you feel ten feet tall. I always say that after ten minutes talking to <a href="kevin-keegan.html">Kevin Keegan</a>, the world is a better place and the same with Sir Bobby. He was so enthusiastic, with a passion for everything, not just football. He’d talk about a beautiful door frame for ten minutes! He had a zest for life and an infectious personality.<br /><br />They both revitalised the club at different times. We were a game away from going down to the third tier when <a href="kevin-keegan.html">Keegan</a> took over and bottom of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> when Sir Bobby came in and we finished fourth, third and fifth and played in the Champions League. That shows you the effect that both had, men you’d run through brick walls for</p>
