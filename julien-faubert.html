  <p><b>[Julien Faubert says <a href="avram-grant.html">Avram Grant</a> was antisocial, his motivation was sh<em>t and I didn’t learn anything from him]&lt;/b&gt; That guy was so antisocial. He never spoke to us, he barely took charge of the training sessions because he was always in his office, his motivation was sh</em>t and I didn’t learn anything from him. Time after time and after every game we kept seeing the same problems with very little progress. We tried to be positive and motivate each other but everything was so bad, from the training and preparation for games. It’s such a shame, because the fans were on our side until the very end<br /><br />People say he is the reason why <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> reached the Champions League final but it wasn’t, it was down to the players. With us, it was his assistant (Zeljko Petrovic) who would do the training sessions and he tried to make it fun. He really tried his best but if <a href="avram-grant.html">Avram Grant</a> can be a manager then I can too. That season, he made so many poor decisions. It’s going to sound bad but the season we got relegated it was inevitable. I didn’t have a good relationship with him and we got relegated because of him</b></p>

  <p><b>[How <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> wanted Antonio <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> but ended up signing Julien Faubert]</b> We were on the team bus making our way to Upton Park to play Fulham. I received a call from this French guy at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and he said to me, ‘Hi, I work for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and we have to talk to you’. I told him I have an important game to prepare for and I don’t have time for this bullsh<em>t. I switched off my phone, we played the game and after the match I switched on my phone and saw around 30 text messages and 50 voicemails. That’s when I knew it was serious. So I called my manager and he said to me we have to talk with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> because they are in a hotel at Heathrow. It was the last day of the transfer window and we went there and started to negotiate<br /><br />When I was on the bench I closed my eyes for about 30 seconds and they thought I was p</em>ssed off because I wasn’t playing and they said, ‘OK, this guy is sleeping.’ The president said I need to be careful because there are photographers and cameras everywhere. I definitely learned a lot from that experience</p>
