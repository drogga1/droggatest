<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Legendary American broadcaster JP Dellacamera gets his moment after staying in background for decades]</b> It’s been three or four years of learning every single day what the business entails, what it takes to be prepared and what it takes to get to a point where you feel comfortable enough that you can do a good job for the game. Until I actually did it, you never really know. You think you know, but he showed me different methods, different ways of studying, different ways of prepping and if it wasn’t for him I don’t know that I would’ve been chosen to go to the World Cup<br /><br />This is our first live hit of the World Cup in the stadium and JP were as calm as if he were on his couch watching his favorite movie. I was a little bit nervous. You’re getting ready to go out in the entire country. He was calm. I’m trying to take his lead because he’s been here before and he’s seen all this. Had he been rattled at all, I probably would’ve been rattled myself</p>
