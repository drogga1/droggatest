  <p><b>[Michael Lahoud on escaping war-ravaged Sierra Leone]</b> When I was six years old, I was sitting in my small classroom in Sierra Leone, when my grandmother showed up at the door. I immediately felt that something was wrong. She told me that we had to go back home immediately. <b>[Next thing]</b> I was getting into a car with my uncle, and looking back at my house with my tiny little suitcase and thinking,’ Wow, I’m going to Hollywood!’ When my uncle and I got to the port outside of Freetown, things got very real. There was a huge mass of people with suitcases trying to get onto the ferry. Government soldiers were patrolling the line. One of the soldiers got very aggressive with my uncle, asking for his visa. He didn’t have one. The soldier started pushing him away with his gun, and I got extremely scared. Then my uncle picked me up and handed me over the crowd to a soldier who was on the ferry. The next thing I know I’m standing on the ferry. Then the ferry started to move. My uncle was gone. I was alone in the chaos. I followed the crowds at the airport and clutched my plane ticket. When the plane landed, I thought I was in Hollywood. Then I walked out into the terminal and all the signs didn’t make any sense. They were in a foreign language. I started to panic. I was in Paris. I completely broke down crying right there in the hallway. Then a flight attendant that was on my plane recognised me. To six-year-old me, it felt like this woman saved my life. They put me on the second plane, and we went up into the sky again, into the unknown. When we landed again, I walked into the terminal and was relieved that the signs were in English. There was only one problem: my mother had left Sierra Leone when I was three years old, and the only things I had to recognise her were old photographs. People kept getting out of the cars and running up to their loved ones, and giving them hugs. I walked around the parking lot for a long time until a station wagon started following behind me very slowly. I thought I came all this way just to get kidnapped. Then a woman got out and started running toward me. I was about to drop my suitcase and run away as fast as I could when she said, ‘Michael!’ It was my mother. So this is where most stories end, and you go back to Facebook and feel pretty good about humanity. Even if you don’t know who I am, you can Google my name, and see that I went to college and currently play in the <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>. There’s your happy ending</p>
