<blockquote>
  <p>[Why is FC Motagua’s CONCACAF Champions League match vs. Club Tijuana taking place in Texas?] Really, I’m not 100 percent in agreement because we never officially asked to play the game in the United States. In November of last year we sent a letter asking if we could play in the United States in case we couldn’t play in Honduras. It was an exploratory note. CONCACAF answered us that they were going to analyze the case, and eventually because of some problems we had here after the elections they canceled a pair of matches. But from there the tournament has continued in its normal way without any problem.<br /><br />Well, the first thing also is the weather, which is important. We know that this part of the U.S. isn’t very cold and Edinburg won’t have too much heat either. It should be an accessible climate for our players. Beyond that, we know there are a lot of Hondurans in the Houston area and we’re sure they’re going to go to the stadium. It’s going to be $15-$30 and we think there are going to be a lot of Hondurans. It’s small, a few more than 9,000 people. And there also will be a lot of Mexican-Americans who are going to support Tijuana<br /><br />[Atala is eyeing a first-ever win over a Mexican team] It would be historic. We’ve never achieved it, even when playing at home. Now we’re playing two matches away. But we’re hoping a lot of Hondurans come from Houston, from McAllen, where there are a lot of Hondurans, and we can feel at home and get a positive result to travel with a favorable score to Tijuana</p>
