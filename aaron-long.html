  <p><b>[Aaron Long’s comeback endured a rough start, with his first game action after the injury coming in the USMNT’s 3-0 pre-Gold Cup loss to Venezuela]</b> It’s definitely not how I envisioned my first 45 minutes back, especially with the national team, you get three goals scored on you in 45. And to know that before the game started that I was only going to play 45 minutes. so to have to come off at halftime when I wanted to go back out there was tough, but yeah, you need those moments. You need to grow from that. We’ve watched so much film on that stuff, we’ve been through the film so many times as a team and now we’re flying so it feels good.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a> sets up Aaron Long who heads it home and puts the USMNT on]</b> I probably shouldn’t have been up there to be honest. Walker was freaking out and screaming at me after the goal. Tim <b>[Ream]</b> and me switched spots for that play so I was just caught up on the wing<br /><br /><b>[After two straight starts, and shutouts, Long sounds like a player who is ready to play every minute of the tournament]</b> I feel great. As the games go on you get more confident. You get in the groove. Scoring goals helps with that for sure. Confidence is getting higher, for me and for the group</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Aaron Long? The late bloomer who has become the anchor of the USMNT defense]</b> I was an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> supporter so I really liked <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a>, so that was kind of my guy. He was just a destroyer. Against the ball he was unbelievable, winning the ball back, and then, with the ball, he could make the game pretty. It was one of those things he could do both sides of the ball and do it for, in my opinion, one of the best teams in the world.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="jesse-marsch.html">Marsch</a> left the Red Bulls for Europe in the summer of 2018]</b> I owe him a lot. In a lot of ways he set me up to be where I am. He didn’t just play me there, he believed in me, he coached me. Those video sessions early on giving me the belief when I was a Red Bulls II guy, saying ‘listen, trust me, keep going down this path, you’re going to be a first-team player’.<br /><br /><b>[Long is ready for the challenge of playing in a Gold Cup final]</b> Building on what I’ve experienced as a fan, and to now come into the locker room and seeing the way the veterans are responding to this game, it really gets you hyped up. I’m a Southern California kid so I’ve got a lot of Mexican friends. USA-Mexico games were a big feature for me and my friends, so it means a lot to me, and my family and friends. I know the importance of this game</p>

  <p><b>[Long’s college coach at UC-Riverside, Junior Gonzalez on his pupil]</b> For collegiate players, and American players that want to make it, he’s for me a poster child for them because it’s not easy for an American player nowadays. many of us in the league are looking at South American players and international players, and he had to struggle. He had to go through his adversity in multiple environments</p>

  <p><b>[New York Red Bulls defender Aaron Long on former team-mate <a href="tyler-adams.html">Tyler Adams</a>]</b> Tyler’s crazy. He’s a different breed of human. I remember one game he lost his guy - he was probably 17 or 18-years-old at the time - on a set piece and our opponents scored a goal and two minutes later he sprints over to the sideline at our coach <a href="jesse-marsch.html">Jesse Marsch</a> at the time and starts screaming at him about tactics and why weren’t we not forcing the ball to the left. Jesse just turned around and said, ‘He’s right. I can’t believe it. How is his mind so strong?’ He doesn’t think about his mistakes, he just moves on</p>

  <p><b>[USMNT defender Aaron Long raves about <a href="christian-pulisic.html">Pulisic</a>’s ‘effortless’ dribbling]</b> He’s so tidy in tight spaces. His acceleration, and it’s not just his top speed, it’s quickness and top speed mixed together. I think <a href="michael-bradley.html">Michael Bradley</a> described it as light, almost like a <a href="landon-donovan.html">Landon Donovan</a> how he’s so light on his feet. The way he can dribble around defenders and make it look effortless is crazy. It’s something I’ve never seen before.<br /><br /><b>[Long recalled a match from their time together in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> when Adams pulled up coach <a href="jesse-marsch.html">Jesse Marsch</a> about a tactical error in the middle of the game]</b> Two minutes later, he sprints over to the sideline at Jesse and just starts screaming at Jesse about tactics and why are we not forcing the ball to the left, to their left center back. Jesse just turns around and is like ‘He’s right, he’s right’. I can’t believe it. How is his mind so strong, how does he not even think about his mistakes and he just moves on?</p>
