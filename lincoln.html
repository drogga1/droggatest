<blockquote>
  <p>[Flamengo starlet Lincoln is setting his sights high] My main reference is Cristiano Ronaldo. Besides his unquestionable quality, he is a winner who works very hard and always wants more. So, I have him as an example, not only as a player, but as a person as well.<br /><br />Everything is going really well and I’m very happy with it all. I’m very still young and have a lot of work to do. This is just the beginning of my career and I know that I have a long way to go. I am trying to absorb as much as I can in training and get as much advice as possible from the more experienced players. My only focus is on putting in the hard work that will enable me to sustain my early success</p>
