  <p><b>[Brazil wonderkid Lincoln hoping to emulate Ronaldinho at 2022 World Cup]</b> Every player wants to be in the Brazilian national team because he’ll be representing his country, so I have this dream, yes, to defend the national team. <b>[To be called for the 2022 Cup]</b> is a dream. As I said before, us players work hard, train a lot and making the national team is the result of work. I don’t think I have skipped stages. I fulfilled all of my roles in the youth team and finally I’m in the first team. This is very gratifying for me. <b>[Ronaldinho]</b> is an inspiration to the world, he’s a guy who has a great history and everybody has to respect him. But I try to play my game, with my own characteristics. Even so, Ronaldinho is a complete player. I’d like to get close to him.<br /><br />Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo? It’s very difficult to say that, because they’re both excellent players. In my opinion, Messi is better, but at the moment, and football is all about moments. Neymar is at the same level; look what he’s doing!<br /><br />It’s everyone’s dream, but first of all, before I want to go to Europe, I want to prepare myself more here in Brazil. I want to compete in the competitions here, to compete in the Brazilian Championship, to play every game in the year, to be able to get there at a high level</p>

  <p><b>[Flamengo starlet Lincoln is setting his sights high]</b> My main reference is Cristiano Ronaldo. Besides his unquestionable quality, he is a winner who works very hard and always wants more. So, I have him as an example, not only as a player, but as a person as well.<br /><br />Everything is going really well and I’m very happy with it all. I’m very still young and have a lot of work to do. This is just the beginning of my career and I know that I have a long way to go. I am trying to absorb as much as I can in training and get as much advice as possible from the more experienced players. My only focus is on putting in the hard work that will enable me to sustain my early success</p>
