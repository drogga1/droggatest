  <p><b>[West Ham have sold Havard Nordtveit to Hoffenheim]</b> I obviously know the Bundesliga very well from my years at Gladbach and I’m convinced I will be able to make the impact that TSG are hoping for</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal defender Havard Nordtveit has described the moment he thought he was about to make his Gunners debut]</b> The move to Arsenal was the best decision of my life. I have never regretted that step. Of course it was a big step to come from FK Haugesund to Arsenal, but I had the opportunity to train with some of the world’s best players. Although I played for the reserves, I trained with the first team and learned an incredible amount. As a young player, it was the best thing that could happen to me. It <b>[the time he nearly made his first appearance for the first team]</b> was the last game of the 2008 season and we needed a victory at Sunderland to secure the Champions League spot.<br /><br />Philippe Senderos was supposed to start in central defence but came to me during the warm-up and told me to be ready for a substitution because he had pain in his back. So, when I was in the Premier League squad for the first time in this game at 18, I almost pissed myself on the bench because I was so nervous! We absolutely needed a win to make the Champions League, which ultimately worked out well. At the end of the day I was overjoyed, even though I was not used.<br /><br />When I was on loan from Arsenal to Salamanca in the second Spanish league <b>[during the 2008-09 season]</b>, I had a hard time. We hoped that I could become a regular starter in Spain but the reality was different, which is why Arsenal decided to bring me back after only three months. In my first training session after my return, Wenger asked me how I liked it and I said, ‘bad experiences are good experiences’. He laughed heartily and hugged me. I will never forget that moment, and I believe he too will immediately remember me when he hears this story.<br /><br /><b>[His toughest opponent is]</b> Eden Hazard. He can turn on a one Euro coin and immediately record top speed again - that’s awesome. When I played against Everton with West Ham, I also found out that Romelu Lukaku is an absolute monster. I also remember games against Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Robert Lewandowski. Marco Reus and Marc-Andre ter Stegen <b>[are the team-mates that]</b> impressed me the most. If Marco is fit, he is one of the absolute top players in Europe. The same applies to Ter Stegen. He is number one at Barcelona and is undoubtedly one of the best goalkeepers in Europe.<br /><br />Every time I am asked who my idol is, I respond with Solskjaer. He is an extraordinary person and athlete. Since we have the same agent, I know him personally and he’s given me advice during my career.</p>
