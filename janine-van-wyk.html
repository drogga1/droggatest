  <p><b>[South Africa’s Janine van Wyk praises the Brazilian fans’ support during the Women’s Olympic Football Tournament Rio 2016]</b> It was fantastic to have the crowd behind us. They were chanting ‘Africa, Africa’ with every pass and attack we created. That certainly won’t be the case against Brazil, so we’ll enjoy the moment for as long as it lasts – but it was just incredible</p>

  <p><b>[Janine van Wyk talks about her country’s historic qualification to the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Women’s World Cup France 2019]</b> When I looked at the clock there were 13 minutes left. It was probably the longest 13 minutes of my career. Every second felt like a year. When that final whistle blew I just fell to the ground and thought ‘oh my god, we did it’</p>

  <p><b>[South Africa captain Janine Van Wyk says China means business]</b> I didn’t really get to watch the game‚ but we know Germany is a tough side to beat. So, to only lose 1-0 against such a team says China means business. They are a quality team that can run for 190 minutes‚ let alone 90. So, we need to be cautious in what we do in our defending‚ but also in our attack to not leave a lot of space for them to play. So, if we can close the gaps and stay compact when they have the ball‚ it will close a lot of spaces for them.</p>

  <p><b>[Van Wyk proud of Banyana Banyana’s performance but upset with discrimination]</b> People often forget that athletes are humans too. We do have feelings, emotions &amp; we do have our own lives outside of our profession. What gives u the right to discriminate, criticize &amp; judge how we should live? Oh wait, maybe because we actually doing something with our lives<br /><br />Disappointed in the result YES, but extremely proud of the way we showed true character by fighting every single second on the field for each other. It’s clear that we are closing gaps when it comes to competing against World Class teams with Pro leagues. Thanks for the Support</p>

  <p><b>[It wasn’t an easy road, and despite being given the cold shoulder by some of her teammates, the young Afrikaner was toughened up by this early toil]</b> At first it was really difficult to fit in. The boys wouldn’t pass me the ball, they didn’t accept me into the team so I was kind of isolated from everything. The reason I continued was the determination of wanting to do well. I knew I had it in me to be a good player. I wasn’t weak, I could kick a ball and I just loved playing the game</p>

  <p><b>[Cosafa Women’s Cup - Banyana captain Janine Van Wyk ruled out]</b> I would just like you all to know that after going down in the game against Malawi yesterday, I have picked up an MCL injury that will put me out for up to four weeks or more. It will be tough few weeks to get by but I know I have the best support to help me get back in action again. Good luck to the team for the rest of the Cosafa Cup tournament. I know you will keep producing the best results in order to defend our title. I will be there cheering and supporting you from the side</p>

  <p><b>[Van Wyk, who recently left JVW for Danish club Fortuna Hjorring, welcomed the signing of 2012 and 2016 Olympic champion Semenya]</b> I am extremely elated to have such an iconic athlete join my football club. I am absolutely honoured that out of all the other women’s clubs around the world, she has chosen JVW as the club where she would like to start showcasing her football skills. I welcomed her at her first training with the team on Tuesday, and was impressed to see that she definitely has all the fundamentals. I look forward to her working with coach Ciara <b>[Picco]</b> and our first team where I am sure she will sharpen up and get ready to play in 2020. Although I won’t be here for the rest of the year, as I have just signed with Fortuna Hjorring, I have no doubt that Caster will fit right in, and enjoy her time at the club</p>

  <p><b>[South African star took to social media to call time on her brief spell at Fortuna as she thanks the club for their tremendous support during her short stay in Denmark]</b> Many of you know that I have recently signed for a club in Denmark and many of you know that I also sustained a knee injury at the Cosafa Cup in August 2019. Due to the fact that I have yet to fully recovered from the injury, the club Fortuna Hjorring and I have come to an agreement to terminate my contract. I am truly grateful for the opportunity Fortuna offered me and for giving me their continuous support and patience during my rehabilitation. I have made a decision to return to South Africa to fully focus on the process of the rehab where I will get the best possible treatment in order for me to get back to playing football again.<br /><br />Sometimes decisions aren’t easy to make, especially when you at the stage of your career when you question whether or not it’s the right decision to make, but it makes it easier when you accept the decision and are ready to face any consequences that come with it.<br /><br />I would like to thank Fortuna Jhorring for their tremendous support and guidance throughout this short journey at the club. It’s heartwarming to know that there are still clubs out there that take a high interest in the players’ happiness and wellbeing. Wishing you all the best for the rest of the season.</p>
