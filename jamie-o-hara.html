  <p><b>[Former <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> man Jamie O’Hara revealed that then-manager <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> went absolutely mental after an infamous <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> Christmas party in 2009]</b> I was at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and we’d organised a Christmas party. <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> hated them and he was really against them. <a href="robbie-keane.html">Robbie Keane</a> had organised this big event in Dublin, and we all went there. Before Harry even knew what was going on we’d had the Christmas party and we were back training on the Monday. Harry pulled us into a team meeting in the afternoon and said ‘boys I’m just letting you know I don’t want any of you organising a Christmas party this year’, not knowing we’d already had one!<br /><br />On the Tuesday, the Sun ran the story of us all out in nightclubs in Dublin – literally everyone’s on the back of it. <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> goes absolutely mental. He gave us the hairdryer treatment and let me tell you none of us played that weekend!<br /><br /><b>[After the revelations Redknapp made his anger at the players known in the press, though he acknowledged that things could have been worse]</b> It will be dealt with I can tell you that. I wouldn’t like to say what I’m going to do but it will be dealt with and then we will move on. They’ve not been fighting or anything like that. You could go back over some of the other parties that other clubs have had over the years and tell a million stories. I haven’t had any negative reports about what went on but they didn’t ask my permission so they have to take the consequences, which they will do.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham have been slated by former midfielder Jamie O’Hara for replicating the contract mistakes of arch-rivals <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> when it comes to <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Christian Eriksen</a>, <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Toby Alderweireld</a> and Jan Vertonghen]</b> I think that is the biggest problem <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> have got. You’ve got <a href="jan-vertonghen.html">Vertonghen</a>, <a href="toby-alderweireld.html">Alderweireld</a> and <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> who are going to leave; they are going to go for nothing and might even go in January if <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> feel they need to get rid of them and make some money. That is a big problem.<br /><br />I’m so surprised that we’ve allowed this to happen because, truthfully, this doesn’t happen at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. Knowing Daniel Levy and how he works, he will always give an extension and add another extension two years down the line so you’ve always got these players, because they are assets to the football club. You are losing three huge assets for your football club who could truthfully fetch you, in the right market, £100million.<br /><br />I gave <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> a load of stick for this when they let <a href="aaron-ramsey.html">Aaron Ramsey</a> go and let others go for nothing, thinking how can they let these players’ contracts run out? But now <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are about to let three of their biggest players go for nothing. It’s crazy! We sold <b>[Kieran]</b> <a href="kieran-trippier.html">Trippier</a> and didn’t replace him and now we’re going to lose our two centre-halves as well so we’ll need a whole new back four!</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie O’Hara says <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> looks like he’s had enough]</b> We all know that we need a trophy. I speak to all the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans and they are all, ‘we want a trophy, we want a trophy’. And that is one where you can get to the latter stages of the competition pretty early on and if you do there is a chance of winning it. To go out straight away is poor<br /><br />You’ve got to look at the players. There is only so much responsibility the manager can have because as soon as they walk over that white line … He will prepare that team and his training sessions are amazing, and he will prepare a side to go and beat a team like Colchester. There were some big players in that team; <a href="dele-alli.html">Dele Alli</a> started the game … it was a proper side. You are expecting them to win that game and I don’t think they were up for it. I looked at it and thought, ‘are they up for this? Do they really want it?’. The problem is now is it’s another trophy we could have won which we have now lost. It’s getting to the point where I’m looking at Poch’s interviews and he looks like, ‘I’m on the verge here, I’ve had enough’</p>

No disrespect to them, even though they’ve had their great history, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> are probably a better suited squad to where they are going.

And, for me, that is not going to be at Man United<br /><br />I don’t think he’ll go to Spain.

  <p><b>[Jamie O’Hara says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> will bring trophies to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and will likely have a significant transfer budget to be able to do so]</b> I think it is a fantastic appointment. You have to be sad for Poch because of what he has done and were we have been. We’ve been a Champions League outfit for a long time now with him. They are thinking big. If you are going to sack one of the best managers <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have ever had, who do you bring in? You bring in another manager who is probably one of the greatest managers around, an incredible signing.<br /><br />What he does is he wins trophies and that’s what <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> want. It’s alright being Champions League, Champions League, Champions League, but the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans, we want trophies and he will bring that. It says to me that <a href="daniel-levy.html">Daniel Levy</a> has said to him ‘you can spend money’. January is coming, the summer is coming. He is not going to come into a football club where he’s not going to have a big budget. So I think you will see a lot of new faces, a fresh team, a new start. If the players are on board, they are on board. If not, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> will say ‘thanks, see you later’. I guarantee in the next year or so we will be challenging for the title</p>

  <p><b>[Jamie O’Hara says Kane will stay to win Champions League for Mourinho]</b> xxxI think this is a positive thing for the outcome for <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a>.

  <p><b>[Jamie O’Hara says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> one of greatest and no yesterday’s man]</b> I think it’s disrespectful to be honest, I think that’s bad shout.

It’s not even about having my manager’s hat on, I think it’s out of order<br /><br /><a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> just beat <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> with a tactical way of playing, and at the end of the day <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> have got their two best players out, the two players who get up the pitch and make things happen. You take those players out of any team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, they would struggle, and he’s had to adapt. So I disagree with the point that he’s ‘yesterday’s man’, I think it’s unfair<br /><br />Mouringo gets a lot of stick from the press and people talking about the way he plays – he is one of the greatest ever managers to be in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>!

They’ve got themselves up to fifth in the league and he’s doing it with a squad that’s really, really struggling. For me, he’s still one of the greatest managers. Yes, everyone wants to see this dynamic football and Leipzig were fantastic the other night, but you can’t say he’s ‘yesterday’s man’, you just can’t</p>
