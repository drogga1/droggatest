  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen have admitted to holding an interest in Manchester United and Liverpool target Leon Bailey]</b> Our intention is to keep Leon. We only want to negotiate clubs who want to sign him in the summer but at the moment there are no offers on the table even for an immediate transfer.</p>

  <p><b>[Genk are famously the club that produced some of Belgium’s biggest stars including Kevin De Bruyne, Thibaut Courtois, Yannick Carrasco and Divock Origi]</b> Do we consider ourselves a selling club? This is not our ambition but it is the reality. We look upon ourselves as a club that’s a university of football. A club that develops high-quality players. There’s not much we can do when they realise how well they are doing and when they realise they can attract top clubs and money. We would rather have them stay longer at our club but it is not always realistic.<br /><br />We have a very good academy that has developed over time. You can see a style of play, a methodology that we developed in those players. It is very technical, not based on power force. It is based on football skills, intelligence and a positive attitude to attack. I think for Belgian standards, it is something that we developed well over time. The success we have had has increased the capacity to attract talent from abroad. We introduce <b>[players]</b> very quickly into our first team. At the same time, I don’t think we can deny it, we had a golden generation at a certain moment in time. There was De Bruyne, Courtois, Benteke and Carrasco shortly after so there must be an element of luck in there as well but I think we used that luck well<br /><br />I like to say that we are swimming against the tide. We originated as a club with a community ambition. The club has been gradually growing but it has always kept its structure which means no one can buy or sell the club. No one can take money out of it in dividends or whatever. It is not unique historically, but increasingly we are becoming the exception. At a time in England where there was a bigger comfort in stadiums, as pay television came in and as the Premier League was formed. We see ourselves as a community club in an era where most of the other clubs are becoming companies<br /><br />I think that as a whole it is moving in the right direction. The league has become more competitive. I think it is more competitive than the Dutch league as a whole. Yes you have three clubs, Feyenoord, Ajax and PSV which are bigger than any Belgian clubs, in terms of history and stadium size. We do not have those kinds of big clubs in Belgium, but any important Belgian team is able to beat those three<br /><br />Not easily, not guaranteed, but in the Europa League, in the next round we would want to face Ajax as we believe that we would have a chance. Avoiding Dutch teams is no longer the case. Our team that we have now, especially with the current coach plays the closest to the kind of football we would like to play. I don’t think we have one individual who can be as exceptional as De Bruyne. Maybe Bailey was, but he left during the winter. I think we have a very young squad with a lot of potential, but as a team and when it comes to the style of play, this is as close as ever to the style we want to play</p>
