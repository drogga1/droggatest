  <p><b>[Despite a poor surface, Sydney FC were outstanding in the first half of their 3-1 win over Wellington Phoenix]</b> Graham Arnold was unbelievable. When I feel fresh, I can do everything. But when I’m tired, like last week <b>[against Roar]</b> … But tonight we showed a great performance, we played very well and to be honest Wellington played good and should score one more.<br /><br />We need to play like the first half. Keep the ball and create chances and we scored three goals</p>

  <p><b>[Johnny Warren medallist Milos Ninkovic never believed his football career would take him to Australia]</b> If somebody told me after the World Cup that I would play in Australia I would never have believed them but this is life and this is football. You never know what is going to be tomorrow.<br /><br />Fifteen years I’ve played overseas and my parents are 60 years old, so maybe it’s the time to spend more time with them<br /><br /><b>[Ninkovic insisted that he is happy in Sydney and paid tribute to the job coach Graham Arnold]</b> They signed some unbelievable players and we still have an unbelievable atmosphere and I think that’s the key. I played with some very good players, at Dinamo Kiev for example, but we didn’t have this atmosphere in the team</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC’s penalty hero and Johnny Warren medallist Milos Ninkovic has given the strongest indication he will stay with the A-League champions]</b> I like these guys too much, I like all these people and the fans and the club, and like I said, I can’t promise anything but I would like to stay, yeah.<br /><br /><b>[Sydney’s coach recently claimed Ninkovic’s decision would come down to what the Serbian midfielder’s wife wanted]</b> She said at the A-League awards that she wants to stay. So she wears the trousers, ‘Ninko’ doesn’t and ‘Ninko’ will do as he’s told.</p>

  <p><b>[Milos Ninkovic was battered and bruised, but he was far from finished]</b> I feel sore like after every game, but maybe this morning more than usually.<br /><br />If somebody told me after the World Cup that I would play in Australia I would never have believed them but this is life and this is football. You never know what is going to be tomorrow<br /><br />I will be focusing on this season and we expect to win all four trophies we are competing for this season. Everything is possible if you work hard and have that belief so these are the achievements I am focusing on for this season</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC playmaker Milos Ninkovic has hailed his 2016-17 season as the best year of his career]</b> It’s a great feeling to be named as No.1. I am very proud of my team and also myself as well but there is more to come from everyone. It is the best year in my career but this season will be better.<br /><br />We will be better and I will be better and I think I have many things that I can improve. I have worked very hard in pre-season to be able to back up my form and there are many things I think I will improve on this year. Winning and improving are the main motivating factors for this year. We have four more trophies to win this season to add to our double and we aim to perform well in AFC Champions League. Everything is possible if you work hard and have that belief so these are the achievements I am focusing on for this season.<br /><br />Most of the players are still here and we have signed some very good players as well for this season. Adrian is a very good player and very good with the ball and he will bring more quality in the front third of the field. I’m excited to be playing with him and the rest of the squad. As soon as I came I had a very good relationship with Arnie, he is the only coach I have worked with for more than two years in my career so we have a very good understanding. He has helped me a lot to adapt to A-League football and will help me to get better this year</p>
