  <p><b>[Despite a poor surface, Sydney FC were outstanding in the first half of their 3-1 win over Wellington Phoenix]</b> Graham Arnold was unbelievable. When I feel fresh, I can do everything. But when I’m tired, like last week <b>[against Roar]</b> … But tonight we showed a great performance, we played very well and to be honest Wellington played good and should score one more.<br /><br />We need to play like the first half. Keep the ball and create chances and we scored three goals</p>

  <p><b>[Johnny Warren medallist Milos Ninkovic never believed his football career would take him to Australia]</b> If somebody told me after the World Cup that I would play in Australia I would never have believed them but this is life and this is football. You never know what is going to be tomorrow.<br /><br />Fifteen years I’ve played overseas and my parents are 60 years old, so maybe it’s the time to spend more time with them<br /><br /><b>[Ninkovic insisted that he is happy in Sydney and paid tribute to the job coach Graham Arnold]</b> They signed some unbelievable players and we still have an unbelievable atmosphere and I think that’s the key. I played with some very good players, at Dinamo Kiev for example, but we didn’t have this atmosphere in the team</p>

  <p><b>[Sydney FC’s penalty hero and Johnny Warren medallist Milos Ninkovic has given the strongest indication he will stay with the A-League champions]</b> I like these guys too much, I like all these people and the fans and the club, and like I said, I can’t promise anything but I would like to stay, yeah.<br /><br /><b>[Sydney’s coach recently claimed Ninkovic’s decision would come down to what the Serbian midfielder’s wife wanted]</b> She said at the A-League awards that she wants to stay. So she wears the trousers, ‘Ninko’ doesn’t and ‘Ninko’ will do as he’s told.</p>
