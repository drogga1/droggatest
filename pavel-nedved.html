  <p><b>[Pavel Nedved has admitted that Juventus could be lured back into the transfer market, with the Serie A giants continuing to be linked with the likes of Ivan Rakitic and Mauro Icardi]</b> <b>[Sporting director]</b> Fabio Paratici has had a great transfer window and if other opportunities arise we will seize them. Juventus are historically built to win and we will try again this year. The team is responding well, we have two important players for each role and we feel strong. Our confidence is formed because of our players. I believe that we have created one of the best teams in Europe, and with a coach that will have the necessary time to develop his game<br /><br /><b>[Nedved has offered a positive update on Maurizio Sarri]</b> I bring you greetings from Maurizio Sarri, who will return after the international break. Important changes have been made but it’s not a moment of transition. Juve is made up of professionalism, work, and sacrifices and we want to win again this year. Sarri is better. He is a hard worker and would like to stay on the pitch every day. The absence of the coach on the bench can lead to difficulties, but we have already experienced a similar situation in the past<br /><br /><b>[While discussing those set to form part of Juve’s future, Nedved also moved to suggest that Gonzalo Higuain will be sticking around in Turin]</b> Higuain is one of the best strikers in the world. He knows Sarri well and has had a great pre-season, we are happy that he is with us</p>

He had a great pre-season<br /><br /><b>[Nedved dodged questions about Mauro Icardi, the Inter outcast who rumoured Juve target]</b> <b>[Sporting director]</b> Fabio Paratici has had done extraordinary things, some beautiful and important deals. The transfer window is still open and we will see if there are opportunities we can seize. We are not forced to do anything. If there are possibilities, we will do something. Otherwise, we will remain as we are<br /><br /><b>[Juve will, however, have to do without the guidance of head coach Sarri for their first two Serie A fixtures as he recuperates]</b> Pneumonia is not a simple thing. Sarri would like to be out the training pitch and in the office every day because he is a great professional, but he needs time. He is getting better.

  <p><b>[Juventus vice president Pavel Nedved is backing <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> to spearhead their Champions League challenge]</b> He is a champion and when he’s needed, he’s always there. He had some physical problems and is now back in good form. It’s nice to see <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> and <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Higuain</a> all playing together, and they can all be on the pitch at once if all three run and sacrifice themselves like they did yesterday against Udinese. The coach naturally evaluates the state of form of each one when he makes his choices and, at the moment, they are all in form and you can see it<br /><br />We can’t complain, considering that last year we drew Atletico <b>[Madrid]</b>, but if you’re not in form when the Champions League comes back around between February and March, there is little that you can do. The precedents are favourable to us, but they do not count for anything - only the form in the moment counts. The Champions League must not be an obsession but a concrete goal. We, like other teams, want to win the final, but in the Champions League, one mistake can send you out</p>

  <p><b>[Pavel Nedved has told the club’s <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> opponents to stop blaming referees for their defeats against the Turin giants]</b> I’ve been here for six months, I’ve never criticised the referees, but I say now that referees cannot decide the games. I am disgusted. Maybe the first was a penalty, but the second certainly was not. The referees cannot decide the games, they need to let the players do their work on the pitch.<br /><br /><a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have a massive wage bill; they don’t need extra help. I am disgusted by what I saw today, but also last week with Genoa and then against Inter. I’ve never spoken like this, but let <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> be stronger than us on the pitch, don’t make it easier for them this way. The lads are demoralised, poor lads, I feel bad for them. It simply was not a penalty. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are such a strong team, let them play, let us play. We’ve had three games one after the other where there were bad decisions and the referee didn’t go to the VAR, this time they went twice to view it. We don’t deserve to be treated this way<br /><br />He’s got all my respect but we’re tired of this trend. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have won with merit. Enough with the excuses of those teams who lose against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. We deservedly won today by doing a little more than them. Things should not be said before people have calmed down. This excuse is being used a little too much against Juventus</p>
