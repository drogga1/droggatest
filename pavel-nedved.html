  <p><b>[Juventus considered a move for Cristiano Ronaldo to be crazy when it was first discussed]</b> We are very happy that we could welcome to our team such a world class player like Ronaldo. As a club we have made a step forward and we want to make it count in the Champions League, which has been set as our objective in the next few years. Some might have thought it was crazy … We, Juventus, are in position where it is very difficult to buy players who are better than those in our XI. Our sporting director once said that we could buy Ronaldo. We had known about his buy-out clause which had been lowered to €100m, so it became more realistic. We had to go see the President, who looked at the deal from all aspects and eventually gave his agreement. It was the right decision to get Juventus where the club belongs. We want to win the Champions League, so it was a good move.<br /><br /><b>[Asked how difficult it was to bring Ronaldo on board]</b> It was a lot easier given the fact he wanted join us. He wanted a change of environment and to leave Madrid. He has chosen our club and it is an honour for us. He managed to win in England and in Spain and we would be very happy if he can repeat it in Italy. We will give our all. When the idea was first suggested, we looked at each other and then at the president <b>[Andrea Agnelli]</b>. Maybe <b>[director Fabio]</b> Paratici was expecting him to say that we were crazy. I’ve told Agnelli that it is the right move, that our team would take a step forward. We’ve won seven titles in a row. Whether you want to, or not, the motivation level drops. When you have the opportunity to change something, you do it. This was perfectly timed for us<br /><br />He is amazing from all aspects. He is a player who is working very hard on himself. He is a leader, he doesn’t even have to speak and the players follow him. Our youngsters have the opportunity to train with him and get even better. Cristiano is a normal guy who loves to win and wants to be the best at everything. He asked me about how it works in Italy and what he can expect. It’s far more difficult to score goals here and I think he has figured that out already. However, it is only a matter of time before he starts scoring. He has won five Ballon D’Ors, yet during training it looks like he has just began his career. It’s fantastic to see him train, he always looks for a way to improve himself. It’s very positive, especially for young players who see their example every day</p>

We knew him as a player but now we know him as a person and we’ve all been really impressed by his personality, his character. He is much more than a player. The way I describe Juventus is that it exactly matches with him. Ronaldo is a Juventus player. It’s a perfect fit and it is the perfect mentality<br /><br />I’ve always appreciated English football and the Premier League, I’ve always liked it. My agent received some offers and I have always been a great supporter of Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson, specifically, at that time. They were certainly one of our greatest opponents and also a great source of inspiration and drive and desire.

We earned two more games in the Champions League, two games in the quarter-finals. It was a beautiful thing for them and our fans.<br /><br />I’m neither happy nor unhappy. I think it’s going to be a beautiful tie. Ajax showed what they can do by putting out Real Madrid. It was no fluke; I enjoyed their performance a lot. We have to be very careful. We now have to face Ajax with the same enthusiasm we had against Atletico. I’m very happy because I’m convinced they will be two beautiful games</p>

We have ideas, including some pretty clear ones, but have made no decisions.<br /><br />The club had to make a decision, we made it, I feel this era came to a natural end, without a specific reason. It was a very important cycle and I don’t think it will ever be repeated again. Max won 11 trophies, almost everything we asked of him, so he deserves only praise and a great farewell. The same goes for <b>[defender]</b> Andrea Barzagli, as it is their celebration. There was no one reason, this experience just came to a natural end.

The referees cannot decide the games, they need to let the players do their work on the pitch.<br /><br /><a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have a massive wage bill; they don’t need extra help. I am disgusted by what I saw today, but also last week with Genoa and then against Inter. I’ve never spoken like this, but let <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> be stronger than us on the pitch, don’t make it easier for them this way. The lads are demoralised, poor lads, I feel bad for them. It simply was not a penalty. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are such a strong team, let them play, let us play. We’ve had three games one after the other where there were bad decisions and the referee didn’t go to the VAR, this time they went twice to view it. We don’t deserve to be treated this way<br /><br />He’s got all my respect but we’re tired of this trend. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> have won with merit. Enough with the excuses of those teams who lose against <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. We deservedly won today by doing a little more than them. Things should not be said before people have calmed down. This excuse is being used a little too much against Juventus</p>
