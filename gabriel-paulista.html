  <p><b>[Valencia’s Gabriel Paulista furious after Getafe humbling]</b> I want to say something but I can’t. Everything has gone wrong. Going out of the cup against Granada was very hard, and today it was a game we could win and it was sh*t all over. We have a week to recover and be strong again. We have to win at <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>. We have to change our attitude, play like men on the field and fight - respecting the opponent and being more forceful in every aspect of the game. There are important players missing but that cannot be an excuse for us. Those of us who are fit to play have to work and be stronger, from the goalkeeper to Maxi <b>[Gomez, the striker]</b>. At home we are strong, but if we play like that we will lose. I congratulate Getafe</p>

  <p><b>[Gabriel Paulista warns against restarting <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> too soon]</b> Professional footballers are privileged people, but we are human first and foremost. We have family, loved ones and feelings. We are always asked to set the example and that is the way it should be, many kids and young people look up to us. Let’s set an example to society that we value our lives and health above all. For me, and I am sure for the vast majority of footballers, money is not everything<br /><br />I don’t want that, by rushing back or due to economic pressures, which we can understand but never prioritise over more important matters, any family member, friend or work colleague gets sick and dies. After this terrible time we are still suffering, nobody should be infected again or die due to this illness. I love the sport of football, I love playing, I love my club and we always want to make the fans happy, but also and above all I love and respect the lives of every human being. Let’s play when nobody does so with fear and have full guarantees there is no risk. Otherwise, if we are not given full guarantees, let’s follow the example of other countries which have taken stronger measures. First comes life, and then football!</p>
