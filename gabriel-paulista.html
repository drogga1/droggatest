  <p><b>[Arsenal defender Gabriel Paulista broke down in tears while recording an emotional message to Chapecoense]</b> It’s a bit hard to talk about what happened. I wish the families can have strength and I hope God can comfort their hearts. I had many friends over there, I played for Vitoria for five years and I worked with the coach <b>[Caio Junior]</b> and the backroom staff, and two other players as well. We were very close friends.<br /><br />This is really hard to take. It’s something we never imagine will happen with us or with a close friend. The minimum I can do is send my condolences to all their families and wish that they can carry on. I know it’s not easy to lose a member of the family. I know it from experience - I’ve lost a brother myself and I know how painful it is.<br /><br />I ask for strength for this team that enchanted Brazilian football, a group that five years ago was in the fourth division and surprised everyone. We have only good memories to keep in our hearts from this team and the friends I made through football.<br /><br />We have a message group from Brazil and I texted them to say ‘don’t leave for tomorrow what you can do today’. I say that because on my last birthday I felt this urge to talk to Caio Junior and for some reason I left it for another day, and then this tragedy happens. So if you think you want to do something just get out there and do it because we don’t know what tomorrow brings.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Arsenal defender Gabriel Paulista believes that the north London derby feels like a war]</b> When I played against Tottenham, during the day ahead of the game it felt completely different to playing any other team. It was a kind of war. As soon as I arrived in London, I was told I could lose to any other team apart from Spurs. Arsenal have got much more history than Tottenham and that means they should be above them. But Spurs have been improving every season and the coach is fantastic and they have great players too</p>

  <p><b>[Gabriel Paulista says he faced undeserved criticism during his time at Arsenal]</b> I deserved more of an opportunity. Sometimes I played because my team-mates were injured. I did play and sometimes even after playing well, I’d go home sad, given that I was only playing because my team-mate was injured. I don’t think I deserved that. I think I had the ability to play and to start games because I deserved to do so, or because I did well in training, but that didn’t happen. Sometimes I’d play three or four games and if Arsenal lost, I’d be dropped and everyone on the outside would say: ‘It’s Gabriel’s fault’.<br /><br />That wasn’t good for me. People thought: ‘When that guy plays, Arsenal always lose.’ When <b>[Hector]</b> Bellerin got injured, I played at right-back and Arsenal started to lose. I think I played in four or five games en route to the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City and I played brilliantly in that game. I played really well and I received plenty of praise. Then I think we faced Tottenham away and lost, I gave away a penalty in that game and lost my place in the team. I didn’t play again. I played in the last Premier League game because everyone was injured, all the centre-backs were out … I was quite down about how it went because of these reasons and it didn’t sit well with me.</p>

  <p><b>[Chicharito wanted at Valencia by former Arsenal star]</b> It is only talk, but we know he is a great player who would add a lot to us. We do not know if the transfer will happen but we know that if it does then it would add more quality to the squad and further competition. We already have a very good squad with lots of quality, but this signing would help.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>’s Gabriel Paulista furious after <a href="getafe-fc.html">Getafe</a> humbling]</b> I want to say something but I can’t. Everything has gone wrong. Going out of the cup against Granada was very hard, and today it was a game we could win and it was shit all over. We have a week to recover and be strong again. We have to win at <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>. We have to change our attitude, play like men on the field and fight - respecting the opponent and being more forceful in every aspect of the game. There are important players missing but that cannot be an excuse for us. Those of us who are fit to play have to work and be stronger, from the goalkeeper to Maxi <b>[Gomez, the striker]</b>. At home we are strong, but if we play like that we will lose. I congratulate Getafe</p>

  <p><b>[Gabriel Paulista warns against restarting <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> too soon]</b> Professional footballers are privileged people, but we are human first and foremost. We have family, loved ones and feelings. We are always asked to set the example and that is the way it should be, many kids and young people look up to us. Let’s set an example to society that we value our lives and health above all. For me, and I am sure for the vast majority of footballers, money is not everything<br /><br />I don’t want that, by rushing back or due to economic pressures, which we can understand but never prioritise over more important matters, any family member, friend or work colleague gets sick and dies. After this terrible time we are still suffering, nobody should be infected again or die due to this illness. I love the sport of football, I love playing, I love my club and we always want to make the fans happy, but also and above all I love and respect the lives of every human being. Let’s play when nobody does so with fear and have full guarantees there is no risk. Otherwise, if we are not given full guarantees, let’s follow the example of other countries which have taken stronger measures. First comes life, and then football!</p>
