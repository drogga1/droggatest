  <p><b>[Alireza Jahanbakhsh speaks about the World Cup’s influence on him and his family’s lives]</b> I have a strong memory of watching the 2006 World Cup at home with my family. As we were watching a game, my father turned to me and said, ‘This is my biggest dream - to see you one day playing wearing that shirt at a World Cup’. I was just a kid at the time; neither of us could have imagined I would do just that only eight years later. But his dream definitely became my dream, and I was really determined to do whatever I could to make it happen</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton’s Alireza Jahanbakhsh returns form injury]</b> Thankfully, my condition is great, and I’ve trained with the team in the past couple of days. I have no problem to play this game <b>[against Iraq]</b>, and I am ready. It’s up to the staff to decide whether they want to use me or not</p>

  <p><b>[Alireza Jahanbakhsh and <a href="aaron-mooy.html">Aaron Mooy</a> on target as Brighton beat Bournemouth 2-0]</b> It’s been a long time coming and I didn’t make minutes but I have been waiting for this time for a long time. Before the match I had a great feeling because I’m playing well and I’m glad to help us win the game.<br /><br />Obviously it was an emotional moment for me, I had ups and downs last year, trying to settle. This season it felt good with the new manager</p>

  <p><b>[Brighton’s Jahanbakhsh savours stunning equaliser against Chelsea]</b> It is an amazing feeling. When I was about to go on, I had a feeling I could have an impact on the game. When I saw the ball, I just tried to hit it as hard as I could and the bicycle kick was the only option. I’m going to watch it a couple more times<br /><br /><b>[His effort also broke an unwanted run for the Seagulls, who had lost each of their last 11 encounters with Chelsea]</b> It has been a really tough time for me. I have been training well and working hard to get my chance. Luckily, it has gone the way I wanted. I’m very glad to help the team win points. I couldn’t start the year any better<br /><br /><a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are a great side. We knew it was going to be a tough game. First half, we controlled most of the game. We were dominant most of the time and we had chances to win. We did a great job. It’s a great performance. 2019 didn’t go as well as I wanted. I tried to end the year as well as I could and I’ve started 2020 in the best way possible.</p>
