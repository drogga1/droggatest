  <p><b>[Ruben Neves has revealed that he wants to stay at Wolverhampton Wanderers following their promotion to the Premier League]</b> Honestly, I love to play here. I love the boys and I love the fans. I am really happy here. I have it all to stay, but in football we never know. Yes, I would like to stay. Of course, it is my first season in the Premier League. It is the place that Wolves deserve. The fans deserve it as well. So I am happy here, like I said before. If it is possible, I would like to stay here to have my first year in the Premier League. We go in the same path <b>[in the Premier League]</b>, we work hard in the way that we play.<br /><br />Now it is a little bit early to talk about targets. Like I said before, we want to be champions and we will focus on that now. We are really happy because we achieved our goal a little bit early. Now we have another goal, we want to be champions and we have three games to go. We have to go back to working hard to get this goal. Of course, I think all the players enjoyed this moment. That’s what we wanted from the beginning of the season. Now we can enjoy it because we are in the Premier League and that’s the most important thing. It is really good for me. When I came here, I came to improve myself and help the club. Fortunately, I have improved myself this year in a really good league so I am happy to be here. I love the club and I love the fans. I am happy to be here and fortunately, we are in the Premier League and that’s the most important thing.<br /><br /><b>[On hoping that Portugal manager Fernando Santos notices his good form]</b> Yes, of course. All players are thinking about that but honestly, I am focused on here and now. After, if I have to go to the World Cup then I will be happy with that. They have Wolves TV to see some of my games, sometimes they see it on Sky Sports so, yes, they see my games. Honestly no <b>[I haven’t spoken to Santos]</b>, they sent me a message to congratulate me for the promotion but nothing more. Not the manager, but the director of the Portugal FA</p>

  <p><b>[&gt; <b>[Will Wolves sensation Ruben Neves be a Premier League star?]</b> Andrea Pirlo is a reference for me because of the style of play<br /><br />Honestly, I love to play here. I love the boys and I love the fans. I am really happy here. I have it all to stay, but in football we never know. Yes, I would like to stay</b></p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Neves has hailed his international team-mate <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> as the greatest player of all time]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is the best. He showed that in the semi-finals and again. We are lucky to have him in our team.<br /><br /><b>[Asked whether he thought <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> was the best of all time]</b> Of course, yes. For me, he’s the best ever, and I’m a really lucky guy to play with him</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Neves is not concerned about <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s state of mind for Portugal despite a difficult week at club level with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is fine, had a great training session, as always, and he has a great motivation for the match. He’s fully prepared for the match. I guess he has no idea of what people are talking about. He had a fine training session, as I’ve already said, so I guess we can expect the <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> we always see in the game tomorrow<br /><br /><b>[<a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> midfielder Neves has continued to impress this season after catching the eye in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> last term, but it was put to him that he seems more reserved when wearing a Portugal jersey]</b> No, no. We have lots of matches with <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>. If we compare my number of matches and goals for <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> and the same for Portugal, the difference won’t be big. So, I’m focused on helping my national team all the times I’m called up and don’t have anything more to say about this</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> midfielder Ruben Neves quantifies the perils of away days in the Championship]</b> It’s not easy. The competitive nature, the aggressiveness, the stadiums and the crowd. Actually, it’s why I think playing away in the Championship was tougher than in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, because of these atmospheres. Sometimes I tell my friends what a great league it is: very competitive, the fans, the atmosphere - it’s all so special</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> talisman Ruben Neves has outlined his plans to return to <a href="porto-fc.html">FC Porto</a> one day]</b> I hope to return to <a href="porto-fc.html">FC Porto</a>, without a doubt. I had the misfortune of not winning any title at <a href="porto-fc.html">FC Porto</a>, so it is one more reason to want to return to fill that chapter that is missing in my career. If everything goes well and I have that opportunity, I would like to come back<br /><br />I think I would be connected to football anyway <b>[if I weren’t a footballer]</b>. I have the idea of being a very aware coach in my head. I would try even if I weren’t a player. Another area that I can bet on at the end of my career is that of physical therapy</p>

But we don’t think about it. We want to be together for as much time as we can but it’s football, the speculation will always be there.
