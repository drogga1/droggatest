  <p><b>[Ruben Neves is not concerned about <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s state of mind for Portugal despite a difficult week at club level with Juventus]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is fine, had a great training session, as always, and he has a great motivation for the match. He’s fully prepared for the match. I guess he has no idea of what people are talking about. He had a fine training session, as I’ve already said, so I guess we can expect the <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> we always see in the game tomorrow<br /><br /><b>[Wolves midfielder Neves has continued to impress this season after catching the eye in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> last term, but it was put to him that he seems more reserved when wearing a Portugal jersey]</b> No, no. We have lots of matches with <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>. If we compare my number of matches and goals for <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> and the same for Portugal, the difference won’t be big. So, I’m focused on helping my national team all the times I’m called up and don’t have anything more to say about this</p>

  <p><b>[Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves quantifies the perils of away days in the Championship]</b> It’s not easy. The competitive nature, the aggressiveness, the stadiums and the crowd. Actually, it’s why I think playing away in the Championship was tougher than in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, because of these atmospheres. Sometimes I tell my friends what a great league it is: very competitive, the fans, the atmosphere - it’s all so special</p>

  <p><b>[Wolves talisman Ruben Neves has outlined his plans to return to FC Porto one day]</b> I hope to return to FC Porto, without a doubt. I had the misfortune of not winning any title at FC Porto, so it is one more reason to want to return to fill that chapter that is missing in my career. If everything goes well and I have that opportunity, I would like to come back<br /><br />I think I would be connected to football anyway <b>[if I weren’t a footballer]</b>. I have the idea of being a very aware coach in my head. I would try even if I weren’t a player. Another area that I can bet on at the end of my career is that of physical therapy</p>

  <p><b>[Ruben Neves says everyone at <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> is turning a deaf ear to the transfer talk which has become a potential distraction to the likes of <a href="adama-traore.html">Adama Traore</a> and Raul Jimenez]</b> There has always been speculation since I’ve got here about our team. But we don’t think about it. We want to be together for as much time as we can but it’s football, the speculation will always be there. Our job is to play and leave this for the people who need to take care of it<br /><br /><b>[Wolves having made a return to full contact training]</b> <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> having made a return to full contact training. So far we had only trained individually or in small groups without contact</p>
