  <p><b>[Lyon and France defender Wendie Renard has appealed for help after losing a trophy for being named in FIFA’s team of the year on a train]</b> Yesterday, I took the Paris-Lyon train at 9:56am (non-stop) and I arrived at 12:00 at Part-Dieu station <b>[in Lyon]</b>. Unfortunately for me, I forgot my cabin suitcase and in it I was carrying my trophies (France Football and The Best). I realised this once I got home, so I left and went back to Perrache Station. The reception desk handed me the suitcase, but The Best trophy was no longer inside. For my part, I did what I had to. But I count on SNCF <b>[France’s national railway company]</b> staff to help me find the trophy</p>
