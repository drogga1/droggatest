  <p><b>[Defender Wendie Renard praised her team-mates and French fans after her brace helped lead France to a 4-0 win over South Korea in the opening game of the 2019 Women’s World Cup]</b> We knew very well that we would take a breath of emotions tonight. We managed well, when we have 45,000 people singing La Marseillaise, we can only transcend. We have used the fans to make a good start. In World Cup, I have never scored. It’s really good on a personal level. Collectively these are very important goals just before half-time.</p>

  <p><b>[Hosts France got the tournament underway with an emphatic 4-0 win over South Korea. Wendie Renard expressed her delight with her brace after the game]</b> I had never scored a goal in the World Cup. It is really good on a personal level. These two goals were also very important collectively, because they arrived just before half-time, which is great for confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Wendie Renard said after <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>’s latest Champions League triumph]</b> Before the match, I told Shanice van de Sanden to stick to her qualities because she was asking too many questions. With that, she hurt the opponent and she delivered two good passes</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> and France defender Wendie Renard has appealed for help after losing a trophy for being named in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s team of the year on a train]</b> Yesterday, I took the Paris-Lyon train at 9:56am (non-stop) and I arrived at 12:00 at Part-Dieu station <b>[in <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>]</b>. Unfortunately for me, I forgot my cabin suitcase and in it I was carrying my trophies (France Football and The Best). I realised this once I got home, so I left and went back to Perrache Station. The reception desk handed me the suitcase, but The Best trophy was no longer inside. For my part, I did what I had to. But I count on SNCF <b>[France’s national railway company]</b> staff to help me find the trophy</p>
