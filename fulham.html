  <p><b>[Fulham have announced the permanent signing of former Newcastle United forward Aleksandar Mitrovic]</b> We are delighted to confirm Aleksandar Mitrović’s return on a permanent deal for an undisclosed fee from Newcastle United. The popular striker has signed a five-year deal, keeping him at Craven Cottage until at least the summer of 2023, and will wear the number nine shirt. Mitrovic originally joined the Whites on loan at the 11th hour on deadline day in January, and went on to have a hugely significant impact in our promotion to the Premier League. The 23-year-old striker proved to be the perfect fit for Fulham, scoring 12 times in just 17 starts to help the team reach Wembley. Instantly taken to by the fans, the sounds of the 39,000-strong White Wall belting out ‘Mitro’s On Fire’ during the celebrations at the national stadium will live long in the memory. Such was his popularity, he came fifth in the voting for Fulham’s Player of the Season award, despite spending less than half the campaign in SW6</p>
