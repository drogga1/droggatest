  <p><b>[Bolton Wanderers defender Gary <a href="tim-cahill.html">Cahill</a> bemoans bad luck in last few games. The centre-back pointed to Sunday’s 1-0 home defeat against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as a case in point]</b> There are a lot of positives we can take away from the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game. It shows how far we’ve come this season. If you ask the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> manager I’m sure he’ll say he’s over the moon with the three points. But not only that, we had a number of chances ourselves and had we taken them it could have been a completely different story<br /><br /><b>[The defeat to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was preceded by two away draws at West Bromwich Albion and Wigan Athletic, either side of a last-gasp home win over <a href="stoke-city-fc.html">Stoke City</a>. <a href="tim-cahill.html">Cahill</a> believes that poor decisions in each of those draws cost Bolton a number of points]</b> We’re just not getting the rub of the green at the moment. At West Brom and Wigan we’ve been unfortunate with offside decisions where we could have not only ended up with a clean sheet, but three points too. It’s such a tight league at the moment. We won’t get down about the result because we know a couple of wins on the spin you’re soon right back up there<br /><br /><b>[Bolton’s next fixture is at home to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> on Saturday, and <a href="tim-cahill.html">Cahill</a> believes they have enough quality in their squad to aim for all three points]</b> We’ve got <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> next, we’re at home again and we’ve got to be looking at picking up three points. We’ve proved this season we are a difficult side to play against. We’ve got such a strong group of players at the moment and that’s important. We’ve got players on the bench who are more than capable of coming in and changing the game, and players who can fill in when needed</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill has accused <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> of a lack of respect as his <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> career heads to a disappointing conclusion]</b> It’s been really terrible for me personally. It will just be erased out of my head when I leave <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. My last memory will be last season’s FA Cup final.<br /><br />It’s been very difficult. I have played on a regular basis over the previous six seasons and I’ve won everything with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, so to be watching from the stands is something I didn’t expect. I know how the whole club works, I’ve got a big relationship with all the players and staff, and yet none of that has been utilised.<br /><br />If you are not playing a player, any player, for two, three, four games, then you don’t have to give a reason for that. But if it gets to eight or nine games, then you have to explain the situation. What’s going on? But the manager hasn’t done that. I see some of the situations with players who won the title with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, not just myself, and it just hasn’t been right. It makes it very hard for me to have respect for someone who has not respected what some of us have won with the club<br /><br /><b>[Cahill was linked with a loan move in the January transfer window, though that failed to materialise, in what has been a wasted season]</b> I went to the World Cup and didn’t play, but I came back with an even higher opinion of <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a>. It’s all about how you treat somebody. I’ve adapted to the different tactics, formations and philosophies of all the managers I’ve played under and will continue to learn from my next coach. Every experience, good or bad, is a learning process. I’m quite proud with how I have dealt with it. I’ve not been disruptive and I’ve trained hard every single day.<br /><br />I’ve got respect for all the other people at the club, the players and the staff and the people who helped to give me a chance, so it’s been important to me to conduct myself in the right way. And when you see an <a href="ethan-ampadu.html">Ethan Ampadu</a>, or another young player coming through, he can see how you behave every day, so you have to set the right example<br /><br />People talk as though my career is coming to an end, but it’s not like that for me at all. I 100 per cent see me playing another three or four years easily in terms of the way I look after myself. I’m ready to go and I leave this club thankful to all the players, staff and fans who have helped me so much, and I go with my head held high</p>

  <p><b>[Cahill hopes for <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> future as he backs <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> to survive impending transfer ban]</b> I’ve got the utmost respect for <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpilicueta</a> as a player and a person. He’s played near enough every game, so, for me, it wasn’t an issue. He obviously wanted me to lift it and the lads wanted me to lift it with him, so it was nice from that point of view.<br /><br />Sometimes it’s nice to be a part of that. I’ve been lucky enough to be able to do that with the captain’s armband on in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup etc, and sometimes it’s nice to take a step back and let someone else have a moment. He had his moment as well and he fully deserved it, so, for me, it’s not an issue to step back and let the lads enjoy it. Next, I want to go away on holiday for a few weeks and then I’ll come back and see what options there are for me. I’m confident that potentially I might stay in the league but I want to wait and see, take the decision over the summer. I’ve got a lot of time to think about things and hopefully make the right decision. I can’t wait to get back playing next season. I’m looking forward to that<br /><br /><b>[Cahill is one of the few players at the club to have experienced a Champions League title win as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> prepare to return to the competition after a year in the Europa League]</b> To qualify for the Champions League is a great achievement and something that was a target for the lads, but to finish with a trophy is what they played for throughout the whole season. Looking forward, we have to see what happens with the ban and see how that plays out, but we’re looking forward to the young players coming through. They’re very exciting. I’m sure the fans will embrace that and the lads who are still here.<br /><br />I see the squad being able to build again and move forward. I don’t see why not. Experiences like this grow players to become leaders to go and do that, to play in big games. To play in the Champions League next year is massive for a lot of the players, especially the young players who will be involved.<br /><br />I don’t see why not, but it’s down to the individuals to grow into that kind of character. I’ve been involved in many a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> squad with leaders in there, and there are leaders in that dressing room. A generation moves on and then you can grow into that position. I’m sure they’ll be able to do that.</p>

Kurt Zouma, is a target for Everton following an impressive loan spell at Goodison Park last season, but <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> is keen to keep the France international following the release of Gary Cahill.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> have confirmed the signing of Gary Cahill following the defender’s <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> departure earlier this summer]</b> I’m glad to be here, I think it’s a good opportunity for me to continue my career in the Premier League, and to play in a good, exciting team. There are some very exciting, talented players here. I’m looking forward to the challenge. I’m hungry to prolong my career as long as I possibly can - I feel like I’m in great shape and whoever I play for, I’d like to think that I give it 110% and leave everything out there - so hopefully that will be good enough for the manager, my team-mates and also the fans</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill has said he wants to put his final year at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> behind him as he adjusts to life at <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a>]</b> I think you never saw on the outside how tough it was, to be honest. It’s something I never want to get used to, I’ve played a heavy part in every season I’ve been at that club, so it was a freak <b>[season]</b>. It’s erased out of my life, it was a horrible year but I won’t remember it in my career at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, I’ll remember all the seasons before that and how successful they were. The situation was always going to end in me leaving, it’d gone too far one way, especially with the manager there, it was always going to happen.<br /><br />In terms of my hunger, I got asked a question about what I want to do after winning this that and the other at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. That’s what I want to do, to go out and perform back to the levels I know I’m capable of, the levels you can produce with consistent games and to win football matches. The motivation is there in me, no question</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill has revealed that he suffered under <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a>’s tenure at Chelsea]</b> We went to the 2018 World Cup, got to the semi-finals, so I missed pre-season, which I think was massive looking back now. He was very much into his tactics, probably too much, and I missed all of that. I was on the back foot. To be brutally honest, halfway through the season, the relationship was gone. I don’t think that was ever going to be recovered. It’s difficult to have respect for some of the things he did. But I have a lot of respect for the club, and for the players. As a big figure then, as captain, to go about things totally the wrong way, which I easily could have done, it’s not the way to do it.<br /><br />Was that easy? No. Was that one of the mentally toughest things to deal with? Especially because it went on for so long? One hundred per cent. The maddest thing is when you don’t play for whatever reason - if you’re out of form, or if you had a few bad games and someone is playing better than you - I know in my head that if you give me four or five games in a row, I’ll be back. I’ll take my chance. You know that in yourself because you’ve got that burning desire inside of you. Give me five games and you won’t get this shirt back. That’s an arrogance you have to have. The problem is he never gave me that.<br /><br />He was a great manager. <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> said, ‘Right, I’m changing this’. He knows that formation inside out, and there was not one player on the pitch who did not know his role inside out. If you didn’t know it, you didn’t play. I played left of the three, whereas when we’d won the league with Jose (Mourinho), <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpi</a> (Cesar Azpilicueta) was left-back and I was right-sided centre-back. Yet then <a href="cesar-azpilicueta.html">Azpi</a> went from left-back to right-sided centre-back and I went to the left-sided centre-back. I spoke to <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> and he was adamant it would work. The Joses, the Contes. The attention to detail, the way they think. They never switch off. You have that confidence; an arrogance in a good way.</p>
