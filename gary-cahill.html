  <p><b>[Bolton Wanderers defender Gary <a href="tim-cahill.html">Cahill</a> bemoans bad luck in last few games. The centre-back pointed to Sunday’s 1-0 home defeat against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> as a case in point]</b> There are a lot of positives we can take away from the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game. It shows how far we’ve come this season. If you ask the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> manager I’m sure he’ll say he’s over the moon with the three points. But not only that, we had a number of chances ourselves and had we taken them it could have been a completely different story<br /><br /><b>[The defeat to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was preceded by two away draws at West Bromwich Albion and Wigan Athletic, either side of a last-gasp home win over <a href="stoke-city-fc.html">Stoke City</a>. <a href="tim-cahill.html">Cahill</a> believes that poor decisions in each of those draws cost Bolton a number of points]</b> We’re just not getting the rub of the green at the moment. At West Brom and Wigan we’ve been unfortunate with offside decisions where we could have not only ended up with a clean sheet, but three points too. It’s such a tight league at the moment. We won’t get down about the result because we know a couple of wins on the spin you’re soon right back up there<br /><br /><b>[Bolton’s next fixture is at home to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> on Saturday, and <a href="tim-cahill.html">Cahill</a> believes they have enough quality in their squad to aim for all three points]</b> We’ve got <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> next, we’re at home again and we’ve got to be looking at picking up three points. We’ve proved this season we are a difficult side to play against. We’ve got such a strong group of players at the moment and that’s important. We’ve got players on the bench who are more than capable of coming in and changing the game, and players who can fill in when needed</p>

  <p><b>[Switzerland vs England]</b> We’ve got a huge game on Monday and we know it is going to be very, very tough but it’s a chance for us to bounce back in a game which really matters.

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill feels England need to stop being too nice and is looking to take inspiration from Jose Mourinho’s approach at Chelsea]</b> We’ve been too nice, that comes with experience. We’ve got a very young team, but that’s a big part of the game to know when to slow things down. In terms of game management, there are times in the game to kill it off or slow things down when things aren’t going well. And we will learn that. Jose has been a master of that, it’s a part of play at Chelsea and that’s because there are so many experienced players in the squad. People know when to do that and not. That’s something that’s coming into the make up with England and that’s why we are progressing. At first it was from the manager. The things that we addressed and it was certainly one of them. Even in the last game <b>[against Estonia]</b>, there were tough moments. It was cagey, we wanted the first goal, it didn’t come for a long time and just to be patient and keep going and get the results.</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill says that the entire Chelsea side has to shoulder the blame for Diego Costa’s lean spell in front of goal]</b> The lack of goals did not even cross my mind to be honest, it’s a team thing. I think we could have played a lot better than that and if we had played a lot better, then Diego gets a few more opportunities - it goes hand-in-hand. I think we dug in when we had to. It wasn’t the prettiest, it wasn’t a nice sunny afternoon at Stamford Bridge, where we can just zip the ball about. It was tough but we dug in, got the point, we wanted three, but it wasn’t to be. But we have it in our make-up now, don’t lose.<br /><br />In the first half, maybe we could have had opportunities to put the game to bed if we took our chances. If it had gone to two, it would have been a different ball game. The way the second half went, taking everything in to account, it was important that we did not lose. And we didn’t, so it was good to have that in our make-up. Let’s see, it might be a huge point for us. They were very direct and I am not criticising them for that because I have been on both sides in teams that I have played in. They played to their strengths and thats why it was so difficult.<br /><br />It’s not hard if you want to achieve what we want. We have done so much hard work this season, to get us in this position, to almost to see the finish line. With 13 games now, it’s important that we chalk the games off with the right results. It’s a time to press on, yes. The motivation to try and finish the job should be there for everyone. There is a light at the end of the tunnel now and it’s just important we keep working, keep focussed, keep doing what we have been doing for 95 per cent of the season. I thought we could have played a lot better at Burnley and maybe that’s a little wake up call where we realise that it’s obviously going to be tough to cross the line and there is plenty of football to be played. It’s been going well for us this season. Every game is difficult in its own way and it is something we have to adapt too</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill is adamant Chelsea won’t be getting into any mind games with their rivals]</b> It is natural. We are watching how everyone does. It is natural and that’s the way it is. Everyone is fighting to try and win the league. We have put ourselves in a tremendous position, we are working hard. They played first and we got the result. The pressure was on us in that sense. I am sure they were watching and hoping that we would lose. It was important result, it could have been a sticky game for us but we did enough to get a result. I don’t care how we are top of the league. I think we are top of the league for a reason. We have been working hard, playing well, not conceding goals and so we are top of the league and we just want to continue that. Keep that going. I can’t stress enough that it is not over. We have got a difficult month, next month, which is going to be important. We are focused and we are not listening to any noise. We know what we are doing and we are fully prepared to see it over the line<br /><br />Experience comes into play at this stage of the season, especially. We know what we have got to do. We are focused. We have been doing the same things, working hard all season, nothing should change. Our focus shouldn’t change, our mindset shouldn’t change, the way we work shouldn’t change. Everything should be the same as what it has been. We have the experience to come to places like this and to sometimes be patient. In the first half we counter-attacked, it could have been two or three, but it wasn’t. We just had to be patient. We went in 1-0 and we were patient before we got the second goal, which I thought killed the game<br /><br />It is a fantastic game. It is a fantastic game for us, the neutral and for everyone involved. It is a huge game and there’s some huge teams still left in that competition so you are not going to dodge the big teams at this stage. If you are still in this competition, you are going to face the big teams that are left in it and that game is massive on Monday. We will be ready for it. We have got a week left to prepare and hopefully we will keep ourselves fit, as we have managed to do this season, and we will be prepared</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill thinks Eden Hazard showed his unique talent in the 2-1 win at West Ham to enable Chelsea to edge closer to the Premier League title]</b> Of course, I thought he was terrific. Players like that are special players, they are players you look to in tight games to try and open the door. To try and create something out of nothing and he was terrific again today. He got man of the match and I am sure he has got about nine of them at home after this season. He is in great form, long may that continue. Just like the rest of the boys. Everyone is in great form<br /><br />We have worked tremendously hard, up until this point, and we have got a lot of games left but it is a funny month as we have the cup next week and then we have got a league game and internationals. I was speaking today thinking we have two important games this month to get in a healthy position and that should be our aim. It is bizarre that we have got only two league games in a month. We have got the first one out of the way and a bit of time off until the next one</p>

  <p><b>[N’Golo Kante has to be a serious contender for the PFA Player of the Year award]</b> He has to be in consideration for it <b>[the Player of the Year award]</b>, for sure. Everyone has seen his qualities and what he brought to Leicester last season, with the story behind them winning the title. To come to a new club he has stepped up again and been tremendous this season. He works hard and is a humble guy off the pitch and on it he is phenomenal. I notice a lot obviously because he is just in front of me, he is winning balls he has no right to win and is also quality going forward - he breaks up play and bursts forward with the ball which eases the pressure on the back four and the team.<br /><br /><b>[On Antonio Conte]</b> He’s injected his ideas. When people talking about what we were lacking last season, I think it was a freak season. We are sitting with the same bunch of players near enough which performed well and won the league under Jose <b>[Mourinho, in 2015]</b>, we were top for nearly all of that season. It’s hard to say what drastically changed, just <b>[Conte’s]</b> ideas and the way he sees football being played in terms of formation, we have just adapted to that. It’s been different for us and new for everyone to learn, that is really the difference and you can see his hunger for winning, his desire and work ethic rubs off on the players on a daily basis</p>

It looked nasty when I saw it. I wish him all the best, it is not nice to pick up an injury or be out of the game. It is all about playing and keeping fit, I wish him all the best. He is a key player for them and he has proven that again this year. He is a talisman for them and it is a blow for them</p>

To come in and deal with the pressures that come with moving to a club like Chelsea and adapt the way he has is a testament to him. For me and the rest of the defence it’s great to have him protecting us like he does. He’s come here and adapted straight away and improved even more. He’s going to keep working hard and keep improving, he’s still only young. He’s been absolutely fantastic for us this season, but it is important to say everyone has.</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill is preparing to lead Chelsea out at Wembley against Tottenham in the FA Cup semi-final]</b> That’s our aim <b>[to win the double]</b>. It is going to be a great tie. I think for the neutral, it is a terrific semi-final of teams left in the competition. One to look forward to, one that will add importance. It adds importance, as games against Tottenham always are. We will be ready for it and we will look forward to it. It adds a little bit but no matter who you come up against, it is a semi-final at Wembley to get to the final. We should be preparing in the same way, doing the same things. It is great to be back at Wembley. It is a great stadium to play at.<br /><br />Listen, it is four top teams in there. They are four massive clubs, massive teams. I don’t think it was the hardest <b>[draw]</b> or easiest. Any draw would have been tough. We would be speaking about any of them in the same way. We have got Tottenham. There’s going to be a little added with the London rivalry but it is a route to the final. Whoever wins it will deserve to win it, with the strength of the teams in the semi</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea’s Gary Cahill was delighted to see Diego Costa put in a brilliant performance against Southampton as he returned to the goal trail]</b> I was delighted for Diego, I thought his fourth goal was absolutely brilliant. We have full confidence and belief in him as a squad of players. We know what he can produce, we were just waiting for him to deliver and he delivered. You’re not going to score in every game. Eden’s been chipping in with some important goals lately but Diego produced a great performance and I really felt the fourth goal was something special, it was a glimpse of what he’s been like for the majority of the season for us. I’m buzzing he scored and put in a performance like that.<br /><br /><b>[On his role as on-field leader after taking the captain’s armband in the absence of John Terry]</b> I’ve enjoyed it, I’ve had it for a lot of this season and I’ve enjoyed the added bit of pressure on my shoulders. I tried to give it to John <b>[Terry]</b> when he came on but he’s a bit superstitious and I don’t think he wanted it. It’s given me another challenge and a bit more responsibility, but everything’s the same</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill is a Premier League title winner with Chelsea but admits that he could have been turning out for Arsenal]</b> It was close. The move broke down on the fee, nothing to do with me. It never got down to whether or not I wanted to go there, it was between the two clubs. They showed interest, but they couldn’t agree a fee. It seemed like it went on forever, there was speculation for about a year and a half. I had a fantastic time at Bolton, but as a player when you hear the big clubs are sniffing, you want to achieve as much as you can.<br /><br />It becomes more like an addiction. When you get the feeling of winning a trophy, you just want it again and again. Outside my family and my kids being born, it’s the best feeling ever. It was again when we lifted the Premier League trophy the other day. You realise your career is short and you just want to achieve as much as you can. If you have no goals then what is the point of playing?</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez benefitted from the crazy offside rule to score the opening goal in Arsenal’s FA Cup final win over Chelsea]</b> I don’t understand why the referee didn’t decide to whistle. Yes, disappointment obviously, we wanted to finish the season <b>[well]</b>. We knew what the feeling would be like if we lost. It would put a bit of a dampener on the end of season celebrations and likewise, if we had won.<br /><br />Of course, we are disappointed. It is fresh in the mind and it is not a nice feeling. The offside rule is crazy. I spoke to a referee the other day, I forgot which game I was playing in but the ball got played through and the striker was offside. He made a run to it and then he’s veered off to go into the box and because he has veered off then he is no longer offside. It is a bizarre rule but nevertheless, forget the offside, for me I thought it was very lucky to not be given as a handball. When your arms are up near your face it is an unnatural positions to be in. So yes it should have been handball.<br /><br />You never know in football if they are going to come out and start nervy because it is a final. Or they start with the bit between their teeth. They showed hunger in the first 15-20 minutes so credit to them for that. The disappointment for us was that we didn’t play with the same intensity levels in the first half that we have been playing with all season. We looked slightly off the pace and it is unlike us. We are normally quick and strong and we normally build fast and everything was a little bit laboured.<br /><br />Whether that was ourselves or whether that was how well they pressed, I don’t know but that was the most disappointing thing for us in the first half. Naturally it is frustrating <b>[to concede so soon after scoring]</b>. We worked hard with 10 men to get back in. Energy levels, you are running off your heart there because we worked so hard to get back in. So it is devastating when that happens. It is unlike us again. When you get back in the game then that’s the time to steady the ship and work again. It was always going to be difficult with 10 men and it wasn’t to be. So we were disappointed with how quickly they went back in front<br /><br />For sure <b>[there are positives]</b>. It is difficult <b>[to say]</b> now because we have just earned a disappointment but when I reflect then I am sure it has been a great campaign for myself and the team. We have won the Premier League, that’s the trophy that everyone wants. We have to be proud of our 30 wins, no one has ever done that. We have to be proud of matching the 13 game win <b>[streak]</b>. We got the most clean sheets. There’s loads and when you look back, there is a lot to be proud of this season. We have made huge improvements and we are back this season as the best team in the league</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill desperate to avoid repeat of Chelsea’s 2015-16 slump]</b> I think a lot of the lads in our squad right now were involved in that situation. They have had the experience once and they don’t want that experience again. We will work even harder.<br /><br />It’s obviously very difficult to keep winning the title back-to-back. You have seen that with Leicester last season. It proved very tough. So we have to be mindful of that. And we need to do even more than what we did last year. That’s the only way. Like I said, there are quite a few players still in the squad who were involved in that. We know what that feeling was like and we don’t want that again<br /><br /><b>[On Alvaro Morata]</b> It’s great to have such a great player. He will be a great addition to the squad. There is no doubt about that. It’s more clear than said. He has won a lot of things already at such a young age. So it’s exciting for us as players to have someone like that involved now.</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill bemoans Chelsea decision to sell Matic to Man Utd]</b> Matic is a fantastic player, a real top player. I had the benefit of realising how good he is when he’s playing just in front of you, on and off the ball. He’s going to be a huge loss, there’s no doubt about that. And for us it’s important because it can be very offensive this formation. People look at it as a five <b>[in defence]</b> but really it’s a three a lot of the time. The two wing-backs are pushed very high and we attack with numbers, so for us at the back in terms of balance you have to have some sort of protection and they gave us that last season</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill has hailed Ross Barkley as a phenomenal signing for Chelsea after his £15 million move from Everton]</b> Phenomenal. I think it is a great signing. It is a bargain. Looking at this market, in this day and age, it is a snip for a player like him. I’ve played with him and trained with him and I know what the boy is capable of, so does everyone else. He’s capable of whatever he wants, if you look at him, he reminds me of Ruben <b>[Loftus-Cheek]</b> in terms of his attributes. Has he got a good left foot? A good right foot? Is he strong? Is he quick? And can he finish? Is he good on the ball? He ticks all the boxes. All he needs is a platform just to go and express himself. This club will give him that, like they gave me and gave to other players. It is a big step and it is a good signing. For the money, it has to be a bargain. He’s come at a great age. He’s a fantastic age. I say <b>[to him]</b> come here and be confident, but not arrogant. Be confident, but listen and learn from the top players at this football club. Work hard at your game and then you will progress. He knows what he’s got to do. Listen, you’re not talking about a young player here. We’re talking about a player that has got over 20 England caps and a player that has played so many games in the Premier League. Even at such a young age, he won’t be needing too much advice from me. I’m sure he has that hunger. I text him before he came to see where he is and what not. I think he trained yesterday so I will bump into him on Monday when I get back <b>[to training]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[The draw means Chelsea now face eight games in 28 days]</b> Yes, we knew before, you draw the game and you have a replay. It is not ideal for most teams and that’s probably it, it is probably a punishment for not performing the way we should have done. I am not saying for the <b>[lack of]</b> effort because the effort was there. In the second half we tried and tried but the first half felt flat. The amount of games is incredible. We have a ridiculous amount of games at the minute and I said after the game the other day that it is mad. We don’t have a winter break and instead of having two weeks on a beach, we have even more games, so it is what it is. The manager changed the team today so we should have been fresh <b>[versus Norwich]</b>. Are we feeling it compared to teams in the other leagues? The Champions League teams that are going to be starting the second stage of their season? Possibly, who knows. It is intense.<br /><br />This December and January is intense. Listen, I’ve played in this league for ages so I know all about it. For the lads who are coming in it is different, having another game on top of all that now is not easy for us. I think it is an interesting debate and I can say that because I have been involved in it for 10 years or whatever, and I can say that because it has never bothered me before. I only looked at it this year when you look at players coming from overseas and they tell you the kind of schedule that they’ve had over Christmas. Last season and the season before in the Champions League all the English teams struggled to get into the later rounds. Why do you think that might be? It is not an excuse, it is just a fact. If you come to the latter part of the season, you’ve had two halves of the season, then it isn’t rocket science, you are going to feel fresher. 100 per cent. We don’t, so the boys that have come over are finding that a little bit intense now. I can say that, I am from here and I have never had a winter break so it is normal for me</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill says Chelsea’s players are in the dark over Antonio Conte’s future]</b> Of course we are <b>[100 per cent behind him]</b>. There is nothing between the manager and players, whatsoever. We continue to work hard. If you look at the league, if Manchester City hadn’t done what they’ve done, the title would still be there to be won. For them to be in the position they’re in this season, they’ve broken Premier League records. It shows how good they’ve done. If they hadn’t done as well as that - I know it sounds obvious - we would still be in with a chance of the title. This season they’ve been fantastic, but we still aim to fight for second place. We have a big month coming up in February, let’s hope we come out at the end of that month in a positive way. It is between the manager and the board. We have no idea about that, we have no idea what’s going on between the lines. We just continue to work and give what we can for him and give what we can for our team-mates. That’s the way we have to be. I have experienced it a lot in my time here, but this has been a successful period. Chelsea is a successful football club and he is a top manager. We can’t have any impact. We just sit and we work and try to produce what he asks of us. He is very experienced and, more often than not, we get results.<br /><br />Let’s see. The last couple of months have been demanding to say the least. In terms of the fixture pile-up I wonder if it has been worse than before. I don’t know if it is, but it feels very heavy. As players we can’t impact that <b>[the transfer window]</b>, it’s nothing to do with us. We go out there to try and do the best we can, to win games and to win competitions. Other people make decisions and hopefully they make the right ones. Let’s wait and see if anyone comes in. I feel okay. February is a huge, massive month for us with the fixtures coming up. However heavy it is, we are not going to be able to change the fixtures. We just need to find the opportunity to rest, take that chance and be as fresh as we possibly can. I’d love to feel how some of the other leagues do right now after having a two-week winter break, see what that feels like. Aside from that, we just continue. The manager has tried to rotate to keep people fresh. But he can only make so many because of the number of personnel in the squad and the importance of every game coming up. Yes, you get through it on adrenaline and on heart as well. When you’re feeling fatigued, you work even harder if that makes sense. It is what it is. I’m not complaining about it, I have done it for years and years. We will just get on with it. Everyone is in the same boat in this Premier League. Going back to the FA Cup, we went out of the semi-final of the Carabao Cup which was disappointing, and so this is really crucial to us now. We are delighted to progress. I thought the performance was good, some of the individual performances were good and it was good to see some of the young boys get on as well<br /><br />He <b>[Batshuayi]</b> got a start and he took his opportunity so I am delighted for him. He works very hard in training. I was delighted that he got two goals because we started slowly in the first 10-15 minutes, but we got the breakthrough and settled down after that. I thought we took control. The opening goal was good timing</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill says criticism of Chelsea is tiring]</b> I’m not knocking Liverpool and Spurs whatsoever because they have played some fantastic football and have some terrific players. But you put it into context - we are sandwiched in the middle of those two and yet everything seems rosy there and it’s all drama and a disaster here. It’s been that way a lot of the time since I have been at Chelsea and it does get tiring. In 2016 we finished 10th. Then the next year we dominated the League. Things like that stick in your memory when you have difficult times like this. When there has been a down at this club, we have bounced back in a fantastic manner. Going forward I see no issues.<br /><br />Finishing in the top four is a bare minimum for a club like Chelsea. It is the least we would expect from this season</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill is impressed by how Manchester United star Romelu Lukaku has developed into a world-class striker]</b> It’ll be difficult. I’ve played against him and trained against him loads of times. The cup final’s going to be whoever performs on the day. We’ve put the season to bed and we have a full week to prepare in the right way. When he was here he had talent but he was very young. He’s developed into a world-class striker so credit to him. Sometimes when you’re at a club like Chelsea you feel sorry when you see a player move on, because naturally some progress and some don’t. You don’t hear about the ones that don’t. We all know it’s hard to have time to come in as a young player – maybe the club and the supporters give you seven, eight, nine games where you’re rusty and not performing. It’s difficult to do that. They’ve gone on and developed elsewhere, and he’s gone on to be a top player. There’s loads of them. What everyone can see - pace, power, strength and he can finish. His goalscoring record is very good. But we’re not focusing on one player in this team. First and foremost, we’re focused on what we’re trying to do, and be respectful of the fact that they have numerous players who can turn a game on its head, as do we.<br /><br />I can only speak honestly for myself, maybe the club thinks differently. For myself it’s about winning competitions. You enter every competition trying to win it, and we fell short in the other competitions but we’ve not fallen short in this one yet. We’re in the final against a good team, but it’s about winning trophies. Obviously, we’re disappointed to not be in the Champions League, but if <b>[it were a choice between]</b> not qualifying for the Champions League and not winning anything, I’d definitely swap. That’s just my opinion. The Newcastle game has gone from my head. In terms of the game we couldn’t have done anything with a win, a loss or a draw, so the game has to be put to bed. We have to put that away and focus on the cup final this week. That’s what it’s about – training, preparing well this week and getting ready to go into a huge game at the weekend. I don’t care to be honest <b>[about who’s the favourite to win]</b>. Last year, maybe we went in as favourites and lost, but it doesn’t count for anything. It’s a one-off game and we’ve got a very good side with lots of quality, lots of experience of winning trophies, as do they. Obviously, they finished higher in the league than us this season, so maybe they are favourites, but we read nothing into it<br /><br />Yes, looking back at last season the campaign went so well, like what you’re seeing with Man City now. We had two weeks of putting our feet up, relaxing and playing 5-a-side games in training. They’ve deserved that, as did we last year. We trained well but naturally it was a very relaxed atmosphere, because we’d done all the hard work to win the league. When it came to the cup game we thought we’d just deliver what we’d done all season but it didn’t happen that way. Maybe if we’d won comfortably at Newcastle we’d go in with momentum, or maybe we’d go in a bit more relaxed thinking we’re in good form. There’s certainly none of that – we know we didn’t perform and this is the chance to win a title this year. The determination is there, for sure<br /><br /><b>[Cahill said of how Mourinho will prepare United]</b> A very organised game plan, for sure. He’s got experience. He’s a very successful manager and that’s not by luck, it’s by preparation. We expect nothing less. They’ve got some very strong players and he’s used to winning this competition. It’s all set up to be a great game, with two big teams putting everything on the line to win a trophy</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Cahill thinks Antonio Conte’s reign as manager of Chelsea has been successful]</b> I probably want the uncertainty to be put to bed and for whatever is going to happen, to happen. Naturally, we will see what happens with the club. I don’t really want to speak about it. Today is about celebrating the FA Cup. It is out of our hands. We fell short in some aspects this season but today we produced and the rest behind the scenes is not down to us. So we will wait and see. This summer, a lot of the lads have got big summers ahead. I am going to chill out of six days and take my mind away from football and look forward to the tournament with my national team. I feel a sense of uncertainty and I think that’s obvious to everybody in the last few months. What I can say, obviously we as players have no impact on that situation. I am sure, if I was a guessing man, they will have spoken between the club and manager. Let’s see, I am sure the manager will make the best decision for him and his family.<br /><br />I am sure the club will make the best decision for what they feel. I am not dodging the question but it is totally out of our hands, we just sit on the side. What I can say, it has been a great finish. If he stays on next year, then he stay on. If he doesn’t then we have ended with a Premier League and FA Cup. I think that is something that everyone at this club can be proud of, even the people behind the scenes who you don’t see. They work tirelessly behind the scenes and it is a long slog of a season. Everyone feels like we have got our reward now and we are going to celebrate and have a good time. We are going to celebrate all together as a team, as a tight-knit family. As I said, you have to enjoy these moments and they don’t come around every day. Who knows whether we will be in another FA Cup final, you never know, so enjoy the moment. I think the whole season almost built up to this day, where we had to try and rescue and produce today. sThat goes for all the staff and everyone who delivers behind the scenes. We had to try to deliver a trophy. When you look at it in terms of last year we got the Premier League title and this year was the FA Cup, it is not too bad. Two years, two titles and one runners-up. Like I said the other day, for me that is success.</p>

  <p><b>[Cahill has had a turbulant season of his own and had been dropped for a long period in winter and spring by Conte]</b> It feels amazing, absolutely amazing for a number of reasons. Number one, obviously with our season <b>[being tough]</b>. Two, we tasted disappointment in this competition last year. Three, we won this competition in 2012 but I didn’t play at centre half through injury.<br /><br />To be out there on the pitch, leave everything out there and win it today, from a selfish point of view is special for me. I felt the pressure before this game. I felt like we really had to win this game to save our season. When I say save it, I am not saying it has been a massive success, but at the same time it is the FA Cup. We have won a trophy this year which a number of teams haven’t. It is extremely difficult to do that. I wanted to remember the moment. Without being too emotional about it, it is one of those things when you grow up as a kid watching the FA Cup, then to play in an final is one thing and to win it is another<br /><br />To captain the club is another. So you have to remember these moments. I said to the lads before we went out not to take anything for granted in terms of being in a final. No matter what you have achieved in your career, I wanted them to remember when they were first starting out and looking for that first appearance, remember them days and don’t take it for granted that we reached the final. It is one of them, throughout the season, you take criticism and sometimes rightly so. We fell short in quite a few competition, like I said the other day. But you keep quiet, you keep plugging and plugging away and when you know what you could achieve at the end of the season.<br /><br />I had a feeling before the game and all week that it was a massive game. I wanted it more than anything and we have managed to deliver so it feels amazing. It is a dream, but you reap your rewards. I feel that if you keep working hard, then there’s a number of things needed. You need ability and character, you need all these things. But you sit quiet, take it on the chin when it is good or bad. You keep plugging away and you reap your rewards. I was out there today and I felt like I delivered a great performance, as did the rest of my team-mates on the biggest stage. I’d rather do my talking on the pitch. When I was out of the team it was difficult to do that but now I am back in the team and it is easier to do that and there’s no bigger stage than today. I spoke before the game <b>[to the team]</b>. That’s it. I don’t want to go too much into it because that’s personal for us. I touched upon it, I spoke before the game.<br /><br />I felt like we were ready, we were prepared. Someone said to me the other day, can you just switch it back on after that Newcastle performance? I felt confident this week and good. When you are in a squad, you are looking around to make sure that everyone is focused and feels the same way. I felt like that. Today was a strange game, it wasn’t the most exciting game for a neutral to watch, but we scored early in the game which probably made it more defensive for us. Naturally when you are 1-0 up against Manchester United, you are not going to gamble too much, when you are in the lead. We had to soak up a lot of pressure, I felt defensively, not just the back five and the team as a whole was terrific defensively. Of course, Thibaut had to pull off some saves</p>

  <p><b>[Loftus-Cheek’s hat-trick heroics spark Lampard comparisons and calls for patience from Gary Cahill]</b> What Frank did was incredible - churning out 20 goals a season. It was unbelievable. Ruben is going to take his own path in his career. He is more than capable of getting goals. He is at his best when you see him in that little pocket of space and he turns and bursts through. He is so powerful when he opens up in that area and people can’t get near him. He had a fantastic game and was clinical. Instead of creating chance after chance and winning 1-0, it was good to seal the game early on and get the points in the bag. It was clear to see we were the stronger team and Ruben revelled in that role. We had a lot of possession and created a lot of chances. He stuck them away and I’m delighted for him. He has had to be patient this season. For a young lad to come through the ranks and score a hat-trick at Stamford Bridge, no matter what the game, is a great memory for him. It was a top performance from a top player. We are very strong in that position. It is certainly a very strong area in our team. We have so many players who can play there. <b>[Mateo]</b> Kovacic has come in and is a very, very good player. The competition is fierce there like it is all over the team. He is amongst that. All you can do when you have an opportunity is to take it, and he did that<br /><br />Of course, when you look back at his history, he doesn’t tend to change the team too much. We haven’t lost in the league yet so why would he? Training is one thing, putting it into games is another. But in the European games and League Cup match at Liverpool, he has certainly got people that he can rely on. I’m sure he’s happy with that<br /><br />Possibly <b>[a five-team race]</b> but talk to me in January and February. I have been here loads of times and before Christmas you don’t see where it is going to go. Arsenal are on an unbelievable run of form at the minute. When they lost at our place and already points off the top, people were writing them off. All of a sudden they have been in unbelievable form. That’s what can happen. We did it the last time we won the league after losing at Arsenal and at home to Liverpool. Then we won 13 games in a row, which is why people should wait until the new year. I think if you are in a good position after Christmas and coming into January, you’re up there, you feel like you have a chance. There are loads of games to play until then, a lot can happen. It’s just a matter of going from one weekend to the next and building momentum. It’s great when you go back into training after getting three points. It’s the same going into training today after winning last night. It’s much better than going in after a loss. That’s why I say momentum is key, and we have that right now</p>
