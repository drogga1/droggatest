  <p><b>[Antonio Conte has been hailed by Davide Zappacosta as really important]</b> The coach is really important, he always tries to work in the best way for the team. Since the start of the year, he is working in a really good way for Chelsea and his objective is to keep on winning with Chelsea. He is a good coach because he is a football teacher and he makes you play in a good way. He gives you advice to make sure you are in exactly the right way on the pitch and gives you the strength of character to build your confidence.</p>

Inter? The interest is pleasing but I don’t know anything about it and I’m only thinking of Chelsea.</p>

  <p><b>[David Zappacosta is mulling over his options at Chelsea]</b> Could I return to Italy? Yes, Inter had been after me. My agent Alessandro Lucci had told me about their interest, although I’ve always remained focused on Chelsea.<br /><br />Could I return in January? I have three more years on my contract here and I only want to think about doing well with Chelsea. There’s a lot of competition here, but I want to win a place in the team. After that, it’s clear that if I didn’t find much room, I don’t think any player would like that</p>

  <p><b>[Italy international right-back Davide Zappacosta believes that his two-year spell with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> has benefitted him on and off the pitch]</b> I think I developed a lot as a person over the past two years in England. I think I’ve become a stronger character because I had to get to grips with a different place, a different culture, a different language and a different lifestyle. It certainly wasn’t easy, but it was a very positive experience that allowed me to develop both as a person and a player<br /><br /><b>[He says that he did not hesitate when he knew that AS Rome were interested in signing him]</b> When I got the call to say that I had the chance to come here I said yes straightaway because it’s a massive opportunity. I want to give all I have for this club, starting tomorrow<br /><br /><b>[The right-back will link up with the club’s sporting director <a href="gianluca-petrachi.html">Gianluca Petrachi</a>, who he previously worked under at <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> and Zappacosta says that this was a key factor in his decision to join]</b> He was definitely important because I know him from our time at <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a>. I know what kind of person he is: I know how much he cares and how passionate he is. That was definitely something that influenced my decision but, regardless of that, Roma is a big club with good prospects<br /><br /><b>[<a href="roma-fc.html">AS Roma</a> coach <a href="paulo-fonseca.html">Paulo Fonseca</a> is known for pushing full-backs forward and Davide Zappacosta says that this is something he will enjoy]</b> Yes, I think it will suit me well if we play with high full-backs but defending is still an important part of the role, especially in a back four. It could be good for me, though, because I’m used to getting forward. It’s something that will allow me to show the best of my game<br /><br /><b>[Roma face Genoa at home on Sunday in their opening <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> fixture and Zappacosta has fond memories of his previous games against the weekend’s opponents]</b> My first goals for both Atalanta and <a href="torino-fc.html">Torino</a> were against Genoa. I hope that’s a good omen for the season opener. It would be a dream come true to kick off with a goal but I think the most important thing is to start well as a team and achieve our objective of getting the three points</p>

  <p><b>[Davide Zappacosta: I would love to stay at Roma]</b> On a personal level, I would love to stay in Rome for several reasons. The main one is that I want to show the fans, my team-mates and the management who I am and what I can do. I have worked a lot in these months, I have trained and I have made sacrifices to be available at the restart of the championship. I am doing some sessions completely dedicated to the knee, because it takes time to recover better from this injury. But now I feel 90 per cent fit<br /><br />England and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have given me a lot. I had the chance to play with great champions and win two trophies. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is a championship where people never give up</p>
