Frank Lampard’s decision to use academy graduate Reece James in his first-team plans next season could spell the end for Davide Zappacosta, who may find himself as the third-choice right-back</p>

<p>: 2019 07 30

  <p><b>[Chelsea also confirmed Davide Zappacosta’s departure on Wednesday, while also revealing they had extended the defender’s contract]</b> Davide Zappacosta has signed a one-year extension to his contract at Chelsea and moved to Roma on loan until the end of January. Zappacosta’s 12-month extension takes his contract at Chelsea through to June 2022. Good luck in Rome, Davide!</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea defender Davide Zappacosta joins AS Roma on loan]</b> I am pleased to join Roma, after an experience overseas that helped me progress as both a player and a person. Being able to play for a great club like this is a huge motivation - I cannot wait to start training alongside my new teammates</p>

  <p><b>[Italy international right-back Davide Zappacosta believes that his two-year spell with Chelsea has benefitted him on and off the pitch]</b> I think I developed a lot as a person over the past two years in England. I think I’ve become a stronger character because I had to get to grips with a different place, a different culture, a different language and a different lifestyle. It certainly wasn’t easy, but it was a very positive experience that allowed me to develop both as a person and a player<br /><br /><b>[He says that he did not hesitate when he knew that AS Rome were interested in signing him]</b> When I got the call to say that I had the chance to come here I said yes straightaway because it’s a massive opportunity. I want to give all I have for this club, starting tomorrow<br /><br /><b>[The right-back will link up with the club’s sporting director Gianluca Petrachi, who he previously worked under at Torino and Zappacosta says that this was a key factor in his decision to join]</b> He was definitely important because I know him from our time at Torino. I know what kind of person he is: I know how much he cares and how passionate he is. That was definitely something that influenced my decision but, regardless of that, Roma is a big club with good prospects<br /><br /><b>[AS Roma coach Paulo Fonseca is known for pushing full-backs forward and Davide Zappacosta says that this is something he will enjoy]</b> Yes, I think it will suit me well if we play with high full-backs but defending is still an important part of the role, especially in a back four. It could be good for me, though, because I’m used to getting forward. It’s something that will allow me to show the best of my game<br /><br /><b>[Roma face Genoa at home on Sunday in their opening Serie A fixture and Zappacosta has fond memories of his previous games against the weekend’s opponents]</b> My first goals for both Atalanta and Torino were against Genoa. I hope that’s a good omen for the season opener. It would be a dream come true to kick off with a goal but I think the most important thing is to start well as a team and achieve our objective of getting the three points</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea loanee and Italian defender Davide Zappacosta has suffered a serious knee injury which is likely to keep him out for the rest of the season]</b> During Friday’s training session, defender Davide Zappacosta suffered a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, in a non-contact incident. The club would like to offer its sincerest sympathies to the player, and wishes him a quick and full recovery</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Davide Zappacosta: I would love to stay at Roma]</b> On a personal level, I would love to stay in Rome for several reasons. The main one is that I want to show the fans, my team-mates and the management who I am and what I can do. I have worked a lot in these months, I have trained and I have made sacrifices to be available at the restart of the championship. I am doing some sessions completely dedicated to the knee, because it takes time to recover better from this injury. But now I feel 90 per cent fit<br /><br />England and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have given me a lot. I had the chance to play with great champions and win two trophies. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is a championship where people never give up</p>
