  <p><b>[Dean Austin take aim at Boris Mathis’s commitment]</b> You have to make decisions as a manager that you think are going to help the group. I need people around who want to play for this football club, players that will give their heart and soul and every last drop of sweat and blood for this team and do what they’ve got to do to get the results we strive for</p>

  <p><b>[Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink was sacked as Cobblers boss after a 2-0 defeat at Peterborough on Monday, their ninth match without a win]</b> I understand what the fans want. They pay their money and if they are not happy with what they are seeing they will let you know. I want to pick a team of players who are proud to have the badge on their shirt, players who wear that shirt with pride. That is not just on a matchday, but through the week as well. I have spoken to the players about what I expect, the level of our training, and the intensity of our play. I believe the players here have the ability to be anything they want to be, it comes down to consistent application day in, day out. As a player, I wasn’t great by any means, but I had heart, I had desire and I gave 100% and made the very best of the small amount of ablity I had. My job is now is to get the maximum amount out of these players in these final five games. Whatever else happens will take care of itself.</p>
