  <p><b>[2020-21 season ‘highly likely’ to start behind closed doors due to coronavirus]</b> City For All’ 2020-21 season-ticket sales have today been suspended. The decision has been taken as the club continues to await further information regarding a conclusion to the current campaign, with the start date for next season yet to be confirmed. This comes following a meeting yesterday held between the EFL and the Bantams’ League Two colleagues. City officials have recently been informed of the ever-growing possibility of supporters being unable to attend matches until 2021, and it is now highly likely that next season will commence behind closed doors</p>

  <p><b>[Bradford support Ben Richards-Everton in taking action against police]</b> Bradford City is aware of an incident involving defender Ben Richards-Everton, which recently occurred in the West Midlands. The incident caused our player serious alarm and distress, and, having reviewed all of the evidence made available to us, we have instructed our specialist legal partners to take the matter further - on his behalf. We support our player’s judgement in making the matter public, as he saw fit, and would like to take this opportunity to thank our partners, Opus Law, for handling the matter. As the situation is now being dealt with legally, the club will be making no further comment at this time</p>
