  <p><b>[Marc Bartra says Spain boss Vicente del Bosque remains the right man to lead his nation into Euro 2016]</b> To this day there is no better coach than him who could be here. The confidence of Del Bosque has made me grow more and more. Gerard Pique was again booed by his own supporters on Friday night but Bartra avoided being dragged into the debate regarding his Barcelona team-mate’s relationship with Spain fans. At the end of the day the team won the game. The game went well. Other incidents I think we have to treat separately</p>

  <p><b>[Marc Bartra posts an update on Instagram about the injuries he sustained during the explosions]</b> I think that the shock is decreasing more and more and, at the same time, it adds to the desire to live, to fight, to work, to laugh, to cry, to feel, to love, to believe, to play, to train, to continue to enjoy my people, loved ones, companions, my passion, to defend, to smell the grass as I do before the game starts and motivate me. The only thing I ask is for everyone to live in peace and to leave behind the wars</p>

  <p><b>[Bartra open to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> return and won’t be closing any transfer doors]</b> Right now I am totally focused on <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a>. I am feeling very good here, although I have never closed the doors on a return to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>. I spent 15 years of my life there and they were very beautiful years. I follow <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> very much. I have many friends in the locker room and now there is also the coach who made me come here</p>
