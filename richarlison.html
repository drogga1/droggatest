I told him the doors are open for him there, and that he could help us a lot. I hope he comes. He’d be very welcome there. I’ve known him since we played together for Brazil Under-20 side, and he’s a guy I get along with really well. Hopefully I’ll see him there.</p>

  <p><b>[Richarlison has revealed Brazil legend <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> to be his inspiration as he prepares to chase down Copa America glory at the Maracana]</b> I’m trying very hard to improve my English. It’s interesting to learn the history of this famous ground and to know that the great names of <a href="pele.html">Pele</a> and <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> have also played before me here. It makes me want to continue to represent Brazil here.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed further on who his idols are]</b> <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, especially. I grew up watching his goals on YouTube. The two goals against Germany in the 2002 World Cup final bring back a lot of joy for me. It was a big moment of inspiration to go outside and emulate him<br /><br /><b>[Every time he finds the target, the opportunity presents itself to bring out his famous pigeon dance celebration]</b> The celebration is from a holiday with my friends in Rio. We were playing football on the beach and, for some reason, I created this celebration. It brought joy in the moment, and I decided to take it on to the pitch when I scored. It really is a beautiful thought to imagine the joy the celebration brings the fans</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and Brazil hero Richarlison reflects on a year to remember]</b> I’ve been watching the video of my penalty goal every night! It took a while for it to really sink in, to realise what we’d really achieved. For me and my family, it was a great achievement - and that was despite the difficulties that I had during the tournament…<br /><br /><b>[He was then diagnosed with mumps ahead of the quarter-final with Paraguay. In isolation in a <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> Alegre hospital room, it looked to all intents and purposes as though his Copa was over]</b> That was difficult. Every day I would wake up and look in the mirror to see if the swelling in my neck had gone down. It was a miracle in some senses, because all the research I did said a minimum of two weeks recovery time. Even the doctor didn’t believe I could be back so quickly, in time for the semi-final and the final, but I managed to recover in four or five days<br /><br /><b>[In doing so, and by scoring in the final and by lifting the trophy, Richarlison followed in the footsteps of his idol, the great <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> Luis Nazario de Lima. The original <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> I love him. He’s one of the greatest players in football history. The reason I wear yellow boots is because of him. My memory of him is scoring lots of goals in yellow boots, so I chose mine in homage to him! I think about him a lot, and watch videos of him on the way to games. I model myself on him as a player and will continue to do so, given what a great example he is<br /><br /><b>[He tells a story of meeting <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> at a Nike event in London last year]</b> It was only for a few seconds, but I spoke to him. He told me to keep going as I am, and that I could make it in the Brazilian national team. It was only 20 seconds but it was enough to make me really happy. Before the event, I was shaking at the prospect of meeting him! I was so excited, because I’d only ever seen him before on TV. It was a really special moment for me<br /><br /><b>[Richarlison has not forgotten the criticism which came his way following his transfer]</b> There was a lot of criticism and negativity about the value of my transfer fee. And like it or not, it was a gamble from the club. The press were on top of me a little bit. I remember one guy <b>[the former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and England star <a href="paul-merson.html">Paul Merson</a>]</b> said that I had ruined the transfer window, but he doesn’t know me as a player or a person, and even though we try to focus on training and playing, these things do get to us. Thankfully, it didn’t hold me back and I had a good season. I kept my fitness good, my mind was good and I had a good finish to the season. It was here at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> that I broke into the Brazilian national squad<br /><br /><b>[Richarlison credits <a href="marco-silva.html">Marco Silva</a> as having played a huge role in his development]</b> Marco is the coach I have worked with most in my career, and we get on really well. He’s there for me, we trust each other. We did that at <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> and now at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. He relates really well to the group, to all of the players. I’m really happy here, not just with him but with the whole of the coaching staff. The whole team is happy, and that makes us a strong collective unit<br /><br /><b>[The arrivals of Fabian Delph, <a href="jean-philippe-gbamin.html">Jean-Philippe Gbamin</a>, Djibril Sidibe and <a href="alex-iwobi.html">Alex Iwobi</a>, plus the permanent capture of <a href="andre-gomes.html">Andre Gomes</a>, mean there is optimism at Goodison]</b> We dream of a place in the Europa League or the Champions League. So bringing in these quality players increases our chances. They will make us stronger, and we will fight to meet these objectives<br /><br />For us playing at home is an extra joy. That’s what it was like last season, we beat some big clubs and I think it will be the same this season. When you are waiting in the tunnel and you hear that siren, that alarm, your hairs stand on end. You can smell blood and you go onto the pitch really excited and driven to perform for those supporters</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> forward Richarlison tells about how he spends his money]</b> I had practically nothing in my childhood and, suddenly, I can have almost everything. So I value it, I think about the future. I’m not going to buy a big car. I invest in real estate, in other things for the future. Like this apartment here. Mother, father, uncle, grandmother, I already gave everyone their own home. My uncles have a car, my mum likes motorcycles and I bought her one. My sister has three children and I help with their education and health</p>

  <p><b>[Richarlison outlines ambition to become <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> legend and Brazil regular]</b> My goals are very clear in my head and they are interconnected. Since I arrived, I have always stated that I want to be victorious playing for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. I want to help take the club back to a prominent position and win trophies with <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. I would love to achieve this goal and be remembered as a great player in the history of the club. Regarding individual and long-term goals, my great purpose is to continue to be called up by Brazil and gain more importance in the squad, then have the opportunity to play in a World Cup. For that to happen, I need to continue performing well and scoring goals for Everton<br /><br />I believe that we always have room to improve, regardless of the level we reach in the game. I am only 23 and just starting my career. I have a lot to learn, especially in a team with so many good players and a tremendous coach. I want to take this opportunity to be the best player possible in every aspect. I believe I am coming into the peak years of my career. Although I am still young, I think at this age we are at the peak of our physical shape and that is when the great players really start to burn bright. I hope that my birthday and this new cycle of my life bring me many good things and that I can always grow and stand out with my club.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> striker Richarlison says it is an honour to be coached by <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a>]</b> I have the honour to say that I am trained by one of the best coaches ever. Carlo is a coach who sees the game like few others and has a mentality that favours attacking and searching for victories. He is competitive and very smart and likes to have a team that is also that way. He demands the best from each player and knows how to chart the path for us to play our best. It is an honour to be trained by him and I have been trying to learn as much as possible every day we have been together for training or matches.<br /><br />I believe the team adapted very quickly to the manager’s style and is responding very well to his ideas and methods. We had some unfavourable results before the shutdown and did not play well in the match at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. But we are feeling better and better. Our performances are becoming more consistent with our way of playing. Whoever plays against our team knows they will face a very tough opponent. I think exchanging ideas is a very important thing in a team that wants to become stronger and more competitive. It’s really a great thing to be able to have this open dialogue with our staff and to contribute in some way. I think the conversations help all of us on the pitch and also assist our coach’s decision-making.</p>

We want to have as many good results as possible to, who knows, enter the fight for a place in a continental tournament. We have to keep that flame burning</p>
