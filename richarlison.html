Everton have put their faith in me and I intend to honour this shirt and demonstrate on the pitch why I came here. I’ve known the manager for a while obviously, so I know how he works. I developed really well with him while he was with me at Watford. It was really good working with him and one day I believe he can help me to be selected for Brazil in the full national team. But that is for the future and my present is here with Everton. I want my dreams to become a reality here at one of the biggest clubs in England. I want to score more goals, provide more assists for my teammates and help in whichever way is possible. Everyone in the world knows Everton. It is a very big club, one of the biggest in England as I said. I am really happy and honoured to be here.</p>

  <p><b>[Everton star Richarlison reveals incredible journey to Brazil first team]</b> I haven’t got enough fingers to count the number of clubs who rejected me. I was ready to give up football, but I lifted my head and I went to Belo Horizonte with just the money for an outward ticket for the last trial I had, with America MG. If I didn’t make it, I had no money to get home to Espiritu Santo, 600 kilometres away. I gave my all that morning and I passed. If I had given up after the first no I would never have made it where I am today.<br /><br />I had to live in my uncle’s house because it was closer to where I used to train and I had no money for the bus. I used to sell candy and ice creams in the street and I worked in the fields to help my parents. I couldn’t have done it otherwise, because everyone did what they could so I could fulfil my dream of being a footballer. I have learned that you need to have patience, perseverance and faith in people to reach your goals<br /><br />Ronaldo, O Fenomeno. He is a special player and deserves the nickname he has.

  <p><b>[Everton ace Richarlison has the ability to go on and play for the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester City]</b> I see Everton as the first club that comes after the top six. We have to be in Europe every season. Last year we couldn’t manage that and finished eighth. We didn’t have the best season, especially at the start. During my time here last season, we performed better and this season we have a really good team, a lot of good players have been brought in. I believe what our fans and chairman deserve is Everton to be competing in Europe. To finish in the first six or seven in the table would be a realistic goal.<br /><br />We’d like to enter the international break in a good spirit. We’ve got three wins over a four-game period with the other one being the Manchester United game. Chelsea are a very strong team and it will be a difficult game, we know that, but I trust our team to get a point or a win from there. If we can manage that, it’d be a wonderful period between the two international breaks. I had the derby experience last year and it was very special. Everybody will get into the derby mood. I’m looking forward to the game and hope to score a goal so that I’ll have a special place in the hearts of our fans because it’s a massively important game for them</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and Brazil hero Richarlison reflects on a year to remember]</b> I’ve been watching the video of my penalty goal every night! It took a while for it to really sink in, to realise what we’d really achieved. For me and my family, it was a great achievement - and that was despite the difficulties that I had during the tournament…<br /><br /><b>[He was then diagnosed with mumps ahead of the quarter-final with Paraguay. In isolation in a <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> Alegre hospital room, it looked to all intents and purposes as though his Copa was over]</b> That was difficult. Every day I would wake up and look in the mirror to see if the swelling in my neck had gone down. It was a miracle in some senses, because all the research I did said a minimum of two weeks recovery time. Even the doctor didn’t believe I could be back so quickly, in time for the semi-final and the final, but I managed to recover in four or five days<br /><br /><b>[In doing so, and by scoring in the final and by lifting the trophy, Richarlison followed in the footsteps of his idol, the great <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> Luis Nazario de Lima. The original <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> I love him. He’s one of the greatest players in football history. The reason I wear yellow boots is because of him. My memory of him is scoring lots of goals in yellow boots, so I chose mine in homage to him! I think about him a lot, and watch videos of him on the way to games. I model myself on him as a player and will continue to do so, given what a great example he is<br /><br /><b>[He tells a story of meeting <a href="ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> at a Nike event in London last year]</b> It was only for a few seconds, but I spoke to him. He told me to keep going as I am, and that I could make it in the Brazilian national team. It was only 20 seconds but it was enough to make me really happy. Before the event, I was shaking at the prospect of meeting him! I was so excited, because I’d only ever seen him before on TV. It was a really special moment for me<br /><br /><b>[Richarlison has not forgotten the criticism which came his way following his transfer]</b> There was a lot of criticism and negativity about the value of my transfer fee. And like it or not, it was a gamble from the club. The press were on top of me a little bit. I remember one guy <b>[the former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and England star <a href="paul-merson.html">Paul Merson</a>]</b> said that I had ruined the transfer window, but he doesn’t know me as a player or a person, and even though we try to focus on training and playing, these things do get to us. Thankfully, it didn’t hold me back and I had a good season. I kept my fitness good, my mind was good and I had a good finish to the season. It was here at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> that I broke into the Brazilian national squad<br /><br /><b>[Richarlison credits <a href="marco-silva.html">Marco Silva</a> as having played a huge role in his development]</b> Marco is the coach I have worked with most in my career, and we get on really well. He’s there for me, we trust each other. We did that at <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> and now at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. He relates really well to the group, to all of the players. I’m really happy here, not just with him but with the whole of the coaching staff. The whole team is happy, and that makes us a strong collective unit<br /><br /><b>[The arrivals of <a href="fabian-delph.html">Fabian Delph</a>, <a href="jean-philippe-gbamin.html">Jean-Philippe Gbamin</a>, Djibril Sidibe and <a href="alex-iwobi.html">Alex Iwobi</a>, plus the permanent capture of <a href="andre-gomes.html">Andre Gomes</a>, mean there is optimism at Goodison]</b> We dream of a place in the Europa League or the Champions League. So bringing in these quality players increases our chances. They will make us stronger, and we will fight to meet these objectives<br /><br />For us playing at home is an extra joy. That’s what it was like last season, we beat some big clubs and I think it will be the same this season. When you are waiting in the tunnel and you hear that siren, that alarm, your hairs stand on end. You can smell blood and you go onto the pitch really excited and driven to perform for those supporters</p>
