  <p><b>[Everton officials in Turkey to wrap up <a href="cenk-tosun.html">Cenk Tosun</a> deal before rivals act]</b> It’s in the wind. There’s obviously an interest because we’re actively looking for a front man but whether we are the ones to complete that deal or not I don’t know. The interest from other clubs around Europe is our biggest worry if we are to secure that transfer<br /><br /><b>[Although he would also be keen on a reunion with <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>’s Steven N’Zonzi providing he can sell a midfielder]</b> I would take Steven N’Zonzi tomorrow. He is one of my better buys in my lifetime, only €650,000 from France to <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn Rovers</a>. Knowing him from that age and knowing him now, yes I would like him but with the amount of midfield players I have at the moment I’d have to move some player out to bring a player like Steven in.<br /><br />I would consider every offer and, if it is the right offer, I would recommend to the board that we take it and utilise that money on what we might bring in. I’d have to say that caution is my first priority in this window. For me it would be much wiser that the club tries to get through until the end of the season and readdress what we are about to do during the summer. It is much better operating then than it is in this very difficult window<br /><br />We’re consistently defending well but we’re not attacking very well in possession. I feel the problem is the players’ ability to do the transition correctly<br /><br />When I came in, they played out from the back, played through midfield and when they lost it they lost a goal. When they went into transition they couldn’t defend properly and hence conceded 25 goals in the last eight games before I got here. I think it’s the reverse now. They are defending superbly well but in transition they can’t turn the ball into good passing opportunities and get at the opposition and create more chances<br /><br />I wouldn’t expect that so much against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and certainly not against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> but I would still say we should have done better with the possession we had. But West Brom was a big concern for me</p>

He is two-footed, perhaps not the biggest but he’s very efficient in the air and in the box he gets good space to get his head on the ball. We looked at the qualities of the player, his talent and goalscoring, and his resilience, too. I do not think you can look any more than we have done</p>

  <p><b>[Allardyce offered a bleak reason for limiting the pair’s opportunities in the second half of the season, although bleak is in keeping with <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s entire campaign]</b> We have some young players who are very attractive in terms of their abilities like Vlasic and <a href="ademola-lookman.html">Lookman</a>. But they are so young and having to play them in the first team every single week - we have already been running with four players 23 and under - is for me a risky game in terms of results. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> needs results until such time as it is certainly safe in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. If I try to then groom those players further there is over £2m a place. You need to still try and win. Grooming a youngster then becomes even more difficult because of the money</p>

To experience so many different clubs with so many different cultures has been a great journey for me.

We haven’t accepted any deal yet and we won’t until the board tell me financially it’s acceptable and I say to them it’s in the best interests of the club or the player to go out on loan. We have got a lot of players so moving some out on loan would be a possibility but only if it’s right for the club<br /><br /><b>[Everton have been linked with <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> midfielder Steven N’Zonzi and <a href="marcelo-brozovic.html">Marcelo Brozovic</a> of Inter, but when asked if there was any movement towards a deal for either player, Allardyce said]</b> Not yet. I would expect that my focus is not on the transfer window because unfortunately yet again <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> have decided to play a game right on the transfer window deadline. Clearly at the AGM they didn’t think it was worth not doing it this time round, on the back of playing the whole of the Christmas period and playing five games in 15 or 16 days. I can pick a team today <b>[Monday]</b>, and tomorrow I could pick up the paper and see a player is going to be sold before the window shuts.

  <p><b>[Reason behind <a href="davy-klaassen.html">Klaassen</a>’s failed <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> move revealed]</b> Apparently something like that, apparently that’s the norm at that club (Napoli). Whatever they do as a football club that their image rights are, I don’t know the technical details, but whether their image rights are not validated or taken are over by club, I don’t know<br /><br />Thats the power of the player with the agent, really, there’s nothing else we can do about that. If I’m sat in that position and have an agent, the agent works for me, not the other way round. So for me it would never have been a financial decision. Even if I was losing money I’d be going, but that’s me - because I’d want to play football. Davy wants to play football, but whether he got the full story I don’t know, because I wasn’t involved with it<br /><br /><b>[Asked if <a href="davy-klaassen.html">Klaassen</a> would now be forced to train away from the first team]</b> No, I don’t think so. (He’ll be with first team squad) because <a href="davy-klaassen.html">Davy Klaassen</a> doesn’t give you the sort of problems some players do when they’re not involved.

We’ve seen what he can do. It’s about our lads getting more quality into the box for him. We had an awful lot today, time and time again we were in the final third.<br /><br />As soon as we deliver a bit of real quality, the two goals came about. He found himself a bit of space and finifd it brilliantly.<br /><br />He’s settled down. It was: ‘Why did you buy him? Why are you not playing him?’ The usual when you pay money for somebody. For me my job is not what about everybody else says, it’s about what I think internally, when he’s ready.<br /><br />He could have got a lot of criticism if I’d played him too soon, and they’d all have started saying: ‘What a waste of money,’ as happens across the football world, but we were patient with him and he worked really hard. Long may it continue<br /><br />Our big problem has been away from home. If you reverse it (home and away form) and look with the home points we’ve gained we’re riding high in the top six</p>

  <p><b>[Sam Allardyce claims he rejected the chance to speak to Newcastle United about returning to the club as Rafael Benitez’s replacement]</b> I was certainly extremely surprised. It never really got to the sort of talks people are suggesting. I had to chat to my agent and, as much as I respect Newcastle, Newcastle fans and Mike <b>[Ashley, Newcastle owner]</b>, it wasn’t for me. I politely said no and moved on. It’s that thing <b>[in your mind]</b>… don’t go back. Maybe if it was the first time around I’d have jumped at it, but not now. I appreciate the offer. I was very flattered that I was being considered. I had a think about it, but it wasn’t something I thought about too long. It was better that I made a quick decision for everybody because they’re in pre-season now. I never got to talk to Mike, it was just my agent contacted me and I had a quick think about it and a look at the situation. <b>[It was]</b> not for me.<br /><br /><b>[Allardyce, 64, has not held a full-time coaching role since leaving Everton in May 2018. And the former defender was unhappy with the amount of time he was given at Goodison Park]</b> Everybody walks around talking about, ‘Sam Allardyce’s style is not good enough, he doesn’t play the right way’ and so on and so forth and it is a massive problem for me. People believe it. You believe the false lies, the false implications. Football does that - it believes that lie sometimes. It is built up by fellow managers, journos who follow on with it and you are never going to get rid of it. The type of football I played at Everton, the fans said it wasn’t good enough and I would say the same - I knew it wasn’t good enough for Everton - but I knew I had to get them in the position where they were safe. Then let me build the team, let me spend the next 80million, 100million on the players that will make Everton much, much more fluid, much more creative and go forward and score more goals and hopefully finish better than eighth</p>

You cannot work at a smaller club and expect to get a bigger job by winning trophies … it’s an absolute nonsense<br /><br /><b>[While that may well be true, Allardyce’s advice to British managers seeking the most coveted jobs in the country was more questionable]</b> The best way to get a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> job if you are British is to change your name to a foreign name. I have always said if I was ‘Allardicio’ I could have managed Manchester United<br /><br /><b>[Asked about the upturn in <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> boss Brendan Rodgers’ fortunes after his trophy-laden spell at Celtic]</b> We can all go to Celtic and win trophies.

  <p><b>[Sam Allardyce says <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> ready for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> challenge]</b> I think so. If you look at Pep, we were all surprised he left <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. He’s a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> man, he’s born and bred and he has been through the playing days and coaching behind the scenes with the youngsters, and then the top job, and then he wins the Champions League, <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> on a regular basis and then goes: ‘Boosh! I’m having a year off.’<br /><br />He decided Germany was the next adventure and what was impressive about Pep was that he could speak German. That year he took off he taught himself how to speak German, so when he first went he knew how to communicate, which is very important if you go abroad. Then he has three seasons there and comes to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. He’s had some great years at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> now and Italy is another challenge.<br /><br />So he looks like it’s a bit of, ‘I need to go to Italy and challenge myself there and show them what I can do in that country’. Which is massive in football terms, like it is in Germany and England and Spain, so that challenge for him runs along a line a bit like what <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> has done. Portugal, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, Milan, Madrid and now Jose is back where most like to be, in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. It’ll be sad to lose <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> because he has brought so much to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> in his time and we’re all better off for him<br /><br />The Italian style of football is very negative, very defensive in terms of its outlook and always has been. To win 1-0 has always been enough for them. He <b>[Guardiola]</b> will go and change that completely. He imposes his style of football wherever he lands. He will transform <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in terms of the way they play to his normal passing game</p>

  <p><b>[Former England manager Sam Allardyce says Lives matter]</b> I’ve got a big fear that we should stop the season and look to start again next season. I don’t know how you can finish a season with everything that’s going on in terms of the NHS, how strained it is, and everybody needing to stay safe in their own homes. I think it’s the way it has escalated into such a difficult period for the whole world and, particularly, for our country, how rapidly this virus is spreading and how many lives it looks like it is going to take, and because the only way we can stop it is by isolating. It’ll be very sad for a lot of teams. In <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, there’s <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, who have had such a fantastic season but lives matter and nothing takes precedence over that<br /><br /><b>[Their vice-chairman <a href="karren-brady.html">Karren Brady</a> attracted criticism by calling for the season to be declared null and void. Allardyce was asked why he thought Brady had made the comments]</b> Protecting <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> football club as best she can I would suggest, with my tongue in cheek. It would get rid of all the problems they’ve had this season if it was finished now and restarted next season in terms of fighting against relegation - that’s why she may have suggested it!</p>

  <p><b>[Sam Allardyce urges Magpies to stick with Bruce]</b> It’s going to be very difficult for Steve, I think he’d be worried if the takeover happens. I’ve experienced new takeovers twice - once at <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a> <b>[with Venkys]</b> and once at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> with <a href="mike-ashley.html">Mike Ashley</a>. I wasn’t Mike’s man and I can understand that, and Steve must be very worried from that point of view. There was a lot of hoo-ha about whether Steve was good enough or not, but I think he has done a very good job in his first season, considering he came in just two weeks before the season started, and at the moment they are going to be a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> side next season. I still don’t understand why <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafa Benitez</a> was deemed to be so good. I just don’t understand it because <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> played such negative football then, it was unbelievable. But there you go; Rafa did a great PR job in himself and how he managed that club at that time<br /><br />Steve is a very, very good <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> manager of a great high quality, irrespective of what the media might say, and he knows how to put a club in a position to move forward. If you change everything around, sack everybody and bring new people in, then it’s going to take years and years and they may well waste their money spending it quickly on the wrong players</p>
