  <p><b>[Sam Allardyce feels Stewart Downing has the quality to regain a place in the England squad after impressing in his new role for West Ham]</b> Stewart’s playing in a slightly different role here, I don’t think Roy <b>[Hodgson]</b> plays with a man in the hole, or the diamond. Stewart certainly has the experience, he’s handled the switch of position very well. He gets more possession in the position he’s in, so that allows him to become more effective. Given his qualities, that’s a good thing for us. He’s certainly not past his best by any stretch of the imagination. You only get past your best when your legs can’t take you where you want to go. But Stewart is one of our fittest players. He probably should score more goals than he does, but hopefully he’ll do that in the new position he’s in.</p>

  <p><b>[West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has refuted suggestions Stewart Downing blew his chance in the England team]</b> He had an injury in the first half which restricted his movement. I watched the game and I didn’t see him do anything wrong. I know people have criticised his performance but I thought he did OK. He certainly hasn’t blown his chances of further international call-ups.<br /><br /><b>[Sakho]</b> only got back <b>[from international duty with Senegal]</b> last night so we haven’t had time to assess him yet. We’ll be looking at him today <b>[Thursday]</b> and make a decision soon. Obviously we don’t have too much time before the Everton game on Saturday so it’ll be touch and go. It’s a problem every manager faces after international duty. Stewart Downing came off at half-time with a knee problem as well so we have to monitor that one too. They’re both two players that have been in top form for us. Sakho’s goals and Downing’s performances are two of the reasons why we’re fourth at the moment. We need to be very careful with both players because we don’t want to take any risks with their long-term fitness. If they play on Saturday and aggravate the injury they could be out for two or three weeks which would mean missing five or six games and we can’t afford that. We have a tough run of games coming</p>

He was actually quite cheap compared to the prices we’ve been quoted for other players. He was desperate to come, desperate to leave Leicester even though they were champions.

  <p><b>[Sam Allardyce watched the Eagles execute his plan to perfection as he recorded a maiden top-flight win at Anfield]</b> Liverpool, at home, play a superbly attacking style in terms of football, which means both full-backs will go right up the pitch - it’s very similar to Arsenal. It means that <b>[Joel]</b> Matip and <b>[Dejan]</b> Lovren are very exposed. Because they’re very exposed in that position, if you get the right runners in behind then the two big men don’t like turning and running back towards their own goal, which is exactly where Yohan Cabaye came in today. The ball over Lovren’s head to Cabaye completely left those two centre-halves for dead.<br /><br />Then you ask your players to deliver the quality that you need in the Premier League, and Yohan’s ball to Christian Benteke was absolutely outstanding. It happened against just two minutes after that, but this time we didn’t score. On the corner, everybody knows Liverpool are pretty weak. They’ve conceded six off corners, which we told the lads about. It’s now seven off that corner that’s got us the winner</p>

At this stage I’m enjoying not being involved at the front end of football at the moment. David Moyes would probably be my choice for the Scotland job.<br /><br />I don’t know. You’ve always got to have someone else to want you to get a job. At this moment in time I would be very picky and choosy about any potential managerial jobs if I was to go back in, so that makes it very difficult.

David Unsworth is in the chair, Joe <b>[Royle]</b> sat upstairs will have an opinion today <b>[after the Leicester defeat]</b> and from the Chelsea game. It’s really going to be tough for Everton to get out of that position. Not because the lads are not trying, but as a team collectively they can’t keep a clean sheet and can’t score a goal. Those are the two problems, if you resolve one, you’ll end up resolving the other and that will start with the clean sheet.<br /><br /><b>[The Americans are in the market for a new boss after parting with Bruce Arena on the back of their failed 2018 World Cup qualification campaign]</b> At an international level, I think I would be interested in talking to them if I had the opportunity. It’s a fantastic country and it’s been trying to make football more and more successful every year and obviously the big teams have been going there for a long time now on pre-season friendlies and big tournaments so the fan base is getting bigger and the interest is getting greater. So it would interest me, yes<br /><br />Not an awful lot, but it wouldn’t take me long to find out and see if I can make them better than what they are at the moment, because they obviously haven’t qualified for next year’s World Cup</p>

It’s not the first one. It’s the second in a row at home. It’s a very difficult situation. That’s for me. That’s all I can say now. I always believe in myself. I wouldn’t be here otherwise.

It is the hardest thing to recruit today, a centre-forward who scores goals and is the right type of centre-forward who scores goals for you. That’s the most expensive area on the pitch today. We’ve a number of players here who have reasonably good goalscoring records who haven’t settled in - <b>[Oumar]</b> Niasse when he came from Russia, but has scored a few this year. And Sandro <b>[Ramirez]</b> who hasn’t quite settled yet but scored lots of goals at Malaga last year.<br /><br />There are people who have scored goals here but if there’s one out there that’s ready and ready-made it would be 1]&lt;/b&gt; expensive and 2]&lt;/b&gt; you have to ask is it the right one? It’s my opinion that my first signing has to be correct, has to be the right signing for Everton and for my future. Because if you make bad signings you get the sack. If you make good signings you become a better manager.</p>

I’m not in control of that in too many ways. If someone comes in during January and says ‘Here you go’ and the club say, ‘Look, if he’s not going to sign for us, this has to be the case’ then I accept that.<br /><br />If Ross stays until the end of the season and I feel he is giving 100 per cent to the team, like he has done since he was a kid, then he is an available asset for us until he leaves on a free transfer.

There’s obviously an interest because we’re actively looking for a front man but whether we are the ones to complete that deal or not I don’t know. The interest from other clubs around Europe is our biggest worry if we are to secure that transfer<br /><br /><b>[Although he would also be keen on a reunion with <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a>’s Steven N’Zonzi providing he can sell a midfielder]</b> I would take Steven N’Zonzi tomorrow. He is one of my better buys in my lifetime, only €650,000 from France to <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn Rovers</a>. Knowing him from that age and knowing him now, yes I would like him but with the amount of midfield players I have at the moment I’d have to move some player out to bring a player like Steven in.<br /><br />I would consider every offer and, if it is the right offer, I would recommend to the board that we take it and utilise that money on what we might bring in. I’d have to say that caution is my first priority in this window. For me it would be much wiser that the club tries to get through until the end of the season and readdress what we are about to do during the summer. It is much better operating then than it is in this very difficult window<br /><br />We’re consistently defending well but we’re not attacking very well in possession. I feel the problem is the players’ ability to do the transition correctly<br /><br />When I came in, they played out from the back, played through midfield and when they lost it they lost a goal. When they went into transition they couldn’t defend properly and hence conceded 25 goals in the last eight games before I got here. I think it’s the reverse now. They are defending superbly well but in transition they can’t turn the ball into good passing opportunities and get at the opposition and create more chances<br /><br />I wouldn’t expect that so much against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and certainly not against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> but I would still say we should have done better with the possession we had.

It’s only Tottenham’s finishing that got them the victory. Normally that result would never, never happen. So is it a freak result or not? I mean when you’ve had 23 shots at your own place and you’ve not scored that’s not the manager’s fault. The manager always gets blamed at the end of the day, but he’s set his team out to go and attack - that’s what he said at his press conference - they’ve gone and attacked and created enough chances and enough opportunities to win the game comfortably. They’ve failed to take those chances and they ended up getting sucker-punched by what, in the end, was pretty poor defending.<br /><br />It’s alright saying it’s a disaster, it is, because it’s three-nil, but if you’re a manager you’d say to your players at the end of the day ‘look, we cut the silly mistakes out, keep getting this possession rate and this shot rate and we will win far more games than we’ll lose’. They <b>[the media]</b> are steering all the way around it because it was three-nil, but no one’s looking at the real facts.
