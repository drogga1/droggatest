I think it’s really good for England and I think it’s nice for Arsenal as a club and the fans and we’ve still got Theo Walcott to come back.

  <p><b>[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain says the insatiable appetite of Arsenal team-mate Alexis Sanchez]</b> He’s definitely one of those players who will tend to bring out the best in you because he’s very demanding of himself and everyone else. The number of times we’ve come off the pitch and we’ve won, but he’s still not happy with something. The Crystal Palace game for example, we won 2-0 and right at the end of the game he’s cut in and he passed it to me. I shot and Wayne Hennessey saved it in the last minute of the game. The boys were all happy in the dressing room but Alexis came to me in the shower and said: ‘My friend are you going to score? Oh no my friend…I passed you the ball, you have a cup of tea, you wait…and then you shoot’. I was laughing like, ‘Yeah, sorry my friend’. He always wants assists, he wants goals and that’s what makes him the player he is. He’s always hungry for that and he passes that onto us all. We’ve got a lot of those characters in the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has called on Arsenal’s players to fight until the end]</b> It’s slipped further out of our hands and there’s no hiding from that now. The gap is much bigger now and it’s going to be hard. But we play for Arsenal Football Club - if we don’t go until the end, we don’t deserve to be here. We’ve got to keep doing that.<br /><br />We didn’t take our chances and made some crucial mistakes at crucial times. They took their chances - I think the first goal was a little bit unlucky on our part. They hit the crossbar and the bounce went for them. <b>[Marcos]</b> Alonso got the jump on Hector <b>[Bellerin]</b> and that was 1-0. But we knew we were still in the game, and at half-time we said we had to keep going. We came out in the second half and controlled spells of the game. They controlled spells but it was a great goal from Eden Hazard, which we should have stopped earlier at source. That was disappointing. Then a mistake at the end killed the game for us. Olivier <b>[Giroud]</b> got one back but at the end it was too late. At the top level, against a team like Chelsea, there’s a good chance they’ll punish you if you make mistakes and they did that</p>

If you want to engage in a bit of banter with Mesut, he is up for it, but if you don’t he’s not bothered. He will just go through his game, leave training, live the life at home and then come back to training <b>[the next day]</b>. He’s the coolest guy ever, he’s one of those guys who will have a spare flight somewhere and will say: ‘Do you want to come on holiday with me? I’ve got you’.

  <p><b>[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain says he had no fear that he had given away a penalty when Victor Moses went down in the box in Arsenal’s FA Cup win over Chelsea]</b> I didn’t fear the worst, not at all. I think obviously when he went inside there was a moment when I sort of went to go for the ball, and then I thought he might just be a little bit ahead of me so I decided to pull out and not go for it. So as soon as Moses went down I was fully confident that I was nowhere near him and that the referee should have seen that so my heart didn’t really go in my mouth. I didn’t realise he was on a yellow so when <b>[the sending off]</b> happened that was more of a surprise for me. But I knew I didn’t go anywhere near him and obviously it helped us to victory in the end.<br /><br />It was a little bit of a shock. Obviously it’s not somewhere I’ve played before. I think I said a few weeks ago that I might play left back soon. I was only joking so for it to happen in the final was a bit of surprise. I’ve played left wing before and it’s something that I thought I could cope with and I could do, and obviously it was different and was a different task being on that side of the pitch but ultimately I was happy to do the job for the team. Maybe I felt a little bit off the pace after having a few weeks out but I gave everything I had. I think everyone put in a real good shift and the boys did what we needed to do</p>

I have been monitoring him and he really is a quality player. I feel the same about Lacazette. I have seen him for a good few years now and he is always scoring goals.</p>

As a footballer, you want to play every game. Me being myself, I’m not happy when I’m not playing. There is going to come a time in my career, and I think I’m approaching that, when I do need to be getting more regular football. There comes a time in your career where you have to re-evaluate things and think, ‘Is that going to be here or elsewhere?’.</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain says Liverpool were the only option for him as he prepared to leave Arsenal on transfer deadline day]</b> The first thing was the tough decision to leave Arsenal. That was the only thing that was really tough for me and the deliberation but Liverpool was the only option for me in terms of where I thought I would be playing. The team and the feel of the whole football club in general just sat right with me. I think there are really exciting things to come here and especially with this manager so I felt it was right for me to push to be a part of that. I’m delighted that I finally got the opportunity to.<br /><br />It’s very exciting but obviously a bit surreal at the same time.

It was hard for me to see because I was the one who was getting pushed off the ball, and being put down an age group to play. That was difficult, and I even doubted him.

I need to keep developing and learning a new style of play here and get used to that and then whenever I get my opportunities try to do as well as I can.<br /><br />We’re in an important part of the season where we want to get off to a good start and we’ve got a few results that haven’t gone our way. Every week it feels like we’ve got a lot of goals in us and it’s just not clicking at the right moment. I think we create a lot of opportunities and I hear people saying the stats are always Liverpool have 20 shots a game. So if we keep doing those things that’s the important thing, that we keep creating chances and keep trying and hopefully it will come off for us</p>

  <p><b>[Roberto Firmino is one of the best]</b> Bobby is such a quality striker, especially in our team - he fits the team so well. We’ve got Danny Ings and Dom Solanke that do it really well as well, defending from the front. They all work hard. Bobby is one of the best I’ve seen at winning the ball back from the front; he presses people from their blind side and they don’t know he’s coming and he wins it back. He’s really good at dropping in as well; he can play as a false 9 where he is not always so high, he drops in, comes short for the ball and that opens up the space for Mo <b>[Salah]</b> and Sadio <b>[Mane]</b> to run in behind. The three of them work really well and when they’re playing the way they can, when Bobby is coming deep and the other two are running in behind, it gives you so many options to play in behind or to feet to link up with them. When they’re on song, there is no three you’d rather have in front of you.<br /><br /><b>[On trio who have found the target 16 times between them in their last six outings]</b> It’s frightening. There won’t be too many trios in Europe that can muster up those sorts of numbers. They’ve been brilliant for us in front of goal, but defensively as well they know their jobs, they work really hard and they’re really good, honest lads and good to be around. They’re the type of lads that you really want to see succeed and do well, and you want to do everything you can to help them to achieve their goals and ultimately to help the team achieve all of our goals</p>

  <p><b>[Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain has hit back at the stupid criticism from Gary Neville and Thierry Henry following his £35 million move to Liverpool]</b> Those comments are probably a bit stupid. When you have watched someone long enough you know what they can do. If it was aimed more at the end product side of things and doing those things that lead to scoring a goal or setting up a goal then fair enough, I will take those comments on the chin. Saying you don’t know what I do, when you have worked with me, I think is a bit stupid. If they are referencing more end product then that is fair enough, I hold my hands up. That is something that I have been working on and still need to work on.<br /><br />It is not nice to hear it from your peers or people you have worked with and I have worked with them both in different capacities. They can have their opinions. It cannot shake me. The important thing is that when I came here I had a manager <b>[Jurgen Klopp]</b> who had faith in me and he felt something different to that, and I had faith in myself. That is why I made the step. Everyone says you have to be your own biggest fan and believe in yourself. I am old enough and wise enough and I have been around long enough to know that things will be said, and not nice things a lot of the time. And when you are doing well, nice things will be said. That is all part and parcel of it. But it is never nice to hear it from people you have worked with<br /><br />There is more in me, I know I have to keep pushing on. I can take so much from someone like Mo Salah. Just look at him this season. It has been relentless and when someone can go from - obviously he is a great player - but to be competing with Harry Kane and Sergio Agüero for top goalscorer is something you have to learn from. People probably wouldn’t have expected that from him at the start of the season. To put himself in that position is down to the mentality he has to work hard and get the best out of himself. Every season there is always an example of people like that. You can take inspiration and I have got to keep pushing myself. I have nine games left in the league and we have the Champions League and I want to give the best of myself in those games and do as much as I can to help this team finish as high as we can</p>

You have to give credit to the fans because it is never nice coming to Anfield and hearing that crowd - I’ve been on the other end of it and it is not easy. The fans play a massive part. I’ve never witnessed anything like that. Coming into the stadium for a game which was not a final it almost set it up to be like a final. It definitely got us going and you could see that. If you are the away team and the crowd gets going like that it is horrible. City are an amazing football team but they are only human and you put anyone in a pressure environment in an atmosphere like that maybe it can disturb them. I wouldn’t say to the extent it did that because they still played some good stuff and dominated the ball but it definitely played a part in the first half. It got us going and it would probably shake anyone up so you have to give fans credit for that.</p>

The next target for me is to build up more in the gym, back towards being able to run outside again. I can’t wait. I’ll probably have to do two months of running which is not really my favourite thing either! And then once the ball comes out it becomes easier. I’ve already started passing the ball and stuff like that inside, which feels really good. I’d love to be able to make an appearance at least before the end of the season, depending on what we’re doing and if I’m really needed. I’m sure I won’t be fully at the races or fully fit and up to scratch.

The whole set-up, the structure, is perfect at the moment.<br /><br />Last year was the first sign of that going in the right direction with the Champions League. Now, in a weird way, it is almost like it didn’t happen, but I think that’s credit to everyone around the building - everyone is hungry for the next thing and what’s next. That’s the right attitude to have to go on and be more successful and go on to win more things. That’s the plan, hopefully we can follow it through and win some more things</p>

And especially the young lads on their first starts and debuts. <b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> had young players out as well but I think all of those young players are pretty involved in the first team and Europa League and stuff, so they had more experience. It goes to show what quality we have here. More than that, it was the character. It wasn’t a plain-sailing game against tough opposition - a big club in <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. A lot of boys could have gone missing or the occasion could have got the better of them but they kept going.<br /><br />I saw Pep <b>[<a href="pep-lijnders.html">Lijnders</a>, the assistant manager]</b> talking in his press conference about the character and what the boys are going to have to do to make that step up, and tonight showed it. It is an education for all of us, even the more senior boys. When you make mistakes in big games like that and big moments at the start of their careers, it is about how you respond to that. They responded really well<br /><br /><a href="ali-curtis.html">Curtis</a> is a really confident lad and he’s been around us long enough to know that we trust his ability and he is comfortable with that. It was nice to see him put his name down to take a penalty and he was always going to do that. The same with Rhian - I know how confident he is! To step up in front of the Kop like that, to convert all the penalties, especially with the young lads, shows a lot about the character. I am really happy with them<br /><br />At the minute they are not tap-ins, let’s put it that way! It was a pretty good goal, so it was really hard to keep the celebrations in but that is always something that I knew I would do against my former club.

  <p><b>[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain believes <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s mindset has been key to their <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> dominance so far this season]</b> The mindset that I’m in when we go into a game is that I’m going into it with the mindset that we’re going to win. I think that’s how we all feel. We’re going into the games expecting ourselves to win and anything else we’re disappointed. There’s times in my career where I definitely haven’t gone into all games 100 per cent confident that the team’s going to come away winning. But with this team, I have that sort of belief in us. If we’re on our A-game that’s how I think we should come out of games. Obviously it might not happen every time but when you’re going into games with that sort of mindset and belief it simplifies everything else. You go in there to win, you know what you need to do to win. There’ll be some things you can’t control, that happen with the opposition or little mistakes here and there but the overall mindset is we’re going to win. Anything else that happens in and around that will happen and it is what it is.<br /><br />Whether you’re out in front or chasing people will always talk, whether it’s positively, whether it’s people trying to turn positive situations into a bit of a negative one. We’ve got to make sure it’s the most important game of our lives every time we play and that’s the message the manager keeps giving us and how he is inclined, we do that and see what happens come the end of the year. That’s the only way I think you can not get caught up in all the talking and people making predictions early on as they do. We’ve had a good run in the league. I think there are areas we can improve on and our performances haven’t always been absolutely stellar and really good but we’re finding ways to win.<br /><br />If we keep working and things carry on going that way and we can click and start putting a bit more clinical performances in, that’s obviously a good thing for us. But for the time being we’re delighted with how we’ve been doing. The boys have been brilliant but it’s a long long way to go in all competitions. I don’t live under a rock so I hear what people say and the predictions that people make. You’ve got to just keep going out and churning out results. There might be a time where results don’t go so well and people maybe close the gap a little bit. We’ve got to be ready for those moments mentally as a team to just keep going and see what happens</p>

When you consistently hit them year after year, or as close to, is when you will be satisfied with yourself and others will be satisfied.<br /><br />That’s why the likes of those two players I just mentioned go down as the greatest - because they have been able to keep that up for year on year on year, for 10 or 15 years. That’s nothing to think lightly of, it’s unbelievably hard.<br /><br />When I look at last season, how it finished and we didn’t win the league with 97 points, you’ve also got to respect what <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> managed to do that year, the year after they won it with 100 points.<br /><br />To then go and get 98 points the next season takes a lot of mental strength and it takes that sort of desire to go again the next year and not be satisfied with what you’ve done. To keep churning out game after game the next year takes a lot of doing and you’ve got to respect that.<br /><br />We’re on a good track at the minute. Ninety-seven points and you’ve got that disappointment, that made us hungry for this year again. We’re going well at the minute.

Obviously being out for pretty much the whole of last season, my main aim this year was to make sure I stayed available and when I was called on I put in the work and contributed to this team wherever I could.<br /><br />That’s really all I’m focused on for this year, being a part of this team and helping this team achieve what we want to achieve.<br /><br />Anything along the way - goals or anything like that - is a bonus. For me, just to be fit, have a good season and a consistent one of playing when needed - that was my main target this year.<br /><br />And obviously I want to be able to bring the things I brought to the team before I got injured, so try to be an attacking midfielder that can assist the boys up front when I play.<br /><br />And also make sure I’m at the levels defensively that this team requires and the manager requires of the midfield boys to be able to play and be reliable to play.<br /><br />Other than that, I’m just happy as long as this team keeps pushing forward and I can be a part of that.

That’s the most important thing - finishing as high up as we can - and we are in a good position. We want to keep that going and if records come off the back of that then that’s obviously a little bonus, but you can’t really think about those things, I don’t think<br /><br />At times I think, especially in the first half, maybe things got a little bit static or robotic and we struggled to remember patterns of play and things that have got us success, so we came in at half-time a little bit disappointed with ourselves and disappointed with the fundamentals, the movements and the things that we work on to create space and go in the right direction.<br /><br />In the second half we had more moments where that was working a bit better.

I probably would have come away from here <b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>]</b> with the same feeling but it’s nice to get a goal, it’s something in the attacking side of things that I could have contributed today. But I still need to do more, I think we all do<br /><br />I think today quality-wise I was a bit disappointed with myself. There were times where stuff came off but going into games I know what I want to do, what my strengths are, how I want to get into positions, and when you get into those positions that’s your time to do what you want to do. You don’t get much time and there’s not really much margin for error but that’s what we train for, to get into those areas and then when you get in there be a bit tighter with your passing. There were a few times where my touch wasn’t as good as I’d have liked and when I get into those pockets that’s what I’m in the team to do.<br /><br />I’m in the team to, from midfield, help create, link up with the front boys. I think I did it better with <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Bobby Firmino</a> in the second half and a few times I managed to get a little half-chance through to <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a>. Getting in between the lines and turning, that’s what I’m there to do, and there were times in the first half that I didn’t do it enough</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain says <a href="naby-keita.html">Naby Keita</a> offers a lot to the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> cause]</b> Not really. You have to always be sharp and focused. Obviously, when everybody’s fit, there’s more competition for places and that’s what it’s like being part of a team like this, a successful team and a big football club. There are going to be top players in the team and we’ve all got to push each other and, when we get our opportunities, take them and help each other. That’s just the way it works<br /><br />It’s great to see Naby come back, he’s a great asset for us when he’s playing and firing, the same as Fab - they’re big parts of our team. The boys in midfield, especially <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Hendo</a> (Jordan Henderson) and Gini (Wijnaldum) who have sort of been ever-present throughout the season, and Milly (James Milner) as well before he picked up his injury, they’ve been brilliant. But it’s a massive help to those boys and us all when there are more options and we can rotate and everyone can take the weight. At the same time, everybody obviously always wants to play but that’s part and parcel of playing for a team like this. It’s great to see them back because Naby can add a lot to the midfield, especially going forward, he’s got that creativity. And Fab as well, defensively we know how solid he has been for us for the first half of the season. So it’s good to see them back, we want everybody fit and available, the Champions League will be coming back soon so we need everyone</p>

I think I’ve played the last five now, which is really nice. That obviously helps you get a feeling with the way that the team’s playing and with the boys around you. I think a lot of it’s just down to maybe being a bit more clinical, getting myself in more areas where I can shoot and affect the game. Luckily, the last few have gone in. But that’s what the top goalscorers do. We’ve got Mo, Sadio, Bobby and they set the example for anyone that wants to learn how to score goals. I get to watch them a lot and try to follow situations and put yourself in the position to score. We’ve got players that can find you, so there’s always opportunities that this team creates. I’m delighted to have scored a couple of goals in the last two games, but it’s about us all and making sure that we chip in where we can and finish the season strong now<br /><br /><b>[Oxlade-Chamberlain said of <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Firmino</a> and his value to the collective cause]</b> It becomes a little bit normal when you play with that guy. That’s the way he plays and he does those magnificent things all the time. I love him, I absolutely love him. He’s such a joy to play with and to feed off. He’s always looking for others, he works for the team and his skills speak for themselves. He’s a top man and we all love him</p>

  <p><b>[Oxlade-Chamberlain: If anyone mentions <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> winning the league, <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> shuts them straight down]</b> I look at <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> because he’s lifted the European Cup, how much that meant to him, but you wouldn’t have thought he’d lifted anything from the way he is. If anyone even utters the words ‘winning the league’ then he shuts them straight down. He’s done it externally as well, he won’t ever let himself get carried away. He’s just so driven, focused on the next game and the next thing. That’s how we are as a team and how I am as an individual. My dad built that into me so that I am never too excited by anything that’s going on around you, you’ve got to go onto the next thing to achieve the next target<br /><br />I feel like I need to do a lot more if I’m being really honest. It’s my best my goalscoring season. But, for me, I haven’t scored enough, I need to get more numbers and I’ve got the perfect base and the perfect team to do more.<br /><br />It’s a strange one. I think there are certain things that have definitely suggested I’ve improved. I could see it in my first season here just before I got injured that things were going in the right way and it felt like I was a big part of a team going in the right direction collectively.<br /><br />That’s the environment we are in and I don’t know if that’s what we’ve built as a team or that’s the way I feel about myself, but I wouldn’t look at this season and clearly say I’ve taken a big step forward because in my eyes I need to do a lot more.<br /><br />I feel I need to do keep pushing to keep up with the rest of this team and everyone around to be a part of this. The only thing I can say is that I feel I have taken a step forward from two or three years ago because I’m now getting more minutes consistently.<br /><br />I think I’ve started six <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games in a row and it sounds funny but I can’t really remember me doing that before. I don’t think i ever did that at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> . Look back and check but I don’t think I did. But I genuinely can’t remember playing that regularly</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain claims <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> title pain in 2018-19 made them even more determined to succeed]</b> You can look at it two ways. You can look at it in the sense of, how do you get 97 points and finish off second best? That, mentally for the lads, I think was a big challenge. You almost can’t get a more perfect season. You might have, you know, the season before City obviously got 100 points. So we’re talking one game, one win difference - you expect to win with that. So, I think first of all it was sort of another heightened respect for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> as a team, to go 100 points and then 98 back to back, that takes a lot of doing. Mentally, as a group of players, I think that’s maybe where we thought, ‘Alright, 97 points not good enough’ and I remember the manager saying we’ve got to do more. Simple as that. He was adamant that’s not enough, you’ve got to do more, and I think it’s a credit to us in what we’ve done so far this season, the boys are doing more and obviously this is a strange time because you talk about momentum and that’s the same for every team at the minute, but it’s not finished yet. We’re close but we’re not finished yet, but up to this point we are doing more. At the minute we’ve been doing that but whenever we’re able to kick off again we’ve got a job to finish so we can’t get carried away yet<br /><br />Whatever happens, we as a club know what we’ve achieved up to this point and we believe in what we could go on and do for the rest of the season and beyond that, and I think that’s important to know, that we’ve achieved something up to this point; it’s not the end goal but it’s all we could do up to now. Whatever is out of our control is out of our control as a group of people, as a football club, as players, as fans so just take care of themselves, look after themselves and their loved ones, and whenever we’re able to get back I look forward to seeing them again</p>

  <p><b>[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain reveals playing position was key behind transfer from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I wouldn’t say I wanted to leave <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because I didn’t believe we could win. I just didn’t believe I was going to be able to play where I wanted to play and that was it. Me winning the Champions League was obviously a dream come true and a massive bonus but I didn’t feel like ‘Ah, I told you so’ <b>[at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[Even so, it was the prospect of playing in his best role which most enticed the No. 15 to change clubs, especially after starting his last campaign with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> as a wing-back]</b> It was a big decision for me to leave a club like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. It was everything I knew at the top level for seven years. sWhen I had to make the decision to leave, it was the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make and to be honest there was a part of me that didn’t know if it was the right thing.
I feel a lot of my best performances for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> came in midfield but I never played consistently in that position. The first game of that season I switched with Hector <b>[Bellerin]</b>. First game I played on the left <b>[wing-back]</b>, he played on the right and second game we switched.

  <p><b>[Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain admits <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> took a ‘risk’ on handing him a new contract in August 2019, with the England international determined to repay that considerable show of faith]</b> It was another big moment for me. It was really exciting for me, obviously coming off the back of an injury; we were talking for a while if that was the thing we were going to do and coming to an agreement on that meant a lot to me. To be at a club that supported me all the way through an injury like that, which for some it can be career-ruining or career-ending, to commit to an extension and a contract, probably at a time where maybe it was a bit of a risk or they had to put a lot of trust and faith in me as an athlete and a person, because after an injury like that no-one really knows how you’re going to come back, for the club to do that meant the absolute world to me. I felt very privileged and honoured to extend my time with an amazing football club and an amazing team. Definitely one of my favourite moments of the season</p>
