  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is not technical enough to justify playing as an outright playmaker but is too free-spirited to play as a deep midfielder]</b> I saw him walk a tremendous amount.

For more than an hour, I was watching him on the scale of the whole pitch. I told myself: ‘It’s not possible’. When he had the ball, he made some passes, switched the play sometimes, but there was no movement. For more than an hour, I never saw him make one long run, with the exception when he fouled Jimmy Durmaz, who was on the break. He walked, making signals with his arms.</p>
