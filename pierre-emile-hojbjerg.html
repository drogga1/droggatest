  <p><b>[Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg speaks about leadership]</b> If you talk in the changing room then people will stop listening then. Talking has to be done on the pitch. Talking has to be done when it is tough. Talking has to be done when the moment is tight and you have to show your personality, stand true and you have to be a leader. I know what I stand for. I know what the club stands for and what the values are. I just try to be me</p>

  <p><b>[Southampton’s Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg has admitted he was too young to fully absorb the methods of ‘the most demanding person he’s ever met’ in Pep Guardiola]</b> He is the most demanding person, not only coach, that I have ever met. He always told me about controlling the game with or without the ball. To make the player you play against react to you, not you to him. He used to say to me, ‘Pierre, the most important thing is, if they are close to you, go out and if they are open, you go in, but you need to read it.’ He would say: ‘You need to tell me after one minute, how do they play’.<br /><br />We sit on the bus <b>[at Bayern]</b> after we have won and he sits on the bus watching the game and then he is in his office with two laptops and a television and he is analysing. Maybe that’s what makes him the greatest. But also maybe that is what makes him lose, because it is too much, he drowns. I don’t judge him but he is the greatest teacher I have had. We are people who once worked together and cared about each other, so I have respect for him. I learnt a lot from him, he was a great teacher, but to be honest I had him a little bit too early in my life, in my career. He was so good and on such a high level I still had to adapt to that. I was 17, 18 and 19. If I was 22, 23, like I am now, I would have had the base, I would not have had to struggle to keep up with some of the best players in the world. I was too green, I would have told everybody and I even said to him I was ready to play but if I had him as a coach now I would be even better.<br /><br />There is a mental mindset that says, ‘Oh they’re hurt, they’re wounded, let’s go at them,’ and if you get a taste of when they are down, you go for the kill. But if City have won 10 games in a row and you meet them, then before the game some players will already say we’ve lost. Now, when they are wounded, there is a belief that maybe wasn’t there before</p>

  <p><b>[Like his manager, Saints captain Pierre-Emile Hojberg also apologised to the fans and described 9-0 <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> thrashing as embarrassing]</b> I can only put my head in front of the team and say the only thing that matters is what we do going forward, and we can never let something like this happen again. It’s very embarrassing and very difficult for the whole team and we’re the ones to blame. We need to take it. I’m sorry, the only thing I can say to the fans is ‘I apologise’</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> captain Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg has apologised to the club’s fans for their 9-0 thrashing at home to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> on Friday night]</b> If I speak from the heart, I don’t think it will end very well. I can only put my head, as the captain, in the front of the team, and say that the only thing that matters now is what we do going forward and we can never ever let something like this happen again. I don’t want to talk, I don’t want to… I can only apologise. It’s very embarrassing and it’s very difficult for the whole team and we are the ones to blame. You need to blame us, we need to take it. What can I say? I’m sorry, the only thing I can say to the fans is I apologise<br /><br /><b>[The 24-year-old shouldered the burden and reassured fans]</b> The people that come to support us every week, away and at home, who give us love, these are the ones you want to do it for. These are the ones you want to get up again and get success for the club for. These are the people you play for. They have every right to be angry, to be disappointed, to be embarrassed. We need to show that they deserve better. First of all, we need to keep it inside the building, inside the dressing room. Second of all, the only thing that matters now is actions. I don’t care who’s coming up - something like this can never, ever happen again. Never</p>
