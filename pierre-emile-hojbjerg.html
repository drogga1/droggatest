  <p><b>[Like his manager, Saints captain Pierre-Emile Hojberg also apologised to the fans and described 9-0 <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> thrashing as embarrassing]</b> I can only put my head in front of the team and say the only thing that matters is what we do going forward, and we can never let something like this happen again. It’s very embarrassing and very difficult for the whole team and we’re the ones to blame. We need to take it. I’m sorry, the only thing I can say to the fans is ‘I apologise’</p>

  <p><b>[Southampton captain Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg has apologised to the club’s fans for their 9-0 thrashing at home to <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> on Friday night]</b> If I speak from the heart, I don’t think it will end very well. I can only put my head, as the captain, in the front of the team, and say that the only thing that matters now is what we do going forward and we can never ever let something like this happen again. I don’t want to talk, I don’t want to… I can only apologise. It’s very embarrassing and it’s very difficult for the whole team and we are the ones to blame. You need to blame us, we need to take it. What can I say? I’m sorry, the only thing I can say to the fans is I apologise<br /><br /><b>[The 24-year-old shouldered the burden and reassured fans]</b> The people that come to support us every week, away and at home, who give us love, these are the ones you want to do it for. These are the ones you want to get up again and get success for the club for. These are the people you play for. They have every right to be angry, to be disappointed, to be embarrassed. We need to show that they deserve better. First of all, we need to keep it inside the building, inside the dressing room. Second of all, the only thing that matters now is actions. I don’t care who’s coming up – something like this can never, ever happen again. Never</p>

  <p><b>[Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg speaks about leadership]</b> If you talk in the changing room then people will stop listening then. Talking has to be done on the pitch. Talking has to be done when it is tough. Talking has to be done when the moment is tight and you have to show your personality, stand true and you have to be a leader. I know what I stand for. I know what the club stands for and what the values are. I just try to be me</p>
