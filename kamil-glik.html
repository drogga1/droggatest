  <p><b>[On Kylian Mbappe]</b> We all know that Mbappe can become one of the best players in the world. He is a young player, but he is doing some extraordinary things for a player his age.</p>

  <p><b>[Mbappe tops Lewandowski and Belotti for former Monaco team-mate Kamil Glik]</b> Kylian is a nice boy. He is not yet 19 years old. He did not go crazy when the media storm erupted around him. I do not know what his situation is today, but here in Monaco we took care to nurture him. He has pressure, but his head is on his shoulders, which means he can be even better. I am convinced that once he has matured further, he will get to the top. I would say that a bright future awaits him. He can be a world leader, I have no doubt. He is certainly one of the three best players I have played with. Maybe even the best.</p>

  <p><b>[Monaco paying the price for big money sales of Mbappe, Silva &amp; Bakayoko]</b> It’s not just because players left in the close season, even if that explains a lot of it because we lost five starters. We can’t look for excuses and now we have to focus on the league to ensure that we’re back in the Champions League next season.</p>
