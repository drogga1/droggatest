But from that moment I could see his special qualities.<br /><br />He has proved from that moment that he has special qualities. He has proved himself on and off the pitch and he can continue to play at the top level for another three or four years. He is very fit. He trains to the limit. It is not normal to reach these performances, but I think he will continue for a while. He is the captain. He is a hugely important player. I think he will continue to give people joy at club and international level</p>

What I will take with me from my job is the love I feel when I go about my everyday life<br /><br /><b>[And Santos felt such a victory on home soil would leave a lasting legacy upon the sport in his nation]</b> It will leave a huge mark on Portuguese football to have played in these Finals. The World Cup did not go as we hoped but this team marks the future. The future is here. If we look back to 2016, most of these brilliant teams are no longer here. This is an ongoing process and it speaks of what Portuguese football is. We don’t have the financial wherewithal to keep them <b>[top players]</b> in Portugal. They are scattered all through Europe, but the future of Portuguese football is secured</p>

At half-time I tried to rectify things and we improved, but we went into the break with an unfair scoreline - it should have been 2-1 and not 2-0.

It is not easy to beat Portugal, Portugal have all the conditions to be able to make a good European Championship. The status is the same as always. When we went to Euro 2016, they said it was crazy when I said Portugal was a candidate<br /><br />It was not an exhibition with artistic notes, as it was against Lithuania. Before the game we could not appreciate the situation of the pitch, but we were aware of how it was and the truth is that posed some problems, especially in the circulation of the ball. The players had difficulty getting their foot on the ball. For the first 20 minutes, we couldn’t get the game right and Luxembourg are a team that presses well and are physically strong. From the 25th minute, things got more balanced, we started playing differently and scored the <b>[Fernandes]</b> goal. It was a tougher game than we expected but it showed the character and personality of these players</p>
