  <p><b>[Portugal coach Fernando Santos believes his team will be better than France by the start of Euro 2016]</b> It’s clear that we have to improve our game in some aspects but I guess we had a good performance. We made it an open game, as I’ve said, for moments the game was under Portugal’s control, in others, it was France time. So I guess we showed that we can beat France. It wasn’t the case today, here, but I believe it will be so in some months, when we are over there, in France</p>

  <p><b>[Portugal coach Fernando Santos had a chance to test out his side in Friday’s friendly against France]</b> It was worth it. Portugal did very well, with good ball retention, exploring the flanks and getting Cristiano close to Eder. France had periods where they got better, and they were improved in the second half. At the point that we were getting better, we ended up conceding a goal at a set-piece. Football is like this. I want to thank the fantastic public presence and the way they pushed the team forward. The team was thrilled. We had two or three players with some problems. We had to make changes but that’s not why we lost. The team fought well</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Santos has defended Cristiano Ronaldo for failing to score as Portugal edged past Albania 1-0 on Monday]</b> He’s a player who scores 50 goals a season, so it’s not surprising that it causes some anxiety when he goes a few games without a goal. He showed a fantastic, sacrificial spirit because he was experiencing some pain but gave everything in the game. The goals will come. Sometimes anxiety plays its part in stopping goals being scored, but he’s just saving himself up for the right time.<br /><br />We have to face Denmark like it’s a final. Victory is always important. We took an important step, but still nothing is decided. We played well against a good Albania team, but the team always believed and we ended up being happy</p>

  <p><b>[Portugal head coach Fernando Santos believes his side have the quality to win Euro 2016]</b> Some people say I’m crazy because I say that we are not favourites as well as saying that we have the quality to win. There are many candidates. Portugal has the objective to go to France, win games and win the European Championships. When I arrived everything was difficult - it was hard to get third place. Now, everything is great. This team is capable but there are things to improve. If we maintain what we have been doing and improve these aspects, not being the favourites, we are one of the candidates. I believe it is possible. When I arrived I wrote on the board for the players to read: first goal, qualify for France as first in the group; second goal, get to France and fight for victory.</p>

He was not in shape to start the game. He told me he could play 20 to 25 minutes and he came on at the right time.<br /><br />It’s always important to finish first and be seeded in the draw for Euro 2016.

  <p><b>[Portugal must continue to work, work, work]</b> In the first 10 minutes I thought it was going to happen, the same thing we saw against Bulgaria. Courtois made two or three fantastic saves. In the first part we again make a good game, facing a very strong team as Belgium. We had always controlled the game, with some possession of Belgium, but nothing that caused us major problems. The second half was different, also with good control, but there was a time we break a little. In the game with Bulgaria did not do anything wrong, there were good things, but today also we did all right.<br /><br />We played too slowly in the first half. We have not sought enough depth. We were too late in repositioning, too much space was left. We sometimes ran behind the ball, it is wrong. But I’ve learned some positive lessons from this meeting. <b>[Thomas]</b> Vermaelen is not in his place at left-back. There has been positioning problems but later, we went to a 4-4-2 system that has worked better. We were seeking higher <b>[positions]</b> in the second period, it worked, it is positive</p>

  <p><b>[Claims that Portugal are Cristiano Ronaldo plus 10 come as no surprise to Fernando Santos]</b> Cristiano is essential for any team. That was already said at Manchester United and is now said at Real Madrid, and we are talking about two of the best teams in the world. Of course, the best player in the world is an absolutely fundamental element in any strategy, but we all know that to win we have to have a strong team and play as a team. In fact, he <b>[Cristiano]</b> has demonstrated this commitment, this spirit of sacrifice and dedication, and his colleagues are even more motivated by his example.<br /><br />There is still a lot of time left before the World Cup and I prefer to analyse the present. Cristiano is in excellent form and I hope that it continues until and during the competition in Russia<br /><br /><b>[Portugal will be hoping to repeat their Euro 2016 heroics]</b> The favourites for the title are Brazil, Germany, Spain, Argentina and France. I say this because of the enormous recruiting base and the extraordinary quality of their teams, who have a winning history and experience in these competitions<br /><br />If there are five favourites and only four places in the semi-finals, we can easily see how difficult it is to reach this stage of the competition. We know we are not favourites and we accept the favouritism of other teams, but that does not mean that we have no ambition and the goal of entering each game to win</p>

It was, of course, difficult to leave out Eder, Nani and others who wrote the most brilliant page in the history of Portuguese football.

We are only talking about this because it’s <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. There are millions of players out there and it seems that this only happens to him and maybe another two or three players. To nobody else. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is here, he was called up, he’s fine, he’ll play, I have no doubts about it. So, for me, there’s no issue here<br /><br /><b>[Santos clearly felt he had made his stance clear, as he replied to the next question on <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> again? No, sorry, sorry. On <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> again, I’m talking about Portugal. You are talking to me about <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, no. I won’t talk about <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> anymore. For me, the theme of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> ends here</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s fitness was never a doubt for Portugal coach Fernando Santos as the star forward scored a hat-trick in Thursday’s 6-0 victory over Lithuania]</b> He’s fine. I had no doubt about that, as I said before the match. Other people did, but I didn’t have any doubts<br /><br />What we have is a very motivated <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, who always gives his best. He scored three times, which is normal for him.<br /><br />What we have is a very motivated <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, who always gives his best. He scored three times, which is normal for him.<br /><br /><b>[Santos felt his side could have scored more than twice in the first half]</b> The players stuck to the plan. We played very well in the first half, with lots of variety to our game and plenty of control. At the break we could have had more goals. But after scoring the fourth we could afford to rest ready for the next game. We’ll try to beat Luxembourg in the same manner, but we have less than 72 hours to recover so we’ll see</p>

  <p><b>[Portugal coach Fernando Santos was grilled over <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s fitness prior to the match]</b> A lot of people were asking about <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> - what I said was that he was able to play, that <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> was fine. It <b>[his performance]</b> didn’t surprise me. In fact, I am never surprised by <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a>, I assure you. So, scoring a hat-trick was perfectly normal</p>

  <p><b>[Fernando Santos expects Portugal to compete strongly for back-to-back European titles but does not think his defending champions are favourites heading into Euro 2020]</b> We are candidates at the Euros, we never assume as we are favourites. The Portuguese team has quality. When Portugal can gather creativity, quality and artistic notes, and at the same time realise that the game, at certain times, needs other things, <b>[we are]</b> practically unbeatable. It is not easy to beat Portugal, Portugal have all the conditions to be able to make a good European Championship. The status is the same as always. When we went to Euro 2016, they said it was crazy when I said Portugal was a candidate<br /><br />It was not an exhibition with artistic notes, as it was against Lithuania. Before the game we could not appreciate the situation of the pitch, but we were aware of how it was and the truth is that posed some problems, especially in the circulation of the ball. The players had difficulty getting their foot on the ball. For the first 20 minutes, we couldn’t get the game right and Luxembourg are a team that presses well and are physically strong. From the 25th minute, things got more balanced, we started playing differently and scored the <b>[Fernandes]</b> goal. It was a tougher game than we expected but it showed the character and personality of these players</p>
