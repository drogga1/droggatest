  <p><b>[Kedah’s new signing Ken Ilsø Larsen has set an ambitious target for himself, to score 20 goals this season]</b> I had that <b>[a target]</b> last year in the league as well, I wanted to score 20 goals but I didn’t succeed. I only scored 19… so I’m going for the 20 again <b>[with Kedah]</b>. Even though I know Malaysia has a tougher league than Singapore, but I’m also at a better team now.<br /><br />In general, players in Malaysia are more technical as well as faster.<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether the goal took some pressure of him]</b> Today was just one of those days where it did not really come together as expected, I made the wrong choices in terms of finishing. But sometimes if you continue 90 minutes, you’re back in. I think I would be lying if I said I wasn’t happy, as a striker will always want to score, I’m just happy that I scored<br /><br />I had just been eased into it, and not playing fulltime <b>[in the previous pre-season friendlies]</b>. I asked the coach to let me play the fulltime today because I need to run for 90 minutes so I will be ready for our first league match, against JDT<br /><br />When you get into a pre-season a little bit later than the rest of the team, you’re going to develop a few issues with your body. In general, you have to time it and not be too aggressive, but also not too slow</p>

  <p><b>[Kedah’s import striker, Ken Ilso believes that the good combination between players]</b> We have some difficulties in our previous matches with our final touch in front of the goal, and the last pass before the finish. We did great today. The pass that I got from Fakri Saarani was amazing and it makes it easier for the strikers to put in.<br /><br />In the first half I felt like I was not really into the game. They were really closing us down. But it’s good that you have players that are good with the ball. We agreed that we just want to keep going like we did in the first half and we know we’re going to get our chances</p>

  <p><b>[Ken Ilso continued his scoring streak with a strike against Perak that sealed Kedah’s qualification to the next round of the FA Cup]</b> I’m happy but we could also have scored more than we did. I think we did good in keeping off the pressure. But myself would’ve liked to have scored one more. But all in all, when you go here and win against Perak, you have to happy.<br /><br />It’s difficult to play against Perak as they are strong in counter-attacks. They were also strong in putting pressure. It was important we got the first goal, it gave us a little calmness at the back. In a game where it’s all or nothing, it meant they had to step up. Which gave us more space to operate and that’s what we got<br /><br />I don’t know <b>[if there were too much aggression in the game due to heightened emotions]</b> . i think there should always be emotions in a game like this. You can also hear the crowd, they both wanted victory. It’s difficult when you’re in the game, you get a little of the emotions from the outside. It’s transferred somehow to the pitch. I think it was alright<br /><br />It’s amazing. It’s so important for everyone on the field to feel the tension from the crowd. When you win, then it feels more amazing. Because you stand and celebrate with the fans afterwards. There were so many Kedah fans, it was unbelievable</p>

  <p><b>[Kedah forward Ken Ilso Larsen says while Malaysian clubs rarely plan ahead for the future, the Red Eagles do things differently]</b> I think it’s in the DNA of Kedah to have a lot of young players in the squad, and a couple of older ones where they can also bring in some experience. It does not matter who’s not playing, we can have the young players take over.<br /><br />I always understand that it’s difficult to arrange everything when you have the one-month Aidilfitri break, but it is what it is. They had to pack a lot of games together and luckily we have a big squad that is capable. But of course there will be teams that will be vulnerable to fixture congestion. I think Kedah are ready for it, but in this case it is what it is<br /><br />I just know if you want to produce very good youth teams and in the end the senior team, you need to invest a lot in the youth department. Take the example of Germany where I had played in. Around 12 or 14 years ago they decided they wanted to win the World Cup, and they started investing massively in young players. And just look today; they have just won the Confederations Cup with their ‘C’ team, with a lot of young U21 players. It takes a lot of investment and it takes time before you can reap the fruits<br /><br />Some of the decisions made by Malaysian clubs are a little short-term, when they need to invest in the future. Just take the example of their foreign signings; they get changed either in the mid-season transfer window, or after just one season<br /><br />One of the reasons that attracted me to Kedah in the beginning was at the time, they had foreign players who have been playing for a couple of years for them; such as Sandro <b>[da Silva]</b> and Liridon <b>[Krasniqi]</b>. That showed progress in the way that I like football and the team’s surroundings</p>
