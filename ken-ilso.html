<blockquote>
  <p>[Kedah’s new signing Ken Ilsø Larsen has set an ambitious target for himself, to score 20 goals this season] I had that [a target] last year in the league as well, I wanted to score 20 goals but I didn’t succeed. I only scored 19… so I’m going for the 20 again [with Kedah]. Even though I know Malaysia has a tougher league than Singapore, but I’m also at a better team now.<br /><br />In general, players in Malaysia are more technical as well as faster.<br /><br />[When asked whether the goal took some pressure of him] Today was just one of those days where it did not really come together as expected, I made the wrong choices in terms of finishing. But sometimes if you continue 90 minutes, you’re back in. I think I would be lying if I said I wasn’t happy, as a striker will always want to score, I’m just happy that I scored<br /><br />I had just been eased into it, and not playing fulltime [in the previous pre-season friendlies]. I asked the coach to let me play the fulltime today because I need to run for 90 minutes so I will be ready for our first league match, against JDT<br /><br />When you get into a pre-season a little bit later than the rest of the team, you’re going to develop a few issues with your body. In general, you have to time it and not be too aggressive, but also not too slow</p>
