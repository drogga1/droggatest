  <p><b>[Anderlecht’s sporting director Michael Verschueren said of Kompany’s appointment]</b> With Vincent’s return we have achieved something that everyone thought was impossible. Vincent is the child of the house and the person we need to give a new impulse to the club and to use for RSCA 2.0</p>

  <p><b>[Kemar Roofe has sealed a £7million move to Anderlecht from Leeds]</b> We were looking for an attacker like Kemar for quite a while now. He’s a true goal-getter who will be a great asset to our team</p>

  <p><b>[Michael Verschueren has admitted that he wishes that he did not sign former <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> star <a href="samir-nasri.html">Samir Nasri</a> in the summer]</b> If I had to do it again, would we have signed <a href="samir-nasri.html">Samir Nasri</a>? With what we know now, no. We’re very worried about Nacer Chadli’s calf injury. If we had known about it, we might have acted differently. We’ve been unlucky. We wanted him to play more. You can get injured once, but for a second time, it’s not positive. Roofe? We looked at his medical history and he never had big problems. We’ve been unlucky<br /><br /><b>[he is optimistic that Jamaica international star Kemar Lawrence will prove to be an excellent addition]</b> We’ve been following him for a very long time. It was difficult, because New York didn’t want to sell him at first and we found an agreement on the last day of the transfer window. We did a superb deal</p>
