That is the situation of tournaments that included European and South American clubs, such as the Copa Rio of 1951 and 1952; and the Intercontinental Cup. Nevertheless, not until 2000 did FIFA first organise the Club World Cup, with representatives from all six confederations. The winners of those competitions are the teams who are officially considered by FIFA as world club champions</p>

  <p><b>[Are we waiting for a player to be killed? Why FIFA has got to ban heading. Luke Giggs said]</b> Fernando Torres’s injury is another reminder of the possible serious implications that can result from a clash of heads, which can occur in any game of football or indeed any contact sport. This incident, as well as the recent head injury involving Ryan Mason, demonstrates there is more understanding and recognition in football of the importance of ensuring all head injuries are treated with the utmost seriousness, and this has to be welcomed. However, there is still room for improvement in all sports, not just football, to ensure that the safety first principle of ‘if in doubt, sit it out!’ is applied in all cases of suspected concussion.</p>

We cannot control the security if people come to these stores. We cannot accept the situation and still we have no solution. We really need to close that especially the stores which have fuel tanks which can lead to a grave security concern</p>

I haven’t changed my mind. It’s a fantastic stadium. Most of the work that we have asked is completed. The rest is of temporary nature so we have no worries. The new dressing rooms are of a very high quality so we are very happy. The pitch will be prepared now that the cricket season is over. This will be one of the best, if not the best stadium in the country for hosting the World Cup matches<br /><br />Even though this is a boys tournament, I want girls to come out in large numbers, to see what football can do to their lives. We also want families to come to the tournament. And we will be doing everything to make this possible<br /><br /><b>[With the DY Patil set to host a Justin Bieber concert in May, Yarza did not see it as a negative and hailed it as an important test run]</b> One of the things we like to do in World Cup venues is to have test events. We will have 50,000 people there but the planning of laying grass is only after that. So it is a good opportunity. Timing wise it’s a good thing to see how facilities work.

  <p><b>[Meet Lucas Cardoso - The 72-year-old who will be volunteering come October]</b> I started following football from the 1966 FIFA World Cup. I was a Portugal fan, and it was the first time Portugal had qualified. They finished third but I still remember the semi-final against England very clearly. They had changed the venue <b>[from Goodison Park to Wembley to incorporate higher gate receipts]</b> at the last moment, and that really helped the hosts.<br /><br />Portugal ended up losing 2-1. But it got me interested in football and I have been following every World Cup since. In India, I have been a Salgaocar fan for a long time. Back then, they used to have a policy of fielding only local Goan talent. Dempo SC or Churchill Brothers used to bring in players from other states and other countries as well, but Salgaocar would play our Goan youngsters. That way I could really relate to them because I wanted to see Goa develop as a footballing state and more Goan youngsters get to play regularly<br /><br />Let me put it this way, Salgaocar and the other clubs used to promote Goan talent but they then shifted their focus from it. But in FC Goa, the whole of Goa sees a united representation on a national level. Along with the players from other countries, we are able to see Goan players like Romeo Fernandes and Mandar Rao Dessai given chances at the highest level. That’s why you see most of Goa readily supporting them<br /><br />Yes, Goa might not have any players in the U-17 team, but the fact remains that football is our first sport and it is as much as a part of the Goan culture than anything else. We are happy that at least Goan youngsters are getting the chance to improve with the rest of the country thanks to this tournament, so we will definitely support it,<br /><br />My first experience with volunteering came three years back during the Lusofonia Games held in Goa. I’m fluent in Portuguese, so I went and offered my services. Initially they were apprehensive, saying that I was too old for that! I told them that I won’t be able to do any running around or such ground work, but with my experience, I could handle logistics. So they gave me some logistics related work. Later, as the Games drew closer, I was appointed as the Official Liason Officer and translator of the Portuguese contingent</p>

This is issued from the player’s former association to his new one.<br /><br />For an international transfer to take place an ITC is necessary and the various steps need to be taken to get the ITC. Once this has been completed the former association of the player, asks the player and his former club to confirm if his contract has expired, if it was ended early or on mutual agreement or whether there is a contractual dispute.<br /><br />The ITC can be rejected if the contract between the player and his former club has not expired, or if there is no mutual agreement regarding its early termination. Generally speaking FIFA doesn’t speculate on potential scenarios and their outcomes so in this respect we refer to the regulations</p>

In the committee´s opinion, imposing a ban on registering each and every minor would not be proportionate to the offence committed. Consequently, the FIFA Appeal Committee decided that, as far as youth categories are concerned, the ban shall not cover the registration of minor players under the age of 16 who do not fall under the scope of art. 19 of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, which refers to international transfers and first registrations of foreign minor players.</p>

Additionally, FIFA and Qatar have once again explored the feasibility of Qatar hosting a 48-team tournament by in particular lowering certain key FIFA requirements.<br /><br />A joint analysis, in this respect, concluded that due to the advanced stage of preparations and the need for a detailed assessment of the potential logistical impact on the host country, more time would be required and a decision could not be taken before the deadline of June. It was therefore decided not to further pursue this option. The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 will therefore remain as originally planned with 32 teams and no proposal will be submitted at the next FIFA Congress on 5 June</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA to propose teams use five substitutes when football resumes after coronavirus outbreak]</b> When competitions resume, such competitions are likely to face a congested match calendar with a higher than normal frequency of matches played in consecutive weeks. Safety of the players is one of FIFA’s main priorities. One concern in this regard is that the frequency of matches may increase the risk of potential injuries due to a player overload. In light of this and the unique challenge faced globally in delivering competitions according to the originally foreseen calendar, FIFA proposes a larger number of substitutions be temporarily allowed at the discretion of the relevant competition organiser. In competitions where less than five substitutions are currently allowed, each team would now be given the possibility to use up to five substitutions, with the possibility of an additional substitution remaining during extra time where relevant</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA has confirmed that it will allow the transfer window to open before the end of the delayed 2019-20 season in order to aid clubs during the coronavirus pandemic]</b> In order to avoid any concerns regarding unemployed players, players are permitted to be registered with a maximum of three clubs and are eligible to play in official matches for three clubs during the same season. In order to give priority to clubs to complete their 2019-20 season with their original squad, provide flexibility, and allow associations to properly plan their football calendar, those associations following a dual-year calendar are permitted to commence the ‘first registration period’ for the 2020-21 season prior to the completion of the 2019-20 season, subject to certain conditions. In order to provide financial relief to parties involved in disputes before FIFA, for any claim lodged between 10 June 2020 and 31 December 2020 (both inclusive), there will be no requirement to pay an advance of costs and no procedural costs shall be ordered. For any claim lodged prior to 10 June 2020 which has yet to be decided, the maximum amount of the procedural costs shall be equivalent to any advance of costs paid</p>
