  <p><b>[Chelsea loanee Tomas Kalas is looking to Andreas Christensen for inspiration as he waits on talks over his future]</b> Andreas Christensen made it and he played many games. Obviously, there were a few mistakes but he took the chance well and he deserves to be there. If he can do it, then I believe I can do it as well. I just don’t want to be too overconfident.<br /><br />I have been there on pre-seasons in the past and I don’t think that I was the worst player on the pitch. One season that I spent there I got only two games, which was not as many as I was expecting or what I was told I would get. Both games we won and we only conceded an unlucky goal against Cardiff, so it could have been two clean sheets. I don’t know what I could do more. If it comes, with the way they are playing, then hopefully I will fit in. On the other side, it hasn’t worked for the last eight years. Is it time to change? Maybe yes, maybe not … If we work it out with Chelsea, between me, Fulham or maybe even a different club but I can’t really say much about that right now<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he would like to stay at Fulham]</b> Of course, I want it. I don’t know if it will happen though. There will be talks in the next month. Hopefully, it will work in the way that I want it, Chelsea want it and maybe Fulham want it. I don’t know if it will, it is difficult to say now what is going to happen. If it goes the right way, it would be nice to stay with the team that’s in the Premier League. For me, it would be another step towards the highest level, because of course the Championship is not the highest level. The Premier League would be perfect, it doesn’t matter which club. If it was at Fulham, where I have spent the past two seasons, then that would be even better.<br /><br />We are going to talk about it and Fulham has to offer something if they want me. I don’t know now but I am just glad we made it. What happens next season, I don’t really know. I just don’t want to be overconfident but I can rate myself as an experienced Championship player. What’s the next step? To try it in the Premier League. If I am not ready now to try my best and take a punt, then I don’t think that I ever will be. I can easily say that I will try to get myself to a Premier League team, if an offer comes<br /><br />Is it a positive record or negative? You could see it from both ways but being employed by Chelsea for eight years is not a bad record, even though I just started two games for them. I am taking it positively because they took me into senior football and helped me to develop. Even though it might sound horrific to keep sending me on loans, they always sent me on the loans that I wanted or agreed too. They listened to me and we found a way, so I believe the same thing will happen for next season<br /><br />Unbelievable, it is difficult to describe it with words. It is something that we tried to achieve for a long time. For two seasons, last season was disappointing. This season, we made it to the end and won. It is difficult to say how I am feeling but it is nothing but positive. Obviously, we were under pressure with a player less and it was all going Aston Villa’s way. It wasn’t much about football, it was more about team spirit and the way we handled it towards the end. It was superb as much as how we played our first half. So all together, the quality, team spirit all came at the right time and that’s why we won. Getting promoted, what more can you ask for. To be successful in the Premier League is for next season, so we couldn’t ask for anything more this season</p>

  <p><b>[Bristol City are targeting the permanent signing of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> loanee Tomas Kalas as they ring-fence a portion of their transfer budget to secure the defender]</b> Now it is time to relax and after that back to business and where? Who knows</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> defender Tomas Kalas has said that fans can ‘slap him’ if he refuses to take a picture with them after joining Bristol City permanently]</b> In Bristol it’s a nice atmosphere everywhere you go. Nowadays loads of people know me now so it’s making it quite tough again. But as long as somebody isn’t rude like one of today’s kids. I signed their shirt and they said, ‘great own goal’ <b>[against <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday]</b> … in that moment you would rip that shirt off them! As long as they ask politely, I’ve never said no (to signing an autograph) and I’ll never do that unless somebody says, as a direct order, ‘sign my shirt, take a picture with me’ then I don’t really hear that. But if somebody says please, because that’s what my father taught me, say hi to everyone who says hi, say please to anybody who says please. If somebody says, ‘please can we take a picture’ - if I say no then they can slap me<br /><br /><b>[The central defender says he chose to make his temporary move to Bristol City permanent due to the interest they showed in him even after his loan move expired]</b> For me, personally, it was quite a successful season and the interest was there from Bristol City, the manager and the fans, especially, the whole summer. So that made the decision that much easier - the decision if I should wait for somebody else or shall I sign for Bristol as a first choice. I just wanted to get it done and dusted and find the club I can finally play for and dedicate whatever it takes on and off the pitch to one and only club; not always be on loans and try my best for the club that never takes me or never shows interest after certain successful seasons. They still showed the interest and that’s what I really appreciate</p>

  <p><b>[Tomas Kalas opens up on his injury frustration and reveals how Bristol City can keep <a href="cardiff-city-fc.html">Cardiff City</a> quiet]</b> I was really optimistic in the first two weeks but then it stopped healing as quickly as it was the first 10 days. It was frustrating because I was already planning when I’d be back, because I didn’t want to miss any matches. But the most important thing is to get back and make sure it doesn’t happen again. There’s loads of ways to approach it but my way, even though it takes longer was to aim to come back and go straight into the team. The recovery took twice as long as I wanted it to but I was able to go back into the team without being affected<br /><br /><b>[As is the case with every injury player, Saturday afternoons haven’t been much fun for the 26-year-old]</b> Even though I had hamstring problems, I was kicking people in front of me when I was watching games so I apologise to them! I always want play and help the boys but I couldn’t so that was the most frustrating part of it<br /><br /><b>[That was the case at Barnsley where Williams and Kalas looked to have established an initially strong understanding but those two late goals and the points lost ruined all that promising work]</b> You don’t want to know how it was in there after the game. There was disappointment, anger. You can’t just come into the dressing room after drawing a game you were supposed to win and tap each other on the backs like ‘let it go’. Naturally, we are winners and when we lose its difficult to take<br /><br /><b>[But Kalas is confident he and Williams will build a solid and reliable partnership, admitting his admiration for the Wales international]</b> You can see straightaway how experienced he is and that’s by how he plays. We can learn from him because he’s been in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I’ve never been there properly. He’s already played hundreds of games and I’m quite far away from that and so are a lot of other players. Whatever he does is probably right because if he wasn’t doing the correct things then he wouldn’t have had the career that he’s had. It’s more like an inspiration because if I were like him I’d be very happy<br /><br /><b>[Although the keys to victory, in his eyes, lie in not matching Cardiff up like-for-like but by trying to play a cuter brand of football and cutting off their supply line]</b> It’ll be our task to not give them many opportunities to put the ball in the box. It doesn’t matter if that’s from set pieces or open play. If we start playing their way it will be difficult because they’re more physical than us. So we’ll try to play the way we do and hopefully it’ll be enough</p>
