  <p><b>[Manchester United have shown an interest in Argentine left-back Enzo Diaz]</b> I found out about it on Saturday morning, but later I did not talk to anyone other than my agent. My agent told me that they were delighted and they were going to see me in a couple more games. It is the dream of any footballer <b>[to play for Manchester United]</b>. However, I need to remain focused on what we are doing and enjoying this moment</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Man Utd target Enzo Diaz? The ex-farmer followed by Mourinho in Argentina]</b> I found out on Saturday morning. I spoke to my agent, who told me that <b>[the scouts]</b> were very impressed and that they were going to watch me for a few more games. It would be a dream come true to play there, but I need to stay focused on what I am doing right now.<br /><br />I used to train in the evenings after working in the fields all day</p>
