  <p><b>[Neil Ruddock says <a href="patrick-vieira.html">Patrick Vieira</a> should faces the possibility of further punishment after allegedly spitting his face following his red card]</b> He is the lowest of the low. I like him as a player but not as a man. He deserves a long ban</p>

  <p><b>[Ruddock later said of the Cole incident to Talksport]</b> Basically, I loved kicking Andrew Cole. I know this is not big and it’s not clever, but in one tackle I did break both of his legs. I didn’t mean to break both of his legs if I’m honest – I only meant to break one</p>

  <p><b>[Neil Ruddock shows off incredible weight loss after losing over a stone]</b> I said I was fed up of carrying the extra weight, so I’ve done something about it. Say bye bye to fat Razor, and check out the new and improved Razor<br /><br /><b>[Since following the new regime, he’s also dropped two shirt sizes and lost four inches off his waist]</b> It wasn’t nice to get a load of bad test results – my cholesterol was up, my blood pressure was high – so I knew I had to do something about my health<br /><br />Losing my former <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> teammate Justin so tragically this summer also made me realise that nobody really knows what’s happening inside their body, so everyone should try to make healthy improvements to their life where they can</p>
