<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Who is Mario Fernandes?]</b> Several days after we signed the agreement with Gremio and Mario, Real approached the club and the player. Real offered Gremio more than we did, and they offered Mario much more. His agent showed me the figures when Mario was already training at CSKA and preparing for the season. He said that even if Real had made their offer a little earlier, he would still have come to CSKA. Because he understood that, at Real, he would have been a fringe player at best, whereas we had assured him that he would be an immediate starter for us. He would have the chance to make further progress, and Real would have to come back for him. And he would be able to go there with Champions League experience under his belt.</p>
