  <p><b>[Metz-Lyon abandoned after Anthony Lopes hurt by firecracker]</b> The public authorities in Metz took the decision to stop the match between FC Metz and Olympique Lyonnais indefinitely, in agreement with the match delegate and the referee, following the incidents that took place at the half-hour point of the game.<br /><br />A report will be sent to the LFP’s Disciplinary Commission. The LFP regrets these incidents and will be uncompromising in its continued review of this report</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes will need treatment for several weeks after he was struck by a firecracker in Saturday’s game at Metz and diagnosed with a sound trauma]</b> After having been in the emergency rooms last night and having seen a specialist this morning, Dr Giroud, I want to reassure everyone. I am suffering from a sound trauma which will have no consequences on my future. I will be undergoing treatment for two weeks. Thank you for your support.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ashley-williams.html">Ashley Williams</a> is shown a yellow card after pushing Anthony Lopes and causing a mass brawl]</b> It was no big deal, it happened and that was it. For me, it seemed to wake up the fans and they seemed to love it. I don’t think it is part of the English atmosphere to hit an away player, but it was like this. But I am proud that we were strong at 1-1 and we won the game despite everything. It was a very proud night for us</p>
