<blockquote>
  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> star <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> has been praised by Leyton Orient CEO, Danny Macklin, after sales in the club’s shirts spiked after it was announced the England captain would be sponsoring them next season]</b> He is a first class individual. He has helped provide vital income and exposure and is raising money for three fantastic causes. One week on, we have already sold more shirts than we did in the entire 2019-20 season. It is unbelievable. We have had to place two top-up orders since. We have had enquiries from around 113 places to buy the shirt, and we have had 100 orders from the USA. It has been phenomenal. We even know of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans buying it and applauding what <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> has done! That is welcome at an important time, and we will be able to make some donations from the proceeds to the three causes. It was much needed support and comfort along with other things we are doing. It gives us assurances in terms of finances, but there’s an awful lot more to do to be a sustainable club<br /><br />He is a role model to people like my son. We all want an England footballer we can be proud of. He started his professional career on loan at Orient, which was a perfect fit. A number of people said he was going to be a star at the time and that he ultimately had the talent, but he needed to put in the work to reach the levels he had. He can be an even bigger star in a couple of years. Every award, record or goal <a href="harry-kane.html">Kane</a> has got is totally deserved.<br /><br />Will Covid-19 make an impact? Absolutely, yes. It will be longer and more difficult to get around those obstacles but as a lower league club we have to use this opportunity to drive change. Not just within the club, but within all our expenditure base and make sure we are driving all our revenue forward as creatively as we can. It is an opportunity we may not get again. I agree with <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a>’s opinion <b>[about not taking public money]</b>. I echo pretty much everything he says, I don’t think we can go cap in hand to the government at this stage. There might be a stage when the game needs that, but right now we need to make sure we have our own houses in order. We need to look at what the game can do. That’s not just taking it from the players’ pockets - that’s across absolutely everything we do. The money that comes from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> that filters into parachute payments is extraordinarily high and just a redistribution of that could allow clubs to be sustainable. That, along with creative thinking and treating it like a business, will allow us to enjoy what we enjoy most - competitive football</p>
