  <p><b>[Canada legend Paul Stalteri says <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> could have been too big for Davies but his potential is huge]</b> I am very relieved that things are going so well for him at Bayern. When he moved from Vancouver to Munich last January, I was happy. But I also had doubts. My fear was that Alphonso would not get enough game time at Bayern. That the club could be one size too big for him. But I was certain in one point: Germany is the best country for Alphonso’s career. German soccer is just the thing for top talents from Canada. It fits perfectly because we Canadians have a similar mentality to the Germans: hard work and discipline are important points. And they are crucial for the human development of young players<br /><br />His huge advantage is his super-toned body, his dynamism and his smooth movements. ‘Phonzy’ not only runs incredibly fast, but also a hell of a lot. He is on the go non-stop. With his outstanding ball control, he can always go one on one. Even as a boy he was extremely dangerous in front of the opposing goal. In Canada, he was mostly on the left wing going forward. But he could also play in the number nine position. The defensive position he now has at Bayern was not his role in the past. He is one of the most dangerous players in Canada. The boy has a really good heart. He loves jokes on social networks. He jokes off the pitch, but as soon as he gets on the pitch he is totally serious and a thousand per cent committed. He doesn’t do anything stupid. His development is enormous, his potential huge. He has all the qualities and is well on the way to a great career</p>
