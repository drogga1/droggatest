  <p><b>[Kenneth Omeruo ready to quit Chelsea for regular first team football]</b> It might happen that I get to play for Chelsea but it is no longer my immediate priority. You have no idea how frustrating it is to always go out on loan. Last season I had an opportunity to go to one of Turkey’s biggest clubs <b>[Besiktas]</b> but the deal collapsed two days to the end of the transfer window. This season I was lucky I could find a place where I could still play because they want me to come to Alanyaspor. My priority is to play at the top, to find a place where I get to play regularly. Next season will be interesting because I’m looking to be in one of the top leagues, so we’ll see what happens.</p>

  <p><b>[Kenneth Omeruo speaks about representing his country at the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-17 World Cup in 2009 on home soil]</b> The U-17 World Cup was the bigger moment than anything else. It was like winning the lottery being called up. It was God. I wasn’t so good. I thought there were other players who were better than me at the time and now I am in the national team. It was God and hard work as well that got me here. The life-changing moment was playing in the U-17 World Cup. I went to open trials where anyone under 17 could come and show what you can do. I went from that to being selected among the 24 players to be selected to represent the country. It was massive. We played against the likes of <a href="isco.html">Isco</a>, who plays for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, and we beat Spain. We lost to Switzerland in the final but I was already a winner for going</p>

  <p><b>[At 26, Kenneth Omeruo already own a football club in Portugal]</b> Now, I am working with a fourth division team which I partly own a share with, the reason is to help bring players from Nigeria straight to Portugal. It is difficult to wait for the U17 chance, not everyone will have that opportunity, I am also working on opening my academy so I can scout the best talents.<br /><br />It is good to help the players and also make money in the process also, I have about 90 blind kids in Abuja that I pay their school fees in the school of the blinds, we do have their end of the year party every December in Abuja</p>

  <p><b>[Former Golden Eaglets player Kenneth Omeruo reveals why Eaglets stars fade in Europe]</b> I think one of the reasons, is bad decisions, as a young player you have to be ready and know that if you are not playing then the values go down. One thing I have always done is playing, I always wanted to play. It does not matter where, either at the club or going on loan, because if you are not playing, then it’s difficult for the national team to invite you base on fitness level</p>
