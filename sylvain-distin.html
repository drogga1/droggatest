  <p><b>[Sylvain Distin says <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> hasn’t clicked &amp; <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> won’t make him better]</b> I’m not sure if he has got that defensive grit. He is an amazing player with the ball, really confident with the ball but that is possibly the modern centre-back. As a modern centre-back, yes he is amazing. Did he fulfil his potential? No. He still has a lot to learn and he has to be a lot more consistent. Can he fit in every team? I don’t think so either. He is perfect for <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>. Will he be perfect for a team who have to be stronger defensively first and then have less possession? I am not sure he is there yet. Definitely he has all the attributes but I feel like something didn’t click for him yet. He could be much, much better than he is now. When I see that <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> would play a midfielder at centre-back when they have two or three centre-backs, as a centre-back that would hurt me greatly. That’s my job and you take a midfielder to play in my position? That would hurt me. I don’t know if he doesn’t have the confidence of the manager or if it’s something else but something needs to click with him.<br /><br />We had a very similar manager <b>[at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>]</b> as he has at City now, a manager that likes to play from the back, no matter what. That means if you make a costly mistake because he is being too confident or trying to force the play from the back he had a manager who said ‘never mind, you did the right stuff, carry on’. If you make a mistake and your manager says ‘it’s fine, don’t worry’ and the next game or two, three games after you make a similar type of mistake and your manager says ‘no, this is what I want to do, you carry on, I don’t care’ you get into a pattern where mentally you feel ‘it’s ok I can make a mistake. That’s what my manager wants’. Some will feel that’s brave, but some people will think I don’t know if it’s brave or stupidity. When you’re at a place like City it’s ok because they have so much quality but at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> that would cost us so it’s difficult. I know he reacted well every time but I’m a bit scared that because of the last two managers he has had that put him in that pattern of ‘it’s ok to make a mistake don’t worry’. With the team and manager they have now he is the perfect player. No disrespect to him, he is a top manager, but will <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> make him a better defender? I can’t see it. He will make him a better player coming out from the back with the ball but a better defender? I don’t see it happening</p>

  <p><b>[Sylvain Distin says having a black manager could have benefited his playing career]</b> Yeah, definitely. I think what you want, and that starts not only as an adult but as a kid first, you want heroes. You want to recognise yourself in someone. I had that with players. There are a very important number of black people who play football, but then when it comes to managers you look around and you try to recognise yourself in someone and you don’t<br /><br />I know it’s really difficult. It seems the obvious second career. When you stop football, everybody thinks you’re going to be a manager. But I’ve played in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> all my career, I don’t see myself being in a very low league. And then you have to look around and look for examples, players that retired in the past few years, and what they do, what level they started, and you realise that through your career, you never had any black managers.<br /><br />And you realise that when you look around, you even have friends who tried and it’s proven difficult. The reason why - I have no idea, but I was in the mindset where I just didn’t want to fight for it. I just didn’t want to fight to prove that I belong here. You just want to have the same chance as everyone and I just felt at the time that it wasn’t the case</p>
