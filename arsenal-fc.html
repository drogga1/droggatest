  <p><b>[Arsenal Supporters’ Trust (AST) has taken aim at the club’s hierarchy in the wake of <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>’s sacking]</b> Arsenal need more change than just a new head coach. The dismissal of <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> was unfortunate but inevitable. Performances and results have been far below what is expected at Arsenal. But Emery’s departure is the easy part. The more difficult challenge is to recruit a suitable successor. We are far from certain that Arsenal has the right personnel to lead this process.<br /><br />The AST has long been advocating that the most important changes needed at Arsenal are in the boardroom where Arsenal need better governance. It is a sad fact that the club is now wholly owned by an overseas investment vehicle, Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, who are largely absent from London. This means that the club needs to be governed by a strong board in London, one that is truly independent and has the expertise and dynamism to drive a football club forward.<br /><br />Arsenal’s board currently has no one with football expertise. Its three ‘independent’ members are 85, 79 and 77 years old. None of them have football experience nor reflect the diversity of Arsenal’s playing squads nor supporter base. A strong board would be able to hold the club’s executive to account and to provide them with counsel.<br /><br />Arsenal also need to build better relationships with their supporters especially at the ownership/boardroom level. New appointments to the board should include looking for people with the skillset to ensure better dialogue with supporters and provide a sense of purpose and direction. So if Arsenal are to genuinely move forward from today it requires not only a new head coach appointment but also a rejuvenation of the boardroom</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal provide reassuring update on <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> coronavirus situation]</b> You can imagine that as this fast-moving situation has developed, we have been taking extensive steps to ensure we keep operating efficiently while protecting our players and staff. Our training centres in London Colney and Hale End were closed for deep cleaning after Mikel’s diagnosis with the virus but have now re-opened with a small workforce to maintain the facilities and training pitches.<br /><br />A number of staff, including Mikel and the men’s first team squad, are currently isolating at home. We’re pleased to say that Mikel is feeling much better. He’s in good spirits, doing detailed planning with the coaches and speaking to the players regularly.<br /><br />The women’s and academy teams are also currently staying at home. All our players are looking forward to getting back out on the training pitches as soon as the situation allows. The players have been given specific training and dietary regimes to follow at home and are in daily contact with our coaches and support staff. As you will have seen from social media some of them are certainly embracing this changed new world<br /><br /><b>[Reacting to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>’s announcement that the resumption of England’s top flight would be further delayed, until at least April 30, the statement continued]</b> You will have seen Thursday’s announcement that the 2019-20 season will be extended indefinitely, and that the professional game is further postponed in England until at least April 30, 2020. We are fully supportive of this decision which was endorsed at Thursday morning’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> shareholder meeting. Of course, we all want to be back playing football as soon as we possibly can, but only when it is safe to be doing so</p>

Over the past 10 days we have been in discussions with them around the potential financial challenges ahead, and how we are planning for those now. These are productive and ongoing conversations around how our players might support their club in an appropriate way. We have not and will not make any comment on this matter until these private discussions have concluded<br /><br />Our owners, Kroenke, Sports &amp; Entertainment, are fully committed to supporting Arsenal through this challenging time. We are also carefully controlling our costs. We have stopped most capital spend, and our discretionary operating expenditure is being strictly controlled. Earlier this month, our executive team volunteered to waive more than a third of their earnings over the next 12 months<br /><br />All our employees are receiving their full salaries and we plan to continue this. We are not currently intending to use the government’s furlough scheme. In addition to our employees, we are extending our commitment to pay casual workers on our payroll from the end of April to the end of May. For our matchday casual workers this means they will be paid for all four <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> games that have been postponed and will be paid again should they work at these games once re-arranged</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal players and coaches agree 12.5 per cent pay cut to help club through coronavirus crisis]</b> The move follows positive and constructive discussions. In these conversations there has been a clear appreciation of the gravity of the current situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and a strong desire for players and staff to show their backing for the Arsenal family. Reductions of total annual earnings by 12.5 per cent will come into effect this month, with the contractual paperwork being completed in the coming days. If we meet specific targets in the seasons ahead, primarily linked to success on the pitch, the club will repay agreed amounts. We will be able to make those repayments as hitting these targets, which the players can directly influence, will mean our financial position will be stronger. The agreement is based on the assumption we will finish the season 2019-20 and receive the full broadcasting revenues. The resulting savings will help cover some of the financial risks we have this season in relation to our matchday and commercial income. We are proud and grateful to our players and staff for pulling together to support our club, our people and our community in these unprecedented times which are some of the most challenging we have faced in our history.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal could be set for a loss of approximately £144 million ($178m) for the year 2020-21 if all games next season are staged behind closed doors. In summarising its findings, the AST said]</b> Covid-19 is likely to take Arsenal from a situation where they would have reported a small profit of £4m for this current season to one of recording a loss of £19m. If behind closed doors (BCD) becomes an issue that affects all of next season then the club could face reporting losses of £144m. So we can see that the reduction in income from playing BCD for the rest of the season will knock £23m ($26m) from available cash at the end of the season as will the absence of season ticket renewals. The combined impact will leave little spare cash this summer, especially if sponsors withhold part of their advance payments for season 2020-21. Arsenal’s available cash reserves heading into the summer of 2020-21 could be wiped out and a new borrowing requirement of over £50m ($62m) being required by the end of July if the club is to meet its commitments to pay other clubs instalments due on player transfers and finance wages in June and July. So we certainly don’t predict a big spending transfer window! Whilst the money set aside as security for the bondholders, who have lent the remaining £170m ($210m) of stadium related debt, cannot be touched, it is almost inevitable that Arsenal will be drawing on its short term £50m ($62m) loan facility made available by Barclays</p>

These unprecedented times have changed so much in all of our lives and although the UK government strategy means that we now intend to complete the 2019-20 season respecting new parameters, we are disappointed at the prospect of fans not being at matches in the near future. Like everyone, we look forward to the day when we are all able to safely return to matches. As previously stated, supporters will be entitled to a credit or refund for any match tickets or hospitality they have already purchased for future behind-closed-doors matches in the 2019/20 season. Whether as part of a season ticket or for an individual match, supporters will be offered a credit for next season or a refund. This behind-closed-doors credit will be in addition to the two unused cup credits already due to general admission season ticket holders. The process to credit/refund supporters who have purchased match tickets and or hospitality for these fixtures will begin immediately.
