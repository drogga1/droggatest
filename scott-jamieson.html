  <p><b>[Scott Jamieson has enough experience of the vagaries of football to not get hung up on predictions that his club IFK Gothenburg will struggle in 2017]</b> For the large part of the pre-season, we didn’t have too many new faces for whatever reason and we’ve brought in two in the last two weeks or so. So it’s good to have new faces, you know, freshen things up and bring their quality to the team. From the outside, we’ve kind of been written off in regards to this season and how we’ll go and a lot of other teams have spent a lot of big money and we haven’t.<br /><br />I had one year at Sydney FC after they won the <b>[2010 A-League]</b> grand final and they tipped us to go back-to-back and we didn’t win a game in the first nine or 10 games or something. I think it’s not just the media. As players, there have been campaigns where I’ve been at a team that’s had a very successful pre-season and struggled. Once the games start, that’s when we’ll know and that’s the best way to answer critics is by performing on the Saturday<br /><br />It was frustrating. We played well enough to win the game <b>[against Norrkoping]</b> but we were just on the wrong end of the <b>[2-1]</b> scoreline, so it’s a disappointing to not have a chance at silverware but it’s funny because we’re still a chance of making Europe if Norrkoping win because they finished in the automatic European spots in the league last year</p>

  <p><b>[The FM simulator filling football-shaped void for players, coaches, fans]</b> That was my childhood. My football knowledge at a younger age … I knew a lot of players around the world, and not the mainstream players, because of Football Manager<br /><br />I had Britt Assombalonga before he blew up. I took Peterborough to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and I had him scoring goals for me <b>[all the way]</b>. That’s been my biggest feat. With a very volatile chairman like Barry Fry, it’s tough. The meetings I had with him for player recruitment…<br /><br /><b>[Jamieson’s just taken over French club <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a>]</b> I need to try and topple <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. The American owners of <a href="marseille.html">Marseille</a> have a bit of money behind them so it should be alright. Being around the house and getting out of the missus’ hair, it’s just whether she’ll accept the four, five hours on it rather than one or two. I’ll say it’s for work</p>
