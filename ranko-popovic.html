  <p><b>[Thailand’s Buriram United FC were crowned champions of the Toyota Mekong Club Championship 2016 tournament]</b> Our victory today is because we played as a team. The first game didn’t go well, but that is what made our players so eager to do their best for the final match. Starting from the kick-off to the final whistle, we were playing strong. I told my team that we have to score at least one goal so that way we can start to set the pace. Everyone responded well to the strategy, and played a great game. I wish the best for Lanexang, that they continue to build their impressive record. I hope they have even more success in the next season where, hopefully, we can meet again</p>

  <p><b>[FC Pune City squandered a golden opportunity to qualify for the Indian Super League <b>[ISL]</b> playoffs when they drew 1-1 away to Bengaluru FC on Friday]</b> I think we were closer to the win and we deserved to win the game. We were organised, they did not have any big chances before the goal and we had some situations which could have easily gone in our favour.<br /><br />If we take the big part of the game, I think we were closer to winning it and this was necessary for us to make history. But we are going on a good way and I hope we will very soon do what everyone is expecting from us<br /><br />We lost one chance today <b>[to make the playoffs]</b>. Had we won today, we would have practically been in the semi-finals. But, this is good for football, and also for us. We have to challenge and we have a couple of days before the game, and like all the games, we will try to get three points from that<br /><br /><b>[Popovic also went on to provide an understanding view of the referee’s decisions in the game]</b> This is one of the most talented Indian referee. I know he tried to keep the balance between the two teams. We tried from our side to help him because he is still young and is one of the most promising for Indian football. Tonight, I was not satisfied with some of his decisions, but I respect the referees, and I know he will learn and be a good referee in future</p>
