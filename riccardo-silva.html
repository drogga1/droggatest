<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Miami FC owner Riccardo Silva has issued a response after their two-and-a-half-year long lawsuit calling for promotion and relegation in American soccer failed]</b> Two and a half years after the filing of this case, <a href="cas.html">the CAS</a> arbitral tribunal has finally rendered its decision. The CAS panel found that the wording of Article 9 of the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Regulations could arguably lead one to believe that the rule is universally applicable, and that the system implemented in the United States is not compliant with Article 9<br /><br />However, the tribunal ruled that <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> has considerable discretion and deference when it comes to the interpretation of its statutes, and concluded that <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> didn’t intend for the rule to apply to US soccer<br /><br />We are proud to have raised an issue which has been affecting soccer in the USA for many years. We respect <a href="cas.html">the CAS</a> ruling, but we still believe that an open, merit-based system would bring major benefits to the quality of the game, and would create inclusive, competitive and non-discriminatory soccer in the USA</p>
