  <p><b>[Danielle van de Donk is confident that the Netherlands can shock the United States in Sunday’s Women’s World Cup final]</b> I don’t think she’s going to score against us. I think <b>[the underdog role]</b> is the best role you can be in. I like it. I’ve always been the underdog. I think I got used to it. I think they… I don’t know the English word, but I don’t think they think we’re that good.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if she may be looking for the word underestimate]</b> Yes, thanks. I think that is going to be an advantage for us. If they do <b>[underestimate us]</b>, they do, and we’ll show them wrong<br /><br />We’re going to prove ourselves and show them what we’ve got. We might surprise them. I think they have got things to improve as well. We don’t need to look at ourselves all the time. We just need to look at our strengths and go from there - don’t want to look at the negatives. I think that’s how we approach the game. We didn’t really have the easy way as we got here through the play-offs and everything, so it wasn’t like we qualified straight away.<br /><br />We came here the hard way and we proved that we can play football and that we are good and that we are European champions, not just anyone. I’m very proud of the team, I’m very proud of the Netherlands and I think we came this far as well because we have such amazing support all the time. You are in the final so it’s everything or nothing. We’re going to be proud anyway, so we’ll give it our best try and everything we’ve got. Whatever the result is going to be, it’s going to be amazing for us<br /><br /><b>[As for the potential feeling of being a world champion?]</b> That’s going to be amazing! That’s my aim. That’s my goal</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal midfielder Danielle van de Donk was delighted with her match-winning contribution on Monday night]</b> You know what? They did all the work and I took the glory so it can’t be any better. To be fair I felt like it was coming. We had a lot of chances and I think it came after three shots on goal, Viv <b>[Miedema]</b> hit the post and I was like: ‘Come on guys, please put it in the goal!’. Happily, it fell at my feet and it went in. It was a bit bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, in, so it was a bit lucky as well. It’s nice to have an impact when you come on. I felt like I gave the team more energy. I watched <b>[United]</b> play against <b>[Manchester]</b> City <b>[last week]</b>. I thought they played amazing then, in the first half, and then they got a bit tired so there were a few gaps. We analysed it and I think we did well today. One of our baselines is action-reaction and I think that was not that great and I think that was a bit of tiredness in the team, but we won so it doesn’t really matter<br /><br /><b>[But the 28-year-old was happy to be given a break]</b> You always need to be on your A game but sometimes you need rest. You benefit from it, but sometimes it’s hard mentally. I felt fine coming off the bench, but I don’t know how I would have felt playing 90 minutes. I could see the girls were getting a bit tired and sloppy sometimes</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal’s Danielle van de Donk says she’s never scared when teams are keeping the Gunners at bay – as she always knows a goal is on its way]</b> I don’t know what it is, but I stay relaxed and chilled, I don’t really get scared anymore I just know it’s going to come. We’ve just got so many people on the pitch that can score goals so I feel comfortable. That sounded arrogant, I didn’t mean to sound arrogant<br /><br /><b>[Dutch international usually a midfielder but currently playing on the right of the front three]</b> It’s not my favourite role, but that’s what’s asked of me for the team and I am doing the job. It’s still not a bad role at all to be fair, it could be a lot worse! I’m scoring some goals from there this season which makes everything better.
<br />&lt;brIt was a bit of a surprise to be fair. But we do practice to play against every system. I must say they are doing very well. I really like how they play and I think they got their tactics right today. It was obvious that they were very hungry to get points against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I actually like the growth of <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. I really like the team, I think they’ve got a very special team and I am just happy to see that the level is getting higher and higher. It makes the derby even better and it just makes the league a bit better as well. I do know a couple of the girls and I’m glad to see that they’re doing so well, but not well enough against us<br /><br /><b>[Van de Donk acknowledged as much, but was just happy to leave victorious]</b> We just wanted three points and a clean sheet and we did it, but we know it wasn’t our best game today. We had to work on how much pressure we were putting them under <b>[in the first half]</b>, <a href="joe-montemurro.html">Montemurro</a> had a lot of things to say <b>[at half time]</b>. He knew we weren’t quite doing enough that we were being a bit sloppy. He told us to forget about it though, that we had another 45 minutes to get the goal and once Kim got the goal it all became a bit easier for us</p>
