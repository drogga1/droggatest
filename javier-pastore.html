  <p><b>[Reports suggest the Brazilian will be heading back to <a href="psg.html">Parc des Princes</a> following his recent departure from a role at <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a>]</b> He’s a super-intelligent guy, who speaks countless languages. Because of that, he can handle the arrival of any player in the squad.<br /><br />He did just that at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, he changed a club, a team, in such a short time and made them very strong. I talked a lot with him and these discussions helped me when I wasn’t feeling good. He’s present at any time and in any situation<br /><br /><b>[Considering the nature of his exit from <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, there could be some hesitation over the re-appointment of the Brazilian, but Pastore has no doubt this would be a great move for his former side]</b> Of course it’s a good idea. Leo knows France very well and that’s an important point: he was the first to come to the club at a crucial time, he was the one who managed everything with Nasser <b>[Al-Khelaifi, <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> president]</b>. <br /><br />They know each other very well and understand what the club needs to progress and make a big step in Europe. Leo has a lot of talent. This would be an excellent opportunity and a turning point for <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>.<br /><br />If he comes, he will do great things, and I especially hope that he will be able to accomplish this important aim in Europe, which would be a fantastic thing for all <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> fans</p>

  <p><b>[The latest course of controversy surrounding <a href="nasser-al-khelaifi.html">Al-Khelaifi</a> comes as a result of reports suggesting he paid two million euros to Javier Pastore’s agent in order to bring the player to the Parc des Princes]</b> It is evident that this document was false. Now that it is public, it’s clear that the document is false and hasn’t been published, written or signed by <a href="nasser-al-khelaifi.html">Al-Khelaifi</a>. Our client will file a complaint against the media for the use of false documentation</p>

  <p><b>[Roma midfielder Javier Pastore believes it will be impossible to finish the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> season as coronavirus ravages Italy]</b> We’ll see if we play again from this season or the next. To be honest, I think it’ll be impossible to finish the season, as we need at least 20-30 days of training to be ready. All the clubs will lose money, but I think it’s pretty much impossible to resume where we left off. It would mean ending later and later, so having to move the start of the next campaign. But we can’t do that, because next summer there’s the Euros, the Copa America, etc<br /><br />We can’t train together, but the club has given each player the necessary gym equipment to train at home. We wake up in the morning, weigh ourselves and send the staff all the necessary details, including the time we spent training and the exercises we did. We have to try to maintain muscle tone<br /><br />There will be chaos in Argentina, because people are going to rush to panic-buy and companies will try to make the most of the situation, which doesn’t happen in Italy. Don’t believe the false stories that come out, the truth is this is an illness that is not just dangerous for the elderly. We’ve been dealing with this virus for a month and the problem didn’t seem that important at first, but after two weeks, it was chaos. Only supermarkets and pharmacies are open, there are many checks on the street to ensure people aren’t going out</p>
