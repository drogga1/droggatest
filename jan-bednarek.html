<blockquote>
  <p>[Southampton defender Jan Bednarek has hailed one of his predecessors at the club, Virgil van Dijk] He is, at the moment, the best centre-back in the world. He’s really good in the air, really quick, really good with the ball so I think he deserves this position. He is a top player and watching him improves your game as well. At the moment, when I started to play in this position I watched [Giorgio] Chiellini, I watched [Sergio] Ramos and now it is Van Dijk.<br /><br />Of course, they fight for the title but the main thing is winning three points. We are going to fight for that. The main thing is to be brave. To do our best and we will find out after the game what will happen<br /><br />We are playing better as a team, and it is obvious that if we are playing better the atmosphere is going to be better. The fans can also see that we are getting better and better. They can see if they push us forward we are going to do better. It is good. We need to keep going as a team and it will be even better</p>
