  <p><b>[Joao Moutinho poised for breakout rookie season with LAFC]</b> You can just see how technical a player he is. Whether it’s in 5v2s or juggling circles, you can just see the comfort he has on the ball, and his touch is great. Any time you have a good touch and good technique, you’re going to be able to make things happen on the field. Certainly, this preseason as he’s adjusting to MLS level, and a couple of different things tactically, he’s able to do well because of his great technique<br /><br />The thing with rookies is you never really know until you get to the summer and they’ve gotten a run of games under their belt. Because it’s a whole other beast when you’re playing real games, and playing for points, and getting into a rhythm of playing week in and week out. He’s certainly done well in preseason and I think he’s a great addition to our back line</p>

  <p><b>[Whether <a href="gregg-berhalter.html">Gregg Berhalter</a> makes wholesale changes, stands pat, or finds a middle ground, he and the USMNT head into the group finale with plenty of options]</b> This is a team that, from the beginning I think we’ve all bought into this idea of we’re a collective, we’re a team, we’re a unit, and no matter who’s playing, who’s on the bench, we’re all rooting for one another. We’re all helping each other in any way that we can and so it’s everyone’s job to be ready from the first minute whether they’re starting or not.<br /><br />So far the mentality has been great. In training and games the guys who have come in off the bench, guys who have started, guys who haven’t gotten a chance yet, the mentality has been phenomenal and it’s going to take that same committed effort and mentality to move along in this thing</p>

  <p><b>[LAFC vs New York Red Bulls. Walker Zimmerman said when as to explain the high level of the team]</b> Concentration has been high. I think guys are realizing what we’re doing doesn’t happen every year. What we’re doing is special and I think guys notice that. And that kind of helps in our preparation because every game still matters. We’re chasing trophies, we’re chasing records in points and wins. It presents a challenge each and every game. And it helps guys get motivated every game</p>

  <p><b>[Defiant in defeat, Nashville SC built to survive pitfalls that plagued <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> expansion predecessors]</b> It’s not the result we wanted but you can tell that there’s a lot of fight in this team and we’re going to be pretty successful this year. Not the result we wanted but I’m really proud of the effort against a good Atlanta side. We showed what we can do</p>
