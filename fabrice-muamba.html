  <p><b>[Fabrice Muamba speaks about his heart attack on the pitch]</b> I am walking proof of the power of prayer. But I’m very much alive and sitting here talking now. Someone up there was watching over me. On the morning of the game I prayed with my father and asked God to protect me - and he didn’t let me down.<br /><br /><b>[Fabrice,24, ‘died’ after ­collapsing as millions watched the match on TV. He spent 40 days in hospital]</b> I could see <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> players running around in the distance and saw two Scott Parkers then two Luca Modrics. That was when I realised something was seriously wrong</p>

  <p><b>[Former Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba returned to the pitch for a charity match four years after suffering cardiac arrest]</b> I really enjoyed it, I lasted longer than I thought I would. To be able to put some smiles on the Bolton fans’ faces was great. The Bolton fans are always special to me, regardless of whether I’m here or not. It’s a town that means so much to me</p>

  <p><b>[Fabrice Muamba, who suffered a cardiac arrest during a match and survived, shares his thoughts on <a href="ugo-ehiogu.html">Ehiogu</a>’s passing]</b> Yesterday I lost my friend Germaine Mason. This morning <a href="ugo-ehiogu.html">Ugo Ehiogu</a> passed through heart attack. Cherish life it’s promised to no one</p>

  <p><b>[Fabrice Muamba feared the worst when he saw <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea City</a> striker Bafetimbi Gomis collapse at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart</a> Lane]</b> I am sure he will not be allowed to play for a couple of weeks or even a couple of months. I am 100 per cent sure he’ll see a specialist. He will probably see three specialists and two of them need to give him the all-clear before he can play again. It’s very different to what happened to me. Bafetimbi Gomis has a history of medical issues. I did not have a history, so it was a real surprise when it happened to me.</p>
