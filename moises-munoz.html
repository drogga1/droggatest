  <p><b>[On Carlos Darwin Quintero]</b> Quintero has showed that he’s in good form, that he has a lot of desire. That’s something that has helped us a lot, it’s spread through the team and this makes us calm, having players with a lot of experience.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico goalkeeper Moises Munoz got his first start of the Gold Cup on Thursday but feels like he’s still yet to face any sort of threat]</b> They didn’t cause us any problems at all. I sweated more in the warm-ups than in the 90 minutes of the game. There was no issue in front of our goal, especially because they didn’t come to play. They only came to defend by parking the bus. They stayed back. It’s sad to find ourselves in games like this, but that’s our confederation. We’ve got to know the way we should play to break up these kinds of tactics.<br /><br />What happened today, Curacao might try to emulate. We’ve got to work in the days before then to try and find ways to open up these defense that Curacao could play. We definitely have to get a goal because we want to advance as the first-place team<br /><br /><b>[Munoz was left to feel like he was among the paying fans at Sports Authority Field as he watched his teammates try and fail to break through the Jamaica back line]</b> It’s really a desperate situation just to be there watching the game. I was one more fan in the stadium, practically, the whole 90 minutes just watching my teammates try to score, trying to do something about the Jamaican defense. They just came here to do that and they got away with it. They tried to just defend the whole 90 minutes, they did exactly that. We’re a little bit frustrated because we couldn’t get the score that would’ve let us have a lot more space in the game</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico fans still want Osorio gone]</b> Definitely. I think it would be negative and counterproductive to get rid of the manager. The responsibility is of all of us, not just the manager. The most prudent thing to do for continuity’s sake would be to continue the process <b>[with Osorio]</b> until the World Cup, and we’re very close to achieving that goal.</p>

  <p><b>[Recent retirees Moises Munoz adjusting to life after playing careers]</b> I’m really glad to be here. It’s different because I’m not going to be the one playing this time, but taking part in this event my hands are going to be choosing the teams facing each other in the next Concacaf Champions League. I’m happy to be here and anxious to see what the matches are going to be.</p>
