  <p><b>[FC Dallas forward Fafa Picault has spoken openly about the racism he was forced to endure during his time on the books at <a href="cagliari-fc.html">Cagliari</a>]</b> You have different forms of racism. I’ve dealt with it differently in different locker rooms and in stadiums. When I moved to Italy I was about 16 and I moved up to the first team around 17 years old. I was split between what a lot of young players do where you train with the first team and go back and play reserve games with the reserve team.<br /><br />Our coach at the time with the reserve team was probably one of the worst people I’ve met. Daily, I had to deal with him calling me a monkey or telling me I need to go back to the jungle in Africa, black players don’t have technique, you’re just fast, go run, we brought you here to run<br /><br />He didn’t bring me, the president brought me, but he said that’s what I was brought for. When we would train he would just say anything that was nasty. If I told a younger guy to do something he would say: ‘No, you have to do it because you’re black’. I would have monkey stickers posted in my locker at times and I was getting in fist fights maybe twice a week. I was managing that with AP classes back home that I was finishing online and also still have to perform on the soccer field - which was probably the easiest part. The easiest part was the soccer at the time</p>
