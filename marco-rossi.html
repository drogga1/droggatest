  <p><b>[Hungary head coach Marco Rossi has compared new Manchester United signing Daniel James to Usain Bolt and former Brazil striker Ronaldo]</b> James’s speed reminds me of Usain Bolt - to be so fast like him is really incredible. In the last years I don’t remember one player that gave me this sensation. His acceleration is so peculiar, which is why Manchester United have bought him.<br /><br />In the past I played against a very fast player who, for me, was the best after <b>[Diego]</b> Maradona - Ronaldo. He was just not known for speed, but for everything. His acceleration looked like James, though at the moment the skills are a little bit different</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United winger <a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a> has been likened to World Cup winner <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> by Hungary manager Marco Rossi, with the Wales international considered to be of the same motorbike mould]</b> James is a player that is playing with a motorbike because he is really fast. I have never seen someone in the last period as fast as him, maybe <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>. He’s unbelievable. If we leave him space to run he could be dangerous. This could be the key, but we work a lot on the defensive line and will try to give confidence to our players<br /><br /><b>[Rossi’s side know that a draw will be good enough for them if Slovakia fail to overcome Azerbaijan]</b> We are trying to get the three points, I would never like to draw and give Slovakia the chance to go through to the Euros. This is what I would want to avoid. This is not so diplomatic what I am saying, but it is the truth. We will do all our best in order to win, Wales will do the same, and I don’t think this match could finish in a draw. I could not bet one pound on the draw. I will ask of my players, if they <b>[Wales]</b> are dragons, to be lions - and then we will see who will win</p>
