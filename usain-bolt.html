  <p><b>[Usain Bolt on Gareth Bale]</b> I think Gareth is probably the fastest player in the world at the moment, but I will help him with his sprinting if he wants. It is not just about how fast you can accelerate, but also when you have the football at your feet, about balance while you are sprinting as well. I helped <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> with his sprinting in a training session and look what he has go on to achieve since then. I have a lot of respect for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and if they and Gareth want my help, I am happy to fly in and take a private training session with Gareth.

Even if it’s just for five games or one game, it would be a dream come true because, as I’ve said, I’m a massive fan. This is a start and I’m really appreciative of everything the Mariners have done. They’ve given me an opportunity to make my mark, to start here, and I’m very happy and I want to thank you guys for that. I look forward to scoring as many goals and to bringing home the trophy</p>

  <p><b>[Usain Bolt says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should be building their team around Paul Pogba, rather than letting him leave]</b> Pogba is a friend of mine and I am a massive fan of his and I think they need to build a team around him. When you watch him at Juventus and when he plays for France, he is outstanding because he has good strikers and people to play and run off the ball which he needs as a great passer. It doesn’t matter how somebody cuts his hair, as long as he comes on the field, he shows up. If you build the team around him and give him strikers who understand how he plays then he is going to do great.<br /><br /><b>[Bolt would welcome his arrival, believing that <a href="antoine-griezmann.html">Griezmann</a> and Pogba could be the recipe for success that <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> requires]</b> Listen, it’s all over the place. It would be a proper signing because him and Pogba play very well together, play for the same country. You never know. People will say whatever. Until it happens, I won’t get my hopes up. We just have to wait. We signed Daniel James. I don’t know how to look at that. He is quick. We have to watch and see how the rest of the season turns out<br /><br /><b>[Bolt is happy to see the defensive football of the <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> era gone from United]</b> Watching <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> from the <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Fergie</a> <b>[<a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>]</b> days we were always an attacking team, no matter what was going on. Even if we didn’t put a good side out, they were always attacking. For us to be a defensive team was never going to work. For me, I wouldn’t say I am happy that he left, but I am happy with the style of football we are playing now<br /><br /><b>[On next season]</b> It depends on who we sign this summer. I think we did okay last season but everyone got injured and even when they came back it was downhill from there. I think this year we can be in better shape, with a few new players, we should be fine. We need to be patient and believe, believe is our motto, so we just have to believe</p>
