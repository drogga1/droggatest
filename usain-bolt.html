Sometimes every player will drop off form but he knows the level he needs to get back to and I think in time he will. So, I’m sure they’ll pick him for the World Cup because he’s one of the best and he scored the winning goal so there’s no way I think you should leave a player at that level out of the team<br /><br />They wanted to but I thought it was too cold. I didn’t want to go full out sprinting because it was cold and I’m not used to this type of cold yet. We sat, we talked, made jokes, they asked me questions and I asked them questions. It was good. It was good. I learned a few things. I think I improved a little bit. I was happy that the footballers welcomed me. It was a good time. They invited me back to train for longer, to try to improve even more and to see what level I’m at so they can assess me and tell me ‘this is the level you can play at’ so I’m working on it</p>

  <p><b>[When asked which three players would make ideal team-mates in a relay race]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a> and <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>. <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> is a great player. He has speed, skill and can finish. He is still young but could play in any team in the world. There are a lot of exciting young players - <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>, <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a>. It will be interesting to see how the former <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> players Mattthijs <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">de Ligt</a> and <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a> do at their new clubs, as well as <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a> at Real. I am friends with <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a>, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> and Leon Bailey and hope they can keep playing well<br /><br />Raheem is really, really good. Working with Pep has developed his game even further. I think he is hitting peak form now and he is still only 24 years old. The only problem is that he wears Manchester blue, not red!<br /><br /><b>[The 33-year-old was also asked to pick a favourite between <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> star <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and fellow five-time Ballon d’Or winner <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>]</b> Both of them! I hear a lot of people have this debate but both of them are footballing geniuses. I have always been a big <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> fan and I admire the way he has been successful in different leagues - England, Spain and now Italy</p>

  <p><b>[Usain Bolt shares his thoughts on The Best <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Men’s Player finalists]</b> All three are wonderful players. I think <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> have won this award five times each. <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> just won the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Award and based on the success of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> last season it may be his turn. As a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> fan, I would probably vote for <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>!</p>
