  <p><b>[Former <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> forward Garth Crooks says <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> was Bobby Moore-esque against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>]</b> What a ball for <a href="diego-costa.html">Diego Costa</a> to score. I don’t know what was better, Costa’s movement in order to offer the invitation for <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> to attempt the 40-yard wonder ball or the sheer audacity and precision of the pass. I suppose the movement combined with the chest trap made it for me. The last time I saw a centre-back put a centre forward in on goal so well or so deliberately was Bobby Moore in the World Cup final in 1966. It was just masterful. As a former player I saw defenders try something like that but seldom did it work. I even played with defenders who would not have given a moment’s thought to attempting such an adventurous manoeuvre for fear of ridicule. That was left to the midfield players - providing you had one that could pass, of course. It’s great to see world-class defenders producing world-class moments.</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> striker Garth Crooks says <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> expressing interest in <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> at some stage in the future would be no surprise]</b> There is something of <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Robert Lewandowski</a> about Kane and I wouldn’t be in the least bit surprised if <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> were interested in the England captain replacing their scoring legend at some stage. Fortunately, I don’t think they have the cash<br /><br />I was furious when <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a> played <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> in the Champions League final but I understood why he did it. Leave your best player out of the biggest game in your club’s history and you can kiss goodbye to that relationship. <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> was clearly investing in something further down the line and payback started against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>. I can’t remember when I have seen two more beautifully-placed goals so gracefully stroked past a goalkeeper<br /><br />So what do <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> have here? I’ve seen <a href="moussa-dembele.html">Moussa Dembele</a>, <a href="eric-dier.html">Eric Dier</a> and <a href="victor-wanyama.html">Victor Wanyama</a> make promising starts at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart Lane</a> but none of them started like <a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Tanguy Ndombele</a>. <a href="tanguy-ndombele.html">Tanguy Ndombele</a>’s debut goal that put <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> back in the game against <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> was glorious. I’ve seen better performances but seldom have I seen better finishes on a debut. I’m told that <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s record signing has much more to offer which is just as well. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have had some wonderful midfielders over the years and he’s got some big shoes to fill.</p>

  <p><b>[Garth Crooks says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> should consider retiring from football permanently if he fails to land major silverware at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> He’s poked a fellow coach in the eye, and argued and pushed others on the touchline, but promises not to make the same mistakes in the future. I’m not entirely sure I believe him. What is clear is that <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> is on a massive charm offensive. How long he can hold it together is anyone’s guess. The new <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> manager has been handed one of the best squads in the country, the best stadium in the world and one of the best academies in the game - and that is all accompanied by state-of-the-art training facilities. If <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> can’t win trophies at this club, he should consider retiring from football permanently. Let’s face it, that’s why he’s been hired - to win trophies. He can be rude and truculent. However, what he can do is win silverware<br /><br />I have been one of <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s biggest critics over the past two years but <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> are a very different club to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and this relationship might work. The moment you start hearing <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> fans chanting <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s name, you’ll know it is</p>
