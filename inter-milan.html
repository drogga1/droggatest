The two clubs are evaluating a number of possible options, including the redevelopment of the Stadio San Siro. A collaborative group has already restarted the analysis of different alternatives.</p>

  <p><b>[Death of Inter fan confirmed following ultras clash ahead of Napoli game. Milan police chief Marcello Cardona told reporters at a press conference held on Thursday]</b> The clashes broke out abruptly. These ultras hit the coaches carrying Napoli fans with bars and sticks. There was an effort to flee and in the opposite lane, some cars passed by and an ultra from Inter, who had a stadium ban, was hit by an SUV. We still do not know who was driving and where they came from. Four Neapolitans were wounded slightly, one with a cut and then three with bruises. At this moment we have arrested two Inter ultras and are looking for another. We have identified three from the images and we do not rule out further arrests as what happened is very serious. I want to prohibit away followings for Inter until the end of the season and seek the immediate closure of the Inter Curva until March 31.</p>

The Nord believes Icardi has shown that he doesn’t possess the necessary character, not just for the captain’s armband but also for a united dressing room…Therefore, the Nord’s position is that Icardi is no longer part of Inter and, from now on, will be treated accordingly. At Genoa let’s all stick together to build a future together and carry in our hearts the only thing that counts… Inter!</p>
