  <p><b>[Mexico’s Gold Cup attack looking for rhythm with Alan Pulido a potential help]</b> Having top forwards is fundamental in football. Alan is an experienced player, a payer who practically is very close to Javier, Raul, Oribe Peralta. He could’ve been at the Confederations Cup, but having four No. 9s would be difficult. This is the cup for him. We’ve had him in a lot of friendly games.<br /><br />He’s really hoping that he can give us a lot. He’s a player who looks for the ball, who gets into games and can score goals. He’s able to hold up play. And he comes in in really good form in this last tournament, being bicampeon with Chivas, a star for Chivas. That’s what we lacked tonight and we’re going to improve.</p>

  <p><b>[Pompilio Paez said after the team’s first friendly, a 1-0 win over Ghana]</b> Having top forwards is fundamental in football. Alan is an experienced player, a payer who practically is very close to Javier <b>[Hernandez]</b>, Raul <b>[Jimenez]</b>, Oribe Peralta. He could’ve been at the Confederations Cup, but having four No. 9s would be difficult. This is the cup for him. We’ve had him in a lot of friendly games. He’s really hoping that he can give us a lot. He’s a player who looks for the ball, who gets into games and can score goals. He’s able to hold up play. And he comes in in really good form in this last tournament, being bicampeon with Chivas, a star for Chivas. That’s what we lacked <b>[Wednesday]</b> and we’re going to improve.</p>

  <p><b>[On winning]</b> Starting off winning is really important. It gives the group confidence, although we know there are things to correct. It’s easier to correct those things when you’re winning, and especially this time, for example, we got more results on the wings with Elias and <b>[Jesus]</b> Guardado inverted.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico’s lack of playmaker exposed in Gold Cup draw]</b> We lacked effenciy, effectiveness, better ball movement. passes that should’ve been stronger to connect with our wingers. We changed the structure, we inverted our wingers. What we lacked was the ability to break through. We had the ball, we controlled the whole field but we lacked the last 20 meters, in this area of attack to create attacking situations. It’s not easy to do against an opponent that practically is playing with nine men back and just one forward.</p>

  <p><b>[Erick Torres hadn’t represented the senior side since April 2015 but was given a start in the game against Jamaica]</b> We knew Erick. He had a lot of desire to get into the national team. We knew we could make six changes after the group stage and Erick was in a good competitive rhythm. We didn’t put him into the last game because he’d only had two training sessions and we wanted to give him the best situation. Now he understand the style of play with his teammates a lot better.<br /><br />It’s not easy to play as a No. 9, especially with such a set team, however he had a chance and hit the post. It was really tough to find because they closed off spaces really well and we had to play on the wing</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico makes statement vs. Curacao - but not the one El Tri needed]</b> Today’s game, lots of new players, not only you guys <b>[in the press]</b> but also we wanted to know how they’d respond. We can come to conclusions in individual analysis that some of them didn’t have the performances we hoped for, others did. We have a game today where we lost the first three balls, the other team played their game and created some dangerous sitautions before we scored the goal.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico wasn’t surprised that Curacao gave it a challenge Sunday]</b> I said before that this game lacked goals on Curacao’s side. They could’ve converted goals, but that’s why goalkeepers are there.<br /><br /><b>[On Erick Gutierrez]</b> Today he had a good match, it’s an experience and commitment he has to take on. We did a vote between the three players who represent the team and spoke with the coaching staff, and they selected him. Socially, he meets the conditions and we have confidence in him.<br /><br />Today, Corona could’ve been captain because of the experience he has, Jair Pereira who has done it with Chivas and because he’s helped us a lot with leadership</p>

  <p><b>[Was Mexico really a failure at the Gold Cup?]</b> I personally don’t like the word failure. But everyone is entitled to their opinion.<br /><br />This coaching staff was hired with the mission of taking Mexico to the World Cup. We are very close <b>[to qualifying]</b>. In the Confederations Cup we were minutes from defeating the European champions <b>[Portugal]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[Pressure off as Mexico qualifies for 2018 World Cup with win over Panama]</b> We’ve learned a lot from this qualifying process, but football is always in the present. There are eight months to go. That’s an advantage for Mexico, that we’re already thinking about what we’re going to do in the World Cup.<br /><br />This is a new stage. There are three games left, but we have to have the double responsibility of preparing to give the Mexican fans the pleasure of a great World Cup. We’re going to be there and we’re going to, as always, do everything possible as professionals to have a great World Cup</p>
