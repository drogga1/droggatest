Nice were top of the table for a long time and proved we can do it<br /><br />He <b>[Nice coach Lucien Favre]</b> wants players to work on pressing and all that. I don’t like defending, but modern football is like that, you have to work all week to be good at the weekend. The problem with Bastia is that it’s bigger than football. I couldn’t say anything during the match, but afterwards I wanted to use my voice and say something for those who feel they can’t react in these situations. I did it for them. I don’t care what people think. They only see me on the pitch for 90 minutes per week. What you read in the Press is always rubbish. I am not someone who likes to talk a lot, I never lost my head. I have very few friends now, but they are true friends. Every now and then I read ‘Oh Balotelli is going out with this girl’. I mean, who cares?</p>

For the last four years, all the big transfers have been based on crazy figures. Mino wanted to say that some players were bought for that sum, so I’m on roughly the same level as them. Whoever gets me will get a great deal, because my contract with Nice expires in June, so I’ll be a worth zero! But if I were to have a price tag, it’d be the highest it’s ever been, because my goals speak for themselves. I do think I’m in the top 10 in the world. Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi are on a different level to everyone else, but I could be in there with Neymar, Antoine Griezmann and Paulo Dybala. They are only ahead because they’ve won more. Dybala has been in two Champions League finals and I haven’t<br /><br />Chances that I join Napoli? I don’t think so. <b>[Aurelio]</b> De Laurentiis never liked me. Inter? I would go back there because they’re a great club with fantastic fans. I wouldn’t go back to Milan right now. Nothing against the fans, as I am crazy about them, but the club kicked me out in a nasty way, as if I was of no use there and just kind of wandered in. I’d only go back if Adriano Galliani returned, but seeing as Galliani won’t return … I would go to Roma because of the club’s management, the players and the fans. I was close to joining Juventus just one time, when the Bianconeri’s management wanted me, but I said no.</p>

Even if I am Italian, born and raised in Italy, the law states I only became Italian once I reached the age of 18. The law is wrong and that is perhaps why to this day some people see black as the colour of diversity, of inferiority, of an error in the middle of a team photograph. I think that if I had been white, I’d have had fewer problems. Perhaps I did cause some of my own problems and had the wrong attitude at times, but would I have been forgiven quicker? Absolutely yes.<br /><br />Italy is not a racist country, but it does have some racists in it.
