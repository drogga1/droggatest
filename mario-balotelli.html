I was going crazy the last couple of weeks, because I was totally alone. My daughter is in Naples, my son is in Zurich, my mother is of a certain age and needs to be protected, my brothers are in quarantine with their children, so I was left by myself. It was tough. It’s impossible to train properly if you don’t have a running machine, so even though it wasn’t really allowed, I went to the park near me to do a little running<br /><br /><b>[The <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> forward says he is not a very good cook, and his diet has certainly suffered over the last few weeks]</b> The <a href="brescia-fc.html">Brescia</a> forward says he is not a very good cook, and his diet has certainly suffered over the last few weeks.

Being accused of not respecting the rules, by one of our players no less, is shameful slander and those who said it will pay (both in economic and image terms) in the opportune venues, so we can protect the work and sacrifices of this club. Unfortunately, as we all know, the irresponsible behaviour of an individual can create serious risks for everyone involved, so we’ll be forced to enact even more rigid measures to protect the club and its representatives</p>
