  <p><b>[The outspoken Russian, who once infamously complained over City showing disrespect to <a href="yaya-toure.html">Toure</a> because the club did not give him a birthday cake]</b> Pep was successful at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>, but take a look behind that success. The team he took at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> had been built by <b>[his predecessor]</b> Frank Rijkaard and then he was lucky to have <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>. It was <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> who made <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, not Pep. <a href="luis-enrique.html">Luis Enrique</a> has shown that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>’s success was not down to <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>. It was the same in Munich. <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> won the treble before <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> took over. They already had a great team on the pitch and a great organization off the pitch. He couldn’t fail. My grandfather could have won the league with that team. <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> will keep <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> at the top - but the difference is that i also think he will win the Champions League there. When <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> left <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> there were a lot of happy people there once he had gone. He wasn’t popular.<br /><br />Pep doesn’t want players with personality. He only wants players who are scared of him and will do what he says. The first thing he did when he arrived at City was to pick a fight with Yaya and <a href="joe-hart.html">Joe Hart</a>, two of the club’s biggest players. <a href="joe-hart.html">Hart</a> is England’s goalkeeper; Yaya has won the African Footballer of the Year four times. They have both been big personalities in the dressing room at City and <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> doesn’t like that. When you first go into someone’s house then you should treat them with respect. You don’t go into someone’s house and ask them to leave. He was the same at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. He forced <a href="samuel-eto-o.html">Samuel Eto’o</a> to leave the club. <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>, a player who cost 57 million pounds, was sold for just £18 million. It has to always be about <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>, no one else<br /><br />Yaya is a professional. He will keep doing everything that is asked of him and he will walk away from the club at the end of the season with his pride. If City want to keep paying him not to play then that is up to them. But when his contract is over, he will tell the truth about <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>’s fans will not like it</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitri Seluk has been asked by his client to build bridges with <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>, but the Spaniard is continuing to give him the cold shoulder]</b> <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> has won matches this season, so everyone must only see his fantastic football. But his personality is far from great. I repeat the message from everywhere that he has been from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a>. Many people don’t like him<br /><br />I have spoken to Yaya in the last few days and he has asked me to make the peace with Pep. I agreed with him that I had to do what I could to make the situation better, because Yaya and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> have been caught in the crossfire<br /><br />I am genuine in what I say. I am not an unreasonable man. I don’t think that Pep will ever love me, but the most important thing is that we try to forgive what has happened in the past and develop a new relationship. This is a genuine gesture. I hope Pep accepts that my hope is that we can start with a clean page.<br /><br />Of course, I hope Pep takes the decision to bring Yaya back into his squad. But even if he doesn’t, I can assure him that I am not going to speak about him any more in the media. I have sent this message because Pep hasn’t returned my calls. I really do hope this can be a new start and that Yaya can help <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> to win more trophies</p>

  <p><b>[Yaya Toure’s agent Dimitri Seluk has suggested the player is ready to leave Manchester City in the summer and that he would consider a move to Jose Mourinho’s United]</b> At this moment the situation is like this; from yesterday we officially started negotiating with different clubs about his future. We waited until March 15 for what Manchester City will say but until now Manchester City don’t say anything. Before March, we didn’t negotiate with anybody because Yaya does a lot with Manchester City, so we waited. But we cannot wait until the last minute, until June and have no negotiations with anybody.<br /><br />Some clubs have contacted me. Now we have three options. I don’t speak about Yaya and China or the MLS. He will play in Europe. I have spoken with clubs in different countries; Italy and Spain. Clubs from England waited for the situation with Manchester City, but now we can speak in England and soon I will come to England for negotiations. Yaya must go to vacation already signed with another club.<br /><br />I understand this is two clubs who are rivals but for me, for example, this is not a problem from Yaya or from me, this problem will be from Manchester City staff. I said to Manchester City that we will start negotiations with other clubs about the future of Yaya. After that, if Manchester City want, they can start negotiations. If they don’t want then we will find another club. Yaya can, tomorrow, sign a contract with another club and after that for Manchester City it is too late. They don’t say anything; he must stay or he must go. They can think it and Manchester City are one of the options. We are open to negotiations. But tomorrow, for example, if we heard with Chelsea, he will sign with Chelsea<br /><br />Definitely. I love this football club. The day I will be done, I’ll know myself. I know my body and I’ll say, ‘Yes, I’m done’.</p>

  <p><b>[Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s Premier League journey has taken him from Manchester United to Arsenal]</b> Eventually, we parted ways with him because of that whole situation. Obviously, by that time, Mkhitaryan had already become a well-known player, and when Borussia Dortmund offered Shakhtar €27 million for Henrikh, suddenly Raiola was all over him. Although I had already talked to Liverpool who were also interested in Mkhitaryan and wanted to sign him. If Mkrtchyan hadn’t lied to me and we hadn’t parted ways with Henrikh, he would have been a Liverpool player</p>

  <p><b>[The Ivorian midfielder’s agent claims his client wants to stay in England and will allow his new club to release him without compensation if they wish]</b> Yaya is fit and desperate to prove he’s still the best central midfielder in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He’s happy to accept a one-year deal to stay in England. And if his club are not satisfied with his performances, he will pay back half his wages, or the club can cancel his contract immediately, with no compensation<br /><br />It’s the first club where I’ve stayed for a long time. After eight years of service I think it’s the right time to move on and let the kids continue to take the responsibility. I’m really happy, I’m delighted to be part of this football club and they’ll be looking forward to being strong next year, they’ve played fantastic football and I hope there will be more of the same next year. I’m delighted <b>[to have won three <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> titles]</b>, to be honest.

To proving to the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> fans that Yaya is not finished with football. He is full of strength and energy and wants to play in England this season. At a time when English clubs are spending huge sums of money on players, I officially declare that Yaya is ready to move to any top-six English club as a free agent with a salary of £1 per week. As long as a success-based bonus system is in place. I think a player like Yaya would be good for a club like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> or <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.

  <p><b>[Yaya <a href="yaya-toure.html">Toure</a>’s agent in explosive <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> rant]</b> If my grandmother became manager of <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> they would still be champions. This is the enviable consistency of <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s career choices: he arrives at a club with a huge budget and which already wins titles without him. Once again: <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s actions towards <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Pellegrini</a>, who reached the semi-final of the Champions League that year, were horrible. But <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> has taken similarly horrible actions on many occasions<br /><br />What has <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> achieved? In two years he has won as much as Mancini and <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Pellegrini</a> did. In fact, <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Pellegrini</a> reached the Champions League semi final, and <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> hasn’t done that yet. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> just renewed his contract for three years<br /><br />I would bet that, in that time, <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> will not win the Champions League, no matter how much money he spends, and he loves to spend money. When he spends £200m on the defence alone; when money is no object, then I can only agree with (Mauricio) <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> when he says that he likes to win trophies, rather than buying them as <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> does<br /><br />You know, <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> cannot be called a dog. Because a dog is a good and kind creature, man’s best friend. But <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>, by his very nature, is man’s worst enemy<br /><br />Incidentally, I find it strange, the position <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> has taken, when the manager has shown off his political biases to billions of people. The principle of football outside politics has always existed. But <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> wants to bring politics into football, and this is very dangerous<br /><br />And I believe <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> should ban the manager for bringing politics into football. If you want to go into politics, go to the Catalan parliament and achieve what you want. No need to sit in Manchester and use sheikhs’ money to make a hero out of yourself. This also shows what a worthless person he is. And his cheap populism<br /><br />Many may say that it is <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>’s style, that he plays spectacular football. But when you buy up all the best players in the world, this is much easier than, say, it was for <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Ranieri</a>, whose <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> side won <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. The papers write a lot about <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>, although he as a person is not worthy of this attention. And yet we hear so little about <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, who has won the Champions League three times in a row<br /><br />This testifies to the importance of personality. And when people say that <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> is the best manager, I must reply: <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> is far from winning three consecutive Champions Leagues. And furthermore, I am ready to bet that he never wins it at Manchester City<br /><br />And I don’t think he will ever win the Champions League again<br /><br />God sees everything. The way he acted towards Yaya, a club legend, coming up with various pretexts not to let him play … He has set all of Africa against him, many African fans have turned away from <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>.<br /><br />And I am sure that many African shamans will not let <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> win the Champions League in future. It will be like an African curse on <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a>. Time will tell if I am right or not</p>

Not only in this team, but in general. Yaya is one of the best players in Africa and he had one of the brightest careers in the history of African football. Therefore, he should also leave football beautifully, at the peak. We talked for a long time on this topic.<br /><br />Of course, every football player wants to play for as long as possible. In terms of his physical condition, Yaya could do this at a sufficiently high level for another five years. But we came to the conclusion that he, the football player who played for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, could not lower the bar.<br /><br />We see many players who continue their careers at a mature age, and this is commendable. But Yaya and I chose a different path - to leave as a champion and start a new stage in life with a career as a coach.<br /><br />In this, I am sure, Yaya will reach even greater heights that those he achieved as a football player. There are no African coaches in the English Premier League</p>
