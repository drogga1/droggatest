  <p><b>[Martin Demichelis on Premier League]</b> It’s obvious that <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is the hardest because of how the referees allow a lot more physical contact. In that sense, anything goes. But I understand that it’s the way the English interpret football. It’s how they were brought up. It’s what they like, getting kicked and getting up, whistling a player who simulates a foul or stays on the ground. It seems that rugby is closely related to football here - they like this game of knocks, of aggressiveness, and you can see it on the face of the fans, when they cheer and shout. It’s a way of experiencing it and it’s good</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Demichelis speaks on his turbulent relationship with former boss Louis van Gaal]</b> If I tell you about a great manager, but one who is completely crazy: Van Gaal. He goes a bit too far sometimes. One day, in a game for the starters against the substitutes, with him as referee, the goalkeeper gave me the ball and I smashed the ball in his direction, aiming at his face. It missed him by inches. There was a deafening silence and he said: ‘I ask you all that no one else gives the ball to Demichelis’. We later ended up arguing in the dressing room</p>

  <p><b>[Germany legend <a href="miroslav-klose.html">Miroslav Klose</a> has been backed to become a manager by former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> team-mate Martin Demichelis]</b> We have known each other for a long time and had a good relationship as team-mates, now as coaches. We sometimes have different ideas, but it has to be that way. He was a striker; I was a defender. He is German, I am Argentinian. We both learn from each other. Miro is a good and intelligent man who will one day also be a professional manager. I am a team player and I am with the under-19s to learn and have new experiences. I still have time to develop, but my goal is to become a professional coach one day. Now I want to learn quickly so that I can be ready in the future<br /><br /><b>[The defender recalled an episode from earlier in his career when he clashed with former Bayern manager Ottmar Hitzfeld]</b> Sure, I was spirited as a player and sometimes had differences of opinion with my coaches. But I always just wanted to help the team. At the beginning at <a href="ottmar-hitzfeld.html">Hitzfeld</a> I was supposed to play number six, I accepted that. With Felix Magath I was a regular player in this position. Then <a href="ottmar-hitzfeld.html">Hitzfeld</a> came back and I initially lost my regular place. Before the 2007-08 season, I felt like I was looking for a new challenge, but <a href="karl-heinz-rummenigge.html">Karl-Heinz Rummenigge</a> said I should stay, which paid off for me, because from then on I played with <a href="lucio.html">Lucio</a> in central defence. Then I was supposed to move up to six again in spring 2008, which then led to inconsistencies with <a href="ottmar-hitzfeld.html">Hitzfeld</a>. That’s how it was. The last time I met <a href="ottmar-hitzfeld.html">Hitzfeld</a>, we had a big hug</p>
