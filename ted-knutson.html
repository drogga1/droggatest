<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Why there is no midfielder in the world like €80m Naby Keita]</b> His skill set is extremely rare, and elite skill sets - especially for all-rounders - tend to command huge transfer fees in football. Given his age, production, and fit for that particular style of play, I could easily see a team setting the Bundesliga transfer record right now. If he plays regularly, that could certainly feel like good business a couple of years down the line.<br /><br />There are a lot of good midfielders out there, but none who is quite like Keita. Naby first showed up as an obviously strong choice in the 2014-15 season where he was probably the best defensive midfielder in Austria. A year later, he was the best attacking midfielder, but still had outstanding defensive output, which almost never happens.<br /><br />The only real question we had was how he would fit into Champions League-level teams from a passing perspective, but I’d say he answered all those questions pretty soundly last season, competing in one of the best leagues in Europe</p>
