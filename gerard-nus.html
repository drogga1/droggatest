<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Ghana assistant coach Gerard Nus was not able to return home to Spain until this weekend due to a disagreement over pay with the Ghana Football Association]</b> Yesterday they paid me and a flight ticket was booked for me - I was so happy to go back home. I <b>[didn’t expect]</b> this. When it was time to check out, the hotel told me that there was a bill that I’m supposed to pay. I was prevented from leaving and the ticket is gone. I had to sleep on the sofa in the lobby for the night. This morning, the hotel duty manager allowed me back to my room. I have been coming here for more than two years and I never had to pay any of those expenses. Why does it have to be different now?.<br /><br />If for whatever reason, the people that booked this hotel for me - the GFA - changed the condition and they wanted me to pay for something, they should have told me that on the first day when I came to this hotel; not on the last day when you are leaving. <b>[GFA official]</b> Alex <b>[Asante]</b> told me on Friday afternoon that I have to pay for all expenses from laundry, coffee, snacks between meals, or whatever, for the seven weeks that I have been here, and that they will only pay for the room and for the meals. This is around $1,000<br /><br />I have more money now but no letter. I have decided to leave because it’s been seven weeks, also I have to work because the club has been waiting for me for a long time, I miss my family, and many other reasons. I’m still expecting some money from the GFA but the question is ‘do I believe I’ll get that money?’ At this moment, I cannot believe so many things. With the current situation, let’s just say that the amount that I have received now is okay for me to go back.</p>
