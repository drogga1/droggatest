I think he stirred the fans up and British fans appreciate that kind of approach. He played a season with me at Rangers when we won the league and it was a very successful campaign for him then, so I know what Greg can bring us. I’ve kept in touch with him and his family and I know he’s been bursting over the last couple of years to get back to the top league</p>

His rise-and-rise at Liverpool and at national level was sensational. The story of his career is fairytale stuff - when you consider he’s had setbacks a couple of times; it is the epitome of a true Scot to never give up. He carries himself well and is a tremendous professional. I know a lot of players inspire each other and Andy is an inspirational figure.</p>

The Russians at the World Cup, they were seven games before that without a victory and all of a sudden they blitz their own World Cup.

  <p><b>[Scotland vs Israel]</b> All I’m looking for from every single player is to bring their highest performance level to the game. Does that guarantee 100% a win? Maybe not but I’m pretty optimistic about what happens after that. The key for us is not what we think about Israel, it’s more about what we do, the mentality we show, the organisation we bring.<br /><br />We respect Israel, they’ve been on a good run of form. But we feel very strong here at Hampden and we would love the fans right behind the players from the very first kick of the ball right through to the end</p>

  <p><b>[Scotland boss Alex McLeish is eager to temper expectations around Scott McTominay]</b> When Darren Fletcher came into the Scotland team everyone was asking: ‘Why is he not playing like George Best?’ That was just because he played for Man United. We have to remember that there are certain types of players and they need to be cogs fitting into the wheel. We believe Scott has a good future for club and country - and that performance against PSG suggests that swagger might be there. That kind of performance should give him added swagger and belief in himself. There is loads the big guy can improve on. He is still a young guy learning the game and he’ll be looking at videos of the heroes of the past. He can certainly ping the ball but can he caress it the same as a <b>[Paul]</b> Scholes or a <b>[Roy]</b> Keane when the time is needed for that. The big guy is learning all the time and it’s great to see him coming through in the PSG game as he did against Verratti. Verratti is a world-class player and to mess him about and get the wee guy rattled was the performance of a veteran. I think Nemanja Matic has been a big influence on him as well, playing in a similar position. The games McTominay has played in over the last few weeks have boosted us.<br /><br />I spoke to his agent at Christmas and said: ‘Look, we need to get Scott out <b>[on loan]</b>. We want him to be a part of our squad for years to come and want to get him out training every day with cones and bibs and passing movements. Playing senior football is the key to your learning. I don’t know what <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s thoughts are, but he brought him in and playing against Liverpool he was excellent</p>

  <p><b>[San Marino vs Scotland]</b> It was a poor night for us defensively. We had one chance just before they scored and I was thinking it was looking quite lively for us. But they scored two quick goals and we never reacted. They could have been prevented with better positioning. There’s a lot of inexperience in the squad. We have introduced a few new names in the last year or so and it’s a process where it can take time but I know we don’t have any time. I want to get these lads playing to the level that we demand on the international scene but it’s not easy for players to come from no experience straight into the international team</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers can challenge Celtic with the right recruitment]</b> I’m very impressed. I know Stevie has been very humble and actually said, ‘It’s not good enough <b>[this season]</b> and I’ve got to win things at this club’. He has certainly brought a lot of gravitas to that club.<br /><br />The most important thing for him now if they’re going to seriously challenge Celtic is recruitment. That is the key to any success that you want to have as a manager and as a football club<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about Alfredo Morelos and his poor disciplinary record]</b> There was a spell when he was getting sent off and I’m sure Stevie was having a word with him behind closed doors and then all of a sudden, Steve started to do it publicly and Morelos has calmed down a wee bit. He’s been absolutely brilliant with the press in general in Scotland and I’ve admired his approach to it</p>

  <p><b>[Alex McLeish says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> youngster <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> boasts the same unique qualities as ex-France international Alain Giresse]</b> He reminds me of former France midfielder Alain Giresse, who I remember playing against for Scotland in a warm-up game prior to the European Championships in 1984.<br /><br />Jock Stein came over to me before kick-off and told me to be as physical as I liked against Giresse because, to use that well-worn phrase: ‘He won’t fancy it.’ Famous last words<br /><br />France effectively lined-up with a five-man midfield. Giresse was there - this was that great French side that contained the likes of Jean Tigana and a fella called Michel Platini<br /><br />We were playing a flat back-four and so we had no-one to mark - which was unusual for us - and we were absolutely battered in the first-half. We came in two-down at the break and I still remember <a href="gordon-strachan.html">Gordon Strachan</a> turning around to me and asking what was the record defeat for a Scotland team against France. We were given a run-around. And at the heart of it was this Giresse fella. It didn’t matter how aggressively I went to engage with him, by the time I got there the ball had been moved on. He had an answer for everything<br /><br />The times when I did actually get close, it had no effect. Giresse may have only been small in stature but he was solid. And one thing I have picked up on, having watched Billy play for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and looking back to the time playing for Scotland’s Under-21s, is the fact that they have worked on his core strength.<br /><br />The other player he reminds me of - with respect of his willingness to take a ball under pressure in any situation - was Barry Ferguson. One of Barry’s many great qualities is that he would accept a pass, regardless of the stadium he was playing in, the opposition or the match situation. He would take the ball and do something positive with it. He would re-cycle it. Take it back, move it forward, sideways - whatever the situation called for, he made the right decision<br /><br />Now, it’s not fair to heap that kind of comparison upon Billy’s shoulders quite just yet but I see the same calmness in possession, like he is one step ahead. It’s a rare quality in the game. And if he keeps a level head, he really could go on to be quite a player</p>

  <p><b>[McLeish added on calls for current Scotland boss <a href="steve-clarke.html">Steve Clarke</a> to include <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Gilmour</a> in his next squad]</b> Now, of course, there will be a clamour for Steve to include him. And he does have a difficult choice to make in there because he already has good midfielders. More importantly, he has established some momentum in that area of the field and he won’t want to disrupt<br /><br />The likes of <a href="ryan-christie.html">Ryan Christie</a> and James Forrest for instance, aren’t going to give up their places lightly. But at the same time, if Billy is playing regularly for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, then it is very difficult to ignore him. Steve knows only too well the level and quality that is demanded at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>. The point is, if Billy is progressing and playing then he is going to get a look in sooner rather than later. And if he can take that step up in his stride in the way he has taken to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, then he could take some dislodging</p>

That was one of the main reasons to get him involved with us <b>[in the first team]</b>. He would have been on the bench anyway because of the casualties we had. He was the best youngster coming through. When we played Man United we heard he was in a restaurant being courted by one of the agents to try and get him to Man United. We were a bit alarmed about that so we fought well to keep him. We knew he loved Villa, his old man as well. We had them in speaking to them. They’re lovely people. They asked for something and the club went it’s too much but, finally, you come to an agreement and everybody’s happy. Jack stayed at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, which is great to see one of the great players of Villa nowadays staying with his boyhood club<br /><br /><b>[McLeish added on the role he played in <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a>’s development]</b> I’d see Jack with his famous socks down his legs! He had that swagger. Watching him as a kid on the field ghosting past people with the ball at his feet. You could see all day long he was going to be a star, no doubt about it, which is why we thought we’d have to pretty well keep him at Villa. When Jack came in I saw that, while he wasn’t a big shouter, he was a boy who was willing to take the ball in any part of the pitch. The guy I likened him to at the time was Barry Ferguson. He could have played in any stadium in the world and Barry was fearless in taking the ball, saying: ‘Just gimme the ball, just gimme the ball!’</p>
