<blockquote>
  <p>[Dortmund’s Mario Gotze needs right coach to return to his best] He can still play. But he obviously needs the right coach. I used to think that Mario plays in every team. But apparently he already needs a free-spirit coach and no structure coach. Mario is a free spirit himself and with such a player you have to talk a lot. And not all trainers understand that. Especially in Germany<br /><br />[Hyballa suggests a move away from Germany] I do not want to give him any tips, that’s not for me. He just has to keep going and maybe relax a bit. There are other things in life than football. From my external perspective, I see only two possibilities: Either, he prevails at Borussia Dortmund or he goes abroad. But of course it’s also a matter of mind. Of course he’s been listening for years: you’re the best, you’re the best. And he said back then that he sees himself among the best clubs in the world. That’s why he’s always put the most pressure on himself. He is a perfectionist, but this claim also wears you down<br /><br />Our youth goalkeeping coach Matthias Kleinsteiber, who also led the BVB Youth Board, drew my attention to him. And then a small chubby guy came to us, but he did just about everything right. Actually, I’m always very emotional in training, but when I saw that, I was pretty quiet for a while. Then I called the then U-17 coach and said: He will not come back to you. We played a huge season back then and played for the championship and the cup in the finals. Mario was very fast an integral part of the team, has played on the 10 and on the wings. At that time one already saw what incredible qualities he possesses. He sees spaces, has an outstanding technique and incredible talent. For example, we did a triathlon in the training camp, so he swam it all the others. Since I thought: Is there anything he is not able to do? But you have to say one thing. His development does not come from God alone, but also the youth department of Borussia Dortmund. Because the trainers at BVB also had a very rude, direct nature, as it belongs somewhere in the Ruhr area. And this speech was just right for Mario. You do not always have to sensitively tackle a sensitive person, but sometimes tackle it counter productively to get the most out of it</p>
