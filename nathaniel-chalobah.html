  <p><b>[Nathaniel Chalobah reveals Chelsea’s top FIFA 17 player]</b> I’d say it is probably between <b>[Kurt]</b> Zouma, <b>[Cesar]</b> Azpilicueta and <b>[N’Golo]</b> Kante. One of them three. They are top players. Nathan Ake will be unhappy I didn’t put him in there but I keep destroying him so he can’t be the best. I’m pretty good but I don’t get involved always, especially not with England Under-21s. They take it seriously on those trips, but Tammy Abraham fancies himself and he is pretty decent to be fair. It is good, football brings people together, as it is here. People are from everywhere playing together. Everyone plays FIFA. All kinds of people!<br /><br />I listen to a little bit of grime, a little bit of everything to be fair. Abra Cadabra is here, I am playing a bit of him at the minute and a bit of Kojo Funds. Those are my recommendations in terms of music, for Netflix, I recommend Designated Survivor. I just started it and the first episode was decent!</p>
