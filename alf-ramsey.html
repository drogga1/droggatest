Our best football will come against the right type of opposition-a team who come to play football, and not act as animals<br /><br /><b>[Ramsey said after taking the England job in 1963]</b> We will win the World Cup<br /><br /><b>[Ramsey’s brief team talk prior to the extra-time period in the 1966 final]</b> You’ve won it once.

  <p><b>[Moore holding aloft the World Cup on 30 July 1966 is the most iconic image in English football. It was a perfect moment in the country’s sporting history, and the captain - composed, immaculate, stylish - was its perfect hero. Alf Ramsey, the national team manager, said of Moore in the aftermath of that triumph]</b> My captain, my leader, my right-hand man. He was the spirit and the heartbeat of the team. A cool, calculating footballer I could trust with my life. He was the supreme professional, the best I ever worked with. Without him England would never have won the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[At the final whistle in the World Cup final of 1966, he did not leap for joy or pump his fist, but instead sat staring impassively into the distance. When the ecstatic England team begged him to join them on a lap of honour around Wembley, he refused]</b> This is your day, you have done this. Until the end of his life, he exhibited the same reserved modesty<br /><br /><b>[A fierce patriot, he loathed the very concept of cashing in on the national cause. In the early 1970s, when the <a href="fa.html">Football Association</a> was considering a sponsorship deal on England’s famous three lions shirt, Sir Alf privately complained]</b> How can they want to make money from it? I can’t believe these people<br /><br /><b>[Even worse was the meagre financial settlement. At the time of his dismissal in 1974, his salary was just £7,200, lower than the earnings of some Third Division managers, and his redundancy payment amounted to only £8,000, less than a third of the annual £25,000 ­salary enjoyed by the new England manager Don Revie. Moreover, Sir Alf’s FA pension came to a pathetic £25 a week. This was no way to treat a national hero. Out of work, he had no financial security]</b> The wealth of the game passed me by. I would like to have retired in comfort and have no worries about money, but that has not been the case</p>

It was the most devastating half-hour of my life <b>[Ramsey later said of his sacking]</b>. I stood in a room almost full of staring committee men. It was just like I was on trial. I thought I was going to be hanged</p>
