Manchester United stars Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard have appeared to clash with each other while on the club’s pre-season tour in Australia. A small section of the footage shows Pogba and Lingard in animated discussion before Swedish defender Victor Lindelof holds the French World Cup winner back from approaching his English team-mate</p>

  <p><b>[The former Benfica man last month spoke about the squad’s mindset going into pre-season preparations]</b> Well there’s a lot of excitement of course, because we haven’t seen each other for a long time. It’s always nice to see all the players and you know everyone is just excited to get started again, to work hard and get ready for the season<br /><br /><b>[Lindelof also highlighted the importance of the introduction of a winter break in the English top flight when looking ahead to 2019-20]</b> I think it’s good actually. I think, if you look at the other countries, they always have a winter break and I think it’s important for the mind and the body as well to get a little bit of rest so you can keep going and work hard throughout the season. So yeah, I’m all for it. I know in England we’ve always played a lot during the winter while others have rested a little bit, so I think it’s going to be good. I think people will enjoy it</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof insists that he is happy at Manchester United despite recent reports linking the Swedish defender with a move to Barcelona]</b> I’m very, very happy to be a Manchester United player. I’m really looking forward to this season. I’m very excited for a new season to start. That’s my answer, I’m very happy here. I always felt like a Manchester United player but last season was a better season for me, I performed better than I did in my first. I’m happy that people think that <b>[I’m the best central defender at the club]</b>. I’m just trying to do my best every day and that’s what I work hard for every day to help the team and the club<br /><br /><b>[The next step will be adapting to new faces coming in, including new defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka]</b> Well new players, new signings, we as a team will always try to help them to settle in as quickly as possible. This is my third season here, I’ve been through what it is to sign for this club and get a little criticism. But it’s part of the game and, like I said before, everyone in the team is trying to help the new guys</p>

I’m really looking forward to this season. I’m very excited for a new season to start. New players, new signings, we as a team will always try to help them to settle in as quickly as possible.

  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof says he is excited by the prospect of competing with Harry Maguire for a place in the Manchester United starting XI]</b> I like the competition. I love it, actually. I think it’s great for a club to have that competition. If you have good players in your position you have to work hard every day, especially in training, and that helps a team to go to the next level as well. For me it’s perfect. I like it. I think everyone at this club wants to be at the highest level. I’m very good friends with them all. In training, we compete and then off the pitch we are friends. That’s how it should be<br /><br /><b>[But he has been quick to dismiss any talk of a transfer this summer]</b> I’m not the kind of person who thinks about that. I’m here, I’m very happy here. That’s my focus. Manchester United is my club. I represent this club with great honour. <br /><br />I’m very confident in myself. It’s just the way I am, the way I was raised. I know the type of player I am, I know the type of person I am. I’ve always been like that and it was never a problem for me</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof has said in the past that he is happy to fill in on the left, but Harry Maguire seems to have fitted in on that side more naturally]</b> For me, it’s not a problem. I’m used to playing on the left side as well but I’ll play wherever the manager wants me to play. I don’t see a problem having two right-footers as central defenders. I have quite a good left foot and can manage to play on the left as well so it’s not a problem</p>

I have grown significantly both as a player and as a person in the last two years and for that I am grateful to everyone at the club for their help and support. I love playing football and my aim now is to help the team to win trophies and repay the fans for their unrivalled support. I know that everyone at the club shares this vision and will give everything to get <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> back to where it belongs. I’m still young and know I can improve further but with the help of the boss and his coaching staff, I believe that only good things are ahead for this great club</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof shrugged off recent criticism from former manager <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> as the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> defender insists he isn’t concerned with the opinions of others]</b> For me it has never been a problem, I’m a very easy guy. There is always going to be someone talking or someone else. When you play for this club there is always going to be people criticising you and the way you play. For me it has never been a problem, even when I play good there is someone criticising me for something. It’s part of the job, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I’m just trying to do my thing and I don’t focus on those things. I didn’t even notice, or know about it, before you told me. That’s how I live my life and focus on my things<br /><br /><b>[Lindelof has made six <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> appearances so far this season as the defender has formed a partnership with summer signing Harry Maguire]</b> If you are playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> <b>[scrutiny]</b> is part of it. If you do not perform you hear about it, it’s quite normal. I could see my future here so that’s why I signed a new contract - I’m really happy about that. We have a good thing going and I still want to win the big trophies with this club, that has been my goal since I signed</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof says No danger to <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> at Man Utd]</b> He’s very good. A coach that is easy to talk to and discuss things with and who has a good balance when he should be tough and when he should not be tough. Since he has been at the club as a player, he knows what it takes to succeed there and he has a lot of control.<br /><br />You are used to criticism. When you are at United, everything gets much bigger. There are more people watching, more people writing about the club than any other club. For him it is probably nothing new, he has been a player there, then things went a little better for the club, but he knows exactly what it takes to be a player and how much pressure there is on us. There is probably no danger to him</p>

But for me, I have a contract with United and I am the loyal type. For me it was never a question either, I wanted to stay in United and believe very much in what we have going on and that is also why I signed a new contract. I love to represent United and to wear that shirt every day. My goal when I came here was to win titles and do well for all supporters. But I haven’t won a title yet, so it’s my big goal to take home big titles with United. If we get to the level we can do and everyone can do their best, we can win trophies<br /><br /><b>[The United boss said when fresh terms for the Swede were announced]</b> Victor has established himself here and has become a very important part of our team. He brings calmness on the pitch and I can see that he is determined to help this club and to be successful here. I’m extremely happy that he has committed his future to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. We’re all looking forward to working together to deliver the success and get United back to where we know the club belongs</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United centre-back Victor Lindelof has confessed that he misses <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>, whom he credits for giving him the chance to realise his dreams at Old Trafford]</b> He is, after all, one of the world’s best coaches and he is supposed to have a job at one of the biggest clubs. I miss him in football. He’s a great coach and a great person, whom I owe a great deal. It was he who gave me the chance here, who brought me into everything. I have all the respect in the world for him and appreciate everything he has said and done for me, from scolding to a hug. Even if I did not agree, at the time … he has very great charisma, you had great respect for him. He’s won everything. When he says something, you listen</p>

  <p><b>[Lindelof admits to <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> ‘problem’ which leads to <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s side playing ‘poorly’]</b> I generally think there is one thing we need to get better at if we are going to get back to the level <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should be at: that’s winning matches week in and week out. Sometimes it does not have to be neat, but you should win anyway. There’s been a bit of a problem - If we go into the matches against big clubs, we’re all connected, and we get results. Then a few days go by and we meet a slightly lower team, then we have to go in exactly the same way, not get comfortable. We start well, play fast and get to positions – but then we stop with it after 20 minutes, complicate it and play poorly</p>

  <p><b>[Lindelof didn’t look at new <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> contract, he just signed it]</b> When they offered me a new contract it was very, very easy for me.

I’m very happy here and I want to be here for many more years to come and I know that I can become a better player here. I know the club can help me and I want to stay here for more years and hopefully we can win some trophies as well. That’s my main goal.<br /><br /><b>[Lindelof did his best to avoid being caught up in the transfer hype, but concedes that he was always hoping to see an agreement reached with United]</b> When United wanted to sign me, I think it was in January <b>[2017]</b>. Things didn’t happen, but I knew they wanted me. I wanted to focus on my football, because I wanted to win the title and the cups and everything <b>[with Benfica]</b>. I’ve always been mentally strong, which I think is why I was able to carry on. I just carried on, kept working hard and told my agent, ‘As soon as the season is at an end, you can come back to me and tell me what’s happening<br /><br />In those last few months of the season, we won every game in the league and the Portuguese Cup as well. It was a great end for me to win those trophies. After the last game, my agent called me straight away and explained the situation <b>[with United]</b></p>

I’ll wait until I win a first title and then I can answer that question.<br /><br /><b>[Maguire only joined the club from <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> last summer but is already a key member of the squad and was appointed club captain in January following the sale of Ashley Young]</b> It’s been great playing with Harry a lot this season. It’s very important to play a lot of games together and you learn a lot from each other. The more games you play, the better you get as players and so it’s been great as we’ve been helping each other a lot and getting some good results. I think we’ve been improving lately as well, before the break, we had a lot of clean sheets and performed well.
