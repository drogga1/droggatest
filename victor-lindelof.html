  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof has spoken of the continued speculation linking him with a move to Manchester United]</b> It feels good that I extended my stay <b>[at Benfica]</b> by one year. I enjoy playing for the club and feel I evolve every day there. It was an easy choice. Both parties were very happy and they wanted to give me a sign that they are satisfied with what I’ve done there. Much has been written <b>[about Manchester United]</b> but it’s nothing I have focused on. I have always focused on what was important to me and that’s the team <b>[Benfica]</b>. That <b>[the rumours]</b>, makes no difference to me. As I’ve said I’ve been thriving at Benfica and that’s where the focus has been. A lot has been written and I’ve said nothing, I’ve been focused<br /><br /><b>[Questioned on whether a summer departure could be on the cards]</b> I have a long contract at Benfica and I’m thriving there. It’s a big club and I’m developing every day. I’m only 22 years old and there is no stress <b>[to push through a move]</b>.</p>

I’m keen to get started and make my contribution to the team’s efforts to win more trophies.</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof says it was an easy decision to join Manchester United]</b> I was in Benfica for five years so for me to leave of course it was not a tough decision but a hard decision because I was happy there and I developed a lot as a player. But when this opportunity came it was very easy to take it. It feels great, and I’m very, very happy to be here at this great club. I couldn’t be happier.<br /><br />It feels great knowing that the coach wants you, so to finally be here makes me very happy. I’ve spoken to him, and it was a good chat. It’s very important for me as well to hear what he has to say. Of course he’s a great coach, and for me to be able to work with him it’s a great opportunity for me<br /><br />I think I’m quite a calm player, I like to have the ball at my feet. I think I’m quite good at reading the game and I think I give the players in front of me a sense of calm, they know I’m back there and I try to protect them as good as I can<br /><br />My position is a centre-back, but I’ve played right-back before and I started my footballing career as a midfielder. But I see myself as a central defender, I feel most comfortable there. There are some great players here in my position, but I’m here to do my best and try to help the team as good as I can. It’s always good to have other good players around you because when you have that you get better as well.<br /><br />I always had a dream to come here and to play in the Premier League, so it’s a dream come true. Everywhere you go you have to adapt to a new environment, but I feel comfortable in myself and I trust myself. Of course United is one of the biggest clubs in the world and you always want to win titles, so it’s also my goal that I want to come here and win titles. I think that’s the goal of the club and the other players as well</p>

I’m here to play football and perform as well as possible for Manchester United. I don’t keep track of that, it’s not something I spend time on. It’s not important to me. It just means you’ve done something good and that the club really wanted me.<br /><br />I’m proud and happy to have been given this chance, but I need a few days so that everything calms down. Then I’ll be even happier. I’m very happy. Everything happened quickly. To come to the Premier League, and one of the world’s biggest clubs, it’s a lot to take in. But it’s really a dream come true. There has been so much <b>[rumours and speculation]</b>, I’m just glad it’s finished and that I’m sitting here today. I’m glad I don’t have to answer those questions <b>[about his future]</b> and don’t need to evade them. That feels great</p>

Thank you for all of your unconditionally love and for letting us borrow your amazing city Lisboa for these past years. I will always look back at the time in Lisbon and Benfica with so much love.

I wake up every day and I’m very happy I get to come here and do what I love. I don’t take anything for granted, I work hard every day. I’m just trying to do my best every day, work hard and improve. When you’re given the chance to play, it’s always nice to be out there and help the team, and I’m just happy to be out there doing that. We have world-class players in every position and I think that’s very important to have. This club is one of the biggest clubs in the world, so you’re obviously going to have that.<br /><br />Every game is difficult here. Every opponent is going to work hard, fight for 90 minutes to try to get three points, and that’s what makes the Premier League such a good league, the level of competition. It was a bit different in Portugal, we had only a few big games during the season. We want to win as many games as possible and of course, you always want to come first. But if not, second is there, and that’s what we have to work for. We’re improving as a team every day. It’s important for us to play a lot of games, and just keep going</p>

I like to have the ball and start from the back, and I’ve always liked to have the ball at my feet, ever since I was young. I managed to develop that more in Portugal as well and got even better. I think that’s one of my best things.<br /><br />I just started as a no.10 and also played as a winger in the national team actually. Then no.8, no.6 and then I became a right-back and now central defender. I played all those positions. When I was younger I was a no.10 in a free role and I could move around a little bit. I like central midfield</p>

I think he’s been fantastic and I’m very happy to have him as a coach.<br /><br />It feels good. I’ve been playing a lot of games since the start of the season, I’m just trying to keep on going and doing the best for the team.

  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof claims Manchester United had arch-rivals City looking quite nervous on derby day]</b> After that goal <b>[from Martial]</b> they were quite nervous and it felt like we could have scored another goal, but they scored a third goal instead, so it happens in football, but we are very, very disappointed, because we felt that we could have scored a second goal and got a better result. We had quite a lot of possession, but we didn’t really come in behind their defensive line into their last third of the pitch. But we tried and, like I said, it felt like we could’ve hurt them more<br /><br />I think we started the game, the first 15 minutes, quite badly. They had a lot of possession and we didn’t do so much, but after their goal we started to play a little bit and we made it harder for them. After we scored after our goal we could have been a bit more aggressive and tried a little bit more but we lost and we’re sad about that.<br /><br />Right now the <b>[international]</b> break has come at the wrong time. Because I feel like in the last couple of weeks we’ve really improved a lot, we’ve got some good results and we’ve been playing better, so we’re sad of course for the loss. But we know that we can do some good things and, I can just speak for myself, but I want to play more games now</p>

All the guys have shown their qualities. I think we have to keep going and continue to work really hard and do the things we’ve been doing. And we always have to give 100 per cent in everything. Not 90, always 100 - that’s very important. I’m just happy to be helping the team. I’m a team player and that’s the most important thing for me. I’m just happy that I can perform well and help us get the wins and not concede goals. Those are my objectives in every game.<br /><br />I hate losing - that’s the worst thing I know. I always want to win so, after a loss, I can be quite mad for a while and my wife knows that! She won’t speak with me for a little bit when I get home. But I also think it’s important to let it go too. It’s okay to be angry but, after a few hours, you have to move on and I’m very good at doing that. I’ll say ‘Okay, that’s now in the past, let’s move on and look forward to make sure it doesn’t happen again’.

These are the kind of games you dream about when you are younger, to go out and play the big games, and this is a big game, so I’m really looking forward to it<br /><br />We’re Manchester United, so anything is possible. Of course, it is going to be a tough game but we’re coming here to win the game and go through. Anything can happen and we know that, so if we can get an early goal things could look good.<br /><br />I’m only 24, so I can’t say that I feel old. But there some very good young players here and it’s a good experience for them. I think they are very happy to be here and travel with us and, of course, as a young player you always want to be with the first team and especially to experience the Champions League so I think they are very happy</p>

But it’s part of the game and, like I said before, everyone in the team is trying to help the new guys</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof says he is excited by the prospect of competing with <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> for a place in the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> starting XI]</b> I like the competition. I love it, actually. I think it’s great for a club to have that competition. If you have good players in your position you have to work hard every day, especially in training, and that helps a team to go to the next level as well. For me it’s perfect. I like it. I think everyone at this club wants to be at the highest level. I’m very good friends with them all. In training, we compete and then off the pitch we are friends. That’s how it should be<br /><br /><b>[But he has been quick to dismiss any talk of a transfer this summer]</b> I’m not the kind of person who thinks about that. I’m here, I’m very happy here. That’s my focus. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is my club. I represent this club with great honour.<br /><br />I’m very confident in myself. It’s just the way I am, the way I was raised. I know the type of player I am, I know the type of person I am. I’ve always been like that and it was never a problem for me</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof has said in the past that he is happy to fill in on the left, but <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> seems to have fitted in on that side more naturally]</b> For me, it’s not a problem. I’m used to playing on the left side as well but I’ll play wherever the manager wants me to play. I don’t see a problem having two right-footers as central defenders. I have quite a good left foot and can manage to play on the left as well so it’s not a problem</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof has signed a new five-year contract at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> club have confirmed]</b> Since the day I arrived at United it has felt like home. I have grown significantly both as a player and as a person in the last two years and for that I am grateful to everyone at the club for their help and support. I love playing football and my aim now is to help the team to win trophies and repay the fans for their unrivalled support. I know that everyone at the club shares this vision and will give everything to get <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> back to where it belongs. I’m still young and know I can improve further but with the help of the boss and his coaching staff, I believe that only good things are ahead for this great club</p>

  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof shrugged off recent criticism from former manager <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> as the <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> defender insists he isn’t concerned with the opinions of others]</b> For me it has never been a problem, I’m a very easy guy. There is always going to be someone talking or someone else. When you play for this club there is always going to be people criticising you and the way you play. For me it has never been a problem, even when I play good there is someone criticising me for something. It’s part of the job, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I’m just trying to do my thing and I don’t focus on those things. I didn’t even notice, or know about it, before you told me. That’s how I live my life and focus on my things<br /><br /><b>[Lindelof has made six <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> appearances so far this season as the defender has formed a partnership with summer signing <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>]</b> If you are playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> <b>[scrutiny]</b> is part of it. If you do not perform you hear about it, it’s quite normal. I could see my future here so that’s why I signed a new contract - I’m really happy about that.

  <p><b>[Victor Lindelof says No danger to <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>]</b> He’s very good. A coach that is easy to talk to and discuss things with and who has a good balance when he should be tough and when he should not be tough. Since he has been at the club as a player, he knows what it takes to succeed there and he has a lot of control.<br /><br />You are used to criticism. When you are at United, everything gets much bigger. There are more people watching, more people writing about the club than any other club. For him it is probably nothing new, he has been a player there, then things went a little better for the club, but he knows exactly what it takes to be a player and how much pressure there is on us. There is probably no danger to him</p>

But for me, I have a contract with United and I am the loyal type. For me it was never a question either, I wanted to stay in United and believe very much in what we have going on and that is also why I signed a new contract. I love to represent United and to wear that shirt every day. My goal when I came here was to win titles and do well for all supporters. But I haven’t won a title yet, so it’s my big goal to take home big titles with United. If we get to the level we can do and everyone can do their best, we can win trophies<br /><br /><b>[The United boss said when fresh terms for the Swede were announced]</b> Victor has established himself here and has become a very important part of our team. He brings calmness on the pitch and I can see that he is determined to help this club and to be successful here. I’m extremely happy that he has committed his future to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. We’re all looking forward to working together to deliver the success and get United back to where we know the club belongs</p>

I miss him in football. He’s a great coach and a great person, whom I owe a great deal. It was he who gave me the chance here, who brought me into everything. I have all the respect in the world for him and appreciate everything he has said and done for me, from scolding to a hug. Even if I did not agree, at the time … he has very great charisma, you had great respect for him. He’s won everything. When he says something, you listen</p>

  <p><b>[Lindelof admits to <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> ‘problem’ which leads to <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s side playing ‘poorly’]</b> I generally think there is one thing we need to get better at if we are going to get back to the level <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should be at: that’s winning matches week in and week out. Sometimes it does not have to be neat, but you should win anyway. There’s been a bit of a problem - If we go into the matches against big clubs, we’re all connected, and we get results. Then a few days go by and we meet a slightly lower team, then we have to go in exactly the same way, not get comfortable. We start well, play fast and get to positions - but then we stop with it after 20 minutes, complicate it and play poorly</p>

  <p><b>[Lindelof didn’t look at new <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> contract, he just signed it]</b> When they offered me a new contract it was very, very easy for me.

It’s very important to play a lot of games together and you learn a lot from each other.

I think we’ve been improving lately as well, before the break, we had a lot of clean sheets and performed well.
