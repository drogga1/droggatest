  <p><b>[Fifa admits bronze boot error, <a href="samuel-cshukwueze.html">Chukwueze</a> not <a href="kelechi-nwakali.html">Nwakali</a> winner]</b> We made a mistake at the closing ceremony of the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> U-17 World Cup Chile 2015 with the distribution of the adidas Bronze Boot. Instead of player no. 8 of Nigeria, <a href="samuel-cshukwueze.html">Samuel Chukwueze</a>, the player <a href="kelechi-nwakali.html">Kelechi Nwakali</a> (player no. 10 of Nigeria) received the adidas Bronze Boot. However, if two or more players are still equal (after goals and assists), the player who has played fewer number of minutes will be ranked first. With this in mind, adidas will send you another Bronze Boot in December 2015, which we would kindly ask you to hand over to <a href="samuel-cshukwueze.html">Samuel Chukwueze</a>. Please be informed that <a href="kelechi-nwakali.html">Kelechi Nwakali</a> may keep his trophy</p>

If they decide they want me to come back to London it’s still no problem. They have to make their choice and I will respect it</p>

  <p><b>[Kelechi Nwakali is enjoying life in the quaint Dutch city of Maastricht]</b> It’s good living in Maastricht. A small city and quiet - a big difference from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. London is a big city compared to Maastricht but what matters is my adaption because I’m a footballer and I think our life is all about travelling<br /><br /><b>[The youngster hasn’t forgotten where he came from but reveals how he didn’t think twice about leaving for London after a phone call from an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> legend]</b> <a href="nwankwo-kanu.html">Kanu</a> called me <b>[after the U-17 World Cup]</b> and said <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> wanted me; that the boss <b>[<a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>]</b> called him about me. He’s <b>[Kanu]</b> been my mentor, a brother and a friend. He advised me to go and develop and prove who I am. He is my mentor and a friend. He calls me every day and I get advice from him every time. From a young age I’ve dreamt of playing for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I think God made it easy for me because that has been my dream team.<br /><br /><b>[For now, though, Nwakali remains focused on proving himself in the Netherlands for MVV Maastricht, where he has become the league’s hottest talent thanks to his match-winning performances, tricks, flicks and assists]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have a lot of players and the only way you can play for the first team is through hard work. I play as a No.10 and as No.8 but, since I’ve come to Holland, I’ve been playing as a right winger. It’s my first time in that position but the coach decided that I should play there. As a young player I have a lot to offer - but it’s all about timing. The most important thing is that I believe I have the ability to play in a lot of positions.<br /><br /><b>[He cites the help of his parents as a huge part of making it as a professional footballer and says that the 2014 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Under-17 World Cup in Chile gave him the platform to show the world his qualities]</b> Going from Nigeria to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is a difficult task because a lot of young players want to go to England. It’s all about determination and hard work. I went to Chile and played as the captain, won the trophy and best player award. It was a very big platform for me to continue my career.<br /><br />Nigeria is not like Europe, so it’s a difficult place to survive. You have to work hard to get what you want. Both my mum and dad played important roles before I got to where I am today.<br /><br />I lost my dad in 2006. He was a big <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fan, a diehard <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fan and he and my mother contributed a lot, buying boots, jerseys and taking me to training<br /><br /><b>[Whether he comes back to fight for a place in the first team or spends another campaign out on loan to gain experience, you can be sure that Nwakali will be do everything in his power to secure a place in the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> XI]</b> I’m not the one who will decide what happens but all I can do is work hard and let the boss see that. If <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> decide that next season they want me to play in <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, no problem.

I think Nigeria have the most <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans in the world because of <a href="nwankwo-kanu.html">Kanu</a>. I know they are expecting to see me play in <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Emirates Stadium</a> and I promise them I will work hard to fulfil their expectations</p>

  <p><b>[Nwakali says Eagles won’t disappoint against Algeria and Argentina]</b> I will say I was welcome with open arm. I had a long chat with <a href="kelechi-iheanacho.html">Kelechi Iheanacho</a> and others. I was greeted with so much enthusiasm. I can say that the players of the Super Eagles are united and are working as one big family<br /><br />It was a nice experience seeing some of my former teammates in the junior national team here again in the senior national team. It is a thing of joy that we have progressed this far in our career<br /><br />We will all contribute our quota to ensure that the Eagles are not disgraced against Algeria and Argentina. I am happy to be in the Eagles and I will do my best to ensure that I get more call-ups in the future</p>
