  <p>[Jonjoe Kenny on his loan move to Schalke 04] It is a big chance for me, to come to a new country and show off my abilities, especially at a big club like Schalke. Schalke is a club with a long history and fantastic fans. I am happy to be here and can’t wait to get up and running with the team</p>

  <p>[Jonjoe Kenny is looking to use the likes of Jadon Sancho and Reiss Nelson as inspiration, with the Everton defender preparing to take on his own Bundesliga challenge with Schalke 04] When you see what Jadon Sancho has been doing in the Bundesliga since joining <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a>, you can only be astonished. Even at his age, he has achieved great things and managed to become one of the biggest stars of English football. Also, Reiss Nelson enjoyed a very good experience. In Hoffenheim, he has developed very well. I’m really looking forward to the new challenge.<br /><br />[Kenny added that he has sought advice from his England U21 team-mate Nelson] Reiss has raved about the Bundesliga. The stadiums and fans have especially impressed him. He felt really good at Hoffenheim and advised me to take the step to Germany. For young Englishmen, the Bundesliga can be a good step<br /><br />[Quizzed on the reasons for making a brave career call] Schalke is a huge club with great fans, great stadium and an eventful history. Also, coach David Wagner was one reason for my transfer. I know him from the Premier League and think he’s a great coach. You’ve seen what he has achieved with <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> and I’m convinced he can make me a better player. I am very happy and can hardly wait for it to finally start<br /><br />[Kenny concedes that he is stepping slightly into the unknown with Schalke] I knew a few names, but to be honest, I had to Google to see who my new teammates are exactly. I am looking forward to getting to know the team soon in person</p>
