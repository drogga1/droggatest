  <p><b>[Alvaro Morata and Tiemoue Bakayoko have been slammed for their performances this season by former Chelsea striker Tony Cascarino]</b> Alvaro Morata does so many good things on the pitch but he just needs to learn to get the ball out of his feet more quickly and shoot. Sometimes the Chelsea striker seems to be waiting for the perfect situation to arise before he takes aim at goal. To be a great centre-forward you need to hit the ball early and try to break the net.<br /><br />N’Golo Kante has really missed having Matic alongside him in the centre of Chelsea’s midfield this season. Bakayoko was brought in last summer but has failed to make anything like the impact of the Serb, who joined Manchester United<br /><br />Hazard can change a game in an instant and take teams apart, whereas his team-mates were struggling to create chances against a packed defence</p>

  <p><b>[Mauricio Pochettino leaving Tottenham to join Chelsea would be worse than Sol Campbell’s betrayal when he left for Arsenal]</b> Could this be worse than Sol Campbell going from Spurs for Arsenal? I feel a lot of Tottenham fans would think it was. Their manager! All he has done over the last few years at Spurs, he’s created a fantastic team. If he went across London to a club like Chelsea, supporters would be absolutely devastated. Considering what he’s done at the club, I think they would be so upset. The throwaway comment that Poch made a few weeks ago, ‘With me or without me’, that says a lot. Why would you say that? One thing is clear, Chelsea will see this as an opportunity for a big coup of taking a manger they really believe would take the club in a new direction. Poch has got a fantastic record, he has nowhere near to funds that have been available at Chelsea, so I could see that making a lot of sense. It would be a massive coup for Chelsea.</p>

  <p><b>[Dele Alli must take inspiration from Real Madrid and Spain star Isco if he is to blossom into a star midfielder]</b> Dele Alli is a phenomenal talent, has performed at the highest level and is still only 22, but I think he’s now facing the first battle of his career. He burst onto the scene with his skill, flair and ability to make runs into the box and get important goals. I want to see Alli put himself about the pitch, making more challenges, and improve his passing game because at the moment I don’t think he’s a guaranteed starter for Gareth Southgate.<br /><br />Alli should look at Isco for Spain, he controlled the game, always wanted the ball, made the right decisions. Even when Isco is not scoring or making assists he is affecting the game. Yes he has more experience but that is what Alli should be aiming for. Alli’s position in England’s midfield is key if they are to push on to the next level. He has the ability but managers will not wait for ever for him to fulfil it</p>

  <p><b>[Former Chelsea forward Tony Cascarino believes that Eden Hazard is the most gifted player]</b> Chelsea have had many exceptional players, from Peter Osgood to John Terry and Didier Drogba, but Eden Hazard is the most gifted in the club’s history. He has a bit of everything, the full package, and keeping him at Stamford Bridge was the best bit of business in the summer transfer window. He made no fuss about staying despite Real Madrid’s interest and has got on with the job.<br /><br />His goal ratio is not far off Drogba’s despite not being a striker. He has won trophies and player of the year awards but he still does not receive the praise that he deserves. Maybe because he switched off a little under José Mourinho he is not viewed as highly as he should be, but Chelsea fans should know that they are watching not only one of the best players in Europe at the moment, but the best they have had</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has been blamed for Romelu Lukaku’s poor Manchester United form]</b> I watched Belgium play Brazil in the quarter-finals and it was clear that Romelu and Eden were giving their absolute all. I don’t think I’ve ever seen Hazard work so hard in a game. Fast-forward to the start of the season and he was eased into the Chelsea line-up by Maurizio Sarri, playing 14 minutes in their first game against Huddersfield Town and then 29 minutes against Arsenal. Sarri realised that Hazard needed a rest so he took him out of the firing line. The same cannot be said for Jose’s management of Lukaku.<br /><br />He came on as a substitute in their opening match against Leicester City but then played every minute of their next 12 matches, despite his form wavering and him looking short of fitness. Modern-day players do everything they can to be as fit as possible and, because they work so hard during the week and in matches, injuries become inevitable. Someone has to step in and protect players when they are with their clubs, the manager or the medical team. It is no surprise that the three unbeaten teams this season are ones at which the managers are juggling their squads. Sarri has used Hazard wisely, Pep Guardiola has rotated his Manchester City midfield to keep them fresh and, at Liverpool, Virgil van Dijk and Georginio Wijnaldum have been outstanding</p>

  <p><b>[Tony Cascarino believes that N’Golo Kante could leave Chelsea at the end of the season if Maurizio Sarri continues to favour Jorginho]</b> I don’t think Sarri’s comments about Kante being more technical were too much to be concerned about. I think the bigger issue with Kante is they have given him a new contract because they know so many clubs are sniffing around him, but he’s being played out of position. You feel he’s wasted. I think certainly PSG would be in for him as well as other clubs, and why wouldn’t they? He’s the best at his position in the world, without a doubt, for me. That’s why he signed a new deal, but I don’t believe it will be enough to keep him there if Kante plays in that position all season. I think by the end of the season he might have had enough, knowing he’s a far better player in the positions he is more accustomed to.</p>

I think he’d fit perfectly into Chelsea.<br /><br />The thing with Arnautovic - he reminds me of that Eric Cantona mindset. He thinks he’s good enough to be up there at the top table, and he is. He was dreadful at times last year, but there’s a real player in there and he needs a challenge. And maybe the challenge is West Ham? I’m not saying he should leave West Ham, but he is a guy who needs to be winning things. He’s that good of a player. Arnautovic is a player capable of playing for one of the best teams in England</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea’s Financial Fair Play struggles should be making Callum Hudson-Odoi a target]</b> <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> should be looking at the potential Financial Fair Play problems that Manchester City and Chelsea may be having and try to sneak in to pinch the best young talent in Europe. Why not go to Phil Foden or Callum Hudson-Odoi and say ‘Look at <b>[Marcus]</b> Rashford, look at Tahith Chong - we are going to give young players a chance, come and play for us’.<br /><br />If United think they can get him then why not try and sign Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund. They would probably have to break their transfer record to do that.<br /><br />United have tried the approach of big names and big signings, but United are about something more than that. After all, why did they consider Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino? Because they wanted a manager who could mould and improve players and build a dynasty. This approach has to filter into the plans for summer signings. United should be going after players like Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Crystal Palace and Bournemouth’s David Brooks - young players who will want a chance to prove themselves at the highest level, who can add something to United’s squad</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard leaving would hit Chelsea as hard as Thierry Henry’s departure did Arsenal back in 2007]</b> It will be as big a loss to a team as Thierry Henry was when he left to go to Barcelona. He <b>[Hazard]</b> is up there with the very best. If he gets you from a standing start and he stops, you’re in trouble. There aren’t many players I can say that about. He goes from zero to 50 in a split second, then he’s gone. He’ll go either way. How many players can go either way? You know he’s going to beat you. Take the first goal last night, there’s not much that any defender could do about that. The speed, acceleration, ability - if you go near him, you know it’s going to be a penalty. He is just a very talented boy. I do think he’ll leave this summer, it’s a consequence of his contract running down. Zidane was his hero, so he will want to taste pastures new<br /><br />At least we’re not seeing a player down tools. We’re seeing a player play the best football he can</p>

The obvious candidate, because he’s out of work, would be Jose <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>. The trouble is, we don’t know where Jose is with his relationships, because he has broken a few.

No, because of his relationship with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and the way he was sacked in his second stint with the club. But you need someone who goes in above Frank with huge experience, who can deal with board room, deal with the issues from the owner and just be a buffer for you in many different ways. All the staff around Frank are all relatively new to these roles. Jose is going to have to find himself a way back in. He’s said he still wants to be a manager, but Frank needs someone who has experienced a hell of a lot. A <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a>, a <a href="claudio-ranieri.html">Claudio Ranieri</a>, even his uncle <a href="harry-redknapp.html">Harry Redknapp</a> - someone of that stature who might not be working who he can employ and have above him to help him.

It’s a weird one, I’m throwing Jose out there which seems a no-goer. But I’m talking about having someone upstairs who would make your job a lot easier with the owners and directors, having someone who is batting your corner. I was using Jose as an example, but the problem in that example is Jose. I don’t even know where Frank’s relationship is with Jose, I was just giving an example of a type of people who could come in above him</p>

Fans love to see a local boy come through or at least a player who has come through their club’s system. So I think the timing has been very fortunate, almost convenient. Frank will be given a lot of leeway, even if he has a difficult season. The difficulty for him will come after that</p>

  <p><b>[Tony Cascarino says <a href="antonio-rudiger.html">Antonio Rudiger</a> is <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s best natural defender]</b> I think there’s a lot of learning to be done with <a href="fikayo-tomori.html">Tomori</a> and <a href="kurt-zouma.html">Zouma</a>. They’re a partnership that Frank trusts, but there are mistakes there too regularly. They’re both young men in the early part of their career, but big clubs don’t allow you to go through this period of indifference. They miss <a href="antonio-rudiger.html">Rudiger</a> enormously, because he is their best natural defender<br /><br />We’ve competed in the game. They’re always going to give you problems here in an attacking sense. But we contributed really well, especially in those first 25 minutes. We arrived in their box a lot and looked so dangerous on the counter. The biggest disappointment was our final third quality, that last pass and that last cross. Those important things win you games and we fell short, hence the result</p>

  <p><b>[Tony Cascarino says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have been warned that they cannot expect to outscore everybody]</b> I get why <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans are excited about the team’s attacking flair, they always look like getting goals. But I cannot see them winning the Champions League if they defend the way they did. This has been a problem since Frank has taken over. He’s got a very young and naive team defensively.<br /><br />He’s had <b>[Kurt]</b> <a href="kurt-zouma.html">Zouma</a> and <b>[Fikayo]</b> <a href="fikayo-tomori.html">Tomori</a> playing at centre-half, with <b>[Andreas]</b> <a href="andreas-christensen.html">Christensen</a> and <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a> at full-back. James, in the 94th minute, is literally on the 18 yard box, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have been countered and they nearly lost the game!<br /><br />I think they will be punished if they defend in that manner where they are playing so aggressively. Look, Kepa saved a penalty, conceded twice and <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a> still missed four sitters. <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> cannot win the Champions League if they think they’re just going to outscore everybody. Can they win games? Yeah, they can beat anyone on their day, but I can’t see them putting in a really mundane and professional defensive performance, like the one that won <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> the final last season against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>. I think there’s a lot more to come from this <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team, but I think it might be too early for them</p>

Not bad, but I had a phone call and things were said. If I’m being brutally honest, I’ve always found Frank to be a little bit spiky with some of the things that you say, and you can be complimentary but Frank takes it slightly the wrong way. I’m not convinced by his management at times this year, because I do think it’s an easy excuse just to go youngster, youngster - he’s changed that team a hell of a lot.<br /><br /><b>[Cascarino also weighed in on <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>’s decision to drop £72 million ($93m) goalkeeper Kepa in favour of <a href="wilfredo-caballero.html">Caballero</a>, insisting the Spaniard hasn’t been shown enough ‘loyalty’]</b> I don’t like the Kepa issue. He deserved to get dropped, but keeping him out of the team - I’m not so sure that’s a good decision. You have to show loyalty to players sometimes, even after a bad game. But it’s happening all over the pitch, everywhere has been changed, everybody has been changed around.
