  <p><b>[On-loan Eintracht Frankfurt defender Jesus Vallejo has revealed he may not return to Real Madrid when his temporary deal expires]</b> Until now, I’ve had no contact with Zidane, neither on the phone or in person. The closest contact between both clubs is the one between the athletics and rehab coaches because they coordinate and exchange information regarding form and development. Real ask about my performances and Eintracht answer. It could happen that someone from Real’s scouting department comes to Frankfurt to get direct info.<br /><br /><b>[Spanish newspapers have tipped Vallejo as the successor to Pepe in Real’s backline]</b> What was in the papers are rumors, you know yourself, they are not always the truth. Therefore, I concentrate on what I can influence, namely, on my performance. It’s not confirmed that I have to go back. Real are not obliged to do something now, maybe they only do something in June. What the club does: They advise players what’s good for their short-term future. I don’t waste a lot of thoughts on what could happen until the summer. I live in the here and now</p>

  <p><b>[Jesus Vallejo is adamant he has a future at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and plans to stay after overcoming injury problems]</b> We only talk about how the season has gone. But I am clear that I want to stay. I want to stay. I am very happy in the club and I feel very loved by the fans as well as by my team-mates. The coach also gave me confidence in the last matches. I’m looking forward to the new season to help the team. It has been a complicated season, especially at the beginning due to injuries. It’s not been easy, but it made me improve myself. I am very happy with how I finished, for having done it playing and finding myself well. As for the team, we have to improve and learn a lot from this year</p>

But I want to stay at Madrid. I’m very happy and I want to succeed at the club.</p>
