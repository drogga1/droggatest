<blockquote>
  <p>[Jesus Vallejo is adamant he has a future at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and plans to stay after overcoming injury problems] We only talk about how the season has gone. But I am clear that I want to stay. I want to stay. I am very happy in the club and I feel very loved by the fans as well as by my team-mates. The coach also gave me confidence in the last matches. I’m looking forward to the new season to help the team. It has been a complicated season, especially at the beginning due to injuries. It’s not been easy, but it made me improve myself. I am very happy with how I finished, for having done it playing and finding myself well. As for the team, we have to improve and learn a lot from this year</p>

  <p>[Jesus Vallejo plans to stay at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and fight for his place rather than join an expected exodus from the Liga giants] I’m very focused on the national team [ahead of Sunday’s European Under-21 Championship final] . But I want to stay at Madrid. I’m very happy and I want to succeed at the club.</p>
