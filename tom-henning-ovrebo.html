<blockquote>
  <p><b>[At Stamford Bridge on May 6, 2009, Chelsea saw four separate penalty appeals waved away by referee Tom Henning Ovrebo during an enthralling Champions League semi-final second-leg clash with Barcelona]</b> When you come into the dressing room after a match like that, you go ‘ah Tom Henning, you did not perform at your best today.’ As a referee at that level, also in England, you are used to the supporters. You are used to the media. You are prepared to know that you would cause a lot of disturbance in many ways. Other referees like me had similar experiences Urs Meier from Switzerland <b>[England vs Portugal]</b>, Anders Frisk from Sweden <b>[also Chelsea vs Barcelona]</b>. You can also mention others, of course. We knew when you have a match like this in this kind of game that you will have some reaction afterwards. In a way we were prepared for that.<br /><br />When I look back at my career, I can look at those two, three, four, five per cent of matches that were really shitty or I can look at 95% that were great and I think as a referee and also as a player or coach, you have some ups and downs in your career. It is important that you look at your ups and downs and still enjoy the other matches and even enjoy the matches where you didn’t perform up to an optimal standard. The special thing about refereeing is that it is a very thin line between heaven and hell. If you do a big mistake in a very important game, your career could be finished but if you do a big mistake as a player or a coach in a big game, your career can still continue so in that way it is easier to be a player or a coach than a referee because you know that the consequences if you make a big mistake in your career usually that would be a big scratch in your career<br /><br />You can understand it but you can’t defend it in a way. There are also some representatives from Chelsea who were very professional. Hiddink, for example, who was the coach at the time. He was very professional. He was, of course, understandably critical, but he behaved like a gentleman and very professionally. Some of the representatives from Chelsea were maybe over the line but some of the representatives were also very professional. So I think it is important to not say it is black or white, it is more colourful in a way. The summer of 2009, I had to go to a hearing at UEFA because of all the incidents and all of that. I met Drogba and some of the lawyers from Chelsea. I had a short talk with Mr Drogba and, of course, he is a nice man. He is a nice player. He was a gentleman and we both agreed that maybe we could have done some things differently. So when it was off the pitch again, everything was more quiet. People were behaving professionally<br /><br />When the Champions League continued in August of 2009, I didn’t get the matches at the same standard again. Step-by-step, I got good matches and, in 2010, we got Bayern Munich versus Fiorentina. But, unfortunately, we missed a clear offside. So, then, you had two matches in which my team and I had not performed very well. After that match I didn’t get any more in the Champions League but I continued to referee in the national league in Norway. Unfortunately, I got injured in 2012. I tried to make a comeback but I had to stop in 2013<br /><br />I remember when I told my mum. You must remember I was very small and she said, ‘Tom, are you sure about this, shouldn’t you wait a couple of years?’ But then when I said ‘No, I would like to try it’, she supported me very much. Also, my friends didn’t care too much, as long as I joined them for other kinds of sports. None of them were negative. My dad supported me as well. He was travelling a lot so he didn’t see many of the games but he did support me as well. You get criticised, you get bullied. People laugh at you but that’s part of refereeing but, of course, you have to cope with it.<br /><br />After that, I went into mental health work. I worked with people that had different kinds of mental problems and lots of different health issues; helping them to cope with different situations and stuff like that. I found that interesting. Afterwards I got interested in sports psychology and I got the opportunity 10 years ago to work at the Olympic sports centre as a psychologist. Later this month, I will start at the Norwegian school of sports science to do some more lectures in mental health and sport. I will continue also here as a psychologist in my private practice to meet people who suffer from anxiety and depression and meet different leader groups to help them to perform better. I enjoy my professional life<br /><br />For me, it usually went okay. Referees, whether it is football, handball, ice hockey or whatever it is, the tendency is for fans to bully or criticise them a little bit. But I think that’s just the life of a referee<br /><br />In my career, I also had matches in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, the semi-finals of the Europa League, I was at Euro 2008 but there was also the possibility for me to go to the 2010 World Cup. If we had a good performance in that match <b>[Chelsea against Barcelona]</b>, maybe I could have continued into the World Cup. When you have a match like that, with that many controversial situations, that kind of reaction from the players, you have a mark against you. Then, of course, there are a lot of good referees and it is natural for UEFA and FIFA to pick other referees. But I think that was the match that made the difference<br /><br />It would have been good to have had that system in <b>[the Chelsea-Barca]</b> game. I am very positive for any kind of system that can improve the standard of refereeing<br /><br />My motto in my life is that ‘It is better to get bullied than for people to forget you’, so I think that the fans can continue bullying me if they want to; for me, that is no problem.
I look back at my matches with great memories. It is no problem if people want to use that match as an example <b>[of bad refereeing]</b>; that’s okay with me. Of course, Tuesday’s game will be a good one to watch. I would like to referee it as well; that would be even better. But I think that it’s too late for that. But I will watch it. Maybe I will even referee it a little bit from my chair back home</p>
