  <p><b>[Radja Nainggolan continues to be linked with Chelsea]</b> Nainggolan doesn’t like the rain, but he is among the best midfielders in the world and has to get accustomed to that too if he wants to play in the best teams. He can do it, because he’s a phenomenon. Let’s be honest, we’re not up to the standard of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid.<br /><br />My future is in Roma’s hands. If they want to keep me, they know what to do. If they want to sell me, then I can’t do anything about that. It’s difficult to say we’re targeting the Scudetto, because Juventus are really strong and, as we’ve seen, they don’t drop points. Our objective is to get into the Champions League and we’ve got a very important Coppa Italia semi-final against Lazio coming up. We can overturn that 2-0 first leg defeat, as we are the stronger side and we just have to prove it on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Lionel Messi is capable of making something happen every time he touches the ball]</b> <b>[Pep]</b> Guardiola is right when he says there’s no way to stop him <b>[Messi]</b>. Even if you could fix that somehow and maybe block him off, there are 10 others that can hurt you. Of course, Barcelona are still something else without Messi. We’ll have to do our best<br /><br />We know that it’ll be very tough to play against Barcelona at the Camp Nou but we have nothing to lose. We have to try to show our spirit, work hard and capitalise on any chances we get. We have to be mindful that the tie is played over 180 minutes. We’ll have to try to get a good result in Barcelona while remembering that there’s still the home leg to come</p>

  <p><b>[Roma overturned a 4-1 first leg lead in shocking fashion, beating the Catalan side 3-0 at the Stadio Olimpico]</b> We have our crowd behind us, nobody can beat us. We need these fans to give us a push. If they always flock here in these numbers, Roma can become one of the best teams in Italy.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid are stronger without Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> He <b>[Ronaldo]</b> is a champion, but Madrid will always be Madrid. Now they play more as a team. Now players like Gareth Bale, who were always behind Ronaldo, like everyone is, are appearing. That was logical and now you will see the talent of all the players and the team. The whole team played for him and now it will be stronger, I’m sure.<br /><br />Never. We are not scared of anyone. Respect yes, but fear no. They have an amazing team, a great spine, great up front, at the back… but fear, no<br /><br />Ronaldo in recent times has been at an incredible level, the best in the world. He has scored so many goals, won a load of Champions Leagues, a European Championship with Portugal, a load of good games. He has been at an incredible level and it’s normal to speak about him</p>

  <p><b>[Roma defender Kostas Manolas is reluctant to be drawn on reports suggesting that he is a transfer target for Real Madrid]</b> I haven’t spoken to anyone about Real Madrid. I don’t know what I can say. People can say a lot of things but I haven’t<br /><br />I don’t know. I can’t say that myself. I am a competitive player and I like to give everything. That I can say<br /><br />All of their players could play for Roma. It’s normal. <b>[Luka]</b> Modric or Sergio Ramos, who for me is the best defender in the world and it would be a pleasure to play by his side</p>

  <p><b>[Kostas Manolas has a €36 million release clause in his contract]</b> If a club like Real Madrid or Barcelona were to come along, apart from Francesco Totti who turned them down, I think everyone would think about it. We’d then have to evaluate the conditions, because I can assure you that it’s not easy for anyone to leave Roma. Totti was fundamental in convincing me to stay. I spoke to him more than I did <b>[director of sport]</b> Monchi. I don’t feel like a leader and I am not the captain. It doesn’t matter that I’ve been here for many years. We are all the same in the locker room. Now talented young players have arrived and they need our help. All I can pledge is that I’ll give my all.<br /><br />I renewed my contract and I think I deserved it. I could’ve left two or three times last season, but I didn’t do it and I had my best campaign here. I’ve never been asked to remove the clause. In any case, I don’t think the clause is that low. Football prices have gone through the roof and beyond normality, so if Roma consider it inadequate as a sum, they can call me to discuss it. I had been very close to Zenit St Petersburg, but I saw the figures were all in Rubles. I asked them to change it to dollars and they refused. When they changed their minds days later, I’d already made my decision. It was destiny</p>
