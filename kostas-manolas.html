Kostas Manolas has joined Napoli as the defender has finalised a departure from AS Roma. The 28-year-old Greece international will switch Serie A sides this summer with Napoli having paid €36m to secure the defender’s services</p>

  <p>[Kostas Manolas has posted a farewell message to Roma on social media] I want to thank the coaches, team-mates and all the fans who have stood by me and supported me over the years. I spent five wonderful years, I always gave everything with love for this team</p>

  <p>[Kostas Manolas is set to form one of the best centre-back pairings in Serie A alongside Kalidou Koulibaly following his €36 million arrival] I found a very good atmosphere and a warm welcome. I won’t tell you the reason I left Roma, as it’s personal. The first call I received about Napoli was from my agent, then the director and the coach. They made me feel secure about my decision and it was clear straight away that they really wanted me in this team. I never had doubts, that’s why I chose Napoli and I am sure I made the right decision. I liked watching the way Napoli played and was eager to become a part of it. I’d give anything to win the Scudetto here. Carlo Ancelotti is unique for what he’s won throughout his career. I promise that I’ll do everything I can to help the team achieve their targets and aim as high as possible</p>
