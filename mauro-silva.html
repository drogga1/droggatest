<blockquote>
  <p>[Trauma of the 7-1 destroyed Brazil, but now they’re World Cup favourites] It was a very difficult time. The 7-1 was the biggest blow that Brazilian football had ever suffered in all its history. Unfortunately, it did not go well for Dunga and it ended up costing him his job, as it did [technical coordinator] Gilmar. I was happy to try to be help, to try and collaborate but unfortunately the project did not work out<br /><br />At [the first] major competition [since the Germany defeat], the team felt a lot of pressure when they took to the field, the 7-1 weighed heavily and they felt a great responsibility, it was still a kind of trauma. At the Copa America we saw that the team went through some very delicate moments, you could see the team were quite affected, emotionally.<br /><br />I think it was a very emotional time. We can take into account other factors, but there’s not one single thing that can explain a disaster like that. But for me, from the moment it was decided that the World Cup was to be played in Brazil, it was clear there would be a huge emotional burden. Playing a World Cup anywhere is difficult, but in Brazil, with all the expectation of the fans, it was going to be even more difficult. The group arrived at that moment and just had a blackout. We never saw Brazil playing calmly, playing with joy; we saw the team tense, under pressure, moments where the players displayed their nerves, where they cried during the national anthem<br /><br />It would be great if the World Cup started tomorrow. Unfortunately, there is still some time before then but Tite and Edu are doing a great job. I think the atmosphere has changed a lot. There are other strong teams, of course, but Brazil are in great form at the moment and is my favourite</p>
