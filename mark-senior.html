  <p><b>[The making of Mason Greenwood: Discovered by accident before scoring 16 on debut!]</b> Scouts saw him when he wasn’t even playing; they were watching another player that day. Mason just wanted to join a local team in Bradford called Idle Juniors, but he wasn’t old enough, so he was kicking a ball around on the side of the pitch, waiting for his sixth birthday. As soon as he was six, we made sure we had someone to watch his first game. The team he was playing for had never won a game, and I am not sure they had even scored a goal. Then, Mason scored 16 on his debut and they won 16-1. A six-year-old made the local newspaper!<br /><br /><b>[Sometimes it takes months, even years, for these youngsters to make it to The Cliff. But Bradford-born <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> impressed straight away]</b> He came to our development centre the night his goals from the weekend had made the local newspaper. I got there a little bit early and Mason was already there in the car park smashing balls against the wall, with both feet. It was incredible. I asked him, ‘So, are you this Mason who scored 16 goals at the weekend? Was it a bit easy for you?’ He looked at me and said, ‘If it weren’t for me, we would have lost 1-0’. He went straight into the development centre in <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a>, into the age group above his own. Every single club quickly got wind of Mason, so then they were all after him<br /><br /><b>[The problem with <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Greenwood</a> was that everything he did was attracting attention]</b> We would go down to The Cliff to train with our youngsters (from the <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> centre) and we would be asking the other coaches - who have seen some of the best young talent to come through the ranks - what they thought about Mason and they were saying, ‘This boy is special!’. We used to joke and say, ‘If he doesn’t make it, we may as well all pack in!’. You have a feeling about some people, you think that if this particular player grows and develops, then he has a chance. But with Mason, it was obvious. No coach can claim to develop a player like him; he has just got it. Everything we taught him, he would pick it up within 30 seconds. There was almost no point coaching him. I am pretty sure he broke the 100 metres record when he was around 13 for Great Britain Schools. The story goes that he got out of his car at this athletics meeting and beat everyone by four or five seconds, with no-warm up. He then played around with his football by the car, and went home<br /><br /><b>[Given Greenwood’s unblemished track record, and the fact that he has only just turned 18, maybe, just maybe, he will be the one to finally emulate the achievements of the Class of ‘92]</b> Every time he plays, at any level, he produces. There is no reason to think he cannot keep doing it at United. Fans have been calling for him for a while. He was not cocky, he was a nice kid, he was just confident. <a href="alan-smith.html">Alan Smith</a> was similar to that when he was a kid. He was the same in what he would say - some people just know they are going to play at a high level, even when so young. The sky is the limit for Mason Greenwood</p>
