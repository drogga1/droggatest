  <p><b>[Victorious Côte d’Ivoire coach Herve Renard about consoling Ghana’s <a href="andre-ayew.html">Andre Ayew</a> after the latter had lost the CAF Africa Cup of Nations final]</b> In those kind of situations, it is very difficult to find the right words. But I told him that <a href="yaya-toure.html">Yaya Toure</a>, the best player in Africa, lost two African Cup finals, like you, so never give up. I know you are sad, but it will come for you</p>

  <p><b>[Herve Renard has resigned as coach of Morocco after three and a half years in charge]</b> Morocco will always remain for me a country with which I lived incredible emotions. It was a great adventure started in the anonymity of a return from Cape Verde to Egypt via Gabon and Russia, and that the progression of the team, from 81st place <b>[in the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> rankings]</b> in 2016 to today, has given rise to important ambitions in the hearts of a whole people and Moroccan fans. I am proud of what we have achieved and how far we have managed to hoist Moroccan football.<br /><br />In addition to our <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> ranking (47th), we have twice reached the second round of the AFCON, including a quarter final, a performance not achieved since 2004, but also participation in the 2018 World Cup after 20 years of absence for Morocco, first time unforgettable for me. Yes, we had all hoped for better for this AFCON 2019 in Egypt, but this is football, it gives birth to the wildest hopes and brings us hard to the reality of an early elimination on penalties! It is time for me to close this long and beautiful chapter of my life, not without emotion and sadness, but it is an inevitable decision taken well before AFCON 2019</p>

  <p><b>[Rise of the Underdog: Zambia’s AFCON fairytale with a very tragic origin]</b> It’s like we’re in front of one big mountain. We have to climb it but we don’t have a helicopter and we don’t have a car. We just need to have a lot of courage and to think ‘Yes, we can do it. I am 100 per cent sure we can do it. God has given us this opportunity to be here and now we must win this Africa Cup of Nations for the Zambia national team from 1993<br /><br />We wanted to honour the dead players and that strengthened us. Our first game was against Senegal and the team was on its way to Senegal for a match when the plane crashed. The plane crashed in Gabon and we won the final in Gabon. It was a sign of destiny, written in the sky. There was a force with us</p>
