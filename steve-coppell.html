      <td>Steve Coppell was fast, tricky, determined, and to this day, the right winger signed by <a href="tommy-docherty.html">Tommy Docherty</a> from Tranmere Rovers for £60,000 in 1975 holds the record of most competitive appearances for United. Between 1977 and ‘81, he played 207 times in a row<br /><br />In his first season, he helped <a href="tommy-docherty.html">Docherty</a>’s exciting young side storm back into the top flight after a year in the Second Division. Coppell even earned an economics degree at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> University during his time at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>. Coppell was forced to retire in October 1983 due to the injury he suffered playing for England against Hungary in a World Cup qualifier 18 months before<br /><br />He said that the high challenge in that game felt like ‘someone had put a firework in my knee, and it had gone off,’ ultimately ending his career at only 28. But for that injury, he would have been able to count on adding at least another 200 appearances to his record of 373 in United’s No. 7 shirt</td>

  <p><b>[In 1977 Peter Barnes and Steve Coppell lined up against <a href="claudio-gentile.html">Claudio Gentile</a> for the first time in their careers]</b> We put a cross in and we both slid, and he sort of put his hand on my testicles and I would say it was a playful squeeze, but it was little tighter than that. It made me yelp for a little bit</p>
