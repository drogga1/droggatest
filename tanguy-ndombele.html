  <p><b>[Who is Tanguy Ndombele? Tottenham’s new midfield sensation compared to Chelsea star N’Golo Kante]</b> I like to speak on the pitch, I’m not very comfortable with microphones and cameras. I know it’s part of the job, but I don’t really like to talk about myself</p>

<p>: 2019 07 02b
Tottenham have confirmed the €60 million signing of midfielder Tanguy Ndombele from Lyon, in a record transfer for the club</p>

<p>: 2019 07 03
Lyon have announced the signing of Lille midfielder Thiago Mendes, who will help fill the void left by the departure of Tanguy Ndombele.</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham’s record signing Tanguy Ndombele says Mauricio Pochettino was the key in convincing him to switch Lyon for London]</b> It was deeply thought through. Tottenham have one of the best managers in the world. The fact that he <b>[Pochettino]</b> wants you, it makes you want to come work with him. He was the one who shifted my decision. It is difficult to describe but he knows how to touch people, to leave a mark on people. He looked at me in the eyes and said: ‘Come with me, I am sure that you will progress’. It is these types of little things that made me want to sign over there. I could see that he really, genuinely wanted me, that he genuinely liked me.<br /><br /><b>[Ndombele is his own player, and he is confident of making the step up from Ligue 1]</b> I have heard it all. I am here to make my own path. Paul has made his own in England. I am Tanguy, not the new Michael Essien, not the new Pogba. In my head I am ready, but it is the on-pitch stuff that does the talking. Let’s wait for the matches to come and see if I am ready or not. I do not have a lot of fears. But it is football; how many people have been good and then the year after, they struggle? We are going to make it so that things go well<br /><br /><b>[He is excited for the challenge, and has no regrets about turning down the chance to join his hometown club in PSG]</b> Yes, PSG are a great club, in the city in which I grew up. Today, I am not disappointed. Not at all. Aside from football, as a man, it is better for me to go to London, it will allow me to discover a new country, a new culture of football. I am going to come out of my cocoon. I am someone who watches a lot of football, so I know <b>[the club]</b>. I used to watch Robbie Keane, Dimitar Berbatov. When I look at Tottenham, I see a big European club. It is another dimension. To go to the next level, it was the best choice</p>

  <p><b>[Tanguy Ndombele says his first experience of Premier League football was more intense than what he was used to in Ligue 1]</b> As I have said, I am not used to scoring, so, it’s good for me and for the team. The most important thing is that we won today. It was difficult for me. The football moves quicker here, there is more intensity. In France, often when you win the ball you try to calm the play down, but here you try to push forward immediately. And I am going to try to adapt as quickly as possible. This is a nice squad, the young ones as well as the older ones, the squad seems quite harmonious, it is a squad that has gotten close over several years. I am just trying to integrate and do what is needed on the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Tanguy Ndombele admits the pace of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has presented his biggest challenge since completing a club-record €60 million move to Tottenham]</b> Between <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> and <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> there’s not really a great deal of difference. They are both teams that play with the ball. The big difference between <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> is the speed. Here in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> it is always a fast paced game. The players drive forward, but in France there are periods of calm. That is the big difference<br /><br /><b>[Ndombele has been slotted straight into Mauricio Pochettino’s side]</b> I’m not the kind of person who sets themselves any limits. We are going to try to go as far as we can and try to achieve something. The season is long and I hope we can achieve to the best of our abilities<br /><br /><b>[Ndombele believes he is well placed to aid the <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> cause]</b> Things have been going well. Everyone has given me a warm welcome, the fans have welcome me too, so yes things are going well. Everybody has welcomed me into the team, that is the most important thing when you are a new arrival. Everything is going well so far</p>

  <p><b>[Tottenham midfielder Tanguy Ndombele says he knows he has to keep moving forward as a player, or he risks being forgotten]</b> I’m staying focused, I’m trying to move forward, but always knowing that things can go backwards quickly. Maybe in five years we will not talk about me anymore. In football there are always little gems that appear every year. I still watch Ligue 1; at Rennes there is the youngster <b>[Eduardo]</b> Camavinga who is 16 years old. That’s why I say that we must always stay focused<br /><br /><b>[On a day-to-day basis, though, Ndombele is concentrating on his own self-improvement, and he knows a record transfer fee isn’t enough to consider himself a success]</b> You never know in football, it’s about humility. You see big players like <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> or <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, they have five Ballons d’Or and they still want more. I just signed for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, I don’t have the right to be satisfied, I still want more. I was told that I was a little too nonchalant. I’m trying to improve it. Whether it’s in a match, in training, even in the way I walk, I am trying to improve myself</p>
