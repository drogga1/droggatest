  <p><b>[Ashley Young has responded to comments from Roy Keane suggesting that Manchester United will struggle with him in a defensive role]</b> I think a lot has been said about defenders - a lot was said last week - and it’s one of those things. Everyone’s entitled to their opinion. Keep getting clean sheets and hopefully we can chip in with goals as well as the front boys.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho may have conceded defeat in the Premier League title race]</b> Until the points tally <b>[confirms it]</b> is over, we won’t say that we are going to give up. It’s about picking up points home and away, picking up wins. A lot will be said about the way you pick up points, but when you come to the end of the season, that is the main thing - picking up points - and that’s exactly what we will be looking do. We have to make sure that we keep winning. We say before every game that it is another important game, but every game is important now leading up to this final run towards the end of the season.<br /><br />We are in a lot of competitions; there are points to play for and cups to play for. That’s what every footballer wants to do; you want to be in the big competitions to go and have a chance to win them. And when we come to the game on Monday, hopefully we will be saying we got the three points</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Young is hoping to be given the chance to retire as a Manchester United player]</b> It’s reported every year that I am about to leave but I’ve always wanted to be here. And for as long as I can, I’d like to finish my career at United. I’ve got that mentality to keep going and change people’s minds. I know how to play the game, I’ve got a football brain, and feel as fit and healthy as I did when I was younger. I’d be able to give the 23-year-old me a race.<br /><br />My legs might take a bit longer to recover after games but other than that, I feel as fit as ever. The manager has high standards he wants to keep. He enjoys a joke but when it’s time to get down to serious work, you need to be serious. As players you don’t have to be told. You will see people come back disappointed if they’ve lost a game in training. It’s that Man United mentality. There is no better feeling than success at this club<br /><br />I think United is the biggest club in the world. I got a sense of it from my first pre-season tour to America. It was a long flight, I was tired and ready to go to my hotel room when we arrived. Then I saw the amount of fans outside the hotel, and they didn’t leave the whole time we were there. I’m a private person and like to keep away from things when I’m not playing. But I understand as a United footballer, you’ll be recognised nearly everywhere and people want to have things signed or pictures taken. It’s part of the territory and you have to embrace it</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Young admits to no longer being sure of his best position after being turned from a fleet-footed winger into a dogged full-back by Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho]</b> I don’t know <b>[my best position]</b>. I’m not sure anymore. I still see myself as a winger because I’ve played there for so long. I’ve played as a No. 10 as well. There are so many positions and I think it’s only goalkeeper and centre-half that I haven’t played so far <b>[for United]</b>. But wherever the manager calls upon me, I will go out there and give 100 per cent and look to play well, which I think I’ve done this season. As a footballer, you always want to play and I wanted to be involved in more games this season. There are plenty more to play, and as long as I am playing well and the manager’s happy, I want to be pulling on the shirt.</p>

I feel he can be one of the best in the world. As I say, you’ve just got to work hard<br /><br />They’ve taken up that option and I’m delighted to be there for another season. It is a fantastic place to be at and hopefully we can do more than we have this season</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Young admits winning the league is where we need to be]</b> If we win at the weekend, and finishing second, it will be a very good campaign but, if you ask all the players and staff, winning the league is where we need to be at. I think that’s the disappointment but, overall, I think it’s been a good season and, if we win the FA Cup, it’s been a very good season. Of course there’s excitement <b>[for the final]</b>. There is not anyone who is not excited. We’ve been there before and must prepare this week in the right way, which we will do. Everybody is wanting to be starting, wanting to play, and I’m no different. I want to play in the FA Cup final and obviously want success. There is no better feeling than when you win the FA Cup and walk up those stairs to pick up that trophy. Hopefully, we can do that.<br /><br />It’s been a massive boost for me, playing week in and week out. I’m playing in a new position and feel like I can adapt. I’ve got a good footballing brain. I know where to be on the pitch and when to attack and when to defend. I’ve enjoyed the season and it’s gone even better than I had thought as I’ve got myself back in the England squad. Fingers crossed for when the squad is announced, hopefully that would be an achievement in itself</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Young admits Manchester United will need to return stronger in 2018-19 if they are to right the wrongs of a trophyless campaign]</b> I think we have to come back stronger: stronger in the league, stronger in the FA Cup, stronger in the League Cup, stronger in the Champions League. We want to be fighting on all fronts. We have the summer now to look forward and come back and prepare in pre-season. We wanted to win things, win titles, but it wasn’t meant to be. We finished second with the points we did; in a different season we would have won the league, but it wasn’t meant to be and today is a disappointing one. It will take a while to settle in and we now have the summer to prepare for next season.<br /><br /><b>[On the FA Cup final]</b> It’s disappointing starting the game like we did and coming away with nothing. You can see how the players reacted after the game; we didn’t feel like we should have lost the game today. We didn’t have clear-cut chances, but on a different day there were chances we could have taken and we could have gone on and won the game. In the second half they were on the back foot, it was all us, but we couldn’t get the goal and we are disappointed with that<br /><br /><b>[On World Cup in Russia]</b> There is excitement that is to come, but right now I am disappointed and it’s going to be hard to shake off</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United veteran Ashley Young has insisted that the squad cannot wait to right the wrongs of their Carabao Cup exit]</b> When you lose or draw a game, you want another game as quick as possible. Saturday is another day, there’s another game and we will be looking to get the three points at West Ham. We have to dust ourselves down now, pick ourselves back up and go again on Saturday. This was a disappointing night and we have to get back to winning ways, get back to training and build and work again and work for the weekend.<br /><br />At 1-0 we had chances to win the match and on a different day the ball goes in the back of the net and it is a different game. When you play teams from the lower divisions it is always going to be tough and they had more intensity than we did. Obviously when you are playing these games you have to show that intensity and go further than the opposition but we didn’t do that and we got punished and they won the game</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Young has urged Manchester United to build on their strong performance against Chelsea by setting out to attack Juventus]</b> I think we deserved to win it. Especially when we got back into the game and we really did get on top, but this is what we have to do <b>[against Juventus]</b>. We have to go into the game looking to start on more of the front foot, especially at home. That’s the way we have got to do it, like we did in the second half against Newcastle and for 60, 65 minutes of this game against Chelsea and as long as we play that way then I am sure we will get the right result.<br /><br />We have to take the positives from the game and I think the way we played in the second half especially, we were fantastic at times. On another day we could have scored a third goal, but it wasn’t meant to be. It comes off the post, David <b>[de Gea]</b> saves it, it goes back to their man and they score. It is disappointing, but we have to take the positives from the game and kick on from here. There were spaces for us to play in, especially in the first half when we got the ball to our front three and we actually said it was fairly easy to get it to them, but that end pass, that cross or that <b>[final]</b> shot is what we needed to improve and we did that in the second half. Like I say, on another day we could have gone on to get another goal, but it wasn’t meant to be</p>

You get that feel of the club, you know the size of the club. For me, the biggest club in the world - always has been, always will be. I know the history, the boys in the squad know the history. It’s all about winning trophies, silverware. That’s what the club is all about. You go into the museum, see what’s been won and want to be a part of that. I’ve been part of that and we’ve had successful years in the last couple of years. I’m 33, nearly 34 now, that’s not changed for me. I still want trophies, still want to win things and that’s what everyone in the squad wants. Everyone wants to win</p>

But it wasn’t meant to be and, like I say, it’s disappointing.<br /><br />It is always disappointing to obviously concede. I think we were containing them. There was a lot of pressure obviously in the second half, which we knew <b>[would come]</b>. I didn’t think they were going to score, then obviously the two deflected goals, you know, it deflates us and obviously they go on to win the game. Like I say, it’s definitely a disappointment<br /><br />Yeah, especially in the first half. Obviously after their goal we got ourselves back into the game and I think for large parts we had time and space on the ball to play. I think at times we done that, I think we could have done that even more. But, like I say, we’ve come off the pitch, we’ve lost the game, so we’re disappointed</p>

You go out there as a player and you want to win, play for the badge, play for this fantastic club, the best club in the world and for us now it’s about looking ahead and looking at the next couple of games we’ve got coming up. It’s a busy Christmas period and we want to get points on the board and start getting ourselves back up the table.<br /><br />I’m sure Ole is excited to be back, Mike Phelan as well. For Ole to walk back in here must feel unbelievable. The fans love him, he loves the club and it can only be a good thing for us. With me being one of the older heads, I <b>[previously]</b> worked under Mike and it’s nice to see him back on the training pitch again<br /><br />Carras, Kieran and Emilio have been fantastic. The training sessions they’ve put on have been fantastic, top notch. I can definitely see Carras being a manager one day and Kieran has been brilliant stepping up to the first team <b>[from the Under-18s]</b>. He’s taken to it like a duck to water and Emilio is a fantastic goalkeeping coach. It’s nice for them to be here and work under Mick and Ole as well. The main thing for us has been not to be caught up in everything and instead just concentrate on our work on the pitch and get ourselves fully prepared for this weekend’s game. That’s all you can do as players; be prepared and be ready for the game that we’ve got coming up</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United defender Ashley Young has praised <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> for his immediate impact at Old Trafford]</b> When Ole Gunnar happened, somehow, I almost felt that Sir Alex Ferguson had returned. Because he was accompanied by Mike Phelan (Ferguson’s old assistant) and Michael Carrick, but also because Ole Gunnar knows exactly what it means to play for this club, he is obsessed with both victory and the fact that his players thrive on the field, like Sir Alex.<br /><br /><b>[Looking back on his two years working with Sir Alex Ferguson]</b> He rarely spoke in the dressing room. But he has such an aura that, as soon as he opens his mouth, all the players were silent, sat down and listened, and today I realise how lucky I was to play under him, that’s one of the great sources of pride in my career<br /><br />If I really had the choice, I would play winger, my favourite position. But over the years I’ve been here I’ve been playing different roles, I did not have a problem because I think I have a good understanding of the game. I also understood that this versatility is an asset for me, and for the club</p>

We showed that we’ve got that resilience to keep going right to the final whistle. We know what we’re capable of. People can write us off. People were writing us off at the start of the season and people are writing us off now. It’s no different.<br /><br />Obviously it’s going to be tough. It’s not going to be easy. We’ve got to go over there, win the game and score goals. I’ve got every faith if we defend well and if we create the chance that I know we can do, we can win the game</p>

They all want to train well, learn, talk and find things out and as a senior player when they come and ask you’re there to help and guide them. They’re great talents, that’s obviously why they’re with us and I’m sure if they get an opportunity on the pitch to show what they can do they’ll handle the pressure of pulling on the shirt. It’s just been to keep their feet on the ground and keep learning and keep training hard. It’s obviously a bonus for them to be with us but they’ve got themselves to this point and it’s now for them to work hard to stay with the first team.

  <p><b>[Ashley Young believes <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> boast the required depth in their squad to cover the injury-enforced absence of Paul <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>]</b> In this squad there are a lot of players who can come in and play in those positions. We have great competition for places throughout the squad. You have to be on your toes 24-7 and give 100 per cent in training. We have to go out there and perform and it is not difficult (for us). Obviously when you have a player like Paul missing it’s disappointing, but the boys that have played in those positions have done fantastically well. It will be great when he comes back into training, but like I say, it is competition for places<br /><br />Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I know what I see every day working hard on the training pitch. I know it is possible to go out there and get results. It has not gone as well as we would have liked and like the manager has said, we have gone on a mini run before the <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> defeat, but that is not going to dampen our spirits. We have got a big game now to go and qualify out of the group stages and we’ve got games coming up which we believe are winnable games. From this game we can go on another run and get the points on the board</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> captain Ashley Young cannot believe that team-mate <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> has been left out of France’s squad to face Moldova and Albania in Euro 2020 action]</b> For me I think France are missing out - I can’t understand why he’s not in their squad. That is up to them but he can only get better. You can see he is a natural goal scorer. The way Anthony plays with <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> is unplayable at times. Anthony was a big miss when he was injured<br /><br />Some of the combinations from the boys up front was unbelievable for us watching at the back. At times this season, we’ve blown teams away with our attacking. When you watch us going forward you think it is only going to be a matter of time before we score</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Young says <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> is a world-class player]</b> He’s a world-class player, and when he’s at it, it’s hard to stop him. He’s just growing and growing - and he’s still young. He’s one of those players who wants to be out there. He wants to be out on the training pitch improving himself, and he’s at his best when he plays off instincts. He just plays off the cuff, and it’s frightening to see. I see it day in, day out, and his confidence is sky-high right now - yet he’s still saying he wants to improve. It’s just the way he is and he’s just got that mentality<br /><br />I feel it helps when anybody thinks that United are underdogs going into a game. We know what we’ve got here. The team and the staff here know what we’re building on. I had every confidence that we would go out and win the game. After the draws we had, it was important for us to get back to winning ways. We said before the game that we had to be on the front foot, we had to start well - and we’ve done that in a lot of games. We’ve gone 1-0 up and not been able to see games out. On another day, I feel we could have got more but we had to defend as a team as well and be resilient<br /><br />Consistency has been the issue. Decisions or certain things we haven’t done in games - we haven’t stuck to our principles which is why we’ve not been able to get the right results. But everything came together in that game against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, and the confidence going into the Manchester derby will be sky-high. I don’t think words will be needed. Of course, it matters to the fans and it’s massive for the city. For us as players, I think everyone in the dressing room knows what it means. We’ve always got that ‘never-say-die’ attitude; that’s the Man United way - if the other team score one, you score two. The other team score two, you score three - that’s just how it is</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Young says <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> remains a baby-faced assassin]</b> A lot of people in the press still see him as the baby-faced assassin. But it was like I said before, when he arrived it was like the boss <b>[<a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>]</b> had walked back through the door. When he gets down the business, it’s serious. At times in the dressing room, he’s had to lose it, and I think that’s right when things aren’t going well. You need to be told that. He’s got a nice side and a horrible side, which I feel you need. A lot is said about managers, but it’s down to the players at the end of the day</p>

I wanted to leave in 2010. We’d spoken when I first came and <b>[the goal]</b> was to break into the top four. We weren’t able to do it and we were like it’s not happening, things were starting to tail off. Randy had been there for me from the start and I felt I did owe him, so I stayed for the extra year<br /><br />My agent called me and said: ‘Listen, you’re going into the last year of your contract, there are a few teams that are in for you’. He said <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. We’d already spoken to <b>[Manchester]</b> City. Then he said United had come in. And I said: ‘When am I meeting Sir Alex? Where’s the pen?’ There was no other place I wanted to go. The history of the club, the players that were here, what they’d achieved. For me, that was the place I wanted to be. I wanted to go there and put my marker down on this club and play for the biggest club, for me, in the world. As soon as my agent said that… we didn’t even meet Liverpool<br /><br /><b>[Young got his meeting with Ferguson and discussions with the legendary United boss helped to further convince him that <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> was the only place to be]</b> I always remember the meeting with Sir Alex in London. I think it was probably a two-hour meeting. Ten minutes of that, we spoke about football, the rest was about horses and wine! It was one of them where the boss has just got that aura. He challenged me and said you either sink or swim. That’s basically what it is, you’re going to be challenged every day. And that’s what I wanted. Ultimately, it was down to me to make the decision and as soon as I could sign here, I wanted to sign</p>

  <p><b>[Ashley Young says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> ‘should be pushing for titles and trophies’ as <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s vision starts to ‘come together’]</b> It’s just about keeping on winning. We’re going into the busy Christmas period now when it’s just game after game and it’s just about winning and getting points on the board. I always say talking about getting into the top four is not what our club is about, we should be pushing for titles and trophies. Obviously it’s a transitional period where we have to talk about getting into the top four but I think if different things had gone different ways especially this season in games we’d be further up the league. As long as we keep playing with the confidence we’ve shown and we keep building on what it is the manager wants us to build on then we’re going in the right direction. Things are starting to come together and performances are getting better and that’s the way we need to go, we need to keep bettering our performance.<br /><br /><b>[Young has been impressed by <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a>’s meteoric rise to prominence]</b> You can tell he’s <b>[Greenwood’s]</b> just a natural goalscorer and I think most of his goals have been pretty identical. I don’t think many defenders know what he’s going to do, as soon as he gets the ball he’s just got an eye for a goal. He’s been fantastic for us. He’s obviously been getting on the scoresheet but he’s also a kid that wants to learn and I think training with us day in, day out has brought him on massively. All the young boys have stepped up when they’ve had to as I said. We’ve had injuries in the squad so they’ve had to come in and when they’ve been called upon they’ve been brilliant. The game against <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, it being the 4000th match with an Academy player in the squad, I think it was fitting that an Academy player scored a goal and obviously a point isn’t what we wanted but that point could go a long come the end of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Inter’s Ashley Young advises on how to avoid coronavirus while under quarantine in Italy]</b> Realistically a supermarket is now your main risk at spreading this virus and even catching it. Speaking with family and friends at home it sounds like going to get food is just crazy. Remember, lockdown means lockdown!<br /><br />Queuing to go into supermarket is standard, but not because it’s for stockpiling or greed. Supermarkets have limited the number of people entering at any time so it’s never over-crowded! So wait and be patient to go in if your supermarket is doing this.<br /><br />If you have to get in the lift only get in with 1 more person, 2 people per lift at one time. And stand on opposite sides of the lift and face the wall - don’t breathe outwards towards that stranger.<br /><br />Always use gloves from moment you get out of your car! You don’t want to touch trolleys that other hands have been on. Keep the gloves on until you are getting back in the car. Use a face mask or scarf to keep you nose and mouth covered.<br /><br />Always keep your distance at the till. Keep the trolley behind you when you unpack at the till as it stops people from being able to to get too close.<br /><br />Don’t unpack your shopping right on top of somebody else, make a gap between theirs and yours so none of your shopping touches theirs. Here we can’t put our groceries on the belt until the person in front has finished paying.<br /><br />This may sound harsh but treat everybody that’s not in your household as if they have the virus, you just don’t know!!!</p>
