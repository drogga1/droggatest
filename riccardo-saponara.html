  <p><b>[<a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a>’s Riccardo Saponara in emotional Davide Astori tribute]</b> O captain, my captain. Why did you not come down to have breakfast with us all? Why did you not pick up your shoes from outside of Marco <b>[Sportiello]</b>’s room and then drink your orange juice, as usual?<br /><br />Now they’ll tell us that life goes on, that we must look forward and pick ourselves up, but what will your absence feel like? Who will arrive every morning in the cafeteria, warming up everyone with his smile?<br /><br />Who will ask us about what we did the previous night and have a laugh about it? Who will nurture the youngsters and give a sense of responsibility to the veterans? Who will form the circle to work on our ‘two-touch play’ and who will demolish Marco on the PlayStation?<br /><br />With whom will we debate about Masterchef, Florence’s restaurants, TV series or games played? Who will I lean on at lunch after a tiring training session? Come on, come back. You still need to finish watching LaLaLand to analyse like you did with all new movies<br /><br />Come back to Florence, they’re waiting for you to renew your contract and acknowledge all the good and the positivity that you bring to us on a daily basis. Get out of that damn room, we’ll be waiting for you tomorrow at training<br /><br />In life there are people you’ve known forever but have never bonded with, and then there are the ‘Davides’, who warm to you immediately with a simple ‘welcome to Florence, Ricky’. Wherever you are now, keep on defending our goal and enlighten the right path for us from the backline. Oh captain, my captain. Forever, my captain</p>

  <p><b>[How Fiorentina have come together to create history following Astori tragedy]</b> I am very anxious and suffer so much in the build-up to a game, my stomach gets in knots. Davide would try to shake me out of it and on the bus ride to the stadium would often send me Whatsapp messages of encouragement. Instead of listening to music like everyone else, he was thinking of others. That was Astori. He made you feel safe.<br /><br />When he died, I thought that’s it, I’ll never recover from this.</p>

  <p><b>[In a heart-breaking open letter to his departed Davide Astori]</b> Come back! You still have to finish watching ‘La La Land’ so you can analyse it like every other film that’s just come out. Come back to Florence! They’re waiting for you to renew your contract. Get out of that damn room! We’ll be waiting for you tomorrow, when training resumes… Wherever you are now, keep defending our goal and enlighten us on to the right path. O captain, my captain. Forever my captain.</p>
