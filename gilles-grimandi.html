  <p><b>[Former Arsenal player Gilles Grimandi has hit out at former players criticising manager Arsene Wenger]</b> The criticism saddens me because guys like Thierry and Martin, I like them, I have a good relationship with them, but there a sense of a polemic and I deplore that. To those who have become panellists, I want to say three things. Firstly, they must have short memories: they owe a great deal to Arsenal. Some would have given an arm or a leg to come back to the club when they retired. Then, they should respect the investment that Arsene has made for the club, the way he works like a madman on a daily basis. Arsene takes all the strategic decisions for the club. Finally, I want to say: ‘Get your hands dirty. Today, you’re only in a role of judgement, but if you invested yourself in the club, you’d realise it’s not so simple</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal scout Gilles Grimandi has revealed that Arsenal tried to sign Florian Thauvin]</b> Arsenal were scouting him when he was at Bastia and we were following him closely at the time. After he moved, he wasn’t at the same level. Today, at Arsenal, he would play.<br /><br />He’s starting to score in big games, he’s rarely injured, and while I found him unpredictable a couple years ago, he’s not much more efficient. I didn’t think he could reach that level. When he was in Chateauroux’s youth system, no big club wanted him. Mentally, he’s a true champion. Personally, I’ve doubts over his physique. He has work-rate but lacks power.<br /><br />He’ll be 26 soon, so his hopes to play for a top club are very limited. The fact that he doesn’t play with the France team, even if he’s in the squad, is a problem. It reinforces some of the doubts over him. Dimitri Payet has a stronger rating than him</p>

  <p><b>[Nice sporting director Gilles Grimandi has admitted the prospect of signing Olivier Giroud would be tempting]</b> It’s tempting of course. I know Olivier very well. I was the one who made him come from Montpellier to Arsenal. He offers guarantees in terms of efficiency. We like his profile. But he’s in another planet. He’s unreachable<br /><br />He will choose his next destination in regard to a lot of things. Not necessarily dictated by money. It will all depend on how he sets his priorities</p>
