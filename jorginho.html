  <p><b>[Jorginho reveals he almost quit after being ripped off by agent]</b> I was playing in a tournament in Brazil and an agent scouted me. He took me to his soccer school. The idea was he used it to scout players and anyone he thought was good enough he took over to Italy. That’s what he did with me when I was 15. He set me up with a trial at Verona in their youth section and they took me on. Initially when I moved over to Italy it was really easy because I was living my dream. Everything was brand new. Then I began to get into the routine: training, school, home, home, school, training. That’s all I did for 18 months. I had 20 euros to live on a week and I couldn’t do anything else, because you can’t with that amount of money. All I did was literally train and go to school. That was really tough. Because Verona weren’t in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> at that time, they didn’t have a youth team so I played in a local youth team called Berretti. Whilst I was playing for Berretti, I met a fellow Brazilian and I got friendly with him.<br /><br />He was asking me about what I was doing, how long I had been there for, and I told him I was living on 20 euros a week. He said ‘hang on a minute, there’s something not quite right about that’. He made some enquiries and it turned out my agent had been taking money and I knew nothing about it whatsoever. At that point I wanted to give up. I was completely devastated. I was fed up. I phoned home in tears and told my mum I wanted to come home and I didn’t want to play football any more. She said: ‘Don’t even think about it! You’re so close, you’ve been there for a few years, I won’t let you back in the house! You need to stay there and hang tough’<br /><br />So I stayed and continued to train with the first team. I could have continued playing for Berretti, but at that point I decided I would go on loan. I went to a professional team in Serie C2 called Sambonifacese. While I was there, Verona got promoted to Serie B. When I went back, the coach, Andrea Mandorlini, said he didn’t need me because I had only played in C2 and now they were in B. But one of the directors who I knew quite well stuck up for me, and argued my case with the coach. By the October I hadn’t played a single game and had thought about the possibility of leaving in January. Then the first team player who had my position got injured, and his natural replacement was injured as well. The coach didn’t know what to do. He had to either improvise or play me. He played me and I did pretty well</p>

  <p><b>[Jorginho admits that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> were taught a lesson by <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in their 3-0 defeat at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>]</b> It is very difficult to say anything right now because it was a difficult game and we just saw a big team. So, we know we have a lot to improve and they showed so many things to us that we can learn from our mistakes and from them as well. They were really, really good and we couldn’t press very well. I think we were not compact on the pitch and not pressing as a team. So that made them confident with the ball and they could play easily<br /><br />At this level, if you concede a chance, they can kill you and when you create you have to score, even if you are playing worse than the other team because then things can change. We had a big team against us. I think they are playing to win the Champions League, honestly, because they are confident on the ball, tactically they are very good. The result tells you everything<br /><br />I would like to be able to play the second game to help my team-mates, but unfortunately I can’t so I support them from home<br /><br />It is really tough for the changing room, for us, but we have the other competitions and we still have another game. Anything can happen because, in football, you never know. We just have to believe in ourselves, don’t put our heads down. We need to keep working, keep pushing, because we are a good team. We need to believe, work hard and be together</p>

  <p><b>[Jorginho considered leaving <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> amid difficult first season]</b> Last year, fans were picking on me a lot because I’d arrived with another manager and, in my opinion, I ended up hearing some things that were honestly unfair. But I’ve never challenged the views of the fans and other people who criticised me. Quite the opposite, actually - it gave me strength because inside I knew they were wrong<br /><br />Deep in my mind, it was like this: ‘I’m going to prove they’re wrong and work quietly like I’ve always done, because it’s never been easy for me’.<br /><br /><b>[Jorginho has confessed that he considered following <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> out the door]</b> I’ve gone through moments like this at every club I’ve played for - this low moment when doubt can come and make you wonder, ‘Should I just leave this place? Maybe there isn’t room for me here’. But I embrace this kind of challenge and I’ve never backed down. It gives me more strength to work even harder, to prove to everyone that I can make it.<br /><br />I thank him for the sincerity he showed towards me in public. He didn’t have to do that, and not every manager does it. He’s a legend inside the club, so people listen to what he says</p>
