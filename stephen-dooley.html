<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Stephen Dooley has signed a new contract with Cork City ahead of the 2017 season]</b> I’m very happy to sign back. I was working hard during the off-season getting ready for pre-season and I am delighted to get back in and get started. Maybe last season there was a settling in period and I found myself in and out of the team, which is fair enough, but I am well settled in now and hopefully this year I can kick on and have a better year.<br /><br />We will set ourselves the highest targets; we want to win the league, we want to win the cup again and in Europe, we had a good campaign. We would like to go further in Europe this season. If we can improve on all those aspects, it would make for a very good year</p>
