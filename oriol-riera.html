  <p><b>[On his journey]</b> I started to play football when I was five-years-old where in Spain normally, if you’re a boy, you begin with football. My father and all the people around me saw that I played very well, scored a lot of goals and had good technique, so I moved to Espanyol. It was there that we realised I could become a professional player. I joined FC Barcelona when I was 10 and moved away from my family to a place that wasn’t my home, so my life completely changed just to improve and to fulfill my dream to play in LaLiga.<br /><br />The focus principally was to teach people to be a good man, to have good character and be a good, solid person. If you are not a good man, if you are not a good person, and don’t have a good character, you might be the best player at other clubs, but not at Barcelona. After that, they taught us to play hard, to love the game and to love life every day<br /><br />They have great facilities and we played in the best tournaments in the world, so we had all the capabilities to become a great player. But I have many friends from La Masia who aren’t footballers, only 1 in 100 make it to LaLiga. It’s very difficult<br /><br />Pique and Messi are the best players in their positions, but for me they are normal people that like the things we all like and enjoy. In the past, I spent three years with Messi in the under 19s and then the second team and the first team, we went up and down. He was also my roommate so we spent a lot of time together. We spoke about a lot of things, a lot of it about girls because at that time, I was 17 and Messi was 16 and we liked to talk about that.<br /><br />He had two characters: off the field he was very calm, very quiet, he doesn’t like talking too much. On the field, he was different, he was the best player, had the ability to get the ball, hold the ball and had all the skills<br /><br />If someone told me at that time that Messi would one day be the best player in the world, possibly ever, it would’ve been a surprise, we would’ve laughed and said it was false. We knew that Messi would be a player in the first-team and a good player, but not like this. In that moment, it was impossible to believe it. At the moment, he is the best player and I think in 50 years, we will talk about Messi as the best player in the history of football. There is no doubt about this<br /><br />For many players, it isn’t easy to make it to LaLiga. There is a lot of quality and technical players there. So you you might have to spend time in the Segunda Division before you can get the opportunity to play there. I spent time at Celta Vigo and Cordoba, but the team where I learnt the most and improved the most was at Alcorcon. It was the best club and I had the best coach there, who is now at Getafe. He showed the best movements, the best method to score goals and then when I went to Osasuna, then I had all the skills I needed to succeed<br /><br />Osasuna was for me, particularly, a very good season. Not for the club, we had a lot of financial problems with the club and the club is now in court due to money and the people who ran the financial transactions. There were lot of problems back then and we went down. But for me, I scored 13 goals, I played all the games and my dream was complete and that was the<br /><br />Cejudo always says to me that if I was not here, he would never come. I understand because it’s so far for us, he doesn’t speak English, not like me. My English isn’t good either but better than Cejudo. So if I wasn’t here, maybe he wouldn’t have come. He’s a very good player and he’s different to all the players and he’s a good friend<br /><br />I think it is most important; to play with friends. Cejudo, is like family, and when we played together and maintained this relationship, it’s good because when we are on the pitch, we can speak and try to play together like we used to. We know all the movements and understand how we both play and for the team it is very good<br /><br />Before we came, Popovic came and we met together and he showed me what the club wanted, what he wanted and what the life in Sydney is like. He said the club is young and family-orientated and he wanted it to improve. He told me he wanted Western Sydney to be the best club in Australia and Asia<br /><br />After last season in LaLiga, I had one year more on the contract, but my family and I felt we needed a change. We wanted to move to another country to learn about a different style of football. I want to be a coach and it was a good way to learn as we only know the Spanish style. It was the time to make a decision and go to another region because after 12 years in Spain, I think it’s enough<br /><br />My family has adapted quickly to Australia. We didn’t expect this and it was worth the travel, the 24 hour flight. It’s not easy for the kids but we’ve adapted with schools and teachers and families. We get to enjoy summer in a few months, and we are enjoying the life and the football. We like the change<br /><br />I felt a little bit disappointed when he left because I came here for Popa, to be with him and learn from him. But I know that for him, it is a big opportunity and to be a great coach in Europe. All the things that he showed me in the last three months was unbelievable, it was a big surprise and it was all very good. I liked it a lot, so I was disappointed, but life continues.<br /><br />I think it is a good opportunity for Popa and it’s a good way to improve. I liked all the things that I saw from him. I think Popovic will be one of the best in Europe. He’s a leader, he has no doubts about himself and the team, he controls the tactics, the players and I like this kind of coach.<br /><br />He needs time, but he has a lot of time to go step by step, but I’m 100% sure he will be in the big European games. He is like every other good coach on the continent, he understands how to play against different teams and styles. The results are there to see<br /><br />Before signing here, everyone that I called to ask about the club told me we have the best fans in the league. And what I have seen in the cup games and in the league was not a surprise for me because everyone told me. We have very good fans, they dance, they sing for us, it helps a lot and we will need that help for many more games. It gives us power. The RBB are passionate and ambitious. They push the team all the time<br /><br />I think the positive thing is that we made history in the semi-final of the FFA cup. We have four points, the best start for the club and we know that and we have to be happy about that</p>

  <p><b>[Western Sydney Wanderers need to remain calm in Sydney derby]</b> It’s difficult to stay calm and stay concentrated, but I think Western Sydeny Wanderers need to do so and do everything we worked on during the week. And we know we’re coming against tough opponents. I played in derbies between Barca and Espanyol, Celta Vigo and Deportivo de Coruna, Leon and Valladolid; lot of derbies I have played with passion. I want to play and I am expecting a big and passionate game. I think these games are ways to improve in the league and there are many more games, but we enjoy this environment with packed stadiums in front of our vocal fans who support us<br /><br />We prepare for it like any other game knowing that it is a big game, especially for the fans. We know we are away from home but nothing changes, and we have to do the things we have worked on during pre-season. For us, to play it in front of 40,000 people, we have to concentrate and play hard on the things that only we can control<br /><br /><b>[The former Osasuna man is adamant nothing has changed under Hayden Foxe, dismissing suggestions Tony Popovic’s surprise departure could be detrimental to their campaign]</b> Nothing changes under Foxey; he is continuing the way we played under Popovic. He was the assistant coach and he knows all the players, the team and the club. He knows the positives and weaknesses of the team. Foxey controls all the tactics and we have no doubts. Because Popovic started the club, it is normal that a lot will change. But I think it has all been continuous. We signed for the club and we have to play for the fans and for the club. Only work, play hard and train hard and that’s it.</p>
