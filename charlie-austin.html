  <p><b>[<a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> new-boy Charlie Austin sets his sights on more goals for <a href="southampton-fc.html">the Saints</a> after his debut goal against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> With <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>, we are going into games as favourites and wanting to be in that top ten. That is what drew me to go to <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> - they are a club on the up. I wanted to be involved in that. Look how many chances they create, it’s certainly what me and centre-forwards thrive on. Watching on Saturday and seeing the superb work Shane Long put in and the amount of chances they create - look, I am going to eat it up really</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Austin warned that coronavirus should not be taken lightly]</b> I felt like someone had chucked a bucket of water over me. I was soaking. Before I started feeling the symptoms on Saturday I was on the phone to my wife Bianca’s mother and I said to her that I hoped if anyone in our family got it that it would be me. I felt like I was fit and healthy and I could handle it. A week later and I would say to anyone, even those in their 20s and 30s - ‘Don’t take it lightly - it’s serious’. I get that people who haven’t got it are going about their lives. Last week, I was living my life. Not that I didn’t take coronavirus seriously. But this is extremely serious and we should take it that way<br /><br />I felt terrible for a few days but I never tested for the virus and feel fine now. It was sensible advice to self-isolate from the rest of the lads and from my family during this period. I’ve now made a full recovery<br /><br />It almost took someone high up to get it for the game to think, ‘Oh actually, we need to stop’. If <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> hadn’t tested positive, we would have played those fixtures <b>[last weekend]</b>. I would rather we looked back in three or four months’ time and thought we were over-cautious than look back thinking that we could have done more</p>
