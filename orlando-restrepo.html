  <p><b>[Colombia Under-17 coach Orlando Restrepo is concerned about his team’s defence ahead of the Under-17 World Cup next month]</b> We are fixing the final details before the World Cup, especially in the defensive zone were we were having little trouble. The group is very united and we have been working with the players for a good time now.<br /><br />The help and understanding from the different clubs here in Colombia has been really important for the team. We are planning to travel on September 20 and <b>[possibly]</b> play with New Zealand on September 26. Thereafter, we’ll have 10 days to adjust the tactics before the beginning of the tournament<br /><br />I think that rivals like USA and India will be very hard to play but will help us to improve our football and see in what level we are at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Colombia announce 21-member squad]</b> Ghana are a stroong, physical team and have had good performances at the World Championship before. India is tidy but they do not have great technique while USA are the strongest of all in our group.</p>

  <p><b>[Colombia’s Orlando Restrepo says Improving the quality of players is very important]</b> Just as the body has different parts and everything is connected. So similarly our team is very united.<br /><br /><b>[On being questioned about the African teams in particular who are very strong in physique]</b> Yes, we have an experience of that. We have plans to move forward. We will play against three teams - India, Ghana and USA. We are focused and working on everything. That’s our plan. All the teams have their own style and strategies. For us, all the teams in the World Cup are strong. We will also perform in a strong manner. We want to improve the quality of the players which is very important. We accept that teams have their own plans<br /><br />It’s a general tendency when you play with others and you have to adjust to it. Our concentration is only on football. We are not getting affected by anything. We are only focusing on football. We will not give any excuses per say.</p>

  <p><b>[Colombia secured a 2-1 win over India in their second Group A fixture of the FIFA Under-17 World Cup]</b> Yes, I want to congratulate the Indian coach <b>[Luis Norton de Matos]</b> and players for their will to win. On our part we felt, we need to be more patient to finalize <b>[take]</b> the opportunities we had.<br /><br /><b>[Juan Penaloza scored a couple of goals in the second half and helped Colombia pick their first three points of the Under-17 World Cup]</b> Yes, he had a great game especially as he started the last game <b>[against Ghana]</b> as a right back and now we used him as a right winger to use his speed and creativity. In the last 15 minutes, it was stressful especially when India scored. I stuck with the plan and eventually we capitalized. But yes, it was intense in the last 15 minutes. I had to make a lot of tactical adjustments as we were struggling at the beginning. However, the players did what was asked of them and we won.<br /><br />It’s hard for me to remember their names. The two centre-backs <b>[Anwar Ali and Namit Deshpande]</b>, did an unbelievable job. They kept the Indian team organized and had a successful game. I repeat that it was a balanced game. They <b>[the Indian players]</b> did everything they could</p>
