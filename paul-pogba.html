The young and industrious Scottish midfielder has impressed during his seven UEFA Youth League appearances this campaign, scoring one goal for Nicky Butt’s exciting team. Aged 19, he is also a regular in the club’s Under-23s team and featured on Friday night against Chelsea at Leigh Sports Village. This is Hamilton’s first inclusion in a first-team squad and we can confirm the youngster will wear the no.48 shirt at the John Smith’s Stadium, where the FA Cup fifth-round tie is scheduled. Ethan joined United when turning 16 after playing for Hutchison Vale, a local boys club the Reds have dealt with before when Darren Fletcher represented the Edinburgh-based youth team..</p>

He’s a player who has football inside him, who feels it, it’s incredible.<br /><br />When I was little I looked at <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Messi. I had videos of <b>[Diego]</b> Maradona, Pele, Kaka, of many players. I wanted to have all the virtues that those players had. Now, I look more at players like <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta, Yaya Toure, also <b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne, who is young, <b>[Luka]</b> Modric, who is a very strong midfielder.<br /><br />Happiness? For me the most important thing has always been health. I enjoy to win trophies and have a good time with my family. I lost my father recently, he was very important to me. Life is short, I want to live my life to the fullest. I know I talk like an older person and that I am just 25 years old but I have had friends that weren’t as lucky as me. Football?

But if someone else does it, it is different. They will maybe be man of the match. I think I’m judged differently, but it’s good. It makes me improve as well, it is a challenge for me and I take it in a good way. I don’t take it in a bad way. I’ll try to score and make assists and that’s it.

It just came naturally in training if he sees something I could do better it comes and tells me. Sometimes I go to him and say do you see something I could do better and he helps me and helps me to improve. When you are inside and outside you don’t see it the same, I just ask him and he helped me a lot.<br /><br />You always want to be at the top every game, to improve every game and I think I am still improving.

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba admits he can disagree with Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho at times]</b> People want to hear about the manager and the player. You see some images of me talking with the coach. We can disagree but he is still the manager and I am the player. Sometimes I see things he doesn’t and sometime he sees things I can’t. But it doesn’t mean anything is bad. It’s good. He is the coach. He decides and I accept and I respond on the pitch.<br /><br />Just to wear the shirt to play in Old Trafford, I was here in the academy and it was a dream to play for the first team. I am proud, I know the fans and story of the club. It’s Poggood!<br /><br /><b>[Pogba added on a stunning 3-2 derby victory at the Etihad Stadium which proved United can compete with the best]</b> It was all mental - it just came back in the second half. Everyone with the mentality like beasts. If you have that mentality all season we would have been fighting and top with Man City for sure. It is good when the manager believes in you and the players. When you see and hear that you want to give the best for the manager and the team.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba would rather pick up winner’s medals at the World Cup than receive the individual honour of the Ballon d’Or]</b> I want to win a World Cup and Champions League and to be the best. The Ballon d’Or is more a dream than an objective. You can be a happy guy and win the Ballon d’Or, Ronaldinho is an example for that.<br /><br />France will try to be the boss in and out of the pitch during the World Cup. As for me, I was the best youngster in 2014, I’ll try to be the best player now</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is prepared to prioritise trophies over eye-catching football at Manchester United]</b> It would be nice to win the Champions League and the Premier League. Very nice. For a team, you want to win titles, you play to win. You can play the best football and it’s true, we want to play and enjoy football but if you don’t win a title - it’s good for the eyes, it’s good for the eyes - but you don’t win anything.<br /><br />I’m confident with the French squad, with the players that we have. I’m sure we can do something in this World Cup but I don’t want to be over-confident. We have a nice team but the World Cup is in your head too, it’s not just technique. It’s team spirit, it’s more mental than technique. We have to be careful with this. I’m confident in myself. I want the ball, I want to play, I want to win<br /><br />My philosophy? What’s the worst that could happen? If you have the chance, do it. Never regret your choice. Do it 100 per cent. I have the chance to make my love, my job. What more can you ask? You can’t be the same with everybody, you can’t trust everybody. You can have things with agents, with friends who say: ‘You’ve changed’, but the most important thing is to think about the people you make happy and who look up to you. We say this in France: ‘If people don’t change, they’re stupid’. Do something else. Don’t eat the same food all the time. We love pasta but if you eat pasta for a year you become crazy. I changed to become more mature. I changed when I moved to England. You have to help yourself and believe in yourself. You have to train, work hard and become a professional player for the first team</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba considers injury-ravaged former Arsenal midfielder Abou Diaby to sit on a list of performers boasting more ability than him]</b> <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta, he’s had an exceptional career. <b>[Luka]</b> Modric, <b>[Toni]</b> Kroos, David Silva, <b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne, Yaya Toure even Abou Diaby. Box-to-box, he was exceptional but unfortunately he had a lot of injuries. Look at him when he was he was at Arsenal - he was exceptional. People forget about him. In the France team, he was enormous. I’ve got a lot of respect for him. I won’t forget him, I learned a lot from him.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba has hit back at critics who have questioned his style of play and off the field actions]</b> I’ve always been like that. When I’ve won, I’ve won being like that. That’s my style of play. You’re not going to criticise Messi when he walks on the park. If he scores three goals are you going to say: ‘Ah but he’s walking on the pitch?’ No. You can’t tell me how to play. If I’m here today, it’s as I am. No one has told me how I must behave. That’s my football, that’s all. People can like it or not. Do I need this to be loved? Do I need people to judge me differently? Or do they talk better about me?.<br /><br />I’m not going to live on what people think, for them to say that I’m nice, good, the best, perfect. Everyone has their opinion. And I respect that. I play football, I do what I like. My relatives support me, they’re more important. We can’t love everyone and be loved by everyone. That would be perfection and nothing is perfect in this world. I’m not going to be offended if someone says: ‘I don’t love you.’ That’s your right. You don’t have to love me</p>
