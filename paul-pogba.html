They expect more from you because of the price tag. A good game would be a normal game. A top game would be a good game.<br /><br />It’s a big amount. It went down when other transfers came, so it’s fine. I think it’s also because I’m a midfielder. People see more strikers because they score goals, so that’s why it made such a big impact. I don’t think <b>[Neymar and Mbappe]</b> get it because they’re strikers. I knew it would come with it. I knew there would be a big impact. But I didn’t know it would go so negative.

When the fans that do that, they even have black people in their team, it’s even more sad to see that. They don’t respect the player and the team. I just thought they’re racist, or not, or ignorant, I don’t know. Or they just don’t want you to perform well. I see and hear a lot of things but I don’t react. I smile. I have a story, we had a game against Fiorentina and I just came off the bench and someone made some sounds, maybe like a monkey, I said ‘why’? I just gave him my shirt and at the end, they were happy and applauded me. I just pray for them and <b>[try to]</b> make people understand we just enjoy sport, we just enjoy playing football. I understand they want their team to win but there’s a different way to attract attention. To do something like that is really low. In 2019 it’s really low.<br /><br />The world is beautiful with a lot of colours and cultures, when I speak about racism it’s ignorance. You can’t really change something because it’s been there for a long time. When you speak you try to do things, speak about it and it just carries on. You can’t change that with people. You won’t leave the pitch, if you want to play you’ll play, try to score, try to win and that’s it. Life goes on and at the end, they come after the game and ask for a picture. I’m sad <b>[about racism in football]</b>. I’m not angry. Because I’m happy with myself. I have a Chinese friend, an Italian agent, a Brazilian lawyer. I have a Bolivian wife, I’m French. Guinean originally. My mum is from Guinea. All my life it’s a different culture. I’m just happy with myself. I enjoy playing football. I enjoy giving a smile to people and that’s it. That’s all I need. Be happy with yourself. Be loved by your family, fans, don’t think about people that hate or racists or people who are ignorant, they just pull you back.<br /><br /><b>[How do you combat it?]</b> We’ve tried everything. Putting videos up before the games <b>[saying]</b> no racism, pictures, campaigns, everything and they’re still doing it. What can you do? That’s people. There’s a proverb; you want to change the world, start to clean your house - start with yourself and then after we’ll go around and around. You can’t be in everyone’s head. Do the opposite that they do to you. Maybe it’ll make them realise they feel really ridiculous.</p>

Look at Paul Pogba. There were all sorts of questions asked when the Frenchman returned to Old Trafford three years ago for a then world-record £89.5m fee, with the consensus suggesting that it would be nigh-on impossible for the midfielder to justify the figure. Three years, countless commercial deals and a £198m Neymar transfer later and Pogba’s new apparent valuation to United of around £160m makes the initial move look like much better business than many were willing to countenance</p>

  <p><b>[q: Paul, this weekend, we celebrate the 4,000th consecutive match of there being a youth-team graduate in a first-team matchday squad going back to 1937 - can you believe that record?]</b> Where was I then <b>[in 1937]</b>?! <b>[Laughs]</b> It’s unbelievable and it shows the identity of this club and the culture of this club. We’ve always talked about youth players coming into the first team and it’s just carried on. It’s something that is in this club, it’s incredible it’s been happening since 1937. You want to carry this on for the young players and the next generation to go and play in the first team<br /><br /><b>[q: When you joined Academy 10 years ago as a 16-year-old, what were your impressions of it when you first arrived]</b> When I arrived here, everything felt big! The training ground was big, all the players were big, the pitch was big, everything was big and I had my eyes open the whole time. Then I put the shirt on for the first time and I said: ‘Wow, I came to Manchester United’, I just couldn’t believe it. When I started training with the first team, I was 17, and I remember Vida <b>[Nemanja Vidic]</b> was there and Ji-sung Park and I touched Vida and I saw how tough and how strong he was! I knew then I had to work hard to get into the first team. It was a really great experience as a young kid to come here at 16 and see everything so big, and see all these top players and a top manager. To be there, having them sat next to us around the training ground, was a dream come true<br /><br /><b>[q: How did the club help you when you came over? Presumably, you didn’t speak much English and it must have been hard to move to a new country initially?]</b> Yes it was. I couldn’t speak much English but I went to school here so it helped me a lot. Just talking with the guys in the dressing room helped me, that’s when you learn the most, I think. Obviously, you learn the naughty words first <b>[laughs]</b> and all the players really helped me. I remember I was with <a href="joshua-king.html">Joshua King</a> a lot and he helped me improve my English, also Ryan Tunnicliffe and Jesse <b>[Lingard]</b> as well, although I couldn’t understand Jesse’s English and I still don’t! <b>[Laughs]</b> He speaks so fast with a Mancunian accent and I have to try to figure out what he’s saying! He was one who helped me a lot but everyone did<br /><br /><b>[q: Which coaches stand out as being very important to you in those early days?]</b> I was with Jim Ryan and Paul McGuinness, they helped me a lot, Warren Joyce, as well, after that. For a French guy coming here at 16 to understand another culture and another way of playing football, you needed a bit of time to adapt and they all really helped me, as did the players. It felt great to be trained by those people and I think the last time we won the Youth Cup was under Paul and Jim, they helped us improve a lot<br /><br /><b>[q: When you first come here do you get taught about the history of the club?]</b> Yes. Jim Ryan talked to me a lot about that. He used to play for United and he used to tell me: ‘At this club, young players have a chance to get into the first team’. He said that was the identity of the club. He talked about training hard, passing the ball, pass and run, all this stuff … Pat <b>[Evra]</b> was here too, Rio <b>[Ferdinand]</b> as well and even Berba <b>[Dimitar Berbatov]</b> talked to me a lot about it all. They help you understand how it is here, Pat talked to me a lot because he’s French. Obviously the boss, <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>, talked to me as well and he came to see us as well when we were playing in the Reserves or <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Youth Cup. He used to give us messages and he’d also take us <b>[on trips]</b> for cup games. It shows the history this club has with involving young players and how it’s always been like that<br /><br /><b>[q: Winning the Youth Cup was a really big deal wasn’t it - in 2011 against Sheffield United]</b> Harry <b>[Maguire]</b> was there <b>[for Sheffield United]</b>! We had a good team and a lot of players who played in the first team or went to other clubs. Will Keane played in the first team then he went to Hull, Mike Keane is at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, Jesse, myself and Sam Johnstone, Tyler Blackett, Rav <b>[Ravel Morrison]</b>, Larnell <b>[Cole]</b>, Ryan Tunnicliffe, they’re still playing … we had a really decent team.<br /><br /><b>[q: How important do you think your grounding and upbringing in the Academy has been to your development in becoming the sort of the player that you are now?]</b> From the start, like I said, when I arrived here, they show you the way of playing. All the coaches show you how to prepare yourself to get into the first team. Warren Joyce used to train us very hard to be ready for the first team. The first team always used to play with 4-4-2, so we used to do the same meaning when you got the chance to be with the first team you could play and not be lost on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[q: Ole clearly has a lot of faith in young players - how important is it that the pathway is there for players to continue to come up through the Academy into the first team?]</b> I’ve said to a lot of the young players who have been with the first team: ‘Guys, you don’t know how lucky you are’. Unfortunately for us, we’ve had a lot of injured players and it’s therefore a big chance for the young players to be involved with the first team. They have the chance to do well and stay there. So I said to them: ‘Take this luck and take this opportunity because it’s important until the other players come back fit’. You never know, there could be an injured player and a young player comes in and plays a great game and they stay with the first team until the end of their career. So I’ve told them: ‘Guys, be ready and always take the opportunity’. If they have quality to be with the first team then why not take the opportunity and play and enjoy yourself?<br /><br /><b>[q: The likes of Brandon, Mason and others have been doing this haven’t they?]</b> Yes. Mason, since the first training session that I saw him in, and Brandie <b>[Brandon Williams]</b>, Jimmy <b>[Garner]</b>, Angel <b>[Gomes]</b>, <a href="tahith-chong.html">Chongy</a> <b>[Tahith Chong]</b> and all the players. Axel as well, although I don’t see him as a young guy, for me, he has been in the first team for a long time, Timo <b>[Tim Fosu-Mensah]</b> as well, but the younger ones, they have the quality, they have everything to be in the first team. They’ve been playing and having some minutes and they should enjoy it when they’re on the pitch and work hard. Mason is scoring goals, Brandie has been playing games like he’s been there for six months already. This is about what the club is about and what the manager wants<br /><br /><b>[q: Finally, these guys clearly look up to you…]</b> I feel old now! <b>[Laughs]</b><br /><br /><b>[q: You’re only 26, but do you feel you can help them and advise them?]</b> I think and I hope I can help them. This is one of the biggest clubs in the world and maybe the biggest club in history and they have the chance to be in this club. So I say to them: ‘Take your chance, play, you are young, you have quality, you have nothing to be afraid of’. I hope I can give them the good example when I’m on the pitch and outside the pitch and, even though I don’t see myself as old, I hope that the young players will, one day, come and take my position <b>[when I finish playing]</b>. That’s how it is, I won’t play forever. We all give our best on the pitch and I hope these young players will become legends here at the club, they have to enjoy it and really appreciate the chance they have here</p>

And, yeah, it just shows me as well how much I love football. You have to be very patient because, well my injury, I don’t know if people really know what happened. So I had a foot injury, which came in the game against Southampton. It was early this season and so I carried this for a long time, training and trying to be playing with it. After I stopped, I found I had a fracture. I had a cast on it, a plaster-cast, so it went very well but too well. The bone got bigger and so, when I came back again, I played those two games against <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> and <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>, I could feel something again. So I had to have an operation and now here I am. I don’t feel anything and, hopefully, I’ll be back very soon.<br /><br /><b>[Pogba admits to missing the matchday routine]</b> I don’t even know how it feels like anymore. I can’t wait to have this feeling again. I miss it because that’s my job, to play football. I really enjoy playing football</p>

  <p><b>[Pogba reveals <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> transfer advice from his brother]</b> My brother, the United fan, told me he was really angry - even more than me - when I didn’t play. He told me: ‘No, go. You can play in this team. If they don’t want you here, go somewhere else. They will see. My mother always told me: ‘You will go somewhere but come back.’ She always said this. I was like: ‘We will see’ but you know mothers and the things she said: ‘You will come back here, don’t worry’ and that was just after. She said, ‘You will come back to Manchester, don’t worry’, and I did.<br /><br />Yeah, when I came back, I was really happy to come back. I left it and didn’t finish. I started something but I didn’t finish, I just went somewhere else. To finish it. Obviously, coming back where I started was for me, why I was really happy. Now I’m ready to come as a confirmed player not a youth player<br /><br />I’m almost there; I’m just thinking about training with the team.

  <p><b>[Manchester United star Paul Pogba has hit back at <a href="graeme-souness.html">Graeme Souness</a>]</b> I didn’t even know who <b>[<a href="graeme-souness.html">Souness</a>]</b> was.

I like to focus on football<br /><br />I guess they miss me, I don’t know? I’m not someone that looks at always at Sky News. After the games, when I watch it again I watch the game, not the comments. When you know football, you don’t need someone to tell you what’s happening. Obviously what I hear when people are saying ‘Paul is doing this … Paul … Paul’ I don’t know. One day maybe I will meet them <b>[the critics]</b> and ask them because I really want to know why. I am doing my recovery, I can be somewhere else and I hear something but I’m just doing my recovery, you know? If they want to speak they are allowed to speak, it’s their job to speak. I am used to it now. I am really used to it, it doesn’t bother me. It’s good to hear good stuff instead of bad stuff but when you play football, you know yourself. It’s what your manager and team-mates want, the rest is just talk. It’s selling stuff I think</p>

  <p><b>[Pogba reveals why he left <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> in 2012]</b> It was a very difficult decision for me, with the manager as well and everything with the contract.<br /><br />It wasn’t the contract but more like the trust with the manager. Obviously, the manager, for me, is still the best manager in history. When they asked me to sign the contract, if I didn’t sign, a lot of things happened. I didn’t train, I went back to training by myself and stuff like this.<br /><br />It made me a bit angry and was nothing about the money. It’s just about you’re a player, we believe in you, you believe in you and, me, I just want to play football. That is all I want. I want to play.<br /><br />When I had, like I’ve said before, the chance to play or to come on in this game against <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a>, that’s when really I had heartbreak. There was no midfield here - people were injured, <b>[Paul]</b> <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a> wasn’t there, I think he’d retired already and it was before he came back. <a href="rafael.html">Rafael</a> played in midfield with Ji-sung Park and I didn’t come on in this game. We lost the game.<br /><br />I was on the bench warming up and I thought I would come on and it was a big opportunity for me. I didn’t and things happen. The manager has a choice in everything but that day is when I had my heart broken. I told Pat <b>[Evra]</b> that was the chance, I’d been training with him and he’d been talking to me and saying I would have a chance. But that happened, I didn’t play and I was kind of upset.<br /><br />So I went to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, which was a hard decision for me. Hard because it was going to another club as well where I was obviously not as one of the starting XI but I’ve got to come as a young player. A young, talented player and you have to show yourself again. I went and it was a big challenge for me. I said: ‘Go for it, no problem. I want to show I am ready to play for the team’.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on how tough it was to leave his homeland]</b> Easy. It’s <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. To be honest, I was about to sign at <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> so they wanted me to sign professional but, because I say it, people used to talk to me and say: ‘Don’t go. Don’t go outside. It’s going to be difficult. Stay in France’. I said: ‘No, they’re the biggest club in the world. This comes only once in our life’. I took it. Well, it came twice for me, yes that’s true!</p>

So when I will come back I want to be the best and when I’m at home there’s no excuse<br /><br />I’ve been injured for more than five months. So proper injured, no football. I’ve been in a cast.

I’ve been in the house working. I made a little pitch in my house, a football pitch so I can train, it’s like a small mini-football pitch where I just now play with my son, we’re just playing inside.

This has to stop, once and for all! Not tomorrow or the next day, it has to end TODAY! Violent acts of racism can no longer be tolerated. I can’t tolerate. I won’t tolerate. WE WON’T TOLERATE.
