I score more goals than Kante but they still say Kante does this and does that. If you want to speak about scoring goals, you should judge every midfielder the same way.

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba problems continue as Man Utd star is sidelined by untimely illness]</b> Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba will miss the Emirates FA Cup tie at Huddersfield Town due to illness and, as a result, Academy prospect Ethan Hamilton has taken his place in the squad. The young and industrious Scottish midfielder has impressed during his seven UEFA Youth League appearances this campaign, scoring one goal for Nicky Butt’s exciting team. Aged 19, he is also a regular in the club’s Under-23s team and featured on Friday night against Chelsea at Leigh Sports Village. This is Hamilton’s first inclusion in a first-team squad and we can confirm the youngster will wear the no.48 shirt at the John Smith’s Stadium, where the FA Cup fifth-round tie is scheduled. Ethan joined United when turning 16 after playing for Hutchison Vale, a local boys club the Reds have dealt with before when Darren Fletcher represented the Edinburgh-based youth team..</p>

Messi and football are two things that go together. I enjoy watching at him, he does things that nobody does. He has a stature that nobody has, something special for him, everything is special. He’s a player who has football inside him, who feels it, it’s incredible.<br /><br />When I was little I looked at <b>[Zinedine]</b> Zidane, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Messi. I had videos of <b>[Diego]</b> Maradona, Pele, Kaka, of many players. I wanted to have all the virtues that those players had. Now, I look more at players like <b>[Andres]</b> Iniesta, Yaya Toure, also <b>[Kevin]</b> De Bruyne, who is young, <b>[Luka]</b> Modric, who is a very strong midfielder.<br /><br />Happiness? For me the most important thing has always been health. I enjoy to win trophies and have a good time with my family. I lost my father recently, he was very important to me. Life is short, I want to live my life to the fullest. I know I talk like an older person and that I am just 25 years old but I have had friends that weren’t as lucky as me. Football?

But if someone else does it, it is different. They will maybe be man of the match. I think I’m judged differently, but it’s good. It makes me improve as well, it is a challenge for me and I take it in a good way. I don’t take it in a bad way. I’ll try to score and make assists and that’s it.

For a team, you want to win titles, you play to win. You can play the best football and it’s true, we want to play and enjoy football but if you don’t win a title - it’s good for the eyes, it’s good for the eyes - but you don’t win anything.<br /><br />I’m confident with the French squad, with the players that we have. I’m sure we can do something in this World Cup but I don’t want to be over-confident. We have a nice team but the World Cup is in your head too, it’s not just technique. It’s team spirit, it’s more mental than technique. We have to be careful with this. I’m confident in myself. I want the ball, I want to play, I want to win<br /><br />My philosophy? What’s the worst that could happen? If you have the chance, do it. Never regret your choice. Do it 100 per cent. I have the chance to make my love, my job. What more can you ask? You can’t be the same with everybody, you can’t trust everybody. You can have things with agents, with friends who say: ‘You’ve changed’, but the most important thing is to think about the people you make happy and who look up to you. We say this in France: ‘If people don’t change, they’re stupid’. Do something else. Don’t eat the same food all the time. We love pasta but if you eat pasta for a year you become crazy. I changed to become more mature. I changed when I moved to England. You have to help yourself and believe in yourself. You have to train, work hard and become a professional player for the first team</p>

The captains I played under really had that consistency and would still contribute on their bad days and I’ve got no doubts that he will reach those levels of consistency for United and be a top, top player<br /><br />I’ve said a lot of times that Luke Shaw has got the quality and he’s also got great strength, but he’s not really had a real run since the horrific leg break. He’s had a great pre-season, came back looking fit and a Luke Shaw at the top of his game is the best left-back Manchester United and England have got. He was unfortunate Ashley Young was so consistent last season, but that’s got to serve as a reminder that he’s got to keep hold of that place now.

You play against the best players, you play against a big club, a big story. You play football to play those big games with a lot of pressure. That’s what you want to play. You can see this season <b>[Chelsea]</b> have a lot of possession obviously, they are winning, they have one character you cannot miss in Eden Hazard, they say he is on fire, this time he is probably the best player in the PL right now. The team is going well, they have good results, for us we come back from the Newcastle game, 3-2 winning at home, we need points, so it’s going to be a tough one. I think they need points, we need points. The game is going to be very hard, we’re playing away. It’s a Chelsea vs Man Utd game, you know, so it’s a big one</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba has suggested that Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are partly to blame for the criticism that continues to come his way at Manchester United]</b> Football has changed a lot. I grew up watching the exploits of great champions, real legends like <b>[Alessandro]</b> <a href="alessandro-del-piero.html">Del Piero</a>, <b>[Luis]</b> Figo, <b>[Francesco]</b> Totti and many others. All have been champions, the best in the world, but perhaps many of them did not achieve more than 20 goals per season. Now the data, the statistics, the numbers, often seem to have become the only parameter of judgment. That, on the one hand, is good, it is part of the evolution of modern football and the desire to play the ball more and more. But we often tend to forget how difficult it has always been to score more than 20 goals, even for the big players. And today perhaps even more so, because the distance between the teams of high level has been reduced, especially in big competitions. Messi and Ronaldo have shown in recent years: doing what they did, maintaining those stats - that is the exception, not the norm<br /><br />If an attacker today scores ten or 15 goals, he is likely to be told that it is not enough. But the player’s work must be judged with perspective. You have to remember that someone like Pavel Nedved won the Ballon d’Or without his team winning the Champions League or without having scored much himself. He was simply the best in his role and was rewarded for what he was capable of doing on the field<br /><br /><b>[I can play]</b> on the right, on the left, in front. I don’t really care. I can play behind the attackers, in front of the defence. It depends on the ideas of the coach, the style and the philosophy of the team that I play in. Because we can never forget that football is a team game and if the team works well together, we will all have more fun. Paul here or Paul there: Paul is a midfielder and his task, more than ever, is helping the team do what they set out to do - beyond the obsession with the goal, especially in front of the players of my position. Luckily, I also score goals, but that’s not what matters in my case.</p>

We’ve always talked about youth players coming into the first team and it’s just carried on. It’s something that is in this club, it’s incredible it’s been happening since 1937. You want to carry this on for the young players and the next generation to go and play in the first team<br /><br /><b>[q: When you joined Academy 10 years ago as a 16-year-old, what were your impressions of it when you first arrived]</b> When I arrived here, everything felt big! The training ground was big, all the players were big, the pitch was big, everything was big and I had my eyes open the whole time. Then I put the shirt on for the first time and I said: ‘Wow, I came to Manchester United’, I just couldn’t believe it. When I started training with the first team, I was 17, and I remember Vida <b>[<a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a>]</b> was there and Ji-sung Park and I touched Vida and I saw how tough and how strong he was! I knew then I had to work hard to get into the first team. It was a really great experience as a young kid to come here at 16 and see everything so big, and see all these top players and a top manager. To be there, having them sat next to us around the training ground, was a dream come true<br /><br /><b>[q: How did the club help you when you came over? Presumably, you didn’t speak much English and it must have been hard to move to a new country initially?]</b> Yes it was. I couldn’t speak much English but I went to school here so it helped me a lot. Just talking with the guys in the dressing room helped me, that’s when you learn the most, I think. Obviously, you learn the naughty words first <b>[laughs]</b> and all the players really helped me. I remember I was with <a href="joshua-king.html">Joshua King</a> a lot and he helped me improve my English, also Ryan Tunnicliffe and Jesse <b>[<a href="jesse-lingard.html">Lingard</a>]</b> as well, although I couldn’t understand Jesse’s English and I still don’t! <b>[Laughs]</b> He speaks so fast with a Mancunian accent and I have to try to figure out what he’s saying! He was one who helped me a lot but everyone did<br /><br /><b>[q: Which coaches stand out as being very important to you in those early days?]</b> I was with Jim Ryan and Paul McGuinness, they helped me a lot, Warren Joyce, as well, after that. For a French guy coming here at 16 to understand another culture and another way of playing football, you needed a bit of time to adapt and they all really helped me, as did the players. It felt great to be trained by those people and I think the last time we won the Youth Cup was under Paul and Jim, they helped us improve a lot<br /><br /><b>[q: When you first come here do you get taught about the history of the club?]</b> Yes. Jim Ryan talked to me a lot about that. He used to play for United and he used to tell me: ‘At this club, young players have a chance to get into the first team’. He said that was the identity of the club. He talked about training hard, passing the ball, pass and run, all this stuff … Pat <b>[<a href="patrice-evra.html">Evra</a>]</b> was here too, Rio <b>[Ferdinand]</b> as well and even Berba <b>[<a href="dimitar-berbatov.html">Dimitar Berbatov</a>]</b> talked to me a lot about it all. They help you understand how it is here, Pat talked to me a lot because he’s French. Obviously the boss, <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a>, talked to me as well and he came to see us as well when we were playing in the Reserves or <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Youth Cup. He used to give us messages and he’d also take us <b>[on trips]</b> for cup games. It shows the history this club has with involving young players and how it’s always been like that<br /><br /><b>[q: Winning the Youth Cup was a really big deal wasn’t it - in 2011 against <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>]</b> Harry <b>[Maguire]</b> was there <b>[for <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a>]</b>! We had a good team and a lot of players who played in the first team or went to other clubs. Will Keane played in the first team then he went to Hull, Mike Keane is at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, Jesse, myself and Sam Johnstone, Tyler Blackett, Rav <b>[Ravel Morrison]</b>, Larnell <b>[Cole]</b>, Ryan Tunnicliffe, they’re still playing … we had a really decent team.<br /><br /><b>[q: How important do you think your grounding and upbringing in the Academy has been to your development in becoming the sort of the player that you are now?]</b> From the start, like I said, when I arrived here, they show you the way of playing. All the coaches show you how to prepare yourself to get into the first team. Warren Joyce used to train us very hard to be ready for the first team. The first team always used to play with 4-4-2, so we used to do the same meaning when you got the chance to be with the first team you could play and not be lost on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[q: Ole clearly has a lot of faith in young players - how important is it that the pathway is there for players to continue to come up through the Academy into the first team?]</b> I’ve said to a lot of the young players who have been with the first team: ‘Guys, you don’t know how lucky you are’. Unfortunately for us, we’ve had a lot of injured players and it’s therefore a big chance for the young players to be involved with the first team. They have the chance to do well and stay there. So I said to them: ‘Take this luck and take this opportunity because it’s important until the other players come back fit’. You never know, there could be an injured player and a young player comes in and plays a great game and they stay with the first team until the end of their career. So I’ve told them: ‘Guys, be ready and always take the opportunity’. If they have quality to be with the first team then why not take the opportunity and play and enjoy yourself?<br /><br /><b>[q: The likes of Brandon, Mason and others have been doing this haven’t they?]</b> Yes. Mason, since the first training session that I saw him in, and Brandie <b>[Brandon Williams]</b>, Jimmy <b>[Garner]</b>, Angel <b>[Gomes]</b>, <a href="tahith-chong.html">Chongy</a> <b>[<a href="tahith-chong.html">Tahith Chong</a>]</b> and all the players. Axel as well, although I don’t see him as a young guy, for me, he has been in the first team for a long time, Timo <b>[Tim Fosu-Mensah]</b> as well, but the younger ones, they have the quality, they have everything to be in the first team. They’ve been playing and having some minutes and they should enjoy it when they’re on the pitch and work hard. Mason is scoring goals, Brandie has been playing games like he’s been there for six months already. This is about what the club is about and what the manager wants<br /><br /><b>[q: Finally, these guys clearly look up to you…]</b> I feel old now! <b>[Laughs]</b><br /><br /><b>[q: You’re only 26, but do you feel you can help them and advise them?]</b> I think and I hope I can help them. This is one of the biggest clubs in the world and maybe the biggest club in history and they have the chance to be in this club. So I say to them: ‘Take your chance, play, you are young, you have quality, you have nothing to be afraid of’. I hope I can give them the good example when I’m on the pitch and outside the pitch and, even though I don’t see myself as old, I hope that the young players will, one day, come and take my position <b>[when I finish playing]</b>. That’s how it is, I won’t play forever. We all give our best on the pitch and I hope these young players will become legends here at the club, they have to enjoy it and really appreciate the chance they have here</p>

  <p><b>[Pogba reveals why he left <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> in 2012]</b> It was a very difficult decision for me, with the manager as well and everything with the contract.<br /><br />It wasn’t the contract but more like the trust with the manager. Obviously, the manager, for me, is still the best manager in history. When they asked me to sign the contract, if I didn’t sign, a lot of things happened. I didn’t train, I went back to training by myself and stuff like this.<br /><br />It made me a bit angry and was nothing about the money. It’s just about you’re a player, we believe in you, you believe in you and, me, I just want to play football. That is all I want. I want to play.<br /><br />When I had, like I’ve said before, the chance to play or to come on in this game against <a href="blackburn-rovers-fc.html">Blackburn</a>, that’s when really I had heartbreak. There was no midfield here - people were injured, <b>[Paul]</b> <a href="paul-scholes.html">Scholes</a> wasn’t there, I think he’d retired already and it was before he came back. <a href="rafael.html">Rafael</a> played in midfield with Ji-sung Park and I didn’t come on in this game. We lost the game.<br /><br />I was on the bench warming up and I thought I would come on and it was a big opportunity for me. I didn’t and things happen. The manager has a choice in everything but that day is when I had my heart broken. I told Pat <b>[<a href="patrice-evra.html">Evra</a>]</b> that was the chance, I’d been training with him and he’d been talking to me and saying I would have a chance. But that happened, I didn’t play and I was kind of upset.<br /><br />So I went to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, which was a hard decision for me. Hard because it was going to another club as well where I was obviously not as one of the starting XI but I’ve got to come as a young player. A young, talented player and you have to show yourself again. I went and it was a big challenge for me. I said: ‘Go for it, no problem. I want to show I am ready to play for the team’.<br /><br /><b>[Quizzed on how tough it was to leave his homeland]</b> Easy. It’s <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. To be honest, I was about to sign at <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> so they wanted me to sign professional but, because I say it, people used to talk to me and say: ‘Don’t go. Don’t go outside. It’s going to be difficult. Stay in France’. I said: ‘No, they’re the biggest club in the world. This comes only once in our life’. I took it. Well, it came twice for me, yes that’s true!</p>
