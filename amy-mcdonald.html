<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Behind Glasgow City’s battle for Scottish football supremacy with Celtic and Rangers]</b> It’s a really exciting time for the club. I think overall in the Scottish game, it just adds a different dimension throughout the season and hopefully it will make it more competitive. I think it makes a huge difference that it’s the chairman, Dave King, who has pushed <b>[the professionalism]</b>. That’s on the back of a really successful World Cup campaign and the coverage that the game got in the World Cup last year. It was kind of the perfect storm for the club to then take the initiative to have a more competitive programme<br /><br />I think we’re probably closer now than we’ve ever been. In terms of being able to bridge it, I think we need to make sure that the culture and the environment is correct. We now need to trust in the process and in the players that we’ve recruited and brought in, because they’re the people that need to go and compete every week. Celtic midfielder Ross has no doubts in her team’s ability to achieve that title now, but admits it’s a big step. You see how successful the men’s team are, but I don’t really feel the pressure that we need to achieve something this year. That comes from Fran, he doesn’t put a lot of pressure on us</p>
