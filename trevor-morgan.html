  <p>[Even as DSK Shivajians prepare to host East Bengal in a second round fixture of the I-League, the away side’s coach Trevor Morgan felt that it was an important fixture] It’s an important game. We didn’t get off to the start that we wanted, although we did not lose. It makes the upcoming game very important.<br /><br />It won’t play on my mind. I wasn’t here at that time and also last season is gone now. The coaches are different now and the players too. The circumstances are different. Nobody can assure anything, first of all. Football doesn’t work that way. Look at Leicester City last season. They were massive outsiders and still won the Premier League. The standard of Indian footballers has risen. There’s a massive difference in the way they play now. I don’t think there are any weak teams in the I-League now. Anything that we get, we have to work hard and earn<br /><br />[On Robin Singh] He’ll be in the squad. He joined training only on Wednesday and so hasn’t been with us for long. There’s nothing wrong with his fitness but maybe he lacks some match sharpness<br /><br />It is very difficult to get information on teams in the early part of the season. They’ve got a new coach, a new system. Once we get some recordings back from the TV, we’ll be okay. We surf through YouTube at times to get some video footage on players</p>

  <p>[As East Bengal gear up to face Churchill Brothers at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco, Goa] I saw Churchill’s game against Mumbai and I thought they were very unlucky to lose. They lost to a very late goal and now they will be looking to win their first game. We are expecting nothing less than a very very difficult match. Our preparation has been good. Coming on the back of a win in the last game, we have trained well. The players are relaxed, ahead of a tough game tomorrow.<br /><br />We have a very strong squad at the moment. We’ve got 25 players vying for the 10 outfield positions, which is always going to be competitive. We have a squad which is working very hard in order to pick up the way we want them to play. We got our whole squad together only 72 hours before we played our first game. We managed to get through that and although it was a draw against Aizawl. Since then, our squad has been strengthened. We’ve got all of our four foreigners available tomorrow. So, it is going to be hard for me to pick a squad for tomorrow’s game<br /><br />[Willis] Plaza, he played about half an hour against Aizawl after only 24 hours after a long flight to India. Then, we’ve had him in training for a bit and he looks like somebody who can get the goals. But he can’t rest on what happened last week. He just needs to keep performing now. He certainly looks like someone who can score goals for us<br /><br />They’re both the top leagues in India when they are running. When ISL is on, it is the top league and when it is over, I-League is the best. Yes, there are more foreign players in the ISL and the players stay in 5-star hotels. The I-League’s not like that. The teams have a budget to look at here. It’s a good time to be a footballer in India now. If you play well in this league, you will be picked up by ISL teams</p>

  <p>[East Bengal are all set to take on Aizawl in a return leg fixture of the I-League on Monday] Tomorrow is a difficult game, no doubt. If you want to get a positive result, you have to give your best. Not only one player, but all the players. We are preparing normally, how we prepare for all the matches, nothing different, but we have to be careful.<br /><br />Nothing is easy in football. Just because we are East Bengal, it doesn’t give us the right to win the game. Aizawl has played very well. Khalid has done a great job, compared to where they were last season. In the first game of the season, we played a system we don’t usually like to play but had to play because of the personnel. The team will be completely different tomorrow<br /><br />[On Lalrindika Ralte] Ralte is a good servant of the club. He has never let us down. He is a good man and a good player and I have all the time for him<br /><br />We have got five players for two positions so there is always pressure. The one who performs gets into the team</p>

  <p>[Trevor Morgan could not hide his discontent with his players’ performances as they were edged out by Aizawl] It’s a surprise result for a lot of people but not by how we played today. The best team won.<br /><br />We made the changes because the performance the other night, some of the players looked tired and Ralte was one of the players. So the best thing was to give him rest and I did not want to bring him in but was forced to seeing how we played in the first half. At the moment, it’s anybody’s league. Still eight games to go, twenty-four points, definitely need six, seven wins from that if we are to win the league<br /><br />We prepared for the new system for two days but today it seemed we got 10 people off the street, gave them a shirt and asked them to go play for us. There was no organization, nothing. We didn’t create anything. Aizawl deserved it. They were better than us today</p>

  <p>[East Bengal head coach Trevor Morgan too was respectful of Bengaluru FC] It will be a tough game. We have to perform in this game. In the last two games, we played some disappointing football. We have just one defeat in ten games. It proves that we have done some good job. We need to concentrate on the pitch and not on outside talk. Yeah, it is my job and player’s work to deliver the title. We tried hard at Aizwal but didn’t work it out. We won’t think what Bengaluru are doing. We just want to move on to 24 points. We know, Bengaluru has the quality and ability to play good football. So we need to work hard to snatch the ball from them.</p>

  <p>[East Bengal downed Bengaluru FC 3-1 at the Kanteerava Stadium on Saturday evening] We were under pressure in the last 10 minutes or so because we dropped deep having been 3-0 up and that was caused us some problems. They have answered the criticisms that have come their way. The only way to stop that criticism is by winning games. Top performance from everybody tonight.<br /><br />We prepared exactly the same way to play against Aizawl and never performed. Coming here, it makes you want to play. Great surface, good atmosphere and great stadium for football and the floodlight games as well makes it completely different. The players really enjoyed. You have to play in all sorts of stadiums and surfaces in this league. We’ve come to play in one of the best stadiums in India. The home team gets fantastic support. I am glad there were so many of our supporters here and we were able to make them happy<br /><br />It certainly looked like it [if Robin was back to his best]. I know he can play and we haven’t seen much this season. But he showed what he can do. If he wants to get back in the Indian team that is the level he has to play week in and week out. When he does that, he is one of the best target man in India. So, it is up to him now where he wants to take this, keep improving, get back into the national team and do well for us<br /><br />I think so that Mehtab applauded the Bengaluru fans but we don’t need to do that and have to do our talking on the pitch. Maybe their coach was frustrated seeing that. If we had lost a home game, probably we might have reacted the same way. All I can say that nothing was meant by Mehtab. He has taken some criticism from fans but it was nothing - some pushing and shoving and it was over in 10 seconds</p>

  <p>[Trevor Morgan rides over petty factions to prove he is the real boss at East Bengal] We don’t have any chance to win the I-League. I had told a friend yesterday that we would lose to Aizawl. It’s the failure of the coach to motivate the players.<br /><br />We had the same preparation against Aizawl FC but not this kind of a performance. Players were excited to play today as the surface and the atmosphere was perfect for the game</p>

  <p>[East Bengal’s Trevor Morgan - Mohammed Rafique did a fantastic job] We needed to accept the challenges that have been thrown down to us. Football is about challenges and we’ve accepted that challenge today. It’s not been a good ground [Jawaharlal Nehru stadium] for us but we got the result we needed. Maybe the performance was not as good as we’ve been playing recently, but at the end of the day it’s about winning football matches and we’ve done that today<br /><br />I think Chris was very unfortunate just maybe not to get a third goal. Good bit of play with Robin[Singh], if that had gone it, it would have been game over. But you know when you’re in a position where the home team gets a goal back and the home fans get behind them, it’s a completely different game and it was a different game. But we dug deep, defended well, got bodies on the line and everybody did that<br /><br />Well, of course .Obviously, with both Bengaluru and Mohun Bagan both playing in the AFC Cup and we’ve been in the position ourselves before. I think all footballers, they want play games because the more games you play, the more successful you are but for us probably it’s come at a good time<br /><br />You know we’ve been able to realise just how important the squad is and sometimes when’re you’re not in the squad or you’re not in the team, that’s difficult to comprehend. Rafique played in the first game of the season but he has not been involved ever since and he’s come in today and put in that performance. He was great, he did a fantastic job for us and the team<br /><br />We’ve managed to get two wins from two away games, we’ve got a home game coming up now which we need to win. We have one more game then we have the break. The break will give everybody the chance to give the players some time off. Everyone gets the chance to recharge their batteries but we have to keep ourselves in the mix so when we come back with the few games to go, we’re ready</p>

  <p>[East Bengal’s Trevor Morgan - The next game is always the most important one] Derrick Pereira is a very experienced coach. He knows the I-League, he knows the players he has got. They are a better team than they were before. But this game is about doing the things we are good at. Playing in AFC competitions is a problem I’d like to have, because it would mean we are successful. And the experience would help the team. Mohun Bagan and Bengaluru FC are playing in the AFC Cup, it means they have been successful.<br /><br />We’re not going to win the I-League on the back of one performance. If we win, we’d win because we have more points than anyone else, and that means we have to put in several good performances. Saw the first half, but couldn’t watch the second half. Wouldn’t have seen it anyway as the lights went out!</p>

  <p>[East Bengal’s Trevor Morgan - ‘Churchill defeat was one of my worst days’] We need to win tomorrow to remain in the race to win the I-league. If things went our way and we did what we need to do tomorrow, we could again be top of the league. But we are expecting a difficult game. Any team is capable of beating any other team. We found that out first hand in the previous game.<br /><br />We were very poor defensively in the first half against Churchill. We have to make sure it doesn’t happen tomorrow. It is difficult to set your team out to win. They [Chennai] will play with one up front and get people behind. We have to be patient and find a way through<br /><br />The last game was one of the worst days I’ve had. The thing with football is, we have to move quickly. The training was a bit subdued on the day after the loss. It was difficult to get over personally. But we have to look forward. What’s done is done</p>
