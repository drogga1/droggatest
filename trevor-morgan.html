  <p>[Even as DSK Shivajians prepare to host East Bengal in a second round fixture of the I-League, the away side’s coach Trevor Morgan felt that it was an important fixture] It’s an important game. We didn’t get off to the start that we wanted, although we did not lose. It makes the upcoming game very important.<br /><br />It won’t play on my mind. I wasn’t here at that time and also last season is gone now. The coaches are different now and the players too. The circumstances are different. Nobody can assure anything, first of all. Football doesn’t work that way. Look at Leicester City last season. They were massive outsiders and still won the Premier League. The standard of Indian footballers has risen. There’s a massive difference in the way they play now. I don’t think there are any weak teams in the I-League now. Anything that we get, we have to work hard and earn<br /><br />[On Robin Singh] He’ll be in the squad. He joined training only on Wednesday and so hasn’t been with us for long. There’s nothing wrong with his fitness but maybe he lacks some match sharpness<br /><br />It is very difficult to get information on teams in the early part of the season. They’ve got a new coach, a new system. Once we get some recordings back from the TV, we’ll be okay. We surf through YouTube at times to get some video footage on players</p>

  <p>[As East Bengal gear up to face Churchill Brothers at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco, Goa] I saw Churchill’s game against Mumbai and I thought they were very unlucky to lose. They lost to a very late goal and now they will be looking to win their first game. We are expecting nothing less than a very very difficult match. Our preparation has been good. Coming on the back of a win in the last game, we have trained well. The players are relaxed, ahead of a tough game tomorrow.<br /><br />We have a very strong squad at the moment. We’ve got 25 players vying for the 10 outfield positions, which is always going to be competitive. We have a squad which is working very hard in order to pick up the way we want them to play. We got our whole squad together only 72 hours before we played our first game. We managed to get through that and although it was a draw against Aizawl. Since then, our squad has been strengthened. We’ve got all of our four foreigners available tomorrow. So, it is going to be hard for me to pick a squad for tomorrow’s game<br /><br />[Willis] Plaza, he played about half an hour against Aizawl after only 24 hours after a long flight to India. Then, we’ve had him in training for a bit and he looks like somebody who can get the goals. But he can’t rest on what happened last week. He just needs to keep performing now. He certainly looks like someone who can score goals for us<br /><br />They’re both the top leagues in India when they are running. When ISL is on, it is the top league and when it is over, I-League is the best. Yes, there are more foreign players in the ISL and the players stay in 5-star hotels. The I-League’s not like that. The teams have a budget to look at here. It’s a good time to be a footballer in India now. If you play well in this league, you will be picked up by ISL teams</p>
