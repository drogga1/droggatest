  <p><b>[Cyle Larin sees transfer speculation as motivation, not distraction]</b> For a player like that to think that i can play in Europe and on a big team, it means a lot and it just motivates me to keep doing better.<br /><br /> think it just motivates me the more teams that are looking at me. It just motivates me to keep doing better and keep scoring goals. Each game I have to perform. I have to make sure I’m doing that<br /><br /><b>[On Jason Kreis]</b> The biggest thing he’s helped me on is the defensive side of the game. When I help my team out defensively, it helps the whole team out. When we get the ball, we’re able to attack right off of that. I think a lot of the goals we score are off winning the ball in the front and attacking immediately<br /><br />I like to lead on the field and like to just make sure I do my job on the field and other players will follow. But I think over the two years I’ve been here now I’m able to lead more vocally and help my teammates vocally<br /><br />I obviously know my contract is over soon but I think if I keep doing well and keep doing what I have to do, everything will play out. I don’t know what will happen. I think time will tell and if I just keep focused on the present I’ll be fine</p>

  <p><b>[Cyle Larin has been scoring against New York City FC since he arrived in MLS]</b> I worked hard this offseason to get in better shape so I can be a 90-minute player. We talked in the offseason about how I can do more to help the team and you see it with everyone on the team - we’re working harder for the team and that’s why we’re winning.</p>

  <p><b>[European interest in Canadian striker Cyle Larin continues to grow]</b> If there’s interest in me then I take it as a compliment because it means you’re doing something right, but I’m not thinking about that. I let my agents deal with that stuff. I’m happy here, and I’m focused on winning with Orlando City.</p>

  <p><b>[Orlando striker Cyle Larin reflects on DUI arrest]</b> I learned a lot while I was there just about life, just about consequences of doing certain things. A lot of it was classes and talking to people and learning about what these things can do to you and consequences you have from doing that. I’ve learned a lot going away and taking time for myself. I think I’ve learned from the mistake and I won’t ever do it again. Now, I’m ready to be back, help this team win and do something special with this organization.<br /><br />I was nervous. I hadn’t been in a situation like that before. Your whole life you do everything right and something happens by mistake and it’s hard, but obviously I suffered the consequence for it and I did what I had to do<br /><br />I have to gain everyone’s trust back. I know it will take time and I have to perform on the field to do that and take care of myself off the field, too.</p>

  <p><b>[Cyle Larin said of the attacking personnel]</b> It keeps their defenders honest, their <b>[defensive midfielder]</b> honest, with Giles making runs behind their defense and getting the ball in front of them. I’m able to drop and get the ball too in that 10 position, and I’m being more mobile than just standing up front. I think it helps us, and it keeps defenders honest.</p>

  <p><b>[Cyle Larin shares the high hopes he and his team-mates have for 2019]</b> It’s a close group. It’s a group that has one goal and that’s to win games and to go to the Gold Cup and win it. I believe we can, and everyone is motivated and excited. We’ve stepped up a level of play, even from last year, and I think everyone is committed now</p>
