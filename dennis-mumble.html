  <p><b>[Kenyan defender Cliffton Miheso has confirmed to the South African Football Players Union that he was forced to sign a contract at gun point by PSL club Lamontville Golden Arrows]</b> We have received a copy of a letter that was addressed to Arrows and in that letter we have not been asked to act at all. They are seeking clarification from Arrows on the alleged incident. It is difficult for me to comment on an issue that I don’t have full details on but we don’t promote serious things where people are threatened with guns. If this incident indeed happened‚ we condemn it in the strongest possible terms.</p>

  <p><b>[South African Football Association chief executive officer Dennis Mumble says they are hoping to finally finalise a deal with SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter]</b> We are fairly close to resolving the issue with his representative. But it is almost a done deal as we have agreed terms with the coach. However, we are not discussing anything with SuperSport as it is a personal matter between us and him.<br /><br />We thought we had concluded the deal as we had agreed on everything. The only issue has been when he would leave SuperSport. But now maybe we will be able to get him sooner as <b>[SuperSport]</b> seem to no longer be in the title race. It’s not a big deal when he gets released - we have enough intelligence on the ground to know what is happening with our players. He is also here to monitor the players. It is a matter of how they want him to handle the handover at SuperSport with the new coach</p>
