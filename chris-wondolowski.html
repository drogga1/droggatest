  <p>[On Kellyn Acosta] Kellyn Acosta was injured and had to leave a little bit early, but I was really impressed with him. I think he’s going to be a great player.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Chris Wondolowski has no interest in MLS job opportunities once playing career ends] I want to be involved in the game but not in MLS one bit. One, job security. Two, I want to live in California and if you’re a coach in MLS, you don’t know. And I’ve had a lot of years in this league and I don’t want to do more.<br /><br />I feel good, I feel excited. I love where the team’s at. I love the direction we’re headed. I’m over the preseason now and ready for the real games to start because I’m really excited for it<br /><br />I appreciate Herculez having my back. But it’s more a sense that I haven’t done enough because I’ve been on the field those years, for the last seven years, and I haven’t done enough to get us to [a championship] and I’ve been the captain. So to be honest, I think a lot of that is on me - I haven’t done enough necessary to be successful<br /><br />It was good having a leadership role and talking to guys. It was a great opportunity to meet a lot of these young players and get to know them off the field as well<br /><br />There were a lot of positives. We talked about it and [Arena] told me to be ready. There are things I need keep trying to improve - hold up play, things of that nature, connecting passes and also being on the best chances when they come. So he told me to work on some things but keep doing what I’ve been doing<br /><br />At this point in my career, it’s not a huge worry. All I can worry and take of are the Earthquakes. I feel if we get off to a good start, and me personally as well, that would definitely help my case but at no point will I ever consider it a sure thing in the future<br /><br />Right now, I know I love coming in everyday. I actually really enjoy practicing, going to practices and, to be honest, as long as I’m healthy enough to do that and I feel I enjoy it, I’m going to keep trying to do it because I really like it</p>

  <p>[Chris Wondolowski’s 146th career MLS goal was quintessential Wondolowski] My rookie year I was envisioning 148 minutes. If I got that, that would have been pretty cool</p>
