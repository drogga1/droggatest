  <p><b>[Back in 2003, a then 13-year-old Freddy Adu was the talk of the footballing world. Nicknamed the ‘US Pele’, it was presumed that he was a sure bet to become the first truly global soccer superstar to emerge from the United States]</b> Everything that I’ve been through and everything that hurt my career, I brought it on myself because I didn’t dedicate enough time to it</p>

  <p><b>[He reflected on a journey that is now stuttering to an end after a recent stint under the bright lights of Las Vegas]</b> You have to have amnesia. Otherwise, you’ll torture yourself<br /><br /><b>[From Monaco in France to Aris in Greece, the still developing attacker wasn’t given the chance to settle and found himself landing in more cities than he was playing games]</b> Maybe sometimes I should have picked a team that was not so ‘glamorous’ so I could get better as a player. Rather than going for the glamour and never getting to play<br /><br /><b>[Adu hopes that the next generation of prodigies can learn from the mistakes he made]</b> Growing up, I was always the best player. Guys who were way below me at the time, you’d say right now had better careers than I did. So, when I see a kid who’s really talented, clearly above the rest, and he’s just coasting, trying to get away with his talent, I say, ‘No, no, no. That can’t happen! You can’t let that happen! They will surpass you’. Because I was that kid</p>
