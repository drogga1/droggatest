<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Pablo Moreno: Juventus’ Spanish sensation who left <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> behind]</b> They told me about an eight-year-old boy who played futsal for Granada 74 and who had a series of qualities that I had never seen in someone of that age. He had self-confidence, quality, was very good in one-on-one situations, had an eye for goal and he always made good decisions<br /><br />It was competition after competition and more competition. We trained in municipal fields and had a limited schedule. Well, he never wanted to leave the field, and he would start to cry<br /><br /><b>[Unsurprisingly, Moreno’s talents would not go unnoticed for long and, after winning a second successive Andalusian Championship in which he scored six goals across the semi-finals and final alone, the 10-year-old was being approached by Spain’s elite clubs]</b> He came with me on one team trip and the cell phone did not stop ringing. We were called by representatives of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, <a href="real-betis.html">Betis</a>, Sevilla, <a href="malaga-fc.html">Malaga</a>, and we visited both La Masía and Valdebebas. In August, he ultimately signed with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, who decided to leave him on loan with us for another season.<br /><br /><b>[He has four goals in his three <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Youth League appearances so far this term, while he recently returned from playing a key role in Spain’s run to the quarter-finals of the U17 World Cup in Brazil]</b> We do not know what his roof is, but it is a pride for us. Many parents see him as an example for their children and they follow him on social networks. What’s more, in Granada you can see a lot more <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> shirts, but not because of <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, but because of Pablo Moreno!</p>
