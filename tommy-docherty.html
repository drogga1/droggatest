  <p><b>[Tommy Docherty, former teammate of Sir Tom Finney, on hearing of the Preston Plumber’s death on Friday at the age of 91]</b> He was something else, the <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> of his day. He was a great person and a lovely man. I never heard him criticise anyone. I think he was the best <b>[winger]</b> ever. I never heard anyone say a disrespectful word about him</p>

  <p><b>[Tommy Docherty on two of his successors as <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> manager]</b> There is no doubt that Van Gaal’s record on the continent is fantastic, but perhaps he hasn’t appreciated that <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is a different ball game. <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> was treated very harshly at United, and this season is proving that. Van Gaal has spent a fortune in the transfer market and yet, despite having a worse record than <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> at this stage, there is no clamour for his head. He has made too many changes, too quickly. Big-money additions should be the finished article, and that is not what we are seeing. Angel Di Maria should be the best player in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but he’s only impressed in glimpses. And as for Falcao, well he’d get injured on A Question of Sport (television show).</p>

  <p><b>[former Red Devils boss Tommy Docherty on Duncan Edwards]</b> <a href="george-best.html">George Best</a> was something special, as was <a href="pele.html">Pelé</a> and <a href="diego-maradona.html">Maradona</a> but, in my mind, Duncan Edwards was much better in terms of all-round ability and skill</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba clearly doesn’t want to be at Manchester United]</b> I would just let Pogba go. He clearly doesn’t want to be at the club. Some players who are high maintenance but do perform for you can be tolerated. But he blows hot and cold. United should never have re-signed him in the first place. Sir Alex Ferguson let him go for a reason. I’m not a fan of Mourinho - if he was made of chocolate he would eat himself. And I have my doubts that he will still be at the club this time next season. United don’t like to sack their managers and like to give them a good run. But Mourinho must be on borrowed time as he has spent well over £300m. And these constant rows being played out in public with his players won’t have done him any good. But if he does stay then he needs to show he’s in charge - and that means getting rid of Pogba as soon as he can. It’s the only way to show he’s in control at the club. Player power has always been around. But the modern player has the wages they didn’t have before. There’s less to lose for a player to clash with a manager so publicly.</p>
