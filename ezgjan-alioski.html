  <p><b>[Leeds winger Ezgjan Alioski has expressed his belief that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are not so special ahead of an FA Cup third-round tie in north London]</b> It’s a nice stadium, it’s a big club, but it’s not so special to go there because it’s <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. You have some players who think like this, but it’s not enough to think ‘Wow, it’s Arsenal’, because we are also a good team and we want to show it. We need to go there with a lot of confidence like we always do and to play like we always do. Not to be scared to go there. I see the result versus <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, but this United, even we can beat them. This is a cup, it’s different. The difference is that they’re <b>[Arsenal]</b> in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, we are in the Championship, and it’s nice to go there and show them who is Leeds<br /><br /><b>[Alioski added on Leeds’ latest attempt to return to the top flight]</b> If we are in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> are going to be one of the biggest clubs, like I know they were before</p>
