The <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> quartet of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba have been named in <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> 19’s Ultimate Team La Liga Team of the Season. Between the posts, <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>’s Jan Oblak, who kept 20 clean sheets in 37 league appearances, is protected by a back four of Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba alongside Sevilla wing-back Jesus Navas and <a href="getafe-fc.html">Getafe</a> centre-back Djene. In the centre of the park, Pablo Sarabia is another representative of Sevilla, while Valencia’s Daniel Parejo and Sergio Canales of Real Betis make up the midfield three</p>

Pablo Sarabia is all set to leave Sevilla to join Paris Saint-Germain, with the Ligue 1 club prepared to pay more than his €18 million release clause</p>

  <p><b>[Pablo Sarabia has expressed his desire to remain at <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> for the long-term]</b> Those who know me know that I’m not chasing money. It’s important, but it’s never what will tip the scales. If I signed at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, it was really to progress. Signing here, I wanted to win titles and join the Spanish squad. This is what happened. In Seville, I made assists and scored goals, but I was not called up. In Paris, I do the same thing, and they call me. I want to fully identify myself in Paris and with <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>. I’m here for a long time<br /><br />With the competition for places that we have in attack, I am quite happy with the season that I am putting together. For the moment, I am starting often from the bench, but I try to always be important for the team. When I come on, <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a> wants me to use my game intelligence to open up spaces. He wants me to create holes in opposition defences. He asks me to be incisive and aggressive in attack.<br /><br />Seen from the outside, you could believe that my profile as a player does not correspond necessarily with that of a <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> player. Because here there are only stars and truly great players. The first time that I entered the dressing room, I felt an enormous connection between the players. Sincerely, I did not expect to be so well received. <b>[Angel]</b> Di Maria, <b>[Leandro]</b> Paredes, <b>[Edinson]</b> <a href="edinson-cavani.html">Cavani</a> - very simple, very normal - immediately put me at ease. <b>[Presnel]</b> Kimpembe too. At the beginning, I didn’t understand anything he was saying to me, but he is very funny, he is a good guy</p>
