We’re training to try and get into our stride for the start of the season. Football is made up of several factors, such as the physical side, which is very important, and the mental side. That combination of the two means that we can go into the league in good shape. We have made the decision to play in the <a href="alfredo-di-stefano.html">Alfredo Di Stefano</a> stadium in our Ciudad <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> all the games in which we will play as the home team.
