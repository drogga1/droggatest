  <p><b>[Spain attacker Lucas Vazquez wants to face Argentina’s Lionel Messi on international duty when the two World Cup hopefuls]</b> We always want to play against the best players; so if Messi players, then even better. It looks like Messi is going to be doubtful right up until the last minute. But Argentina have great players<br /><br />We’re full of hope. We are playing well as a team, the philosophy is sensational … Now’s the moment when we have to get down to hard work so that we are ready when our objectives come along. We’re on the right path<br /><br />We have to be realistic: we have a fantastic national team, with some of the top players around, but it’s pointless discussing whether we are favourites or not; the only thing we can do is work hard, know where our virtues lie and make sure we arrive in the best possible conditions, after that we can try and win the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid may have parted with Cristiano Ronaldo but they still boast a great squad]</b> We have a great squad who are shaping up well for the new season. All the players at this club are at an extremely high level and we are enjoying a strong pre-season, the training is very good.<br /><br />My own place in the team? It is up to every player to give their maximum and to convince the coach, who then has decision to make. For me it was great to be captain for a few minutes, for someone to have come through the youth system here and to be entrusted in that way is an honour<br /><br /><b>[On Luka Modric]</b> We are calm and counting on him. We hope he returns to enjoy Madrid. I have no doubt he will stay… well, you never know in football, but I think that Luka is a Madrid player and will continue to be so. It’s how I feel. I’m not in his head, but I am sure that he wants to continue. We won’t get worked up.</p>

We have what we have right now and then we will see. The club need a united squad and coaching staff, and that’s what we have<br /><br />We are used to winning all the time and when it doesn’t happen it’s natural that alarm bells ring. This is the time for coming together. We are eager to turn the situation around</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Vazquez has laughed off talk of a crisis at Real Madrid]</b> It was a very important match for us, we win again and when you chase good results, confidence increases and things come out. So much crisis talk and we are four points behind Barcelona. We will continue working to reduce that distance and fight for the title.<br /><br />It is difficult to do better, we have recovered the good feelings, we win matches again and, in my opinion, he has earned the right to continue in the position<br /><br />We know how to overcome misfortune in the form of injuries suffered by two teammates, more than ever we have shown that we are a group and that when someone leaves the bench, he also responds and sacrifices himself for the collective</p>

The best players have to come to Madrid and Hazard is one of them. I think that Pogba would be an interesting signing.<br /><br /><b>[He added on his own future]</b> We will see. Nobody knows. We will have to see. For sure I want to stay at Real Madrid. I have a contract until 2021<br /><br />It has been a tough season. Perhaps in decisive moments we were not as lucky as in other seasons</p>
