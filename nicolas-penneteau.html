  <p><b>[For <a href="victor-osimhen.html">Osimhen</a>, Wednesday’s Champions League meeting with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is the biggest game yet of his fledgling career - and not least because he’s previously been compared to a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> legend]</b> I’m sure he’s going to be a phenomenon. I’d compare him to <a href="didier-drogba.html">Didier Drogba</a>. He really makes me think of him. He has the same profile. He can do everything and he’s phenomenally powerful</p>

  <p><b>[Nicolas Penneteau says <a href="victor-osimhen.html">Victor Osimhen</a> can be <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a>’s next Didier Drogba]</b> He doesn’t surprise me. When we discovered him, when he first arrived, two clubs refused to sign him because of small physical problems. From the first training sessions we saw that he was a player of different class. I said it when he moved to Lille but for me, he might be the next <a href="didier-drogba.html">Drogba</a> in the French league<br /><br />If he stays at least another two seasons, he will score goal after goal. He has all the qualities of a modern striker. He is fast, he jumps high, he is strong in duels, good on the ball, he can play deep. He will get rid of his little imperfections as he plays. He is a phenomenon</p>
