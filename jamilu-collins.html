  <p><b>[Paderborn defender Jamilu Collins said it will be strange for clubs to conclude the 2019-20 <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> campaign without fans in the stadium]</b> I am happy with the decision made. Everybody has been waiting for this moment, and now it has been made. I am really happy that I will be able to get back on the field again, and I am really really excited about it and can’t wait to get started. It will be a little bit weird playing without fans, but we have to do what we have to do. What is important at the moment right now is to finish the season, and hopefully our fans will still cheer us watching on TV. At the moment, the safety and the health of our fans and people all over the world is very important, so it is safer for them to be at home right now. And when it is time for them to come back to watch football again, we will all be happy to see them in the stadium again. But for now we have to do what we have to do, playing indoors without fans, just playing and keeping safe</p>
