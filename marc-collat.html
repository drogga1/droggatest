  <p>[Coach Marc Collat mainly instructs in French on the steamy morning, but there’s also a strong Haitian Creole influence. As the session ends, a number of players chat with each other in English] Well, it’s my second time as Haiti coach, and during my first experience in 2015, I realized that several Haitian players were playing in Europe or in the States, and to lower the age of the squad and integrate them, we recruited these players. Today the team is very, I would say, it’s far from what we could do with other squads. That being said, all the players, whether they’re from Haiti or were born in other countries, when they put the colors on, they defend Haiti’s colors and we’re very proud of that</p>

  <p>[Haiti’s players left NRG Stadium in a jubilant mood Saturday night after scoring three second-half goals to top Canada 3-2 and move into the Gold Cup semifinals. Marc Collat claimed his team coolly, logically looked at the halftime margin and decided to change things] There was not a big speech at halftime, we just looked at the fact that we had goals that could’ve been avoided. Despite the fact that Canada was dominating, we had opportunities, we’d created opportunities. If we were more serious in the second half, we could be more difficult for them. We came back. That’s when Canada started to doubt.<br /><br />It takes one voice in the locker room to lift everyone up. First game was Nazon, second game was Herve, this game was me. I’m all about positive mentality, and that’s of one of the things I’m enforcing - I’m like, ‘yo, levez la tête - lift your head - we’re not finished. We have 45 minutes to change the game and all it takes is just one goal and we can create history after that.’ Miraculously, that’s exactly what happened</p>

  <p>[More than a <a href="carlos-vela.html">Vela</a> lookalike: Haiti’s <a href="steeven-saba.html">Steeven Saba</a> bouncing back after injuries kept him away from soccer] Steeven, I must say, joined the team this year. He’s a little bit atypical in Haiti and brings a lot of technical skill to the team. He’s very precious and I believe there’s a lot he’ll demonstrate throughout the competition<br /><br />There is a big gap, but there’s a lot of talent in Haiti. I can promise you that. There are two or three players on the team that play in Haiti currently, and I couldn’t be happier to be doing what I can to prove that there’s a lot of talent in Haiti</p>

  <p>[Haiti vs Mexico. Haiti’s unexpected progress to the semifinals might have taken less time, but it was even more dramatic. The underdogs in a clash against Canada, they rapidly fell 2-0 behind but overcame their more illustrious opponents to take a 3-2 victory] There will be no pressure on the players to beat Mexico. It is an extraordinary occasion for Haiti to be in the semifinals of the Gold Cup and I believe the players are ready for this event</p>
