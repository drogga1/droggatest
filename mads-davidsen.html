<blockquote>
  <p>[Football clubs are giving too much power to managers] This is where most clubs fail. They don’t connect the vision to the philosophy. Even internally in the club they are not very clear on what are they exactly as a club. Are they a mid-table team who aims to go higher? Are they just a survivor who aims to be permanently in the best league? Or, are they actually challengers for the title in a few years? They need to be very clear on their own DNA but this is a problem for many football clubs. The setup internally is wrong. They give the power to the coach or the manager and then they let him decide how to play, which players to bring in. Whereas you should do the opposite; that the club decides what we are.<br /><br />[When Davidsen arrived at Shanghai SIPG alongside Sven Goran Eriksson in 2014] You have to describe what you are aiming to do. The president and owners wanted SIPG to be one of the biggest teams in Asia. That was the mission. The next sentence from them was they wanted to do it with local players, our own players. Then you go to the next step to describe your strategy or your philosophy. I started to really make the methodology, and the philosophy, describe everything. I started to push the president and the general manager to get younger and younger players in, and to set up the coaching. In 2015, I presented the SIPG Way, which was the club’s DNA, the club’s philosophy and everything was basically described through it<br /><br />The view of China is it’s a buying league. I said to the president the buying stops because we have foreigners the right age who can help the team for some years and now the academy staff are producing players at the right level also. Our U23 team won the league, our U19 team won the league, our U15 team won the league. The big effect is we won the Chinese Super League, but the smaller effect is we start to have the best youth players in the coming generation. The club is healthy in the long run.<br /><br />[On Vitor Pereira] Vitor Pereira, the whole coaching staff and all the players are the main reason we won the title. They did all the work that year, maintained the strategy, the ideas and the concepts. We didn’t change or become afraid<br /><br />Manchester United suffer from not having this in place. One of the biggest clubs in the world, with the most fans, most finances and they don’t have a sporting director, don’t have a prescribed philosophy, or style of play within the club. You could say they had that under Sir Alex Ferguson but this is one of the key issues, you cannot depend on individuals in this perspective. You must depend on the formalised strategy, make a blueprint, implemented all over the club in every department. Ferguson had all this in his head but, as soon as he left, they lost their identity. They were not very clear on who they were and why they were doing stuff. Therefore, they are an example of how you can suffer despite a high amount of resources<br /><br />[of the sacking culture] It’s a little bit like peeing in your pants. You will feel warm in the beginning, but you will be cold along the way. Then you will start again when the clothes are dry. You can be lucky, of course, in that one season you might find the right manager or something just clicks. But it will not be sustainable<br /><br />I see how football is run. The model we have is there because it’s been there for a long time. It’s not there because it makes any sense. We gamble instead of planning. We gamble on who is the head coach, we throw the keys to the head coach and then we just pray that he will solve all our problems. The clubs need to take back the power. When the club takes back control, its own strategy, then you can much easier hire a manager who fits to your club. Before hiring you are clear on the expectations, where you have power and where you cannot change anything<br /><br />I have developed myself a model, called the Sustainable Model, where the club’s vision and strategy and philosophy and the methodology is decided before you hire the head coach. So this is a different set up than many clubs are used to. Today the managers and, through them, the agents have way too much power in football. And when the manager fails, time after time, he is replaced and we go again. Another one tries and asks for new players. Clubs must stop wasting money, thinking short term only and start controlling their own business again. It will not only save them money, but also help them towards winning over time</p>
