  <p>[Shanghai SIPG technical director Mads Davidsen moved to China in 2012 to run former Denmark striker Ebbe Sand’s football academy] Something has happened in the last three or four years. People want to discuss football now.<br /><br />This club was originally built by a Chinese coach called Xu Genbao who is a legend in China for developing young players. He made this club many years ago called Shanghai East Asia. It was only a youth academy to begin with. Then the kids grew older. He took them from the fourth division to the first division and he finished sixth in the Chinese Super League in the first year he had them. Then SIPG - the current owner of the club - went in and bought the club and changed the name to Shanghai SIPG. In terms of developing young talents, I’m personally lucky to come from a talented club<br /><br />That’s how we want to develop players and how we see the modern football player. We have an alignment from the U12’s to the first team. We also have planned to develop a character-building programme where we want to send players abroad for six months or one year to develop their characters. Football is not only about passing from A to B, it’s also about handling pressure, knowing your own limits, understanding the qualities that you can bring. It’s about collective moves, how we understand each other. This is all stuff the Chinese still need to develop. We need to programme it and structure it for them<br /><br />[Every incoming player - from Hulk to Oscar to Ricardo Carvalho - is made aware of the style of football being implemented at the club] Everything gets easier. if you can connect your training, your education, your management, to your recruitment. Then everything is in alignment and you will minimise the chances of failing. Scouting 10 years ago was about finding jewels. Maybe you’d go to South America or other places where people hadn’t been but that’s gone now. We have too much software. I can watch a game from the second division in Ecuador if I wish to. So now it’s all about minimising the risk of failing. You need to find the best possible targets. It’s much easier if you have a style of play and a strategy. Then you can analyse if the player fits or not<br /><br />People need to understand big names are being brought to China to promote the league, to be pioneers, to be role models. When you want to develop a football culture you also need role models to look up to. Their job is not only to play football, not only to win on a Saturday. They need to bring Chinese fans into the stadium, play good football and they also need to inspire the kids to play more football. We need big names to grow the league and increase the level. We need both parts<br /><br />It’s not an easy job. Our former player - the Swedish player Tobias Hysen - said this is much tougher than playing in the Swedish league. There is pressure on you every day, every single match. There are only three foreigners and they must deliver. People misunderstand - they think it’s an easy job to go to China. Maybe it’s easy to come but it’s very difficult to stay and get success. Maybe that’s why we see a lot of clubs changing their players all the time. If they don’t deliver, they change them. If you don’t adapt and don’t adjust your own ideas, the way you communicate, the way you give feedback then you have zero chance of succeeding. I’ve seen many players and coaches come there and try to force their way. I’m sorry to say they only lasted six months<br /><br />I described to them when I came to the club we need to drive on two roads - at the same time we need to win on Saturday and we need to win next Saturday - that’s very important - and we want to be a big club in Asia. But we also want to win in five years. And now we can start games with eight Chinese so now for me the winner in the future is the club with the best Chinese players. Talent development becomes even more important<br /><br />It’s on so many levels that it’s difficult to hold back the progression right now. The big question is whether the project continues even if a new president comes in. My hope and belief if that happens is that he will follow this new project to the end<br /><br />The level is going up not only on the pitch but also off the pitch. We have the fifth-highest attendances in the world - which is much more than when I came to China. In general we see more professional people around - better medical staff, better fitness staff. Everything is being optimised. Level-wise we have players in our club that could play in the Dutch league or the Belgian league no problem at all. Maybe even the lower teams in Germany. Obviously as more kids play football there will be a bigger pool of players and the best players will eventually get better. We need 10-15 years before we see the real result of the current investment. That doesn’t mean they will not get better tomorrow because they will and we have already improved, but the real result will take 10-15 years before we see that<br /><br />People think it’s only the president that pushed this but it’s on many levels. It’s on a grassroots level, fan level, academy level, first team level, a national team level where they’ve hired a guy like Lippi to not only coach the team but also help the whole association develop<br /><br />You have to see the whole picture before criticising one part. This is the country’s football strategy. The president has decided we want to improve in terms of football, now we start to push many buttons at the same time. That’s foreigners, young players, coaches coming in, that’s building new football academies all over China. That’s putting curriculums in school. There are so many things going on.<br /><br />I hope they will qualify for the 2026 World Cup. They will gain experience from that tournament and I think my dream is that China gets the World Cup in 2030. Then we’ll have a perfect situation for a home team of China to not only show themselves but to show the world what China has done in the last 15 years</p>

  <p>[Football clubs are giving too much power to managers] This is where most clubs fail. They don’t connect the vision to the philosophy. Even internally in the club they are not very clear on what are they exactly as a club. Are they a mid-table team who aims to go higher? Are they just a survivor who aims to be permanently in the best league? Or, are they actually challengers for the title in a few years? They need to be very clear on their own DNA but this is a problem for many football clubs. The setup internally is wrong. They give the power to the coach or the manager and then they let him decide how to play, which players to bring in. Whereas you should do the opposite; that the club decides what we are.<br /><br />[When Davidsen arrived at Shanghai SIPG alongside Sven Goran Eriksson in 2014] You have to describe what you are aiming to do. The president and owners wanted SIPG to be one of the biggest teams in Asia. That was the mission. The next sentence from them was they wanted to do it with local players, our own players. Then you go to the next step to describe your strategy or your philosophy. I started to really make the methodology, and the philosophy, describe everything. I started to push the president and the general manager to get younger and younger players in, and to set up the coaching. In 2015, I presented the SIPG Way, which was the club’s DNA, the club’s philosophy and everything was basically described through it<br /><br />The view of China is it’s a buying league. I said to the president the buying stops because we have foreigners the right age who can help the team for some years and now the academy staff are producing players at the right level also. Our U23 team won the league, our U19 team won the league, our U15 team won the league. The big effect is we won the Chinese Super League, but the smaller effect is we start to have the best youth players in the coming generation. The club is healthy in the long run.<br /><br />[On Vitor Pereira] Vitor Pereira, the whole coaching staff and all the players are the main reason we won the title. They did all the work that year, maintained the strategy, the ideas and the concepts. We didn’t change or become afraid<br /><br />Manchester United suffer from not having this in place. One of the biggest clubs in the world, with the most fans, most finances and they don’t have a sporting director, don’t have a prescribed philosophy, or style of play within the club. You could say they had that under Sir Alex Ferguson but this is one of the key issues, you cannot depend on individuals in this perspective. You must depend on the formalised strategy, make a blueprint, implemented all over the club in every department. Ferguson had all this in his head but, as soon as he left, they lost their identity. They were not very clear on who they were and why they were doing stuff. Therefore, they are an example of how you can suffer despite a high amount of resources<br /><br />[of the sacking culture] It’s a little bit like peeing in your pants. You will feel warm in the beginning, but you will be cold along the way. Then you will start again when the clothes are dry. You can be lucky, of course, in that one season you might find the right manager or something just clicks. But it will not be sustainable<br /><br />I see how football is run. The model we have is there because it’s been there for a long time. It’s not there because it makes any sense. We gamble instead of planning. We gamble on who is the head coach, we throw the keys to the head coach and then we just pray that he will solve all our problems. The clubs need to take back the power. When the club takes back control, its own strategy, then you can much easier hire a manager who fits to your club. Before hiring you are clear on the expectations, where you have power and where you cannot change anything<br /><br />I have developed myself a model, called the Sustainable Model, where the club’s vision and strategy and philosophy and the methodology is decided before you hire the head coach. So this is a different set up than many clubs are used to. Today the managers and, through them, the agents have way too much power in football. And when the manager fails, time after time, he is replaced and we go again. Another one tries and asks for new players. Clubs must stop wasting money, thinking short term only and start controlling their own business again. It will not only save them money, but also help them towards winning over time</p>
