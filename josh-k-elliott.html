<blockquote>
  <p>The 12 Thai soccer players rescued from a cave in July opened an exhibit about their rescue last week, held a Q&amp;A with the press, appeared as guests of honour at a banquet for 10,000 and toured Thailand’s Royal Palace - all over the course of three days. The boys also crawled through a replica of the cave where they spent two weeks huddled together<br /><br />Thailand initially said the boys would go through a six-month psychological monitoring period, but the government has thrust them back into the spotlight just two months after their ordeal. And experts say the government and the king are eager to capitalize on the feel-good story now, regardless of whether the children are prepared.<br /><br />Last week’s ‘United as One’ media blitz was sponsored by Thailand’s new monarch, <a href="king-rama-x.html">King Maha Vajiralongkorn</a>, and the country’s unelected government<br /><br />Thailand expert <a href="kevin-hewison.html">Kevin Hewison</a> says the government needs the publicity ahead of an anticipated election that it hopes to win<br /><br /><a href="kevin-hewison.html">Hewison</a> says the junta has been trying to position itself to win the eventual election, by silencing opposition and promoting itself through the media. The junta has said the election will come in late February, but no concrete date has been set<br /><br />Thailand has also celebrated other aspects of the July rescue. It hailed several foreign rescue divers as heroes, ordered a museum built about the event, and made a national hero out of Samarn Kunan, the former Navy SEAL who died during the recovery operation<br /><br />The boys are being shepherded around by two government committees that control access to them. They’re scheduled to speak to the press again on Sept. 15-16.<br /><br />The boys were permitted to answer questions at the opening of the cave rescue exhibit last Wednesday. When asked how they were doing, at least five of them delivered versions of the same answer: ‘My life is the same, but more people are approaching me’<br /><br />The Wild Boars also appeared in public in early August, when all but one of them attended a ceremony to become Buddhist monks. They said the gesture was to give thanks for their return and to pay tribute to the rescuer who died<br /><br />The Thai government said after the rescue that the boys, who are between the ages of 11 and 16, would be monitored for six months for signs of psychological trauma. Dr Andrea Danese suggested that up to 20 per cent of the boys might develop longer-term psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the incident. The boys are also at risk of suffering withdrawal, according to Dr. Paul Auberbach, of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Stanford University’s medical school<br /><br />A group of Chilean miners who went through a similar ordeal in 2010 warned the boys about the brief fame they would encounter after their rescue. ‘Almost every miner has psychological issues. They don’t sleep or feel well. It’s not well known in Chile but they are in despair’. foreman Luis Urzua, 62, told Reuters in July.</p>
