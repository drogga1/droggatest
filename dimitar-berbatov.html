I don’t think anyone said <b>[Ibrahimovic is too old]</b> because he is a player at the top level where he plays, he can play for another two years, maybe more. He has the class and understanding of the game and also when to push himself and when to not waste energy, just the right moment at the right time and he’s there scoring goals. He has football intelligence and then of course you have Gareth Barry at Everton. I tend to watch the older players and see how they are playing and I admire both of them because, at this age, in football, it is very difficult to maintain a high level of performance and for both of those players to do this is worthy of admiration.</p>

Of course, the club was showing they want me very much, always speaking with my agent, treating us with respect, and this was enough to convince me that I need to take this challenge in this new league!<br /><br />It’s the third time we are going to work together, he knows me very well, he knows how I like to play football, what I need in training to feel good and to be in the best shape for my years.

  <p><b>[Manchester United are set to benefit from a confident Paul Pogba]</b> Jose Mourinho knows how to control to big players in the dressing room, to control egos, he’s done it all his life and knows how to work it into the team. It’s not easy for Mourinho, when teams are set up defensively against them because then it’s when you need imagination, that Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku possess. Coming from experience as a former footballer, Pogba will start to see things getting easier for him now he has the confidence of winning the World Cup. On the pitch you can have the feeling that everything is happening for you, from passing to tackles. This should give him more momentum in the Premier League but he needs to stay strong. Sometimes self-esteem affects you on and off the pitch, until you face your next game and you miss an easy chance for example, then you feel not as great. However, he will be a world champion for life, now he needs to be a league winner. Top players at Old Trafford know how to be winners.<br /><br />He has all he needs, I don’t think he needs to score the most to define his price tag, he has completely different things to do on the pitch and he’s doing it his way. Brilliantly. Lukaku is scoring more goals and coming off his experience over the summer, he’ll feel that he’s a big part of Manchester United. He’s intimidating in the box, very quick and has the players supplying him with the passes he needs.<br /><br />Manchester United need to get back to being champions again, to do this you need to do one thing, and one thing only, you need to win. It doesn’t matter how many goals you score; one goal is enough if you don’t let one in your net. It’s getting more difficult as in the league, teams are getting stronger. Everybody wants to be the team that people say, ‘they play great football’, but at my time at the club and how we used to do things, there aren’t that many changes. You still pass the ball and you move, it’s not difficult, and now United have talented players in the team and can improve on being runners up. Mourinho is the best at this, you cannot question his ability with the silverware he’s won. When I go back to the training ground, players tell me how the team is well built and I can’t wait to see them as champions</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba and Jose Mourinho will figure it out at Manchester United]</b> I was very happy with the display of Paul Pogba against Leicester, it was a real captain’s performance. He was everywhere on the pitch, passed it well, took the penalty with confidence - considering it was the first game, it was very encouraging. There has been chat in the media about him being unhappy, but I think the newspapers and social media are always focused on that side of things, trying to find problems that aren’t necessarily there, constantly exaggerating - it’s on the pitch that matters. These stories are not good for anybody, but Jose and Pogba will figure it out.<br /><br />I said last week that I thought Manchester United’s game with Leicester would end in a low-scoring win and it ended up being a tight one. United were a bit lucky in the end - Leicester had a great chance to equalise at the death - but overall it was a deserved win, and a good way to kick off the season. I know some United fans want a more expansive attacking game and I can understand their frustrations, but the result is the most important thing, especially at the start of the season, and you need to be tactically clever. If you win every game by a single goal you still get maximum points!</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov has revealed he told his agent to fuck off when he was told of Manchester City’s interest in signing him in 2008]</b> I don’t think it was that close, to be honest. My agent told me about some interest but I said, ‘Don’t even bother mentioning anyone else, I’m going to Man United,’ because of the history, the players, the tradition, everything. I think it was the night before City signed Robinho from Real Madrid and my agent said, ‘Berba, there’s another team in for you’. I said, ‘Fuck off, we’re going to Man United’. He said, ‘But they’ll give you more money!’. It’s not all about the money sometimes, though. I was like a horse with blinkers. For me it was the right decision because going to the top of the mountain was my dream, especially when you come from Eastern Europe, from a small town, and no one’s done it before you. It was a great feeling.<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov left a Spurs side]</b> It’s difficult. You see it all the time with players moving clubs.

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba and Jose Mourinho may be experiencing friction at Manchester United]</b> Neither of them should go, it’s all just speculation and it’s not helping. The focus needs to change to football there. At a big club there are always going to be issues and you will always have players with big egos who want to win and sometimes this can create friction between the players or with the manager but it’s normal in football clubs especially a big successful club. When you are a grown up man you know how to deal with a situation like this, but if those outside the club are constantly talking about it and coming up with stories then it’s not helping anyone. I’m far away from the team so I’m just reading what everyone else is reading, I don’t have the inside word but even if there is something going on then the people involved should know how to deal with it and that’s the end of it. We are all humans, everyone makes mistakes, but the focus should be on the field.</p>

I am not at the training ground, I don’t speak with the manager or the players, but looking from the outside, it’s not good to see how they’re performing right now. As a former player it’s painful because you want your team to win all the time. But as I said before.<br /><br />I’m sure everyone at the club is doing everything they can to resolve this small crisis they are in. I still cannot imagine any Manchester United player not putting his all in to turn it around. Players want to enjoy their football and talk up their performances.

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov has called for Romelu Lukaku’s critics to lay off the Manchester United striker]</b> There has been a lot of criticism for Romelu Lukaku since the game but you’ll never catch me having a go at a fellow striker. I know how difficult it is. I remember when I was on a bad run at United when I hadn’t scored for seven or eight games, but then scored five in one game. It happens to everyone. I know he’s not scored for eight games, but I don’t think the criticism of Lukaku is fair. As Jose Mourinho said, he’s working very hard for the team, but this might actually be working against the striker. He wants to impress so badly that he is doing too much, and not doing the simple things like getting into the box. He is probably over complicating things; you don’t want to see him popping up at left-back as he did on Tuesday.</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho has returned old school qualities to his Manchester United side]</b> What a turnaround from Jose Mourinho’s team in Turin on Wednesday. Juventus scored a phenomenal goal through Cristiano Ronaldo and could have been three or four up, hitting the woodwork twice, but Manchester United stuck in there, didn’t give up and were rewarded in the end. It was like old school United! The game once again showed the importance of set pieces. Juventus had the better of the game, but United scored a great free-kick through Juan Mata and then a second after a good Ashley Young delivery. Yes, they had a slice of luck there, but it was one of those crosses that goalkeepers and defenders hate. Mata wasn’t in the team much at the start of the season but he’s played an increasingly important role in recent weeks and the way he celebrated the goal - running over to the coaching staff - showed what a team player he is. He understands that the team is the most important thing and that some weeks he won’t be in the side. A great professional.<br /><br />A lot of the post-match headlines were about Mourinho’s reaction to the Juventus fans at the end of the game. Was it the right thing to do? No, but we’re all human. He must have been getting a lot of abuse from the home fans and it shouldn’t overshadow what was a fantastic result for his team<br /><br />With both teams getting positive results in the Champions League, the Manchester derby clash on Sunday couldn’t have been set up better. Manchester City are in great shape of course, scoring goals for fun, but United have had some positive results, showing good spirit to come back from behind more than once and it will be difficult for both teams. Of course, United defenders will have to be on top form to keep out <b>[Raheem]</b> Sterling, <b>[Sergio]</b> Aguero and co, but Juventus were also odds-on favourites and had the likes of Ronaldo and <b>[Paulo]</b> Dybala in their ranks, so it can be done.</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov has praised Fulham for the appointment of Claudio Ranieri]</b> Ranieri was my coach at Monaco so I know him well, and I think if you appoint someone in this situation, with Fulham are last in the table, you want to appoint someone with great experience who could help them stay up. He is a great appointment, I wish him luck and I know he’s going to work hard, because that’s what he does.<br /><br />When I was under him at Monaco, there were so many young players there like Martial and James Rodriguez. All these talented footballers with potential and he was working well with them. Ranieri has that experience, he knows how to handle not only young talent but the big names too<br /><br />it’s a bit unfair for Jokanovic to go. Look at Newcastle, for example, they didn’t win a game for 10 matches in a row and now they’ve won back-to-back games<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov was impressed with Jokanovic’s management style]</b> They play good football and this is what I like about them. I watched them against Liverpool and they don’t just kick the ball to see what happens next, they pass around the ball well. Sometimes this won’t give you results because of the teams you face in the league are of better quality, or you have bad luck like their disallowed goal against Liverpool. However, the results will come if you stick to your philosophy</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United are not short of money and need to land two centre-halves during the January]</b> They need to reinforce at the back especially centre backs, one or two. In every other position they have several quality players and everything they need, so just defence needs reinforcing. Hopefully they can find one or two and then they should be okay. It’ll be more difficult in the winter transfer window then the summer one to make signings for Mourinho but he should be able to find one person he wants to bring in. So if there is someone he wants to bring in the board should listen to him because it’s obvious that the club aren’t perfect right now and aren’t in the position that they want to be in. They need to improve on that, if it means bringing one or two people, it shouldn’t be a problem. I mean it’s not like Manchester United are short of money.</p>

Rashford hasn’t necessarily hit top form for Man United so far this season, but he is a good player with a big future ahead of him. If he is not happy with the lack of playing time, I can understand why he might start thinking about his options.<br /><br />I would be very sad to see him leave and Manchester United need to do all they can to keep him, but you can see why players head get turned when names like Real Madrid are mentioned. Madrid isn’t a place where he is necessarily going to get more playing time, of course, but when you are bit confused, you sometimes forget about those details and can get seduced by the big name. You think ‘fuck it, I’m not getting a chance here, so why not?’ But, as I said, I do not want this move to happen. It’s important that academy players are given a chance and we don’t want to see another Pogba situation where United have to pay a huge fee for someone they had on their books in the first place</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United need to find a ball-playing centre-half in January]</b> The January transfer window is approaching and I’d like to see Jose bring a ball-playing centre-half to Old Trafford. United lost Victor Lindelof for some time after suffering an injury against Crystal Palace and that will be a loss as Jose had shown plenty of faith in him this season. The Swedish defender had played in every Premier League game but one so far this campaign. For me, United need to sign someone with calmness on the ball, who can feed the midfield and carry the ball out. In modern football you need to play the ball out from the back and United have been missing that a bit.<br /><br />For me, those reactions are coming from the tension and stress around the team, and the criticism Mourinho is taking right now. Of course that is going to affect the manager. It can’t be easy to get criticised from all sides and, from time to time, that pressure must show. And from a player’s point of view it’s not good. You are going to see it either during or after the game, or someone’s going to tell you about it or ask about it, and you are not going to feel good<br /><br />Every coach has their own philosophy for getting the best out of players and sometimes these can seem strange to the public. Mourinho is a winner, we know this, and maybe this is his way of motivating. People are always looking for controversy but I don’t like to pay too much attention to stuff like this. For me, this is one for the team to deal with. When Jose destroyed the water tray that was a massive release of the stress that has built up.</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov has defended Romelu Lukaku]</b> Why do people concentrate on this <b>[goalscoring drought]</b>? Strikers are more than just goals now. How is that going to help Lukaku when there are constantly people saying how long he didn’t score a goal for. It is important and I am sure he had that relief ‘it is finally over’. People always talking about him not scoring is just spreading negativity.<br /><br />He knows all this. He is probably going home and saying to himself ‘I cannot believe I didn’t score again, people are going to be on my back.’ How is that going to affect his self-confidence? It is low. People think he does not want to score, but that is wrong of course. I like him a lot, because he is good on the ball, he is powerful, but he needs team-mates around him who understand his quality, and know how to pass him the ball. If Lukaku is not as good as others with his first touch, then give him a ball that he can handle</p>

Because if you play in the Champions League, you go to the next stage and all of the time you face the best teams and the best players in the world, this is how you keep your best players. This is how you build for the future and how you show that you have the desire and the willingness to win something.

They deserved that goal<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on how the current Spurs side compares to the one he helped to League Cup glory in 2008]</b> Better. The irony is that we still won a cup and they didn’t win something yet. The only thing they are missing is winning something. Hopefully it’s going to happen soon. If you want to develop as a player, in the end you have to show up with something and say I was a great player, but what did I win in the end? Sometimes the players feel comfortable in Spurs but they start thinking ‘is it time for me to win something? Is it time for the next step? Am I in the right place here to win something?’. When you do performances like this and go to the next stage of the Champions League, it tells you in your head that you are capable of winning something</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov has suggested that Manchester United should look at making a January move for Leicester City centre-back Harry Maguire]</b> It’s always difficult to buy someone that’s really good in the winter window so if you are lucky enough to buy someone then you need to keep in mind how he’s going to integrate with the team. If it’s someone coming from a foreign league it can be more difficult than joining from an English team. If you’re buying a central defender then you also need to think about who you’re going to partner him with because you could buy a really good player but if it doesn’t work out then that just causes another problem. But I think they need someone at the back that’s comfortable on the ball and don’t buckle under pressure even when someone is attacking you. You need to be calm, be able to pass the ball into midfield and carry it. I think they need a player like that. I was really impressed with Harry Maguire in the World Cup because he was so composed on the ball and I like that quality in a defender because it benefits the whole team.</p>

It is tiring to have so much change in the managerial position. A club needs that stability at the top.

With all the work he has done I don’t think it would be fair to him or the players if they don’t announce that he is going to stay in charge. Ole was able to raise the spirit, the team, everything at the club. He was the guy who took responsibility in a difficult situation. Purely on what he achieved so far he deserves an extension. He has earned it. He is young for a manager, an ex-United player - it’s the best combination for the club to build for the future.</p>

I like him, I don’t agree with all the criticism he’s getting - yes he has some areas which he need to work like every other player. But his teammates need to help him as well. For example if I’m a midfield player and I play with him, I will know how to pass him the ball, when to pass him the ball, on which foot to pass him the ball. This is what your teammates need to know, how to play with you<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov believes <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> is in the right situation to improve]</b> I think <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> is a good coach for him because if <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> wants to ask the coach something, he can go and ask him, because <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskajer</a> was a good striker.

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov says <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a> can become one of the best, best strikers if <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> use him correctly]</b> I am slightly biased, but I think Martial can become one of the best, best strikers. It depends on whether he has the attitude, the fighting spirit, but he is so good I think he can become one of the best. He has often played two to three games then out for two to three games. Two to three games on the bench then two to three games back in the team. And then United fans ask, why isn’t he consistent? It depends on him, himself, but Martial has to stay at United. He can be a really great player for them<br /><br />I had some of the best times of my career at <a href="monaco-fc.html">Monaco</a>, and not just because of the city.

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov claims <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> may have to consider leaving <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in order to fulfil his ambition of landing major silverware]</b> Someone needs to ask <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> about what he will do if <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> don’t win a trophy this season. Coming from that point of view, and I’ve been in those shoes, the moment comes when you play for a team for a while and you don’t win anything. At the same time you see other colleagues that you are playing with in the national team, and they are winning trophies. You get jealous, in a good way. You’re like ‘I want to be part of that’. You start asking all these questions and at one moment nothing changes, you change the environment, you change the club. It’s a tough decision because fans will be disappointed - and so will the coach.<br /><br />What is that ambition telling him? Stay here and try to win trophies for my club that I’m captain of. Or find a new challenge where you need to test yourself. The question is, if he moves, for example to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, is he going to be playing with better players and scoring more? I was thinking about that when I moved. Every player who wants to achieve and develop and grow as a player is thinking about that. You’re sitting at home, you’re watching a game, big players, big teams are playing and you think ‘what if I was there, am I going to score more goals?’. It’s normal to think like this. Then you start thinking ‘Well I stay here because I’m in the place that I know, I’m comfortable’. You need to choose - test yourself or stay in the same place? Trust me, it’s a complicated situation</p>

That’s unfair on the player but Maguire is a great signing. He will bring football intelligence, calm, interceptions, the ability to bring the ball out, feed the midfield and even the attack. An ability to read the game is so important and Maguire is excellent at that</p>

Teams are seeing the results that United are getting and where they have been finishing in the last couple of years and they believe they have a chance to get the win and the three points against them. On Wednesday evening, I watched Rochdale play it out from the back at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, showing how they didn’t care that they were playing against United, they were so confident even though they made a couple of mistakes it didn’t matter. United need to get back to when teams used to come to <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> and shit themselves in the tunnel and hopefully they can put that fear back into the teams soon<br /><br /><b>[Questions are being asked of his suitability to a demanding role]</b> The pressure on <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> is there and the truth is it’s a difficult situation. When you lose matches people want you out and when you win nobody says anything. For me United still need to give <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> time, it’s not possible for the coach to go every time there are a few bad results, the next one will come in and it will be the same, it’s a vicious circle and you cannot escape that. So, they need to give him more time, the games and the standards haven’t been there recently but I’m sure they are working hard on the training pitch.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that he can turn things around. I love him as a human, a football player and I want him to succeed as a coach. He is at the club where he is a legend, the club have given him a chance and he has great staff and people around him. It is a matter of time, let’s not forget <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> won the league in his sixth season so it’s a long process and it’s not as easy as people think. You don’t just go on the training ground and give the balls out and do exercise. There is a lot that a manager has to deal with. To get rid of him now would be a mistake. Of course, the coach depends on the results of the team, so he is actually depending on his players and he needs the results, everybody knows that. This is <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and they need to win, it doesn’t matter which competition. It would be a mistake if they try to replace him now but at the same time the manager depends on the results of the team. So from now until the end of next month, if <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> continue to lose and draw, it is going to be difficult to advocate and say they are working positively to turn things around. In that situation, what do you do?</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov proclaims He was an artist on the pitch]</b> I was an artist on the pitch. I didn’t realise it in the beginning but it was really important for me to do something different. If you watch me, you won’t fall asleep or switch the channel. It might be a small movement, detail, how I control the ball or flick the ball. I wanted people to say ‘wow, I want to try that’. Then you see it isn’t as easy as it looks. This is what I wanted to do. It didn’t affect my game because this is who I am. I have my way of seeing football, not everyone can see it in the same way.<br /><br />Everyone is different. It helped me get to one of the biggest clubs in the world. Of course, you can’t play with 11 artists on the pitch. It is not going to happen, you need…not 11 of me. You need aggression. That player is a bully with a tooth missing, grass and blood on their shirt. You ask someone like Vida (Nemanja Vidic), ‘are you okay?’ He goes ‘I am fucking great’. You appreciate what he is doing for you. He gets the ball, gives it to you. You can then do the magic<br /><br />I had <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> and <a href="robbie-keane.html">Robbie Keane</a>. Even if you don’t speak a lot outside the pitch, you respect each other for what you do on the pitch. You see what each other can do and how you help each other get better. In turn, you help the team. Everyone wins. At Leverkusen, I had a great partnership with a guy called Franca. We scored so many goals. We destroyed <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in a season. 4-1. We both got two goals each. He didn’t speak English or German so outside the pitch we didn’t say a word. Literally nothing. Honestly, nothing. I saw how he trained and played on the pitch and the other way around. When we stepped on the pitch, man, it was like we were sleeping together. I was enjoying playing with that guy. Unbelievable<br /><br /><b>[For the more introverted Berbatov, though, drawing and reading were his primary activities of choice, and something he still enjoys today]</b> I always tried to grow out of that. I was a very shy boy. I didn’t speak to many people and I tried to keep my world private. I am still to this day the same in some areas of my life but now I am more open to conversations and socialising with people. I think it is something I should have done more often when I was playing<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov feels those watching him were often not able to analyse his contribution fairly]</b> It is probably because I didn’t play like <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> or <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Tevez</a>. I didn’t like that because I can show you six or seven current world-class players who run less than me back then. When you label something like that, it sticks. Even if it isn’t true. People can go fuck themselves. People don’t understand and try to look smart. I would check my stats after every game and I was running 10-11km every game. It doesn’t make any difference for me. I was more bothered how I move and make space. How to get an assist or pass to keep the ball. It wasn’t all about goals. I know when I was bad or good. I was realistic and knew where I stood in the football world. I always wanted to develop.<br /><br /><b>[He is set to get his <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> A Licence and he is beginning to consider a coaching career]</b> I had four scenes in the movie and I enjoyed it because it was something new. I will probably not do it again, now I have done it, I know what it is.<br /><br />My ambitions are what I know and do which is football. Maybe in the future I will try being a manager or sports director. I have my degree in sports management and I am doing my coaching badges at the moment. I studied in Sofia and I am doing my badges there. I am going to get my A Licence and then I only need my Pro Licence and I am ready to go. You never know, I need to prepare. I try to write about training schedules and things like this. You need to stay true to yourself. Integrate your philosophy and know who you are.<br /><br />At the moment, I am studying. I have people around me who are doing the same. I have a plan in my head how I would do it and how I like to do it. You need to be in the right place at the right time, just look at <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> and <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. I feel good in Sofia at the moment. My ambitions, if it is coaching, is to do it in the UK. People know me and respect me here. I like living here, too. London is one of the best cities in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Bulgarian football legend Dimitar Berbatov has slammed his countrymen for the racist incidents suffered by England players in Sofia]</b> In every nation there are bad apples and bad people, this was the case in our stadium against England this week. There were people there who were only there to provoke; these people don’t deserve to go to games and watch football, and for me they need to be banned for life, not just at football but all kinds of sport. I hope our government in Bulgaria does their job and bans them for life, they don’t deserve to be there and they have brought shame on all of us. Because of them, we are only talking about the incidents of racism and not about the football, which has become secondary and it should not be like that. I am very ashamed of how these people can do this.<br /><br />It is also a problem in England, Italy and all around the world, these people should be banned for life. We need to stay together and fight against it because this is unacceptable. I cannot accept the criticism that the whole of Bulgaria has received, 50 people cannot define a nation, we are not racists. I am a proud Bulgarian and I know that we are dealing with this straight away, and there will be severe justice. I hope that every country around the world is working on this issue, we are all in this together, let’s not divide</p>

Sometimes if the game wasn’t going our way, it wasn’t going as expected you couldn’t forget what was said in the dressing room how ambitious and motivated we all were so you would try to carry that onto the pitch for the whole 90 minutes.<br /><br />I would also prepare in my own way and I would tell myself ‘Berba you go out there and give it everything you fucking can’. This was my own motivation, I didn’t need anyone to motivate me, I would do it in my own way. But when you are out on the pitch and see <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a> running his fucking bollocks off on the right side, Scholsey controlling the midfield and <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> running like crazy, it is extra motivation, you say to yourself ‘you better fucking be like them or even better or you’re in trouble<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov feels <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s arrival at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> represents a great opportunity for United to banish the demons of a shock 1-0 defeat at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> before the international break]</b> Based on the form of both teams, where <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and United are in the table and the way they are playing football at the moment, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are obviously ahead. United will need to be prepared for a very difficult game and the sad part is that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are overwhelming favourites. I try to stay optimistic but it is going to be very difficult for United to get a result if they play the way they did against <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. That was probably the shittest game I have seen them play, honestly, it was painful.<br /><br />It is still early in the season and maybe there is still time to turn things around, to catch up to the top four, there is still time in my opinion but they need to correct the way they are playing football, the way they move into the spaces, how the players are looking for the ball, their speed of the ball when they are passing - these are the things they need to work on.<br /><br />United now have an opportunity to challenge themselves but it is going to be difficult because they have had players on international duty that are only just coming back and they will only have a couple of days to prepare, train and play together. If you look at the tempo and the way United are playing, as a United player you feel shit and you look at the games that you play and you don’t feel well, but now they need to challenge themselves and this big test is a great way for them to do just that</p>

It makes me feel like shit, it’s not good and I don’t think anybody wants to look at the table. I don’t think anybody connected with the club will want to check the table at the moment, when you see a team with the calibre of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, one of the biggest clubs in the world, and you see where they are in the table it is crazy to think how times have changed.<br /><br />The players will know what position they are but I don’t advise them to look at it because it isn’t going to make them feel good. On the other hand, you could say ‘come on boys, look at where we are - do we deserve to be here?’. Maybe with some of the performances they have produced they deserve to be there and especially if they continue like that, but if they play the way they did like against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, with aggression and getting in the oppositions’ faces, then things will improve. I’ve said it before, but it’s not too late to turn things around.

When you have been out for so long, things are tough. When you are injured you watch your mates train and you are with the physios, you see them putting their boots on, heading out on to the pitch and this can make you sad and depressed.<br /><br />You get all these feeling rush to your head and you want to get back as soon as possible and this can lead to mistakes, you could go out there and you’re not quite ready and you could get injured again. So, it’s really important to time right the moment you come back. In the case of Martial, to get going again and get a goal will give him even more confidence, especially for a striker. But like any other player, the most important thing now is to stay fit, know when to push hard and slowdown in training because when you have so many games you need to know when to save your energy. The last thing he and the club needs is to pick up another injury</p>

But it’s not going to happen. United fans want to see strikers who play with the element of surprise, beating defenders and shooting from different angles, so the way to deal with the pressure as a new United striker is to be different.

  <p><b>[Berbatov’s advice for <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> as he says he feels like ‘shit’ after Manchester derby]</b> It was another great goal from <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> <b>[against City]</b> and a really fast counter attack. United have some very quick players and they didn’t take advantage of that. The only trouble sometimes is that the quick players want the ball at their feet and they are not using the space in front of them, but when they try to use the space and make a run the midfield players are not seeing them and not giving them the ball.<br /><br />If I am as quick as <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> and make three runs and nobody sees me or gives me the ball, on the fourth one I wouldn’t waste my energy, it’s all psychological. When I was playing, Sir Alex would say ‘Give Berba the ball, and when you give it to him, don’t stay, run, because he’s going to find you’. You need to know your team-mates, who is going to pass you the ball and who is going to make the run, these kinds of things are small details, but they are the most important.<br /><br /><a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> needs to be strong with his team-mates, if he needs to have an argument on the pitch or shout ‘fucking give me the ball,’ do it, it doesn’t matter, you need to show character and have that will to win. Argue or fight, it doesn’t matter if everything is for the purpose of winning the game, you fucking do it<br /><br />Honestly, after that first leg against City I feel like shit. The first half was way below standards, it was not good to watch, the team was all over the place and City were the better side for sure - everybody saw that. In the second half there was a bit of an improvement on all fronts, but it was not enough and when City score three goals against you to change the game is next to impossible, as we saw.<br /><br />The only thing good about it is that there is another game and hopefully they have time to take something from it and show a better account of themselves. I have seen a lot of people saying that the first half was the worst they’ve ever seen United play, I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but it wasn’t good. Honestly, City should have scored not three but five goals.<br /><br /><b>[Raheem]</b> Sterling not being in his best moment to finish a couple of chances in front of goal was a good thing for United. I think the outcome was more down to how poor United were in the first half and not necessarily how good City were. Hopefully, they will recover for the next leg, the real problem is that we are seeing too many of this kind of performances, of course it’s not every game but we are seeing it more than we want to, even if it’s just a poor spell in a match, the fans don’t want to see it</p>

The manager needs to stay positive and give that vibe that everything is OK and that he has it under control.

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov thinks that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> will continue to struggle to attract top players]</b> United have been sliding for a while and once you get like that it is difficult to stop. Yes, they have won some trophies on the way but overall if you look you can clearly see that United are not where everybody wants them and expects them to be.<br /><br />It is easy to blame and point the finger but of course, there are a number of factors causing issues and stress in the team. Sometimes when you decline so much you lose games, the pressure builds, and you go on the pitch and you just don’t want the ball, and that is the worst thing a player can do.<br /><br />I think Ole is still the man to stop the decline, but they need to do business in the transfer market and buy some players now. The question is who do they go out and get and do the players even want to come to <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>. The sad part is, United will now have to work hard to convince players to come. In the past, you only had to say the name ‘Manchester United’ and you were there asking where do you sign.<br /><br />If you asked a group of players now, out of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and other big teams where would they like to go, United would probably be the last place they’d want to go, which is really depressing, and it shows just how much they have declined. It is what it is and whoever is in charge of signing players needs to go and speak to people and do their best because if the slide continues then things will only get worse<br /><br />I keep reading about <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a>, he’s not a magician, do people really think if a player comes in the team are automatically going to start winning?

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov says <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> makes <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> a different side]</b> It will be difficult for United to finish in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> top four but, with <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> performing inconsistently, it is not impossible. United look like a different team with Fernandes always looking to get on the ball, drive them forward and play the strikers in. I would have enjoyed playing in front of Fernandes because, for a striker, you are always willing to make runs when you know you have somebody in midfield who can find you with a pass. As well as his creativity, Fernandes has a good shot on him. The only aspect of his performance that he needs to work on is his aggression in the defensive part of the game but that should come as he gets more experience in the Premier League<br /><br />Since being made permanent club captain, <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> has grown in stature and that’s rubbing off across the defence. They will need to maintain that discipline when they go to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> on Sunday for what should be their toughest test for a few weeks</p>

He doesn’t just stay in the box and try to head the ball. He is linking really well with others and that shows in the team performances when he is involved<br /><br /><a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> is scoring and is full of confidence, he gives the team that extra creativity and hopefully his first derby will be a win, and why not. When you come into a new country and a new team you already know who your big rivals are going to be and now in the lead up to Sunday he is going to know what this game is all about. These days, even if you don’t watch football you know who <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> are and who plays for them. Fernandes will have done his homework and he will be prepared. These two teams know each other so well, some of them probably go for dinner together, you have these things, but when you step onto the pitch it’s about my team not yours</p>

Bruno Fernandes’ ball into <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Odion Ighalo</a> for the first United goal against LASK was the perfect assist. What a pass. Oh my god. And what a finish from <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a>. It was a world class goal, I was so happy for both players and jumping out my seat when it hit the net. Fernandes has quickly become an influential player for United. I’m pleased and impressed by how well integrated into the team he’s become in a short space of time. His team-mates are looking for him with the ball because they know he can create magic. He looks happy to be playing for United. I really hope he continues in this form. As a fan of <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>, I want him to stay at United, I think it would be best for him, but I am curious to see how he will link up with Fernandes. They’re similar players, both intelligent enough to think three steps ahead when they’re on the ball. Sometimes footballers are too similar to play together. But I hope that’s not the case here because, with Fernandes and <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> in the same midfield, United could be a very imaginative team that would surprise opponents next season or even sooner</p>

  <p><b>[Berbatov wants to see Fernandes partnership]</b> Once again there is a lot of talk about <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> and his future. He hasn’t played for a long time, people are asking questions of him: does he want to play, how long will it take for him to return, when he comes back will he be able to play with <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a>, how will he fit into the team - these are all unanswered questions that sooner or later we will find out. I want him to stay at United and I want to see him play alongside Fernandes and the team, if not there will always be a team waiting for <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, if that is <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> or someone else who knows, but he will fit in anywhere. The criticism <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> gets is unfair and he, like some other players, get criticised just for the sake of it, it doesn’t matter what he does<br /><br />He is doing everything he can to get fit and to help his team because I have seen first-hand how he used to train with us as a boy, with ambition and the aspiration to be one of the best, so I don’t doubt his work ethic and desire to become even better. All he will want to do right now is play football, we are all human beings and as much as you try to avoid it, criticism always gets to you.<br /><br />I would like to see <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> get fit as soon as possible and not get injured again, so that he can do what he does best and we can see him play great football. If he was to move, wherever he goes he will be fine.<br /><br />He knows that if it isn’t working out that there is always a team waiting for him some place else and if he goes he’ll play and do well. Look at <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a>, I mean what the fuck? It didn’t work out for him at United and now he has been reborn at Inter, how do you explain that?<br /><br />It’s human nature, sometimes you just don’t feel comfortable in one place because the criticism is too much, you close yourself off and don’t let people in. You think to yourself: ‘It doesn’t matter what I do, nobody appreciates it,’ then you move and you score 23 goals for your new club.<br /><br />One thing I will say about the <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> rumours is, don’t forget <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> is manager there and when you have a manager or other players from the same country you always speak and know that you will get on, especially speaking the same language, it makes you feel comfortable and that is not to be underestimated in this situation</p>

Sometimes, that can play on your mind and it can affect the way you perform and the way you perform- if you are a clever enough opposition you will know how to use that and it was a perfect example of how to exploit City’s weaknesses. The two league results against City are a real positive for the club, it gives the manager and players the chance to say: ‘You see, we are capable to beat the reigning champions and we can do it’. Yes, United have had some bad games this season but they have proven that they are fully capable of turning up and putting on a strong performance against one of the best teams in the league. Sometimes, patience is a virtue, but when you work and follow your philosophy, in the case of Ole, at some point it will pay off. Looking at both of the games against City in the league, I really enjoyed to 2-0 at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>. Both of them are results that need to be cherished and both of them brought points to the table, but the match at home was proof that the first result wasn’t a fluke, they proved themselves</p>

Ultimately, it is down to you, when you get the chance to show you can play, you have to take it and show what you can do. Also, when you play abroad you always want to go back to your home country. When that happens to be England and <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, you’re going to jump at the chance if the right team comes in for you.

  <p><b>[Berbatov reveals favourite strike partner]</b> The likes of <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> and Keane, we complemented each other, and that’s even if you don’t speak a lot outside the pitch. You respect each other for what you do on the pitch. You see what each other can do and how you help each other get better. In turn, you help the team. Everyone wins. At Leverkusen, I had a great partnership with a guy called França. We scored so many goals. We destroyed <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> 4-1 one season. We both got two goals each. He didn’t speak English or German so outside the pitch we didn’t say a word. Literally nothing. Honestly, nothing. I saw how he trained and played on the pitch and the other way around<br /><br />When we stepped on the pitch, man, it was like we were sleeping together! I was enjoying playing with that guy. Unbelievable. Not selfish. I was in a better position and he would give me the ball. When I gave him the ball, he scored. It was like <a href="andy-cole.html">Andy Cole</a> and <a href="dwight-yorke.html">Dwight Yorke</a>. It was unbelievable how we played together. Playing with him helped me develop. I appreciate that when I play with players better or on my level. You can always learn something.<br /><br />I didn’t expect we would get to the final. In fact, I didn’t even know or appreciate what it was. I was just a young boy sitting on the bench. If you don’t realise the importance of a moment, then you can stop thinking what if I make a mistake? You want to play and enjoy. In that way, I didn’t think at all. The one thing that scared me wasn’t that it was the final of the Champions League, it was facing Raul, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, <a href="luis-figo.html">Luis Figo</a> and <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a>. You sit there as a fanboy<br /><br />This was the first time it happened to me. I came into the game in the 39th minute; you show respect for the players and you are scared to touch them, let alone tackle them. You see him going past you with the ball; you are saying Berba, fucking tackle him. Just tackle him. But you cannot allow yourself to do it because you respect them. I am fucking facing <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. I can’t believe it. We changed nothing for the final, played our way. We were this close to doing something<br /><br /><a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>’s goal was one of the most beautiful ones, the first one from Raul was the ugliest ever. The second was the most beautiful. I was standing directly in the line of <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>’s volley on the halfway line. I was watching and following the attack, Roberto Carlos’ cross and <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> karate kick. You are thinking, no, no. You can’t save that. You expect it to be a goal. I was thinking please no. Someone do something to stop him. You want to see goals like this. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> scores goals on stages like this. That’s why he is Zidane<br /><br />When I was a young boy in Bulgaria, everyone my age was smoking. They said: ‘Berba take a cigarette’. ‘No!’ They said: ‘Are you not a man?’ ‘Are you afraid?’ ‘You are not a man if you don’t smoke.’ I was like: ‘I will show you <b>[I am a man]</b>, don’t worry about it, I will go my own way’. You can’t tell me how to behave. I chose the way I wanted to be. I never smoked or drank like crazy. My father used to be a footballer and from time to time, he told me stories of good players who made nothing of themselves because of bad choices. It stuck in my head. You don’t want to be like that. You will make some bad ones but at least try to learn from mistakes. From CSKA Sofia came interest from Leverkusen. I was playing well and in the national team, I was starting to play. I was not at <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> or <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>’s level, but I was in the national team. I left on my own, just me with my suitcase. I was protected all the time with my national team. When you are on your own, you have a language barrier; German is fucking difficult. New language, new surroundings, different people and everything was new. I learned it in the end, not perfect but I can speak it if I need to. Everything was scary and strange but necessary if I wanted to develop. This is the place where I grew as a man and a footballer</p>

When you hear that other leagues are already setting a date for when they will resume, then you become even more impatient to get back - but public health comes first.<br /><br />For players, sitting at home, trying to stay fit, is difficult because they want to be as sharp as possible when the season restarts. Footballers are in a fortunate position, though, compared to most people. Many players live in large houses with gardens so they can improvise training routines at home, with weights for example, but it’s not the same and it isn’t easy to stay focused</p>

  <p><b>[Berbatov: Scoring the winner for <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> feels fucking unbelievable!]</b> When you’re <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, of course you’re going to put pressure on teams. We were always scoring goals in the last minute. It is in the air. You see that something is coming, you smell that something is coming. And I was so confident that day, I was sure that if I had one more chance, I would score. When Sheasy <b>[<a href="john-o-shea.html">John O’Shea</a>]</b> floated the ball into the area, as a striker you need to look and move for the space in the box. Even though there were many, many players in the box in that situation, if you know where to stand, where there will be space, how to position yourself … sometimes the ball is going to come for you. That was the case in that moment. As a young striker, many people told me that one second in football can be very important. If you jump one second before him, it’s over, you win. Sheasy put the ball in, I timed my jump one second before <b>[Jamie]</b> <a href="jamie-carragher.html">Carragher</a>, it was so easy for me to get the ball, get the header, get the goal. Game over. We win. After that, everything is a blur. You’re running blind. You don’t see anything but colour. Let me tell you, that feeling is fucking unbelievable<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov’s treble was made even sweeter when he found out just how rare the achievement was]</b> One or two days afterwards, I found out that it was the first hat-trick for United against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in something like 65 years. I didn’t know that before. It makes me smile because it makes it even more special. A hat-trick, at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, to win the game. Perfect</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov says <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a> should fight for a permanent <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> contract after loan extension]</b> It is great news, for club and player, that United have extended the loan of <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Odion Ighalo</a>. The way he linked with the other players, his interaction with the team and everything he did was top quality for the time he was given to play. Now, <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Ighalo</a> has a massive challenge ahead of him to prove that it was the right decision from the club. Now that he’s staying until 31 January 2021, why not go out there and show the club why he should stay for even longer? Why not fight for a permanent contract? He’s a great boost for the team and it puts United in a strong position<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov added on the impending resumption of top-flight English football after a three-month hiatus]</b> It’s great news that <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is going to return. It is going to happen behind closed doors, for obvious reasons, and I am curious to see how physically and mentally prepared the teams are. It will be interesting to see how long it will take for games to reach a similar level of quality, speed and intensity to how they were before the stoppage. But overall this is a great step in the right direction.</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov has backed <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> to inspire <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> towards a top-four finish]</b> United have had a huge boost in <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> returning to fitness. It is great news for the team. The dangerous thing is that he hasn’t played for so long, so hopefully he has prepared well and he will be ready to play at 100% again. Is he going to start? I’m not too sure, coming back from a long injury may impact him starting, it will be interesting to see if <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> puts him straight into the battle. I’m sure if the manager asks <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> how he feels and if he is ready, then Paul will say ‘of course I am ready’. It will be the first time we get to see <b>[Bruno]</b> Fernandes and <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> play together and it will be interesting to see if they can hit it off, they will have had the chance to get to know each other in training but that is totally different to a game. It could be a great partnership and I am sure that <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>’s return is a massive boost and will give huge confidence to the whole team. One player doesn’t define a team, but when you have good, quality, confident players putting all their effort in to help the team then you are going to succeed<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is a massive opportunity for United and they know it. Hopefully, they will be prepared for that challenge because three points are nothing, if they win their first game back and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> slip up then the three points aren’t an issue anymore, it can be as easy as that. But on the other hand, if United slip up and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> win it will be six points, so they also have to be careful, there can be no room for error</p>

There have also been reports about United being interested in <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a>, last week <b>[Jadon]</b> <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> was their top target, this week it’s <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a>, next week it will be somebody else. There are so many players associated with a move to United at the moment, it is a good thing I suppose and for the players it boosts their reputation. I can see <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> being a better fit at United than someone else, he is used to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and he is producing great goals and assists. But, he is similar to Fernandes, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and Mata in a way and you don’t want too much similarity in your team. With all these names mentioned it is going to be interesting to see if they actually sign any of them or maybe nobody will go because for me they have enough midfield players. Once they have finished this season, and players are out of contract or leave, then they may need someone. But if all of them stay, and they buy two more, then they will have to let a couple go, or if players aren’t happy then they need to go to the manager and tell them they aren’t happy with all other players in the same position.</p>

  <p><b>[Berbatov unable to pick between <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> as <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> returns]</b> Health comes first and we all understand, but you hope things come back to normal as soon as possible. We see now, slowly but surely, the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> was first, now <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is coming back, I’m excited, especially that first game - <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> vs United. The bad thing is there are no fans, but safety first. <a href="harry-kane.html">Harry Kane</a> is back, Son <b>[Heung-Mn]</b> is back, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> are getting back their firepower, <b>[Paul]</b> <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is back for United which I think is a great, great bonus for the team. People ask me who I support in this game, and I am always ‘you have two kids, who do you love most!<br /><br />I support both teams, the only thing I would like to see is good football, but as you mentioned, as we all know, the break was too big. So I’m curious as to how they handle the first game, especially for United, if they win and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> lose, they’re even points for the Champions League. For <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> it’s a bit difficult because they are seven points behind top four so if they take a win, it’s a great bonus for them. So that first game is so important for both teams. Hopefully we can watch good football<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov officially hung up his boots in 2019 at the age of 38 after distinguished career at both club and international level, but the eccentric ex-forward asserts that he knows exactly how he would have spent lockdown]</b> Kicking a ball against the wall and stopping it. That’s the perfect exercise. You can improvise and improve. Even in tight spaces, if you have a small ball, a tennis ball, try to keep it in the air, to train that reflex, that habit of keeping the ball close to your feet. This kind of improvisation can add to your game - especially if you don’t have the best first touch</p>

Next season will be the decisive one for people who are judging <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>. Sometimes a team has to take a step back to take two steps forward.

  <p>It is tempting to imagine yourself in the white shirt at the Bernabeu, but you need to be really prepared for the reality. <a href="kai-havertz.html">Havertz</a> is still very young, even if he stays at Leverkusen for one more year it will be good for his development physically, technically and mentally. Madrid have a big squad with great players and it would be difficult for him to play every game in my opinion. He is definitely a player for the future but he wants to be playing now, so Leverkusen is the best place for him to develop and grow. He isn’t going to lose anything staying there, he is a starter now and playing regularly in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and people are taking note of him. I know Leverkusen, I know how they develop their players and the nurturing environment there. He won’t lose anything staying there for another year, it will only be beneficial for him</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="fred.html">Fred</a> is already <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s player of the season]</b> At first, <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> had a difficult time at United, getting used to the tempo, with the speed of the games and the challenges. It’s not easy, coming from a different league, and sometimes he spent too much time on the ball and lost possession easily. Slowly but surely, however, his game has changed and he has become used to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. <a href="fred.html">Fred</a>’s improvement reminds me of how <a href="moussa-sissoko.html">Moussa Sissoko</a> started at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a>, people didn’t rate him but now he’s player of the season already and the fans love him. Patience pays off and, like <a href="moussa-sissoko.html">Sissoko</a>, <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> is proving that he has turned it around. He isn’t getting much attention because <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> is still in the spotlight and <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is fit again, but <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> has his place there in midfield and if he is happy to not have the headlines but play regularly, I think he will take that. If you are an attacking player and you know that someone has your back, you are going to go forward freely and not be afraid to lose the ball. When you know you have <a href="fred.html">Fred</a> covering your back and you speak before the game, and have that understanding that your team-mate will be there for you, it makes it much easier as an attacking player to take risks and play those passes that can cause a lot of trouble</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov says <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> has all the attributes to become <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s captain in the future]</b> I think it is a perfect time to extend <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a>’s contract. I think he is developing in the right way, playing regularly and I hope they give him more time. It certainly shows that United have faith in him as a player and the club are making a statement that they are going to depend on him in the future. He’s still young and in his early 20s, so for him to see that the club are trusting him and rewarding him with a contract extension is a great day for him to celebrate. He now needs to put those celebrations aside and prove why the club have given him a extension, he needs to be even better than before, and he needs to put even more effort into his game so that he can show that he can be a regular starter. He definitely deserves a new contract, he has great confidence in the way he moves around the pitch and the way he looks for the ball<br /><br />He is at the stage where he is now comfortable in his position and the way he plays football. In the beginning, he needed some game time to get used to everything but now he is fully integrated into the team at such an early age, which is great because he now has more time to play, enjoy his football and make a name for himself as a player. With his physique and the way he plays football, he looks like a future captain and leader of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to me. Now, the most important thing isn’t to relax because he has a new deal, it is the opposite, he needs to play and work even harder. He is in the right place to develop, he is surrounded by great players and the coach believes in him. How good he turns out to be only depends on him and how ambitious he is to be one of the best</p>
