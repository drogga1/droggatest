The only thing they need is someone to guide them in the right direction. One thing is to play in your country but if you go outside you get out of your comfort zone. Hopefully one day, young Indian players here can go to Europe. If you want to test yourself, you want to play against the best. It is the fourth year for this league now. It is so early, you can only grow from here. It is going to be a long road. As long as you try to do the right thing, everything will be fine.

It’s as simple as that. <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have unbelievable players in their squad and they can absolutely put this right.

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov feels criticism of Manchester United forward Romelu Lukaku is unfair and hopes the Belgian stays at Old Trafford]</b> I think he should stay. I like him, I don’t agree with all the criticism he’s getting - yes he has some areas which he need to work like every other player. But his teammates need to help him as well. For example if I’m a midfield player and I play with him, I will know how to pass him the ball, when to pass him the ball, on which foot to pass him the ball. This is what your teammates need to know, how to play with you<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov believes Lukaku is in the right situation to improve]</b> I think Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is a good coach for him because if Lukaku wants to ask the coach something, he can go and ask him, because Solskajer was a good striker. So if you need striker’s advice, you go to the coach<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov believes United would have the firepower to cope with Lukaku’s departure, telling the Straits Times he backs Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford for big seasons]</b> I am calm because I like Martial a lot. I used to play with him in Monaco a lot and I know that he is really good and that he can be even better. I like Rashford as well; he can develop and become even better</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov says Anthony Martial can become one of the best, best strikers if Manchester United use him correctly]</b> I am slightly biased, but I think Martial can become one of the best, best strikers. It depends on whether he has the attitude, the fighting spirit, but he is so good I think he can become one of the best. He has often played two to three games then out for two to three games. Two to three games on the bench then two to three games back in the team. And then United fans ask, why isn’t he consistent? It depends on him, himself, but Martial has to stay at United. He can be a really great player for them<br /><br />I had some of the best times of my career at Monaco, and not just because of the city. I went there at, I think it was 33, and I went into training and had all these young guys around me. There was Martial but also James Rodriguez, Yannick Carrasco, Fabinho and all those guys. They were running around me and I was like ‘what the f*ck?’. But I had some great moments at Monaco</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov says Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard are considered to have a childish mentality]</b> Some fans just say things because they want to say something and they have the freedom to say bad things that are not always deserved. Young players need to express themselves how they see life. If they are happy, they will translate that on the pitch<br /><br />Players like Lingard and Pogba they see differently to you and I. More childish, more boyish because they are young. As long as they are happy, they will put this feel into the game and it will benefit them, and the team will benefit. You can read a lot of negativity around social media and we are all human beings. It goes <b>[in your head]</b> and you start questioning yourself.

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov claims Harry Kane may have to consider leaving Tottenham in order to fulfil his ambition of landing major silverware]</b> Someone needs to ask Harry Kane about what he will do if Spurs don’t win a trophy this season. Coming from that point of view, and I’ve been in those shoes, the moment comes when you play for a team for a while and you don’t win anything. At the same time you see other colleagues that you are playing with in the national team, and they are winning trophies. You get jealous, in a good way. You’re like ‘I want to be part of that’. You start asking all these questions and at one moment nothing changes, you change the environment, you change the club. It’s a tough decision because fans will be disappointed - and so will the coach.<br /><br />What is that ambition telling him? Stay here and try to win trophies for my club that I’m captain of. Or find a new challenge where you need to test yourself. The question is, if he moves, for example to Manchester United, is he going to be playing with better players and scoring more? I was thinking about that when I moved. Every player who wants to achieve and develop and grow as a player is thinking about that. You’re sitting at home, you’re watching a game, big players, big teams are playing and you think ‘what if I was there, am I going to score more goals?’. It’s normal to think like this. Then you start thinking ‘Well I stay here because I’m in the place that I know, I’m comfortable’. You need to choose - test yourself or stay in the same place? Trust me, it’s a complicated situation</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov insists he understands why Romelu Lukaku left Manchester United]</b> I was sorry to see Lukaku leave but I understand why he wanted a move. He’s been unfairly criticised by the media and fans. We’re all human beings and it’s no fun to finish a match and read on social media or the in the press that you suck. You try your best in training and on the pitch but, in the end, if it isn’t working out, you say: ‘Ok, I’ll try somewhere else’. Lukaku only played two seasons at United. My best season at the club was my third when I won the Golden Boot in the title winning side of 2010-11. Sadly, Lukaku won’t get that chance<br /><br />United need to have a big season in 2019-20. When I was playing, it was a bad season if we didn’t win the title. Even mentioning fourth place for United is an insult. If you’d talked about fourth to me and my team-mates, we would have said: ‘Why the f*ck are you talking about top four? We want to be the top one. But City and Liverpool are so good. I expect City to finish first, followed by Liverpool, again. If Spurs can finish third and win a cup it will be another season of progress for them under <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Mauricio Pochettino</a>. Chelsea and Arsenal will push hard for fourth place but I’m backing United to take it. They cannot afford another season outside of the Champions League places<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov thinks former Leicester City centre-back Harry Maguire will make a difference at the back]</b> A big transfer fee brings pressure. I know that from when I made my move from Tottenham to United. Fans will expect Maguire to transform United’s defence immediately. That’s unfair on the player but Maguire is a great signing. He will bring football intelligence, calm, interceptions, the ability to bring the ball out, feed the midfield and even the attack. An ability to read the game is so important and Maguire is excellent at that</p>

He’s got a great left foot with good vision. The only thing I’d worry about is if he can get used to the English way of playing football. It’s interesting to see what will happen.<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov added on the potentially disruptive influence <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> would have]</b> When you have quality players, it’s a luxury to know that if one gets injured you have a great one who can come in. But that’s not good for the players themselves. They’ll be moaning and not happy, so you have to be careful who you buy<br /><br /><b>[The Bulgarian said of his plans to one day follow the lead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, with coaching badges currently being worked on]</b> To see him <b>[Solskjaer]</b> as manager of United, it’s a good thing. You can see the club is giving opportunities to ex-players from the team. I think about and see this, saying ‘I’m doing my coaching badges now. Maybe one day if I work hard and prove myself, I’ll get the chance to do the same. One day - I need to be ready first. I must get the badges and degree to be prepared. All football player think they can be great managers. But it’s not the case</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov says Manchester United shouldn’t accept a bid of even £200 million for Paul Pogba from Real Madrid following the France international’s starring role in Sunday’s 4-0 win over Chelsea]</b> Zinedine Zidane would love to bring Paul Pogba to Real Madrid but, against Chelsea on Sunday, we saw why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is determined to keep the French midfielder. Pogba’s perfect pass to Marcus Rashford for United’s third goal was what I call ‘pure football’. When I played for United, Michael Carrick would get the ball and his first thought was always to play it forward. He knew exactly where I was and there are plenty of examples of him giving me the ball to score a goal. Special players save their energy for the exact right moment. If United receive a bid from Madrid in the next fortnight in the region of £200m, then the transfer will happen. But I hope Pogba stays at United and I don’t think Zidane will quit Madrid if he fails to sign his compatriot<br /><br /><b>[Any deal for Pogba could be include long-time United target Gareth Bale, whom Zidane has publicly stated has no future with the former European champions]</b> The other big transfer rumour is Gareth Bale to Paris Saint Germain, possibly as Neymar moves the opposite way. I’d be surprised if ex-Barcelona man Neymar went to Madrid. But Bale would do well at PSG. He’s a player I admire, so I want to see him play as much as possible. PSG are one of the few clubs who could pay Bale’s wages, although I’d love to see him back in the Premier League</p>

They must say to themselves ‘ok, we need to be f</em>cking better’.<br /><br /><b>[United were able to raise their game for a season opener against Chelsea, with a clinical display seeing them run out 4-0 winners over the Blues]</b> United were better than I expected them to be against Chelsea and I think many United fans were surprised by the quality of the performance. Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka were unbelievably commanding in defence while Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial showed a strong understanding up front. They are two intelligent young forwards and as long as they communicate they can be deadly together. Rashford’s finishing was exquisite while Martial scored a typical number nine’s goal that showed he’s got what it takes to wear my old shirt</b></p>

It could be a particularly difficult one for <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> who joined them from <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> in August.

It’s very difficult to spend two seasons somewhere - as Maguire did at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and I did at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> - showing what you can do then get a big move and have to play against your old teammates with whom you’re probably still in touch. As hard as you try to be professional, friendships can sometimes get in the way<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov added on the ongoing inconsistency of <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s side]</b> United’s performance against Southampton last time out <b>[in a 1-1 draw]</b> was not what I want to see from United. They need a win but that can make for a tense atmosphere and prevent you playing good football. It will be interesting to see which United players go looking for the ball on Saturday. I really hope they start as if they’re desperate to win. An early goal would ease the tension but Maguire and his teammates will need to keep it tight at the back, as they failed to hold on to the lead at Southampton<br /><br />When people ask me if United will try to win the Europa League, I think, why wouldn’t they? United need to win a trophy this season. The club’s high standards demands that they go all out to win every competition they enter so I expect them to try to win the Europa League. It would be a great achievement and an invaluable experience for <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> and his young players. It might also be United’s best hope of qualifying for next season’s Champions League and, while playing on Thursday can have a consequences for a team’s <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> form, they should use all their power to try to win this competition</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have lost their fear factor]</b> At the moment teams aren’t scared of United. Can you blame them? Teams are seeing the results that United are getting and where they have been finishing in the last couple of years and they believe they have a chance to get the win and the three points against them. On Wednesday evening, I watched Rochdale play it out from the back at Old Trafford, showing how they didn’t care that they were playing against United, they were so confident even though they made a couple of mistakes it didn’t matter. United need to get back to when teams used to come to Old Trafford and sh*t themselves in the tunnel and hopefully they can put that fear back into the teams soon<br /><br /><b>[Questions are being asked of his suitability to a demanding role]</b> The pressure on <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> is there and the truth is it’s a difficult situation. When you lose matches people want you out and when you win nobody says anything. For me United still need to give <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> time, it’s not possible for the coach to go every time there are a few bad results, the next one will come in and it will be the same, it’s a vicious circle and you cannot escape that. So, they need to give him more time, the games and the standards haven’t been there recently but I’m sure they are working hard on the training pitch.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that he can turn things around. I love him as a human, a football player and I want him to succeed as a coach. He is at the club where he is a legend, the club have given him a chance and he has great staff and people around him. It is a matter of time, let’s not forget <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> won the league in his sixth season so it’s a long process and it’s not as easy as people think. You don’t just go on the training ground and give the balls out and do exercise. There is a lot that a manager has to deal with. To get rid of him now would be a mistake. Of course, the coach depends on the results of the team, so he is actually depending on his players and he needs the results, everybody knows that. This is <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and they need to win, it doesn’t matter which competition. It would be a mistake if they try to replace him now but at the same time the manager depends on the results of the team. So from now until the end of next month, if <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> continue to lose and draw, it is going to be difficult to advocate and say they are working positively to turn things around. In that situation, what do you do?</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are in danger of following in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s footsteps]</b> It is frustrating and difficult for me to admit that United are so far behind <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. When it comes to playing the game, you can see how confident and calm on the ball they both are, they know how to play and sometimes United don’t have that and they suffer because of that. I hope that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> don’t end up like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and wait at least 29 years for the title. Six years is a long time to wait to win a title for a team like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. When you get into that spiral you are going to start slowly losing your DNA, look at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and all those years, you don’t want that. Sure, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are playing better now, but it has taken them so long to get to this point now where they are playing great football. United need to find that winning formula as soon as possible<br /><br />It is good to see that they are giving chances to young players, <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a> was excellent against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, you can see that he is starting to command the midfield and he scored a great goal, an exquisite finish, I could never score a goal like that. It was unbelievable. At the same time, you can see that some of the players are still young and naive in some situations. In that case, they need the experienced players with them. From the bench or on the training ground they can teach them valuable lessons and teach them how to deal with different situations in games. To put so much pressure on the young players all at once is not so good and that’s why they need some of the senior members of the squad to step up and help them get back to winning</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov proclaims He was an artist on the pitch]</b> I was an artist on the pitch. I didn’t realise it in the beginning but it was really important for me to do something different. If you watch me, you won’t fall asleep or switch the channel. It might be a small movement, detail, how I control the ball or flick the ball. I wanted people to say ‘wow, I want to try that’. Then you see it isn’t as easy as it looks. This is what I wanted to do. It didn’t affect my game because this is who I am. I have my way of seeing football, not everyone can see it in the same way.<br /><br />Everyone is different. It helped me get to one of the biggest clubs in the world. Of course, you can’t play with 11 artists on the pitch. It is not going to happen, you need…not 11 of me. You need aggression. That player is a bully with a tooth missing, grass and blood on their shirt. You ask someone like Vida (Nemanja Vidic), ‘are you okay?’ He goes ‘I am f<em>cking great’. You appreciate what he is doing for you. He gets the ball, gives it to you. You can then do the magic<br /><br />I had <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> and <a href="robbie-keane.html">Robbie Keane</a>. Even if you don’t speak a lot outside the pitch, you respect each other for what you do on the pitch. You see what each other can do and how you help each other get better. In turn, you help the team. Everyone wins. At Leverkusen, I had a great partnership with a guy called Franca. We scored so many goals. We destroyed <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> in a season. 4-1. We both got two goals each. He didn’t speak English or German so outside the pitch we didn’t say a word. Literally nothing. Honestly, nothing. I saw how he trained and played on the pitch and the other way around. When we stepped on the pitch, man, it was like we were sleeping together. I was enjoying playing with that guy. Unbelievable<br /><br /><b>[For the more introverted Berbatov, though, drawing and reading were his primary activities of choice, and something he still enjoys today]</b> I always tried to grow out of that. I was a very shy boy. I didn’t speak to many people and I tried to keep my world private. I am still to this day the same in some areas of my life but now I am more open to conversations and socialising with people. I think it is something I should have done more often when I was playing<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov feels those watching him were often not able to analyse his contribution fairly]</b> It is probably because I didn’t play like <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> or <a href="carlos-tevez.html">Tevez</a>. I didn’t like that because I can show you six or seven current world-class players who run less than me back then. When you label something like that, it sticks. Even if it isn’t true. People can go f</em>ck themselves. People don’t understand and try to look smart. I would check my stats after every game and I was running 10-11km every game. It doesn’t make any difference for me. I was more bothered how I move and make space. How to get an assist or pass to keep the ball. It wasn’t all about goals. I know when I was bad or good. I was realistic and knew where I stood in the football world. I always wanted to develop.<br /><br /><b>[He is set to get his <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> A Licence and he is beginning to consider a coaching career]</b> I had four scenes in the movie and I enjoyed it because it was something new. I will probably not do it again, now I have done it, I know what it is.<br /><br />My ambitions are what I know and do which is football. Maybe in the future I will try being a manager or sports director. I have my degree in sports management and I am doing my coaching badges at the moment. I studied in Sofia and I am doing my badges there. I am going to get my A Licence and then I only need my Pro Licence and I am ready to go. You never know, I need to prepare. I try to write about training schedules and things like this. You need to stay true to yourself. Integrate your philosophy and know who you are.<br /><br />At the moment, I am studying. I have people around me who are doing the same. I have a plan in my head how I would do it and how I like to do it. You need to be in the right place at the right time, just look at <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> and <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>.

I hope our government in Bulgaria does their job and bans them for life, they don’t deserve to be there and they have brought shame on all of us. Because of them, we are only talking about the incidents of racism and not about the football, which has become secondary and it should not be like that. I am very ashamed of how these people can do this.<br /><br />It is also a problem in England, Italy and all around the world, these people should be banned for life. We need to stay together and fight against it because this is unacceptable. I cannot accept the criticism that the whole of Bulgaria has received, 50 people cannot define a nation, we are not racists. I am a proud Bulgarian and I know that we are dealing with this straight away, and there will be severe justice.

Sometimes if the game wasn’t going our way, it wasn’t going as expected you couldn’t forget what was said in the dressing room how ambitious and motivated we all were so you would try to carry that onto the pitch for the whole 90 minutes.<br /><br />I would also prepare in my own way and I would tell myself ‘Berba you go out there and give it everything you f</em>cking can’. This was my own motivation, I didn’t need anyone to motivate me, I would do it in my own way. But when you are out on the pitch and see <a href="gary-neville.html">Gary Neville</a> running his f<em>cking b</em>llocks off on the right side, Scholsey controlling the midfield and <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> running like crazy, it is extra motivation, you say to yourself ‘you better f<em>cking be like them or even better or you’re in trouble<br /><br /><b>[Berbatov feels <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s arrival at Old Trafford represents a great opportunity for United to banish the demons of a shock 1-0 defeat at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> before the international break]</b> Based on the form of both teams, where <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and United are in the table and the way they are playing football at the moment, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are obviously ahead. United will need to be prepared for a very difficult game and the sad part is that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are overwhelming favourites. I try to stay optimistic but it is going to be very difficult for United to get a result if they play the way they did against <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. That was probably the sh</em>ttest game I have seen them play, honestly, it was painful.<br /><br />It is still early in the season and maybe there is still time to turn things around, to catch up to the top four, there is still time in my opinion but they need to correct the way they are playing football, the way they move into the spaces, how the players are looking for the ball, their speed of the ball when they are passing - these are the things they need to work on.<br /><br />United now have an opportunity to challenge themselves but it is going to be difficult because they have had players on international duty that are only just coming back and they will only have a couple of days to prepare, train and play together. If you look at the tempo and the way United are playing, as a United player you feel sh*t and you look at the games that you play and you don’t feel well, but now they need to challenge themselves and this big test is a great way for them to do just that</p>

It makes me feel like sh*t, it’s not good and I don’t think anybody wants to look at the table. I don’t think anybody connected with the club will want to check the table at the moment, when you see a team with the calibre of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, one of the biggest clubs in the world, and you see where they are in the table it is crazy to think how times have changed.<br /><br />The players will know what position they are but I don’t advise them to look at it because it isn’t going to make them feel good. On the other hand, you could say ‘come on boys, look at where we are - do we deserve to be here?’. Maybe with some of the performances they have produced they deserve to be there and especially if they continue like that, but if they play the way they did like against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, with aggression and getting in the oppositions’ faces, then things will improve. I’ve said it before, but it’s not too late to turn things around.

When you have been out for so long, things are tough. When you are injured you watch your mates train and you are with the physios, you see them putting their boots on, heading out on to the pitch and this can make you sad and depressed.<br /><br />You get all these feeling rush to your head and you want to get back as soon as possible and this can lead to mistakes, you could go out there and you’re not quite ready and you could get injured again. So, it’s really important to time right the moment you come back. In the case of Martial, to get going again and get a goal will give him even more confidence, especially for a striker. But like any other player, the most important thing now is to stay fit, know when to push hard and slowdown in training because when you have so many games you need to know when to save your energy.

I hope that he continues to work on that last crucial step before you shoot. That is what makes a great striker, that last decision when you are facing down the goalkeeper you need to know where to put the ball, how much power or finesse is required and this is a small aspect of the game that is so important.<br /><br />He is still so young and no doubt he will be on the radar of a few other clubs, but I see him as a typical born and bred <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player, someone who can carry the torch for academy players coming through at United, to show that it can be done. He is the prime example and he can still go further, maybe one day he can be the captain. I can see him staying at United for a very long time and it honestly wouldn’t surprise me if he is a one-club man. I always wanted to be like that but it was never possible for me</p>

  <p><b>[Berbatov’s advice for <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> as he says he feels like ‘sh<em>t’ after Manchester derby]&lt;/b&gt; It was another great goal from <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> <b>[against City]</b> and a really fast counter attack. United have some very quick players and they didn’t take advantage of that. The only trouble sometimes is that the quick players want the ball at their feet and they are not using the space in front of them, but when they try to use the space and make a run the midfield players are not seeing them and not giving them the ball.<br /><br />If I am as quick as <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> and make three runs and nobody sees me or gives me the ball, on the fourth one I wouldn’t waste my energy, it’s all psychological. When I was playing, Sir Alex would say ‘Give Berba the ball, and when you give it to him, don’t stay, run, because he’s going to find you’. You need to know your team-mates, who is going to pass you the ball and who is going to make the run, these kinds of things are small details, but they are the most important.<br /><br /><a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> needs to be strong with his team-mates, if he needs to have an argument on the pitch or shout ‘f</em>cking give me the ball,’ do it, it doesn’t matter, you need to show character and have that will to win. Argue or fight, it doesn’t matter if everything is for the purpose of winning the game, you f<em>cking do it<br /><br />Honestly, after that first leg against City I feel like sh</em>t. The first half was way below standards, it was not good to watch, the team was all over the place and City were the better side for sure - everybody saw that. In the second half there was a bit of an improvement on all fronts, but it was not enough and when City score three goals against you to change the game is next to impossible, as we saw.<br /><br />The only thing good about it is that there is another game and hopefully they have time to take something from it and show a better account of themselves. I have seen a lot of people saying that the first half was the worst they’ve ever seen United play, I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but it wasn’t good. Honestly, City should have scored not three but five goals.<br /><br /><b>[Raheem]</b> Sterling not being in his best moment to finish a couple of chances in front of goal was a good thing for United. I think the outcome was more down to how poor United were in the first half and not necessarily how good City were. Hopefully, they will recover for the next leg, the real problem is that we are seeing too many of this kind of performances, of course it’s not every game but we are seeing it more than we want to, even if it’s just a poor spell in a match, the fans don’t want to see it</b></p>

Sometimes when you decline so much you lose games, the pressure builds, and you go on the pitch and you just don’t want the ball, and that is the worst thing a player can do.<br /><br />I think Ole is still the man to stop the decline, but they need to do business in the transfer market and buy some players now. The question is who do they go out and get and do the players even want to come to Old Trafford. The sad part is, United will now have to work hard to convince players to come. In the past, you only had to say the name ‘Manchester United’ and you were there asking where do you sign.<br /><br />If you asked a group of players now, out of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and other big teams where would they like to go, United would probably be the last place they’d want to go, which is really depressing, and it shows just how much they have declined.

They need players like that<br /><br /><a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> performed well on his debut against <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>. He will need a few games to get used to the rhythm of the team but the Portuguese midfielder showed that he’s an intelligent player, with an eye for a killer pass and powerful shot. As he grows into his role, I can see Fernandes controlling games. But there were a couple of incidents that suggested he needs to work on the physical side of his game. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is the most physical league, much tougher than the Portuguese league and faster too. The signs are good for Fernandes and I am looking forward to United’s next match, following the winter break, to see how he slots into United’s system and if he can add creativity</p>

Teams want to invest in talented young players, but if teams go out to sign him at any cost, then he is going to have a big expectation on him, and he needs to play regularly to develop.<br /><br />He may decide to stay abroad and go to a different club like <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> or <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. There will be many clubs after him and it is down to him where he goes. As a player it is a very flattering situation when many teams are after your signature. It boosts your ego and it tells you that you are doing something right. It makes you feel good but you do have choices to make which can be a bit overwhelming, you have to make a number of decisions and calculate where you will feel good, where you won’t feel good and, of course, there are a number of financial decisions to make which is important.</p>

The two league results against City are a real positive for the club, it gives the manager and players the chance to say: ‘You see, we are capable to beat the reigning champions and we can do it’. Yes, United have had some bad games this season but they have proven that they are fully capable of turning up and putting on a strong performance against one of the best teams in the league. Sometimes, patience is a virtue, but when you work and follow your philosophy, in the case of Ole, at some point it will pay off. Looking at both of the games against City in the league, I really enjoyed to 2-0 at Old Trafford. Both of them are results that need to be cherished and both of them brought points to the table, but the match at home was proof that the first result wasn’t a fluke, they proved themselves</p>

Unbelievable. Not selfish. I was in a better position and he would give me the ball. When I gave him the ball, he scored. It was like <a href="andy-cole.html">Andy Cole</a> and <a href="dwight-yorke.html">Dwight Yorke</a>. It was unbelievable how we played together. Playing with him helped me develop. I appreciate that when I play with players better or on my level. You can always learn something.<br /><br />I didn’t expect we would get to the final. In fact, I didn’t even know or appreciate what it was. I was just a young boy sitting on the bench. If you don’t realise the importance of a moment, then you can stop thinking what if I make a mistake? You want to play and enjoy. In that way, I didn’t think at all. The one thing that scared me wasn’t that it was the final of the Champions League, it was facing Raul, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>, <a href="luis-figo.html">Luis Figo</a> and <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a>. You sit there as a fanboy<br /><br />This was the first time it happened to me. I came into the game in the 39th minute; you show respect for the players and you are scared to touch them, let alone tackle them. You see him going past you with the ball; you are saying Berba, f<em>cking tackle him. Just tackle him. But you cannot allow yourself to do it because you respect them. I am f</em>cking facing <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>. I can’t believe it. We changed nothing for the final, played our way. We were this close to doing something<br /><br /><a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>’s goal was one of the most beautiful ones, the first one from Raul was the ugliest ever. The second was the most beautiful. I was standing directly in the line of <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a>’s volley on the halfway line. I was watching and following the attack, Roberto Carlos’ cross and <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> karate kick. You are thinking, no, no. You can’t save that. You expect it to be a goal. I was thinking please no. Someone do something to stop him. You want to see goals like this. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> scores goals on stages like this. That’s why he is Zidane<br /><br />When I was a young boy in Bulgaria, everyone my age was smoking. They said: ‘Berba take a cigarette’. ‘No!’ They said: ‘Are you not a man?’ ‘Are you afraid?’ ‘You are not a man if you don’t smoke.’ I was like: ‘I will show you <b>[I am a man]</b>, don’t worry about it, I will go my own way’. You can’t tell me how to behave. I chose the way I wanted to be. I never smoked or drank like crazy. My father used to be a footballer and from time to time, he told me stories of good players who made nothing of themselves because of bad choices. It stuck in my head. You don’t want to be like that. You will make some bad ones but at least try to learn from mistakes. From CSKA Sofia came interest from Leverkusen. I was playing well and in the national team, I was starting to play. I was not at <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> or <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>’s level, but I was in the national team. I left on my own, just me with my suitcase. I was protected all the time with my national team. When you are on your own, you have a language barrier; German is f*cking difficult. New language, new surroundings, different people and everything was new. I learned it in the end, not perfect but I can speak it if I need to. Everything was scary and strange but necessary if I wanted to develop. This is the place where I grew as a man and a footballer</p>

Footballers and managers are in an influential position in society and they need to set an example to their fans in this very difficult situation.<br /><br />I can’t say I was particularly surprised by <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a>’s behaviour. He has always operated outside the box and that’s one of the reasons he’s been successful and fans love him. But this is different. Hopefully, although it was a mistake to hold this session on the common, <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> and his players were still keeping a safe distance from each other.<br /><br />I can see why <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> would be desperate to get back to work. Everyone in football wants the game to return as soon as possible. When you hear that other leagues are already setting a date for when they will resume, then you become even more impatient to get back - but public health comes first.<br /><br />For players, sitting at home, trying to stay fit, is difficult because they want to be as sharp as possible when the season restarts. Footballers are in a fortunate position, though, compared to most people. Many players live in large houses with gardens so they can improvise training routines at home, with weights for example, but it’s not the same and it isn’t easy to stay focused</p>

I don’t know if now is the right time for him to go to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, I have mentioned it before, I have my doubts here because at United there’s <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a>, <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> and Daniel James<br /><br />It’s good to have competition for the team but I would imagine if he moves to a new place he would want to play every game, but rotation is a common thing now in football. From that point of view, you can’t guarantee a player will play, but I think we need to go with that assumption, big money and he would like to play. For me, he is going to choose the team that he knows he is going to play. Not to move and do nothing because that is going to stop his development. That’s why I think it may be better for him to stay at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> for one more year, why not?</p>

Other people will see him linked with a move to United and they will point out his connections with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and how he would never be forgiven if he switched to Old Trafford, but honestly, United don’t need him right now. <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> is a very similar player; he really hit the ground running and looks to be a very promising signing so I don’t think there would be any point in United signing him. <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is coming back, Fernandes is there, <b>[Scott]</b> <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a> is producing great football as well, they have enough quality there so signing <a href="philippe-coutinho.html">Coutinho</a> would be pointless</p>

  <p><b>[Dimitar Berbatov has backed <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> to inspire <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> towards a top-four finish]</b> United have had a huge boost in <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> returning to fitness. It is great news for the team. The dangerous thing is that he hasn’t played for so long, so hopefully he has prepared well and he will be ready to play at 100% again. Is he going to start? I’m not too sure, coming back from a long injury may impact him starting, it will be interesting to see if <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> puts him straight into the battle. I’m sure if the manager asks <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> how he feels and if he is ready, then Paul will say ‘of course I am ready’. It will be the first time we get to see <b>[Bruno]</b> Fernandes and <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> play together and it will be interesting to see if they can hit it off, they will have had the chance to get to know each other in training but that is totally different to a game. It could be a great partnership and I am sure that <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>’s return is a massive boost and will give huge confidence to the whole team. One player doesn’t define a team, but when you have good, quality, confident players putting all their effort in to help the team then you are going to succeed<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is a massive opportunity for United and they know it. Hopefully, they will be prepared for that challenge because three points are nothing, if they win their first game back and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> slip up then the three points aren’t an issue anymore, it can be as easy as that. But on the other hand, if United slip up and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> win it will be six points, so they also have to be careful, there can be no room for error</p>

  <p><b>[Man Utd warned off <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> &amp; Saul moves as Berbatov backs <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> &amp; Co to shine for Solskjaer]</b> <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> have been linked with <a href="saul-niguez.html">Saul Niguez</a> from <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> again, and for me looking at the situation, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is back, Fernandes is there, they have <b>[Scott]</b> <a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a> who needs to play regularly because he’s young and is doing so well, <b>[Juan]</b> Mata is there, <b>[Nemanja]</b> <a href="nemanja-matic.html">Matic</a> is there who is great at what he does, and to put one more in the mix is only okay if you are going to use them and have them playing regularly because that transfer will probably cost a lot of money.<br /><br />In my opinion, I think they have enough quality in the team anyway, especially with <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> coming back, but maybe <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> has a different decision and he has decided that they need someone to strengthen there. There have also been reports about United being interested in <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a>, last week <b>[Jadon]</b> <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> was their top target, this week it’s <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a>, next week it will be somebody else. There are so many players associated with a move to United at the moment, it is a good thing I suppose and for the players it boosts their reputation. I can see <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> being a better fit at United than someone else, he is used to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and he is producing great goals and assists. But, he is similar to Fernandes, <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and Mata in a way and you don’t want too much similarity in your team. With all these names mentioned it is going to be interesting to see if they actually sign any of them or maybe nobody will go because for me they have enough midfield players. Once they have finished this season, and players are out of contract or leave, then they may need someone. But if all of them stay, and they buy two more, then they will have to let a couple go, or if players aren’t happy then they need to go to the manager and tell them they aren’t happy with all other players in the same position.</p>

We see now, slowly but surely, the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> was first, now <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> is coming back, I’m excited, especially that first game - <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> vs United.

People ask me who I support in this game, and I am always ‘you have two kids, who do you love most!<br /><br />I support both teams, the only thing I would like to see is good football, but as you mentioned, as we all know, the break was too big.

For <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> it’s a bit difficult because they are seven points behind top four so if they take a win, it’s a great bonus for them.

That’s the perfect exercise. You can improvise and improve. Even in tight spaces, if you have a small ball, a tennis ball, try to keep it in the air, to train that reflex, that habit of keeping the ball close to your feet. This kind of improvisation can add to your game - especially if you don’t have the best first touch</p>

I think he is developing in the right way, playing regularly and I hope they give him more time. It certainly shows that United have faith in him as a player and the club are making a statement that they are going to depend on him in the future. He’s still young and in his early 20s, so for him to see that the club are trusting him and rewarding him with a contract extension is a great day for him to celebrate. He now needs to put those celebrations aside and prove why the club have given him a extension, he needs to be even better than before, and he needs to put even more effort into his game so that he can show that he can be a regular starter. He definitely deserves a new contract, he has great confidence in the way he moves around the pitch and the way he looks for the ball<br /><br />He is at the stage where he is now comfortable in his position and the way he plays football. In the beginning, he needed some game time to get used to everything but now he is fully integrated into the team at such an early age, which is great because he now has more time to play, enjoy his football and make a name for himself as a player. With his physique and the way he plays football, he looks like a future captain and leader of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to me. Now, the most important thing isn’t to relax because he has a new deal, it is the opposite, he needs to play and work even harder. He is in the right place to develop, he is surrounded by great players and the coach believes in him. How good he turns out to be only depends on him and how ambitious he is to be one of the best</p>
