  <p><b>[Alessio Tacchinardi on Paul Pogba]</b> <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is a pure diamond. He has grown up to become a devastating player. Ever since his first <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> game, I thought he was an extraordinary player. He has the ability to make the very complex appear so simple, dissolving tricky situations. Before watching <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, I had only seen four players play like that: <a href="juan-roman-riquelme.html">Juan Roman Riquelme</a> at <a href="villarreal-fc.html">Villarreal</a>, <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> and <a href="alessandro-del-piero.html">Alessandro Del Piero</a> at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, and <a href="francesco-totti.html">Francesco Totti</a> for Italy.

  <p><b>[Alessio Tacchinardi says <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> was like a second father at Juventus]</b> For me, <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> is a great coach, a wonderful man and a second father. I don’t think you can say he was a failure at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. In fact, I completely reject such a definition. I still remember how well he handled the group, his great game plans and his handling of <a href="alessandro-del-piero.html">Alessandro Del Piero</a> after his horrible knee injury. Many critics wanted him to bench Alex, but Carlo continued to pick him and aided his recovery superbly<br /><br /><b>[But Tacchinardi suggests that is just proof that the chips did not fall for the former <a href="parma-fc.html">Parma</a> and <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> boss]</b> His two years were not blessed with luck, that’s for sure. There was that storm in Perugia, and then a one-off performance by <a href="hidetoshi-nakata.html">Hidetoshi Nakata</a> for Roma at the Stadio delle Alpi. Even the fans took to him despite there having been a few banners and things against him early on<br /><br />I think he’s the best coach in Europe. He’s made a wonderful career in terms of his technical and tactical qualities, but also his human qualities. There are very few people with his intelligence and understanding. He manages the squad well, understands his players and stimulates them without creating fractures in the dressing room. He is one of those coaches who knows exactly how to combine characteristics to create a harmonious and successful environment</p>

  <p><b>[Tacchinardi says I’d pay to see <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a> win the Champions League]</b> Two sides are arriving in Cardiff that have both had a great season. Real has grown a lot in the last few months. They won <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, they knocked out big teams, running well thanks to the many world-class players that they have in their squad. We already know everything about Juventus: they are probably the most complete and organised team in all of Europe.<br /><br />I’m expecting a performance made up of intensity, a fast pace, great head-to-heads and a result decided by a moment of magic from a world-class player. But this <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> deserve to lift the trophy again. I would pay to see Gigi <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Buffon</a> win the Champions League! They all deserve it, though: the players, the coach, the club and the fans who have been waiting for a new triumph for so many years<br /><br /><b>[They have lost four finals in the interim and the 1-0 defeat to Real in 1998 still stings for Tacchinardi, as he maintains that <a href="predrag-mijatovic.html">Predrag Mijatovic</a>’s winner should not have stood]</b> That was a classic final in the most negative sense of the word. A closed match, ugly and blocked, with little action or flair, decided by that offside goal by <a href="predrag-mijatovic.html">Mijatovic</a>. And that goal was offside despite what he still says!<br /><br />In that game, we played calmly up until 30 metres from their goal but then, we did not have the ingenuity, the creativity or the final ball to unlock their defence. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zinedine Zidane</a> and <a href="alessandro-del-piero.html">Alex Del Piero</a> were like soaked powder kegs but it must be said that Alex had a muscular problem that had not yet been resolved and he didn’t enjoy the benefit of a perfect physical condition. Still, Saturday’s game will be different; I hope also in terms of the result!<br /><br />I’d like so much to go out onto the field with this <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. Among other things, I think my characteristics would adapt well to <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a>’s style of play. The attacking and midfield phases are so important for both teams.<br /><br />On the one hand, I see <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and <a href="toni-kroos.html">Toni Kroos</a> as decisive but, on the other, I trust in <a href="gonzalo-higuain.html">Gonzalo Higuain</a> and <a href="miralem-pjanic.html">Miralem Pjanic</a>. Real have one defect: they bring so many men over the halfway line and, at certain times, they can be caught out.<br /><br />However, it’s a deadly team in so many ways and <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> has shown himself to be a great coach, very clever, and he’s also very knowledgeable on Italian football. The <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> will have to be careful and always concentrated but they have an enviable defence that has no rival in Europe, and that’s without talking about their midfield and attack! It’s certainly going to be a balanced game, one played on the edge of a razor blade. But, after all the reflections and analysis, I will say yes, this is the year for <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> to bring the cup back to Turin!</p>

  <p><b>[Tacchinardi says Passionate <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> targeted like a pigeon at Chelsea]</b> Honestly, I hope he leaves <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because this season he has been a target like a pigeon. Right since the first game they have started a media massacre against him. Last year they let him work, but this time right from the start they put him against his own chairman for the transfers. They have been heavy on a manager who took a side that ranked seventh and let them win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Tacchinardi suggests <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>’s mental health could be affected if he cannot resolve his dispute with Chelsea]</b> Antonio, to me, is one of the top three in the world but he needs to be super motivated. He needs to go happy and serene to the training ground and not bothered by all these things because he is passionate. If you are passionate about your marriage and your wife is happy, it is all great, if you are passionate and your wife isn’t happy, you sink into depression</p>

  <p><b>[ex-team-mate Tacchinardi says Phenomenon <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> a better coach than player]</b> I say <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> is better as a manager <b>[than a player]</b> because as a player, Mother Nature helped him. He didn’t need any tips, he entered the pitch and played like when he was a kid. <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> was, and is, football on the pitch. As a manager he became a strong man. He was withdrawn and shy, but if such a group <b>[of players]</b> follow you like this, it means you have improved your character. Tactically he is good. He always finds the right move. He is stronger as a manager. He was a purebred as a player, but as a manager he inherited a catastrophic situation and won every cup. He is a phenomenon. But I admit that I would never ever thought he could become a phenomenon as a manager. If anyone who played with him swears he thought <a href="zinedine-zidane.html">Zidane</a> could become what he is now, this guy is a fool</p>

  <p><b>[Tacchinardi says Roma must park the bus against Barca]</b> Roma stand no chance. This season’s <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is possibly one of the best of the last 20 years. Even their bench is deep. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is reaching amazing levels again and even to stop only him is not easy. Roma would need two perfect games.

The Uruguayan is made of strong stuff, he has charisma, is always in the right place at the right time, keeps it simple and knows when to pass or pummel. He’s not <a href="andrea-pirlo.html">Andrea Pirlo</a>, but then I don’t think <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a> would want a player like that in front of the defence<br /><br />I’d rather get <a href="sandro-tonali.html">Sandro Tonali</a>, who is a rough diamond that <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> can really polish by playing him straight away. Gaetano Castrovilli <b>[of Fiorentina]</b> reminds me of Claudio Marchisio</p>
