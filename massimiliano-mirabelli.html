  <p><b>[Milan sporting director Massimiliano Mirabelli has insisted that striker Andre Silva will not be departing the club]</b> I know that Andre Silva is going through a difficult time, but he is a very important player for us. We have a special affection for him, he has a lot of talent and we want him to stay with us. Of course he’s going to be <b>[with us]</b> in January and I’m sure he’ll be with us for many, many years.</p>

  <p><b>[AC Milan are still interested in buying Andrea Belotti from Torino after recent attempts to land the striker proved unsuccessful]</b> He is well known. We tried to take him to Milan, but it was quite difficult for several reasons. Still, he is a strong player and a Milan fan, so who knows, maybe one day he can wear the shirt he dreamed of as a child.</p>

  <p><b>[AC Milan have confirmed that Napoli goalkeeper Pepe Reina is a summer target]</b> We did inform Napoli that we want to speak to Pepe Reina’s agent, because we want to see if there’s a possibility of bringing the player to Milan.<br /><br />We are always looking to the future. You all know that if I am here, then Gattuso will remain at Milan. He may well remain even without me!</p>

  <p><b>[AC Milan intend to keep Gianluigi Donnarumma for the foreseeable future]</b> Apart from his mistake, he played a great game tonight. We want him to stay with us for a long time. He’s a gem of ours and the whole of Italy, and we’re keeping a tight grip on him</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-AC Milan sporting director Massimiliano Mirabelli would like to see <a href="franck-kessie.html">Franck Kessie</a> leave the <a href="ac-milan.html">Rossoneri</a> and join rivals <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>]</b> <a href="franck-kessie.html">Kessie</a> is one of the most important midfielders in Italy. He’s young, he is physically strong and he is extraordinary, but every player must be managed and treated differently. He is suffering at Milan and I wish that <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> would sign him, it would be the coup of the century. <b>[<a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> sporting director]</b> <a href="cristiano-giuntoli.html">Cristiano Giuntoli</a> is a footballing connoisseur and anyone who signs <a href="franck-kessie.html">Kessie</a> is getting a great deal. He will do great things because he lacks nothing<br /><br /><b>[Asked for his assessment of <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>’s trip to <a href="ac-milan.html">San Siro</a> at the weekend]</b> <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> versus Milan always has a special charm. Both teams are trying to make sense of this season. <b>[Aurelio]</b> <a href="aurelio-de-laurentiis.html">De Laurentiis</a> has done a great job in Naples and maybe the Neapolitans don’t appreciate him, but from the outside you can see it’s great management<br /><br /><b>[Out of work since the collapse of Li Yonghong’s ill-fated Milan regime]</b> I hope to find an important project. I am careful not to make any claims, however, and I hope luck helps me</p>
