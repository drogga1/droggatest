  <p><b>[AC Milan sporting director Massimiliano Mirabelli insists goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma is happy at San Siro]</b> We have had talks over the past week with his agents, which is normal. We also had talks with Gigio and we asked him if he wanted to stay at Milan. He responded in an affirmative matter that he is happy here and he wants to keep playing for Milan. It is now up to us to find an agreement with his agents.</p>

  <p><b>[Milan would be prepared to discuss a possible swap deal involving Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianluigi Donnarumma]</b> If Cristiano Ronaldo wants to leave Real Madrid and they want Donnarumma, then we’re ready to talk to President Florentino Perez. I would’ve been stunned if Marotta had said anything else. Marotta is very talented on the market, so if he is interested in a goalkeeper, we are here. For the moment, nothing will happen. The input we got from the owners is not to accept offers. He is priceless and we will not sell him. For now.<br /><br />We wanted to make him a symbol of Milan for our fans and Gigio had everything required to fill that role. He would’ve had the captain’s armband and, frankly, it was an enormous offer, considering his young age and Milan’s situation: €25m net over five years means €50m gross for the club. On a human level, we were upset, especially as there was no chance for negotiation. It’s not true that on Thursday there was tension with Raiola and we argued with him. We both simply took stock of the situation and went our separate ways. We are upset, naturally, just as our fans are. And I say that with the utmost respect for Gigio and Raiola: everyone is free to make whatever decision they deem right. Now we are looking for a goalkeeper worthy of Milan. Whoever plays for Milan must realise what this jersey means</p>

  <p><b>[On AC Milan’s player]</b> Although we have to compete in three competitions this season, we can’t have 35 players. We have to get rid of a few. It won’t be a big number but not too small either.</p>

  <p><b>[Massimiliano Mirabelli says Alvaro Morata has expressed an interest in joining AC Milan]</b> We’re sorry if Torino are annoyed about Belotti. We have a number of strikers in mind and we are asking for information. I spoke with Torino and they know we are monitoring Belotti among others. We are acting with integrity and transparency: notifying the club before talking to the players.<br /><br />We have been looking at Morata from the beginning, and he has made himself available, then complications arose between the Champions League final and the emergence of different interested teams and things have cooled since. It can warm up again, but it will be on our terms.<br /><br /><b>[On Gianluigi Donnarumma]</b> From the beginning, Donnarumma’s new contract was our ‘mission impossible’. We inherited a player whose contract was expiring: the old management had failed, but it’s excellent that he renewed, as many said the chances were zero. With Bonucci, it all happened in a flash. We haven’t quite realised it yet. Alongside Ramos, he is one of the strongest defenders in the world in terms of technique and character. Over the years, he has learned to win. He is a very important signing from all points of view. To tear him from Juve wasn’t simple. I can’t find the words to express the feeling</p>

We’ll evaluate the things that we have to do after August 15.</p>

Of course he’s going to be <b>[with us]</b> in January and I’m sure he’ll be with us for many, many years.</p>

We tried to take him to Milan, but it was quite difficult for several reasons. Still, he is a strong player and a Milan fan, so who knows, maybe one day he can wear the shirt he dreamed of as a child.</p>

You all know that if I am here, then Gattuso will remain at Milan. He may well remain even without me!</p>
