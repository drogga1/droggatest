  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo looks sad amid Real Madrid’s La Liga struggles]</b> The situation needs to be well evaluated at the end of this season. These things must be talked about and if he <b>[Ronaldo]</b> is not happy then he has to say so. I don’t see Ronaldo as being sad in the Champions League, but I do see it in La Liga. That has nothing to do with his wages. Maybe he’s just more motivated by the Champions League.<br /><br />Personally, I love Neymar as a player. He has magic and would win over a lot of Real Madrid fans, or almost all of them. If there was a chance to sign him, I’d be the first person to say yes, but I don’t know if it’s possible. If Neymar was able to get on well with Lionel Messi, then there’s no reason he couldn’t get on well with Ronaldo</p>

  <p><b>[Former Real Madrid attacker Predrag Mijatovic says the club have no choice but to sign another star player]</b> When you lose a player like that, and you have to remember that you wanted to leave, you have to find another. I’m not convinced that Bale and Benzema can fill the gap of Cristiano. Comparing them with him, they are not able to give the same as him in recent years<br /><br />Without any doubt it would be a mistake to throw him out, it’s a bad decision. The league is very even, you have to keep the coach. Madrid can hardly lose against Viktoria, the Champions League is a competition made for them, if they lose they will have to make a decision, but even if they lose, we have to give Julen time. We do not have to look for the guilty, we have to find the solution, the players have to take this forward, Madrid will come out of this situation, I am convinced.</p>

We’ll see what happens, but I think Luka has the greatest possibility of winning.<br /><br /><b>[Asensio]</b> has a lot of talent and progression, he has highs and lows, cracking matches and others where he does not see the ball too much.

But, he has to convince himself, he does not trust himself too much, he has to keep training<br /><br />The Spanish team is with a new coach, trying to keep the same line with new players. We have to give them time, we cannot demand what they offered years ago. The selection always offers good football and I’m sure they will be in the European Championships, without any doubt</p>

  <p><b>[Predrag Mijatovic has revealed that <a href="fabio-capello.html">Fabio Capello</a> wanted <a href="real-madrid.html">the Blancos</a> to give up on <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> before he had even got going]</b> In my first year at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a> was the left-back, the best in football history in my opinion, but I knew that we had to sign a young player to replace him. Knowing Roberto like I did, as a team-mate, and knowing his contract was about to end it was clear his performances weren’t like they had been, and we needed to replace him. <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a> was 18 years old and totally unknown, and <a href="fabio-capello.html">Capello</a> wanted to give up on him, but I refused because I wanted him to train with <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a>. A player, training with a world-class star like <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a>, can see how he lives, take on any advice from him and that’s worth a lot more than 10-15 games on loan</p>
