  <p><b>[David Moores says Tom Hicks &amp; George Gillett Must Sell <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> I’m writing because it’s 5 years this week since the miracle of Istanbul - my greatest moment as a fan and as Chairman of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club - but which now feels light years away from happening again. But above all I’m writing to you because I care deeply about the club, the team and the fans. I hope against hope that Messrs Gillett and Hicks will see this letter, or some portion of it, and do the right thing. In holding on and holding out, they risk damaging a sporting institution of global renown and if they have any conscience or nobility they will stand aside and allow new owners to take over the club for its future benefit and that of its lifeblood - the club’s fans<br /><br />We looked long and hard for the right person or institution, we followed up every lead. We wanted that fantasy investor to come forward - the infinitely wealthy, Liverpool-loving individual or family with the wherewithal to transform our dreams into reality. And so sincere was our commitment to finding that person or company, that we invested huge sums and massive amounts of time investigating potential investors, only to conclude that they were not the right people for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. It would have been easier, I assure you, just to take the money, cross our fingers tight and hope things worked out - but we dug deep into every file and asked all the tough questions, knowing the answers might scupper any deal. We had looked at George Gillett’s affairs in detail and he came up to scratch. To a great extent, we took Tom Hicks on trust, on George’s say-so<br /><br />The share offer was laid out in unambiguous terms. The document pledged there would be no debt placed upon the club, and significant funds would be made available for investment in the squad and the new stadium<br /><br /><b>[Moores has not apologized for the deal, but he hugely regrets selling the club. He resigned from the board a year ago and insists that he has not been back to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> since]</b> It has been hard for me, sitting mute on the sidelines as the club I love suffers one blow after another<br /><br /><b>[He is in no doubt though that it is time that the Americans left Merseyside]</b> I call upon them to stand back, accept their role in the club’s current demise, and stand aside with dignity</p>

  <p><b>[When <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were sold to American businessmen Tom Hicks and George Gillett in February 2007 for around £219m, it was on the proviso that the duo would provide the finance that would propel <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> into Europe’s elite clubs in terms of spending power. Three years later and David Moores was forced to write an open letter begging Hicks and Gillett to sell up, saying]</b> They started off with grand ideals that they were never realistically going to achieve - I call upon them now to stand back, accept their limitations as joint owners of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club, acknowledge their role in the club’s current demise, and stand aside.</p>

  <p><b>[David Moores, who took over as the club’s chairman in 1991, later confessed that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> remained a major name in the game but were still struggling to marry a more modern approach with their traditional values]</b> In the wake of Euro 96 with the influx of more and more overseas superstars on superstar wages, I was aware the game was changing beyond all recognition and deeply worried, too, about my ability to continue underwriting the financial side.<br /><br />I was from the ever-decreasing pool of old-school club owners, the locally based, locally wealthy supporter like Jack Walker who stuck his money in out of his passion for the club.<br /><br />Football clubs were beginning to be seen as a source of profit rather than a source of pride; they were as much financial institutions as they were sporting legacies. The <b>[Roman]</b> Abramovich era was upon us, and I knew that I could never compete</p>
