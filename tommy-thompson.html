<blockquote>
  <p>[After a few stops and starts, it appears the Tommy Thompson hype train is ready to take off once again] It wasn’t easy but that’s part of what you sign up for when you enter the league at 18 years old.<br /><br />[Thompson tried to be as diplomatic as possible when describing a change that has so clearly been a godsend for him] I want to make sure I word this carefully. I’m definitely excited about our new style of play<br /><br />Chris Leitch has given me a license to go forward and to attack players. He wants me to create chances and he understands I might make a couple mistakes on the way. The role I’m playing is much more attacking and suits me better offensively. It’s allowed me more freedom and a little bit more of a license to put defenders on the back foot<br /><br />He’s been coaching me since the academy days so he saw what I could do when I was 16, 17 years old. He knew I was a dribbler so when he became my MLS coach, he remembered that kid in Sacramento that was playing freely and he wanted to see me do that in MLS, so he came up to me and said ‘I know what you’re capable of, go and do it<br /><br />I still want to impact the scoresheet more. I’ve started doing that this season more but I want to be a guy who’s getting goals and assists week in and week out</p>
