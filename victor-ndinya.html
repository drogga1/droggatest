  <p><b>[Former Bandari FC player Victor Ndinya has lauded club’s new Technical Director Twahir Muhiddin for his growth in the game]</b> I would like to thank Bandari fc for the opportunity to be a squad member for the past three years. Special dedication to Coach Twahir I appreciate the fact that you believed in my talent and gave me my KPL debut and always willing to serve as a mentor to me during my stay. I realize that your guidance has a lot to do with my success and I cant thank you enough for all you have done for me in my career. As I leave to pursue my new career adventure I thank the technical bench for the support I received.<br /><br />The skills and abilities you helped me develop will empower me to reach my professional goals. It was a tough decision to leave but for the best of my interest I had to do it. I wish the team the very best in all their endeavors. To my fans keep supporting me and I will announce my next chapter soon</p>
