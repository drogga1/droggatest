  <p><b>[Gylfi Sigurdsson on having a premonition about his winning spot-kick for Iceland against Netherlands]</b> I had a dream that we got a penalty. I took it and scored in that corner. So when we got one, I already knew where I was going to put it. I’m looking forward to my next dream!</p>

  <p><b>[Iceland international Gylfi Sigurdsson has singled out David Beckham and Frank Lampard as two of the players he aimed to emulate growing up]</b> Growing up as I kid I used to watch the Premier League and used to see David Beckham taking those kinds of free-kicks, so from a young age I was probably quite lucky to have him on the TV every week. It was something I used to practice when I was in Iceland and just kept doing it after I left. My dad played in Iceland and I think went over to Sweden for a couple of years. He and my brother used to bring me out when I was little, and then of course just watching football <b>[helped me develop my style]</b>. Beckham and Frank Lampard were the ones that I particularly liked watching, and with Lampard scoring so many goals from midfield it was hard not to look up to him.<br /><br />It was an unbelievable feeling. Of course, after seeing our draw, with the Netherlands, Czech Republic and Turkey all in the same group with us, some of us considered it an impossible target. But then to be able to finish the job off with two games to go is an unbelievable achievement and the feeling that goes with it, to be on our way to the finals, is fantastic</p>

  <p><b>[Gylfi Sigurdsson is enjoying life at Swansea under his new boss Paul Clement]</b> Yes, that’s of course, very flattering. Maybe he was just trying to give me confidence. Of course, it would be a dream to play for one of these big clubs. Hopefully if I continue doing well for Swansea and Iceland then in the near future, I can play in a big club. I am enjoying being one of the senior players, though. We may be in a tough spot, but I am kind of enjoying the pressure of that. I am trying to make the most of that and help the team to get three points every week.<br /><br />The results in the last couple of games haven’t been as good as we would have hoped, losing two very important matches. There’s still a long way to go. If you look at the bigger picture, with where we were at Christmas and where we are at the moment, we have made a big step towards safety but, of course, it’s a really tough season with a lot more football to be played.<br /><br />Hopefully we can continue the good work that we have been doing over the last six or seven weeks and we stay up. Clement has been fantastic, you can tell that there’s a reason why he has been at these big clubs that he has been at. He is very organised. His training sessions are fantastic. He is very positive and he is very good man-to-man with the players. The players have confidence in him and all together it feels like a good combination</p>

  <p><b>[Gylfi Sigurdsson says that Iceland are here to stay as they aim for their first ever World Cup qualification after the heroics of Euro 2016, where they knocked out England]</b> We enjoyed France so much and we want to do it again. Our focus is just to win as many games as possible and to make sure that we get the chance to experience tournament football again. It has been very good over the last four or five years. There has been a really positive vibe around the national team and I think we have got high expectations from everyone back home. There’s a lot of pressure from everyone back home, which is good in a way as it keeps us going and it keeps us focused. We have a very tough group so it is going to be tough to qualify, but after our experience last summer we are determined to try to make it happen.<br /><br /><b>[On Eidur Gudjohnsen]</b> He was at a club like Chelsea and got a lot more goals <b>[than me]</b>. We both like to score goals and we make similar kinds of runs into the box. We are two different players apart from that though. He was <b>[my inspiration]</b> when I was younger, definitely. He was the one I looked up to in the Premier League. He was on television every day. He was the player that I watched when I was younger, it was nice to play with him for a number of years. I enjoy the pressure. The players and everyone back home wants me to do well and score goals and get assists for the team. I have sort of got used to that over the years<br /><br />It has a lot to do with the team spirit that we have. Of course, we have good players. The players fit really well together, with our team spirit. How we are as a group is unique. If you look at the youth set up in Iceland, it is really good. We have good coaches and I think in the future, there will be a lot more youngsters coming through who are technically gifted and that will only improve Icelandic football. Also, in a sense <b>[it is like]</b> we haven’t changed managers. The managers worked together. Lars <b>[Lagerback]</b> left and now Heimir Hallgrímsson <b>[the new head coach]</b> has been doing pretty much what we have been doing from the years before. Things have been working really well for us so we are not going to change too much or do something different</p>

  <p><b>[Everton have completed the signing of Swansea City star Gylfi Sigurdsson for a reported club-record fee of £45 million]</b> Hopefully I will continue to create goals and score goals for the team and contribute to the kind of success we’re seeking at the club. This is an ambitious club and it is clear we are moving in a really good direction. The most important thing is that this team keeps winning games and climbing the table - and does that throughout the season. For myself, I would like to score as many goals as possible and create as many goals for my team-mates as I can. These are my targets. But it is always the same thing: as long as the team is winning I will be more than happy.</p>

We’ll be looking forward to going to Russia now and obviously seeing the hand clap at a World Cup!</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool vs Everton]</b> It does tend to happen that when you get someone in something happens. A little bit of spark. Sam Allardyce’s been good. Very direct. We know what he wants and he explains it very well. He looks after the players very well to get the best out of them. He’s very experienced and I think that will benefit us.</p>

  <p><b>[Iceland star Gylfi Sigurdsson described his missed penalty against Nigeria as the toughest moment of his career]</b> It’s tough to take. It’s probably the toughest moment of my career. Hopefully I can put it right and score in the next game. It was a game of two halves. We were good in the first half and very organised defensively. I don’t think they had any shots in the first half. We created numerous chances in the first half that we probably should have scored from. In the second half we were unlike ourselves. We were very open, especially after the first goal and we had to go and get something out of the game. Overall it’s very disappointing. We were impatient in trying to win the game instead of letting it happen naturally. We’re very disappointed because we felt after the first half the game was there for the taking. We’re just going to have to get something out of the next game to get through.<br /><br /><b>[Zlatko Dalic has suggested he will leave out some of his star names]</b> It doesn’t help <b>[if they are already through]</b>. They are such a good team even if they rest players. They have players at some of the biggest clubs in the world and it’s going to be a tough game no matter what. We’re just going to have to do our job and hope for a good result</p>

  <p><b>[Gylfi Sigurdsson is delighted to see <a href="andre-gomes.html">Andre Gomes</a> back at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>]</b> Fantastic. The club always wanted to keep the quality we had last season and then try to improve as well so it was very important for us to keep him. Hopefully we’ll strengthen the squad even more, that’s what the players and staff want so hopefully we’ll get a couple more players<br /><br /><b>[Silva oversaw a run of six runs and three draws from 11 games heading down the final stretch, with Sigurdsson now setting out what must be done to challenge for a top-six finish and European qualification]</b> We need to be more consistent and play like we did in the last three months or so. I thought we really stepped it up towards the end. It was mid-season when we lost a few games on the bounce and that pulled us away from the top teams. So consistency and playing the way we did towards the end will get us results.<br /><br />We won a few games and were playing most of the time with the same team and when players get a good run in the team things just click and you get confidence. Going forward we were scoring a few goals, we were keeping a few clean sheets which was massive for us and we started winning against the top teams</p>

He is still very young but he has shown his potential with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and has an extremely bright future. It is good for the morale of the team when you see top players being brought in. It is good for competition and it is nice to bring in new players who are determined to make an impact<br /><br />It shows the club wants to move in the right direction, it wants to continue improving during the season and between seasons. If we can bring in a couple more, then fantastic, that would add to the quality we have. It was sad to see Fab go off so early in the game on Saturday - but is it good we are bringing in new players to strengthen the squad for the season. The owner is investing a lot, which is fantastic, with the new stadium plans and players coming in. I think it will be exciting times ahead and we will bring in players to add to the quality we have</p>

  <p><b>[Gylfi Sigurdsson on life during the lockdown, <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> in the Community and his future under Ancelottis]</b> You just have to accept what you can and can’t do. There are more important things than football at the moment. We have never been in the position of not being able to go to a training ground.<br /><br />It is a sad time and very strange. But it is easy to stay at home with the family and make sure you are not taking any chances.<br /><br />When you’re off in the summer you know when pre-season starts but now we don’t know when we’ll return. But we will at some point and you have to stay as fit as possible for when we start training. I am lucky enough to have a good gym. The long passing and shooting <b>[practice]</b> I just have to accept is not possible<br /><br /><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> are doing their best to monitor the squad’s fitness, with players being given individual training regimes]</b> We have had everything we need, information in terms of what we can and can’t do, and the sports scientists have given each player a programme. We have a programme for the week and an app which lets them know what we have done. I start most mornings running on the treadmill and getting on my exercise bike. Then I do gym work, mixing upper and lower body weights<br /><br /><b>[The ‘Blue Family’ project, launched earlier this month, seeks to help people who have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak, particularly older members of society who may be feeling isolated]</b> I knew <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> did a lot of work in the community before I came to the club but I did not realise the extent of it. Continuing that work at this time is so important and I am sure it will make a big difference to a lot of people. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> is completely connected to its community and there are not many other clubs that do so much for the people around them. Football means so much to so many people and <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> is a huge part of a lot of people’s lives<br /><br /><b>[His usual number 10 position was also made redundant in December upon <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a>’s arrival, with the Italian preferring a 4-4-2 formation. That mean a new, deeper position for the 30-year-old]</b> I didn’t know if he was joking! There are a lot of things I have to think about in games I’ve never thought about before; if we are attacking I have to sit back and make sure we are set up defensively if we lose the ball.<br /><br />The things I love are scoring goals and getting in the box, getting on the end of crosses and taking up positions where the ball might fall to you. It has always been my target to attack and score goals. It took a couple of games to get used to something different but I have started to enjoy that position.<br /><br />If it had happened five or six years ago, I wouldn’t have been too happy. But as you mature and gain more experience it is a good challenge to play a new position and think about completely different things. Carlo is a very experienced and successful manager and we have a good relationship. It is nice to be in his team and if you are playing, you are happy</p>
