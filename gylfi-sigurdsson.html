  <p><b>[Gylfi Sigurdsson on having a premonition about his winning spot-kick for Iceland against Netherlands]</b> I had a dream that we got a penalty. I took it and scored in that corner. So when we got one, I already knew where I was going to put it. I’m looking forward to my next dream!</p>

  <p><b>[Gylfi Sigurdsson on Iceland’s historic qualification for Russia 2018 and the prospect of seeing their iconic thunder clap celebration with the fans]</b> It’s happening now so it’s just an outstanding feeling and I think all of the players and the people of Iceland are really proud of it. We’ll be looking forward to going to Russia now and obviously seeing the hand clap at a World Cup!</p>

  <p><b>[Gylfi Sigurdsson is delighted to see <a href="andre-gomes.html">Andre Gomes</a> back at Everton]</b> Fantastic. The club always wanted to keep the quality we had last season and then try to improve as well so it was very important for us to keep him. Hopefully we’ll strengthen the squad even more, that’s what the players and staff want so hopefully we’ll get a couple more players<br /><br /><b>[Silva oversaw a run of six runs and three draws from 11 games heading down the final stretch, with Sigurdsson now setting out what must be done to challenge for a top-six finish and European qualification]</b> We need to be more consistent and play like we did in the last three months or so. I thought we really stepped it up towards the end. It was mid-season when we lost a few games on the bounce and that pulled us away from the top teams. So consistency and playing the way we did towards the end will get us results.<br /><br />We won a few games and were playing most of the time with the same team and when players get a good run in the team things just click and you get confidence. Going forward we were scoring a few goals, we were keeping a few clean sheets which was massive for us and we started winning against the top teams</p>

  <p><b>[Gylfi Sigurdsson says Moise Kean’s arrival at Everton has sent the Toffees’s squad morale through the roof]</b> Moise Kean looks like a very good footballer with a lot of different qualities. He is still very young but he has shown his potential with Juventus and has an extremely bright future. It is good for the morale of the team when you see top players being brought in. It is good for competition and it is nice to bring in new players who are determined to make an impact<br /><br />It shows the club wants to move in the right direction, it wants to continue improving during the season and between seasons. If we can bring in a couple more, then fantastic, that would add to the quality we have. It was sad to see Fab go off so early in the game on Saturday - but is it good we are bringing in new players to strengthen the squad for the season. The owner is investing a lot, which is fantastic, with the new stadium plans and players coming in. I think it will be exciting times ahead and we will bring in players to add to the quality we have</p>

  <p><b>[Gylfi Sigurdsson on life during the lockdown, <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> in the Community and his future under Ancelottis]</b> You just have to accept what you can and can’t do. There are more important things than football at the moment. We have never been in the position of not being able to go to a training ground.<br /><br />It is a sad time and very strange. But it is easy to stay at home with the family and make sure you are not taking any chances.<br /><br />When you’re off in the summer you know when pre-season starts but now we don’t know when we’ll return. But we will at some point and you have to stay as fit as possible for when we start training. I am lucky enough to have a good gym. The long passing and shooting <b>[practice]</b> I just have to accept is not possible<br /><br /><b>[Everton are doing their best to monitor the squad’s fitness, with players being given individual training regimes]</b> We have had everything we need, information in terms of what we can and can’t do, and the sports scientists have given each player a programme. We have a programme for the week and an app which lets them know what we have done. I start most mornings running on the treadmill and getting on my exercise bike. Then I do gym work, mixing upper and lower body weights<br /><br /><b>[The ‘Blue Family’ project, launched earlier this month, seeks to help people who have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak, particularly older members of society who may be feeling isolated]</b> I knew <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> did a lot of work in the community before I came to the club but I did not realise the extent of it. Continuing that work at this time is so important and I am sure it will make a big difference to a lot of people. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> is completely connected to its community and there are not many other clubs that do so much for the people around them. Football means so much to so many people and <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> is a huge part of a lot of people’s lives<br /><br /><b>[His usual number 10 position was also made redundant in December upon <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a>’s arrival, with the Italian preferring a 4-4-2 formation. That mean a new, deeper position for the 30-year-old]</b> I didn’t know if he was joking! There are a lot of things I have to think about in games I’ve never thought about before; if we are attacking I have to sit back and make sure we are set up defensively if we lose the ball.<br /><br />The things I love are scoring goals and getting in the box, getting on the end of crosses and taking up positions where the ball might fall to you. It has always been my target to attack and score goals. It took a couple of games to get used to something different but I have started to enjoy that position.<br /><br />If it had happened five or six years ago, I wouldn’t have been too happy. But as you mature and gain more experience it is a good challenge to play a new position and think about completely different things. Carlo is a very experienced and successful manager and we have a good relationship. It is nice to be in his team and if you are playing, you are happy</p>
