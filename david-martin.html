  <p><b>[David Martin is confident he can learn from <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> manager <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Manuel Pellegrini</a> after the goalkeeper agreed to join his boyhood idols on a two-year contract]</b> I can’t wait to work with someone like <a href="manuel-pellegrini.html">Manuel Pellegrini</a>. He has so much experience and I can learn so much from him. I know him from his time at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, his calibre as a manager and what he did here last year. It wasn’t easy to come to a big club like this and turn in that style of football and bring in so many new signings.<br /><br /><b>[Martin is looking forward to the challenge of battling for a place in the team]</b> I’ve always been an enthusiastic person and I never know when I’m beaten, so I’ll always go into training every day with that attitude and I will compete with Lukasz and Roberto. I remember Roberto from being at Zaragoza and he’s been at a few clubs since then. We’re a very similar age and it will be good to go up against him in training and compete with him. It goes without saying how good Lukasz is. He’s proven himself as one of the best goalkeepers in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> last season, so to go up against them and try to improve will be great<br /><br />I worked with <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> <a href="borja-valero.html">Valero</a> at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and he’s probably one of the best goalkeeping coaches in the world. Since then he’s been at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="inter-milan.html">Inter Milan</a> and <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>. I’m looking forward to seeing what he’s picked up, experience-wise. He’s a great man and he’s at the cutting edge of goalkeeping. Sometimes you can have the best training in the world but you need someone to pick the faults in your game so you can improve, and he goes into the finer details. I think that’s what sometimes makes the best <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> goalkeepers, those finer details. To learn from him will be a real honour once again</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> goalkeeper David Martin says he and his dad were both in tears as they hugged after he made his <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> debut at the age of 33 on Saturday]</b> It still doesn’t feel real. I’m just pleased got through it, I didn’t let anyone down and actually I enjoyed it in the end. My dad didn’t say much - I think we were both in tears! For my dad to play for the club for 21 years and see it, and for me to make my debut, keep clean sheet and get win for the boys, it is so pleasing<br /><br /><b>[The shot-stopper admits that he had some pre-match nerves but hopes he will be given another chance by his manager]</b> I was struggling to eat for two days, Cressa <b>[Ryan Cresswell]</b> was laughing at me because my plate was taken away because I couldn’t eat my food. I hope I’ve given myself a good chance but have to work hard and keep grounded</p>
