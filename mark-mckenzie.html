  <p><b>[In basketball-mad New York City, how do U.S. soccer hopefuls make their big break?]</b> There’s a basketball hoop on every corner, it feels like. My dad’s Jamaican so soccer already runs through my veins as it is. He’s fanatical. In Jamaica it’s track, cricket and football. Those three are like the mainstays in the country. He played all the way through college. He moved to America when he graduated high school and, once he got here, he went to college in New York and played rightback. <b>[In Jamaica, soccer is]</b> on the beach, it’s in the streets, it’s on dirt fields, it’s wherever you can play. He’d always tell me stories where they had makeshift balls, where they would fill a water bottle up with newspaper or make a paper mache type ball and just kick that around. They’d do whatever to play. I think that’s where I get that natural calling for the sport from<br /><br />No matter where else in the world it is, these kids are being exposed to it at younger ages and they’re able to put more into it. Whereas here, in America, it’s almost a pay-to-play sport where you’re putting more into a lot of other sports and soccer is seen as that you have to have money in order to play. I think that’s just contrary elsewhere in the world. There are small-sided courts. You go to Holland, you go to England, you go to France, you go to all these different countries and you’re able to find kids playing pick-up <b>[soccer]</b>. Here in America, it’s the opposite. You go and you may find a big green field here, but you can’t play on it because it’s a private field, owned by a certain club. I think that’s the big difference between America and overseas<br /><br /><b>[McKenzie credits his family for helping him achieve his dream]</b> I’m truly blessed and thankful to have a person like him in my life to come up in such difficult conditions and to now see where I’m at, it’s amazing. You have <b>[the New York Red Bulls]</b> in New Jersey so that’s picking kids from Jersey and New York, but to have a club in the actual city, it’s an important step in development in the US<br /><br />If we continue to reach the inner city, there’s a lot more talent there than we think. I think spreading the game takes away that title of pay-to-play, allowing kids access to just play without having to worry about their financial status. If we can hit these different groups and try to implement a system where it’s a unified thing rather than it being that only certain people can play, it will only help the sport at the end of the day. You look at Brazil and I think that’s why so much talent comes out of there. It’s not a pay-to-play, these kids are allowed the opportunity to just go out and kick the ball. It’s them playing pick-up football and that’s why so many countries are so far ahead. They’re able to reach so many different groups and that equals more talent that they’re able to pick from. The US still has a way to go, but I think we’re going in the right direction. I’m optimistic about it.<br /><br /><b>[When McKenzie gets chance to go back to his basketball-mad home and see family, he’s encouraged even more by what he sees]</b> It’s definitely got better since I’ve been there. There’s more turf fields, it’s not grass, but I see more turf fields and I’ve seen a few small-sided courts. There’s the basketball hoop, but under that basketball hoop there’s also a small net. That’s a step in the right direction</p>
