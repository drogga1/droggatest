  <p><b>[John Salako says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> would probably be the best home for <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> if he decides to leave Crystal Palace in the near future]</b> Of course <b>[there’s still concern he could leave in January]</b>. I think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> would probably be the best home for him after their ban. They’ve got a really exciting young side there, and Wilf could come in and add to that. He could well move there, but <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> could come back with the money too. Anything could happen!<br /><br />Of course the fans are going to forgive him! The biggest coup over the summer was keeping Wilf. He obviously had his head turned but he’s been magnificent. No one begrudged him wanting a move. He made it very clear he wanted a big move, and wanted to play Champions League football. No one resents that, and we’d have wished him well if he’d got that transfer. It would have been difficult for him because he had his mind set on going. He’s had to get his head down and focus on Crystal Palace, and he’s done that. He’s back to his best!</p>

  <p><b>[John Salako says If <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> were to offer <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a> plus money to Crystal Palace for <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> then they may just get their man]</b> I honestly don’t think Wilf will go to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. <b>[Callum]</b> <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Hudson-Odoi</a> has come back, and I don’t think they’ll want to hinder his development. But <a href="willian.html">Willian</a> and <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> are getting on a bit, and maybe they’ll want someone to add to that. They could do a great little swap, though. Palace have got their eyes on <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a>, and that would be fantastic - <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> plus money! If Palace get the right offer, they could be tempted. Wilfred definitely has the ability <b>[for Chelsea]</b>, and no Palace fan can begrudge him if he wants that move<br /><br />I think he would be fantastic over there <b>[at Chelsea]</b>. I don’t want Palace to lose him, but in reality he is going to have to go. I would love to see him in that sort of team. I don’t want to upset them <b>[Palace fans]</b>, but I am only looking and I think he is improving all the time. I see that end product from him, and I just love him. He is one of my favourite players ever because I’ve never seen anyone do what he can do</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace favourite John Salako says <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> should cost any interested side up to £80 million]</b> As a manager, as a coach, if I was thinking how much I would spend on Wilf, the market’s ridiculous at the moment. But I think he’s got to be worth at least £70-80 million all day long. All day long. He’s at a good age where he can go on and do four, five, six years for someone<br /><br />To be fair, he’s been so important since he went off to <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and came back. He came back home but it’s difficult for Wilf because he showed in the summer that he has ambition. The lad’s got the world at his feet. He’s got so much talent, he’s got so much to offer. He could easily play for one of the top four sides. He wants to play Champions League and go and win things and really kick on. I don’t think there would be any Palace fan that would begrudge him that. He’s been sensational.<br /><br />We’d love him to stay but we have Andros Townsend, Max Meyer, Jeffrey Schlupp. In the January transfer window if we went and got a few players for Wilf, whether that’s <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> or <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, we could take a couple of good players. <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a>, if one of the youngsters fills in and we spend the money wisely then Palace move to another level. So it might be a blessing in disguise <b>[if he goes]</b> but if he stays we’d be delighted</p>
