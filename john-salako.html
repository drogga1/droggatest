  <p><b>[John Salako believes Aaron Wan-Bissaka should not join Manchester United this summer because it is too early]</b> You want young talent. He’s got the world at his feet. But my only concern is that we had <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> leave at a young age and he didn’t cope. He wasn’t mature enough and didn’t really settle in at Man United. He ended up coming back and has had the best spell of his career since he came back. He’s obviously another one linked with moving away but I’m just a bit concerned with Aaron. It’s been his first full season and it’s been absolutely magnificent. He couldn’t have been lying in bed and dreamt of a better debut season. He probably needs more games. I would compare him to Nathaniel Clyne who came through the system at Palace and was tremendous. He played 120-odd games and then went to Southampton, Liverpool, played for England and everything seemed to fall into place for him because he had that maturity. He knew his job and he was confident in himself and his game.<br /><br />It’s too early for Aaron. He needs another season. I’m not surprised United have come in because they could probably get him cheaper and they think they need to do something now. You remember with <b>[Theo]</b> Walcott and those types of players who came through at Southampton - even Gareth Bale or Alex Oxlade-Chamblerlain - they came early and it took them years to find their feet. I don’t know why teams don’t buy them and then leave them with their club and loan them back for a season or two, just to get that maturity. Then they’ve got the player at the right price.<br /><br />I think United are trying to get players on the cheap. That’s one of the things I’m frustrated with at Palace. There is a DNA, lots of local players that have come through at your Brentfords and in the lower leagues. We used to pick up Ian Wright from <b>[Sunday League side]</b> Ten-em-Bee, or from local sides like Sutton or Carshalton or Croydon. You’ve got to take a chance on those players lower down the leagues for £5m or £6m and they can turn into £40m players. That’s where the value is. You look at Joe Gomez who went for something like £5m from Charlton to Liverpool. What value that is! Those are the kind of deals that Manchester United are now looking to pick up<br /><br /><b>[<a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> has also been linked with a move away from Palace after recording 10 goals and five assists in the Premier League]</b> It sounds as though he wants to <b>[move to a top-six club]</b> from what I’ve heard coming out. He feels this is the time. He’s certainly ready. I think he’s had his best season so far. He’s matured, he’s added so much to his game. In all honesty I think it’s down to him. He’s got the physicality, he’s got the ability and now he’s just got to add that little bit of temperament. He’s getting frustrated at Palace because he is targeted because he is such a key man. If he played in a better side, there would be other better players that would attract more attention and take that pressure off him a little bit.<br /><br />If he’s got the desire to go and play Champions League football and he wants to play at a big club, I don’t think any Palace fan can deny him that. He’s been magnificent and you would wish him all the best from the bottom of the heart. He is a player that would excite and compliment and work well in any team</p>

  <p><b>[John Salako says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> would probably be the best home for <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> if he decides to leave Crystal Palace in the near future]</b> Of course <b>[there’s still concern he could leave in January]</b>. I think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> would probably be the best home for him after their ban. They’ve got a really exciting young side there, and Wilf could come in and add to that. He could well move there, but <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> could come back with the money too. Anything could happen!<br /><br />Of course the fans are going to forgive him! The biggest coup over the summer was keeping Wilf. He obviously had his head turned but he’s been magnificent. No one begrudged him wanting a move. He made it very clear he wanted a big move, and wanted to play Champions League football. No one resents that, and we’d have wished him well if he’d got that transfer. It would have been difficult for him because he had his mind set on going. He’s had to get his head down and focus on Crystal Palace, and he’s done that. He’s back to his best!</p>

  <p><b>[John Salako says If <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> were to offer <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a> plus money to Crystal Palace for <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> then they may just get their man]</b> I honestly don’t think Wilf will go to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. <b>[Callum]</b> <a href="callum-hudson-odoi.html">Hudson-Odoi</a> has come back, and I don’t think they’ll want to hinder his development. But <a href="willian.html">Willian</a> and <a href="pedro.html">Pedro</a> are getting on a bit, and maybe they’ll want someone to add to that. They could do a great little swap, though. Palace have got their eyes on <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a>, and that would be fantastic - <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Giroud</a> plus money! If Palace get the right offer, they could be tempted. Wilfred definitely has the ability <b>[for Chelsea]</b>, and no Palace fan can begrudge him if he wants that move<br /><br />I think he would be fantastic over there <b>[at Chelsea]</b>. I don’t want Palace to lose him, but in reality he is going to have to go. I would love to see him in that sort of team. I don’t want to upset them <b>[Palace fans]</b>, but I am only looking and I think he is improving all the time. I see that end product from him, and I just love him. He is one of my favourite players ever because I’ve never seen anyone do what he can do</p>

  <p><b>[Crystal Palace favourite John Salako says <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> should cost any interested side up to £80 million]</b> As a manager, as a coach, if I was thinking how much I would spend on Wilf, the market’s ridiculous at the moment. But I think he’s got to be worth at least £70-80 million all day long. All day long. He’s at a good age where he can go on and do four, five, six years for someone<br /><br />To be fair, he’s been so important since he went off to <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and came back. He came back home but it’s difficult for Wilf because he showed in the summer that he has ambition. The lad’s got the world at his feet. He’s got so much talent, he’s got so much to offer. He could easily play for one of the top four sides. He wants to play Champions League and go and win things and really kick on. I don’t think there would be any Palace fan that would begrudge him that. He’s been sensational.<br /><br />We’d love him to stay but we have Andros Townsend, Max Meyer, Jeffrey Schlupp. In the January transfer window if we went and got a few players for Wilf, whether that’s <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> or <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, we could take a couple of good players. <a href="olivier-giroud.html">Olivier Giroud</a>, if one of the youngsters fills in and we spend the money wisely then Palace move to another level. So it might be a blessing in disguise <b>[if he goes]</b> but if he stays we’d be delighted</p>
