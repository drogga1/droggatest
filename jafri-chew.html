  <p>[Malaysia forward Jafri Firdaus Chew needed only four minutes to show what he is capable of, assisting their third goal against Myanmar on Monday] I am relieved that I could produce an assist. I had a terrible time against Brunei, so even though I played only for a short while tonight, I showed what I’m capable of. Praise Allah, we came away with three points.</p>

  <p>[After his assist against Myanmar, Malaysia’s Jafri Chew signalled his intent with a brace against Laos in their 3-1 SEA Games Group A win] Praise Allah, I’m satisfied with my performance tonight as I managed to score two goals. Against Brunei I didn’t play well, and tonight I got to do better. But I have to do more. I’ve scored two and made one assist so far [in the tournament], but I believe I can perform even better than tonight. I’m not sure though about my chances [in the starting line-up], all six strikers are in form. We have to see what the coach decides.<br /><br />[When asked about Malaysia’s possible opponents in the semis, the 20-year old revealed that his focus is on rivals Indonesia] I believe that Indonesia will be a changed team from the qualifiers. If we meet them in the semis they will keep pressing us and we have to keep composed</p>

  <p>[Jafri Chew played his part in Malaysia’s exciting 1-0 win over Indonesia] I’m always ready to play. Whenever I’m called into action, even that early because of Kumaahran’s injury, I’m happy to be counted upon.<br /><br />At that time, of course we were thinking that the match could go into extra time. But I’m thankful that it didn’t and we managed to finish it within 90 minutes. Of course I’m excited because we are in the final now. But the mission is completed yet. We still one more game to go. We have to take this win as a confidence booster ahead of the final. That’s our last game and that decides the gold medal, hence it’s important for us to maintain our focus and ensure we give our best</p>
