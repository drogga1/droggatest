  <p><b>[Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic has hit out at his Serbia team-mates and threatened to quit the national team unless attitudes change]</b> I always try to lead by example but some people don’t want to see that. The attitude of some players is unacceptable, not just on the pitch but off it too and it was obvious from the moment we got together on Monday. I told our coach <b>[Radovan Curcic]</b> there is no point in me carrying on with the national team if things don’t change.<br /><br /><b>[Referencing Serbia’s heated 2-0 victory over rivals Albania]</b> When our personal reputations were on the line we did everything right. But I’d really like to know whether some of my team mates apply the same poor work ethic at their clubs as they do in the national team most of the time</p>

I cannot wait to meet my new team-mates and to start training with them. This is a very exciting time for the club and I am looking forward to playing my part in creating more history for this great club.</p>

He was the leader of our national team and it’s great to be at the same club, like him. I’ll try to do my best to repeat what he did. I know it’s going to be hard but I don’t want him to tell me one day ‘what are you doing there?’.<br /><br /><b>[Matic admits he is proud to have been signed for a second time in his career by <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> I feel great. Manchester is one of the biggest clubs in the world and I’m very happy because I’m now part of this great club, this great group. My wish was to train with Jose and of course when you have a coach like him and a club like Manchester, you don’t need to think a lot. My decision was very easy. He’s a great coach. When I worked with him before, he always took the best from me and I improved a lot with him.<br /><br />When the coach wants you to come to the club, it gives you more motivation, more possibility and I will for sure give my best to show that I deserve to be at this club and part of the group. It’s very important to come as soon as possible, to have time to adapt to the coach’s wishes and new team-mates and I’m happy I’ll have some days to train with them before the first big game, against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. It will be a great game. It’s going to be interesting, I think all <b>[of]</b> the world will be watching.

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic is already planning to spend a long time at Manchester United following his £40 million move from Chelsea]</b> Thanks to the guys, they have accepted me from my first day and I feel. Thanks to them, I feel very comfortable and I feel like I will be here a long time. They have helped me, and I am happy if I give them something back, and that I helped us to win. We played good football, and I think our supporters enjoyed it as well. It’s good to start well with three points, the season is long but we have to collect a lot of points and we’ve had a good start. It was great <b>[to play at Old Trafford]</b>, when you wear that <b>[United]</b> shirt you feel some kind of pressure because this is a big club, but that’s why we are here. We know that it’s a big responsibility to play for Manchester United and I’m happy that we have started well and that I hope we continue like this - I’m sure this group can do good things<br /><br /><b>[Romelu Lukaku bagging a brace against the Hammers]</b> I am happy for him - not only that he scored goals - but his amazing all-round game as well. He saved a lot of balls and he gave us self-confidence up front. It was very important for us that he scored his first two goals and, after that, it was easier for us to play, the game was more open, and there was more space to use. I’m happy for him and that we have him on the team, and I’m sure he will continue his form</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic is looking for Manchester United to mount a challenge for a Premier League and Champions League double in 2017-18]</b> Winning the Premier League title will be a tough task not just for us but for everyone because there are five or six realistic contenders. But we all know that Manchester United are expected to win every game. As far as the Champions League is concerned, we’ve had a favourable draw and we are hopeful of still being in the competition in the latter stages.<br /><br />The 2-1 UEFA Supercup defeat against Champions League holders Real Madrid was a good test of our credentials to slug it out with Europe’s best. We were outplayed but that was a one-off while the Champions League is a competition where you face different rivals in every round.<br /><br />I knew many of United’s players from before as I’ve played against them quite a few times so I had a pretty good idea what I was walking into. The team helped me adapt quickly, they treated me like one of their own in the dressing-room from the very first day. We’ve made a pretty good start in the Premier League but it’s a long season and we will see how it goes</p>

It is too early to say that because we have just played three games. It is true that we have started well with three games, nine points without conceding a goal, so I am happy because of that. But the season is very long and there are many games. We will see at the end of May where we are. What I can say is that I am happy that I am part of such a big club like Manchester United. I am very focused to do my job for the national team against Ireland.<br /><br />It is a dream for me to play at the World Cup with Serbia. If that happens, I will be very happy. If I win the Premier League with Manchester, that would be something great in my life. But I repeat again, it’s still a long way to go<br /><br /><b>[On Roy Keane]</b> When I started following football, he was one of the best midfielders in the Premier League, if not the best.

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic has warned Manchester United that they cannot afford too many repeats of their 2-2 draw at Stoke]</b> It was a tough game. To be honest, it’s always a tough game when you come to this stadium. Stoke are a good team, so it was difficult, but we managed to get a point. If we want to be champions, we have to win games like this because in these games, if you win, you are champion. We have to know against teams like this you have to have a little bit more, you have to be concentrated and of course we’re not happy with a point.<br /><br />It’s always important if you can come from behind, and I think we showed spirit. We had the lead in the second half but they scored a goal from the corner kick. We didn’t take some chances at the other end, so we could have won the game. It’s always important to be at the top of the table if you can. I’m happy that we are still there, and we’ll continue to work hard to stay there until the end of the season.<br /><br />Yeah, it’s great to see them score again and they are very important players for us. I hope they’ll continue to play well; the season has really only just started and we have many games until the end, so I am hopeful that they can continue to do well. My team-mates have helped me to become a part of the team very quickly and I’ll work hard to help them too. We want to win titles this season and I’m happy that I’m part of this great club</p>

My body is not ready yet and I have some difficulty, of course, but I try to hide that and to play simple. I will be better. We know what we have to do because we are Manchester United and we are focused just on the next game. Always the next game is the most important, so game by game we have to collect points and next May we will see. It’s a long way to go.<br /><br />We cannot be relaxed for the future because we have to win more, focus because the teams now know how we play, the teams know our formation, our players and, of course, in the future those will want to show they can play against Manchester United. We will be focused, we will be ready for that. It is going to be hard but that’s why we are here<br /><br />It is going to be harder and harder for us - not only for us, for every team - so we have to collect the points and to continue to work like this. But we are in a good position. The most important thing is to collect the points, not concede the goals, because this is good for our confidence. It’s too early to say someone is favourite to win the league, but for sure there are five or six teams who are going to compete this year</p>

Everyone knows that Paul is very important for Manchester United, but we also have great players to play instead of him. We showed in the last few games that everyone in Manchester is ready to play and everyone can help us.<br /><br /><b>[On Marouane Fellaini]</b> He is a great player. If you see how he works every day in the training sessions, the games he played didn’t surprise me – that he played well, that he scored goals. He doesn’t have the credit that he deserves. I don’t know why. But I really enjoy playing with him, and I am sure that we will continue like this. It’s nice to have him in the team because he can defend, on long balls he is strong and he’s always dangerous in attack. I am sure that he will show all his quality this season</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic has admitted it is not easy to work with Jose Mourinho at times]</b> Mourinho is a brand, and the best coach I’ve ever worked with. isn’t easy to work with him, because he always demands more. Even when you play the best match in your career, he considers that you can play better in the next match. I cooperated excellently with him at Chelsea, and the fact that Mourinho is the coach at Manchester was the decisive factor in choosing my new environment.<br /><br />Privately he’s completely different from the way he is perceived by the general public. This is a man who possesses all human virtues. He’s not at all cold or conceited, as he is presented in the media.<br /><br />Mourinho has created an excellent group of players with huge potential, and everything is there for us to achieve good results. I don’t want to talk about the goals of the club, but when I mention Manchester United I think the ambitions are clear to everyone. The fact that I’m playing for United is the pinnacle of my career and of everything I’ve achieved in football.<br /><br />I really like it in Manchester, and the family has got used to the city. I needed very little to make me happy in my new environment – just to be together with my wife Aleksandra, my six-year-old son Filip and three-year-old daughter Tea. The children have a good school in Manchester, and I’m particularly glad that my son started football training. He has a place reserved in United’s junior ranks</p>

Congratulations to our opponents today because they were very, very good and it was a great game.<br /><br />I think the fans enjoyed it and the most important thing is we took the three points and we can focus on the next game now. I think they had a little bit more of the ball in the first half, but we had more clear chances. They play great football, but the most important thing is the result at the end and we managed to win. If we continue like this, and fight like this, we can compete for the title. It’s important to win these kinds of games.

In two games everything can change. I think there is five teams who will challenge for the title and if I say something now I will be wrong for sure. You have Manchester City, us, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham so with five or six teams it is going to be a big fight until the end and we will see in May. This is only 10 games but I’m happy that we are now second position, that we are there. We have a chance but we still have to improve.</p>

I spent a good time at Chelsea, three-and-a-half years is a long time, so, of course, it means a lot to me to go back. It’s going to be something special to play again in the stadium.

I’m going to do everything I can to make that happen. The fans can at least expect that I will give absolutely everything in every game. I will always give 100 per cent. Let’s see what we can achieve together, however, I think we can go far. It’s difficult to make promises in football. I can’t promise that we’ll win the league. However, I can promise that I will give 100 per cent and we’ll see how far it takes us.<br /><br />I’m living my dream now, and of course I have a dream about winning the league with United. I still remember I watched the Champions League final in 1999 on the television. I know everything, or at least almost everything, about Manchester United. United was a big team back then. They had many fantastic players, but for me, Ryan Giggs was the greatest. When Nemanja Vidic came to United, I also admired him</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic is a holding midfielder of the highest order at Manchester United, but few will realise that’s partly courtesy of former Argentina stars Pablo Aimar and Javier Saviola]</b> When I started to play football, my dream was to play as an attacking midfielder and to score goals. When I grew up slowly <b>[motions to being tall with his hand]</b>, I started to move back and, when I came to Benfica, the coach Jorge Jesus told me I won’t have the chance to play attacking midfield.<br /><br />We had many players better than me in that position, such as Pablo Aimar and Javier Saviola. So it was difficult for me and he said, if I want to play, then the No.6 position in defensive midfield was for me and I can become one of the best in the world. I started to work hard and to listen to him and, step by step, I improved. As you can see today, I am at Manchester United and I am happy that I changed my position<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether his size, along with his ability, had led to the switch]</b> Yes, I think so. With my height, it is difficult to play forward in that role but I don’t know. Maybe the coach said that my height was a problem when maybe it was my quality! Aimar and Saviola were very small but extremely good technically and had very good quality</p>

As I say there are still many games to play and I think that we are not out of the title race. If we want to catch them, we have to win almost every game.

There is an interesting story because an agent wanted to take me to a Serbian club and I was not happy to do so. He asked: ‘Where do you want to go then?’ I was sitting at a table with him, playing third division, and I told him: ‘I wanted to go to Manchester United.’ He was like: ‘What is he talking about?’ I was joking but it shows everything is possible.</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic concedes that Manchester United have put themselves under more pressure by failing to land a trophy in 2017-18]</b> When you don’t win one year, the next year there is always more pressure. This is football. When you play for Manchester United, it is a normal thing and we have to accept that and deal with that. When you win the trophy it’s different and you feel better but the most important thing is that we can look in the mirror and know we gave our best. The team was sad after the game <b>[FA Cup final]</b>. We know we deserved more but this is football. This is a final - everything can happen - so as I said we have to be focused on the next challenge. I think that we have improved this year. As you know, United last year were sixth. The year before that, fifth. So we improve, we are second. The only team who is better than us this year is Man City. Obviously, they play amazing football. But we are second and we are in the Champions League next year, which is the most important thing.<br /><br />We played 90 minutes’ good football at Wembley. I don’t know how it looked from the outside but I felt in the first half we also played football. Obviously it was better in the second half but in the first half we controlled the game, though we conceded a goal from one mistake. Some games we played much better in the second half. We have to try to play 90 minutes in the same way</p>

He is still young and I think if he continues to score in the next games he will get that. If he reaches his top level he can be one of the best players in the league for sure. Sometimes I don’t think he understands how good he is. Sometimes he is quick, he is good with the ball, he can run. He has everything that a Manchester United football player needs. Sometimes I don’t think he understands that. If I had his ability with the ball and I was as quick as him then I wouldn’t pass to anyone and I would score every game!<br /><br />To be serious, he does need more confidence and this comes with results. When you don’t have results it is very difficult for players to have that high confidence. If we can get results over the next few games and improve as a team he will show that he is very important for us. The manager speaks with him about it. I have told him once. But he is a great person and a great guy and I am happy for him that he is scoring. It is great. The quality is there, and he just needs to be more consistent. I am glad we have him in the team.

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic has told <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s young players to improve their concentration levels in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> matches against low-profile opposition]</b> It’s difficult to explain, but I think that we have a very young team. When we play big games against big players, big teams - when I say big teams, I mean teams at the top of the league like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, City, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> - then I think these young players have more concentration. I think they give more on the pitch and, in small games, that’s not the case in my opinion. If we manage to keep the same concentration in big games and also in small games then we can be more consistent and win more games. As you know we are fifth, sixth in the table and I’m sure that this team can do more</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic says <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> can be one of the best]</b> Marcus has great potential. He’s a great guy also off the pitch, but I think he hasn’t used all his qualities yet. He needs to mature more and I can say every year, every month, he’s getting better and better. I think in the future, in the next two or three years, he will show what he can really achieve because he can do much, much more in my opinion. But he’s still young. We can’t expect him to play 40 games at the same level because he’s still young, still learning, he’s still developing his body, his mentality. He can be one of the best strikers in the world, for sure<br /><br /><b>[Matic thinks the playing field has mostly levelled in England’s top flight, though, given the amount of funds at the disposal of the clubs]</b> I think every year <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> improves. Top-six teams have always been top six and they always play good football. They always had the best players but, over the last 10 years in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I think the small clubs have improved a lot. They’ve started to invest more. Even the clubs who fight to stay in the league, they can buy players for 30, 40million. I think the standards in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> are higher and that’s why the big teams find it very hard now to win. I think this is good for football, good for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and I think in the future it will be even harder for the top teams<br /><br /><b>[Former United stars have been quick to criticise the current team when on duty as television pundits]</b> I think it’s their job if they go on television, it’s their job to say something.

United have some option to extend my contract, but we will see if the plans of the club match my plans.

I think we played some good football. In the last 35 to 40 minutes, we were the better side. But it’s hard. If you don’t score against this kind of team it’s hard to draw or to win.
