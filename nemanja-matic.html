  <p><b>[New <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> signing Nemanja Matic is eager to live up to the success enjoyed by compatriot <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Vidic</a> was a great player, he was one of the players I looked to be similar to because he had a great career. He was the leader of our national team and it’s great to be at the same club, like him. I’ll try to do my best to repeat what he did. I know it’s going to be hard but I don’t want him to tell me one day ‘what are you doing there?’.<br /><br /><b>[Matic admits he is proud to have been signed for a second time in his career by <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> I feel great. Manchester is one of the biggest clubs in the world and I’m very happy because I’m now part of this great club, this great group. My wish was to train with Jose and of course when you have a coach like him and a club like Manchester, you don’t need to think a lot. My decision was very easy. He’s a great coach. When I worked with him before, he always took the best from me and I improved a lot with him.<br /><br />When the coach wants you to come to the club, it gives you more motivation, more possibility and I will for sure give my best to show that I deserve to be at this club and part of the group. It’s very important to come as soon as possible, to have time to adapt to the coach’s wishes and new team-mates and I’m happy I’ll have some days to train with them before the first big game, against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. It will be a great game. It’s going to be interesting, I think all <b>[of]</b> the world will be watching. They are Champions League winners and it’s going to be a hard game but I’m sure we’ll be ready. I’m sure that this season we can do big things</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> want trophies in 2019-20]</b> I think we need to be focused from the first day, to prepare physically and to be ready mentally for the season which is in front of us. We <b>[must]</b> think positively. We want to win trophies, so I think everyone needs to be ready.<br /><br />The mood is always great. But last summer, because we had the World Cup, we had a shorter holiday and didn’t have as much time to rest<br /><br /><b>[The 30-year-old, who is approaching his third season at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, added on the tests to come]</b> I’m getting excited about the new season. But I won’t look at the fixtures a lot because you have to look game by game. The next game is always the most important, so when the fixtures come out, the most important is the first game, so you are focused on your first game. Then when you’ve finished that you can think about the second one. In football it’s not good to think about a game that comes later, so you need to be focused always on the next challenge</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic believes a lack of experience stands in the way of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> challenging for the title]</b> Quality and experience brings you the title. In this squad we have quality and no experience. We have five or six top players, but they are still young like <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> and <a href="anthony-martial.html">Anthony Martial</a>. They have shown their quality on the pitch but they are too young to lead the team of course. <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a>, great potential. United have a project and know what they want with players of the future. But you need to give them time because, at 17, you cannot play the same like you are 26 or 27. Football always wants results but the fans need to be patient so they can improve. In the future I am sure these players will take United back where they belong<br /><br /><b>[Legendary club captain <a href="bryan-robson.html">Bryan Robson</a> believes Matic could do the job and the player is flattered by the icon’s praise]</b> It’s always great to hear when someone like Mr. Robson says good things. It means something to me. Of course I am one of the most experienced players in the team and I will try to lead them the best way I can. As for the future, maybe, who knows? The manager has to make the decision about the captain. Whatever he decides, we’ll be happy, of course. The captaincy is important but, if we play good football and fight for each other, that is the most important</p>

We will see what’s going to happen. He is a <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> player and of course we will be happy if he stays. I don’t see that he’s going to leave but in football everything is possible<br /><br /><b>[Matic doesn’t think United need to dip back into the transfer market this summer, as the players at the club are ready to perform]</b> The players who are in the changing room, we are ready to play. I don’t know if the club will sign someone before the transfer deadline or not. I think the guys are happy in the changing room and of course every good player is welcome but I don’t know what ideas the club has. The players in the changing room have the quality to play for Man United and they will show that on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[Matic and United open the season against his former club <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, who are managed by <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>, who played alongside the Serb at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a>]</b> They have a lot of good players so it’s not going to be easy. It’s not going to be easy for them either because we are a very good team. For sure it’s going to be very interesting. <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>’s a great guy and he was a great player of course.

There is no problem. I told him I disagreed with him, but that he had to decide the team<br /><br />I have been in football for a long time, I have played almost all the games for all the clubs in the last 10 years. In order for me to play, one had to sit on the bench and accept that fact, and so do I now. The coach must opt for the team that will fight for the title, and if he does not win, he bears the responsibility<br /><br /><b>[There will also be a new head coach on the sidelines after Ljubisa Tumbakovic replaced Mladen Krstajic, who was sacked after June’s 4-1 rout of Lithuania following their 5-0 humiliation against Ukraine]</b> We see every success as euphoric, and every failure as a tragedy. We have such a mentality, temperament, it’s hard to change that. But now let’s go to the European Championships. It would be very important for our football, we haven’t been there for a long time. Finally, we connect two major competitions</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic has said it’s a positive that <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are blooding so many youngsters, despite it limiting his own playing time]</b> I don’t believe in age, good players or bad players. It doesn’t matter if you are 18 or 35, so I think who played today deserved to play. I am happy for the young players, they get the opportunity to play here. It’s not always the case in big clubs, and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> is giving opportunities to the guys who grew up here in the academy. That’s good because in big clubs they don’t always get opportunities because of the pressure and the results and because everyone wants to win. I think in this season the people from the club they can see who is ready to play already in a high level.<br /><br /><b>[Despite his limited opportunities he still thinks he has a lot to offer the club going forward]</b> Of course, I want to play. I always give my best for the team. The coach is the man who picks the team and when you are on the bench you are not happy, but I am doing my best to change his mind and persuade him to put me on the pitch. The season is long, today as you saw I played and we won the game, I am happy so we will see in the future what the coach decides. I am ready. In the last ten years I have played in a high level and I have tried my best to help the team because I think I am a team player and I can help a lot I think</p>

It’s very important to start with three points and we are happy because of that. It’s good for <b>[young players]</b> to have this opportunity to play these games. They have to use that to work hard to get more chances during the season. I’m happy for them. It’s great as it gives young guys a chance to improve. They can only improve if they play games.

When I’m on the pitch, I’m happy and I will continue to do my job. We have to be more consistent in our games, but this is normal for a young team without experience. This is normal and I’m sure those young guys in our changing room - they are the future of Manchester United<br /><br /><b>[After seeing <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>’s side net three times in the second half to see off League Two underdogs Colchester]</b> I think we played well most of the game. First half, we had complete control, we played round their box and we had chances to score. We scored the three goals in the second half. They made one great counterattack and, after that, we scored in the next action. I’m happy we’re in the semi-final.

My family is happy here, I’m happy, so we will see what the next step is, if I will leave or stay, but whatever we decide I’m sure that we will decide for the best<br /><br /><b>[<a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> clearly left an impression on Matic, who was effusive in his praise of the ex-Italy head coach]</b> <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> is crazy about football. I think in 24 hours he thinks about football. He works a lot, he analyses the opponents very well, also his team. Tactically, he is one of the best coaches in the world for sure. Physically, his teams are ready to run 95 minutes at the same level. <b>[He is a]</b> Very professional coach and for sure one of the best in the world.

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic has told <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s young players to improve their concentration levels in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> matches against low-profile opposition]</b> It’s difficult to explain, but I think that we have a very young team. When we play big games against big players, big teams - when I say big teams, I mean teams at the top of the league like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, City, <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> - then I think these young players have more concentration. I think they give more on the pitch and, in small games, that’s not the case in my opinion. If we manage to keep the same concentration in big games and also in small games then we can be more consistent and win more games. As you know we are fifth, sixth in the table and I’m sure that this team can do more</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic says <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> can be one of the best]</b> Marcus has great potential. He’s a great guy also off the pitch, but I think he hasn’t used all his qualities yet. He needs to mature more and I can say every year, every month, he’s getting better and better. I think in the future, in the next two or three years, he will show what he can really achieve because he can do much, much more in my opinion. But he’s still young. We can’t expect him to play 40 games at the same level because he’s still young, still learning, he’s still developing his body, his mentality. He can be one of the best strikers in the world, for sure<br /><br /><b>[Matic thinks the playing field has mostly levelled in England’s top flight, though, given the amount of funds at the disposal of the clubs]</b> I think every year <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> improves. Top-six teams have always been top six and they always play good football. They always had the best players but, over the last 10 years in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, I think the small clubs have improved a lot. They’ve started to invest more. Even the clubs who fight to stay in the league, they can buy players for 30, 40million. I think the standards in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> are higher and that’s why the big teams find it very hard now to win. I think this is good for football, good for <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and I think in the future it will be even harder for the top teams<br /><br /><b>[Former United stars have been quick to criticise the current team when on duty as television pundits]</b> I think it’s their job if they go on television, it’s their job to say something. Sometimes they say the truth, probably; sometimes they criticise the younger players, which isn’t good, in my opinion, especially if you’re an ex-player of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and you criticise the players and you know you’ve been there 10, 15, 20 years ago. You have to help the players if you can. But they probably get money to work there and they have to say something. To be honest, I don’t watch that much, when I see some clips or something, yeah, but I know what my job is and for me, the most important opinion is my coach, my club. If they’re happy with my work, that’s it.<br /><br /><b>[Matic has watched former <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> team-mate <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> enjoy an encouraging first season as <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> head coach]</b> I’m very happy because I saw <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>, I saw <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a> is back at the club and I think it’s very important for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because they know what <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is, they have experience in football, and I’m happy that they are there. I’m sure they can help the team and if you speak about Frank, I played with him, and he’s great, a great person, he was amazing as a player, as you know, and I’m sure that he will improve <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and he will do great.

United have some option to extend my contract, but we will see if the plans of the club match my plans. I couldn’t say anything more because I don’t really know either<br /><br />United is a bigger club, looking at history, but <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> have done better in the last 10 years.

We didn’t have the titles behind us, but we had to win. We made history and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> will never be able to erase those of us who did it. That will remain forever. I knew roughly what was waiting for me at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>, I played many times against United.

I think we played some good football. In the last 35 to 40 minutes, we were the better side. But it’s hard. If you don’t score against this kind of team it’s hard to draw or to win. I think everyone on the pitch from our team felt that we were in control, completely in control, so that’s the model of how we should always play against top teams<br /><br /><b>[Matic added on Martial’s costly second-half miss]</b> Yeah, I think that he made a great action, a one-two with Andreas, and tried to do his best to score. We also had one great chance in the first half. As I said, we have to use these chances because against top teams you can create three or four in the game, and you have to use at least one.

Anything less than three points is not good for us, we must win<br /><br /><b>[United recorded a 2-0 victory at Turf Moor earlier in the season]</b> Physically, they are very good. They are a strong team, all big guys, especially on set-pieces where they are very dangerous, and also with long balls and second balls.

He is getting more experience and he will get better and better. He is a much better manager than one year ago in my opinion because now he knows all the players, he knows exactly what he needs to do before the games, so I think for his job the experience is very important</p>

Because he can do much, much more in my opinion. But he’s still young. We can’t expect him to play 40 games at the same level because he’s still young, still learning. He’s still developing his body, his mentality. So he can be one of the best strikers in the world, for sure</p>

  <p><b>[They will return to the field when taking in a trip to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> on June 19, with Nemanja Matic another of those who is eager to get going]</b> I miss football and I miss the pressure before the game. It’s going to be strange, playing without supporters, but we have to adapt. At least we can compete with other teams and, hopefully, can start well<br /><br />It’s easy. The new routine is to check our temperature every morning, wash our hands and keep our distance, as much as we can. But training is normal - we are now allowed contact training so it’s more or less the same. There are just a few different things before the training.</p>

The country allowed everyone to do whatever they want, everything was open, the shopping centres and the restaurants. So, they started to live normal lives because our country was closed for three months completely. You were not allowed to walk on the street, you couldn’t leave your home, so it was different than <b>[in England]</b>. But when they opened, they said, ‘You are more than free to do whatever you want’. Before that tournament, there was a game with 20,000 people and nobody said anything about that.
