  <p><b>[New <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> signing Nemanja Matic is eager to live up to the success enjoyed by compatriot <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Nemanja Vidic</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Vidic</a> was a great player, he was one of the players I looked to be similar to because he had a great career. He was the leader of our national team and it’s great to be at the same club, like him. I’ll try to do my best to repeat what he did. I know it’s going to be hard but I don’t want him to tell me one day ‘what are you doing there?’.<br /><br /><b>[Matic admits he is proud to have been signed for a second time in his career by <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>]</b> I feel great. Manchester is one of the biggest clubs in the world and I’m very happy because I’m now part of this great club, this great group. My wish was to train with Jose and of course when you have a coach like him and a club like Manchester, you don’t need to think a lot. My decision was very easy. He’s a great coach. When I worked with him before, he always took the best from me and I improved a lot with him.<br /><br />When the coach wants you to come to the club, it gives you more motivation, more possibility and I will for sure give my best to show that I deserve to be at this club and part of the group. It’s very important to come as soon as possible, to have time to adapt to the coach’s wishes and new team-mates and I’m happy I’ll have some days to train with them before the first big game, against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. It will be a great game. It’s going to be interesting, I think all <b>[of]</b> the world will be watching. They are Champions League winners and it’s going to be a hard game but I’m sure we’ll be ready. I’m sure that this season we can do big things</p>

  <p><b>[Jose Mourinho is still special]</b> He always wants the best. He always wants to win. Of course, him as a coach, if you play good he always thinks that you can play better. This is good. He always asks you to do more. I am happy that we work with him and he’s a coach who won many, many trophies in his career and for sure we can learn a lot of things from him. He won many things. The coach is good if he won the trophies. He won in every country he has been, he has won a lot and that’s why they call him special<br /><br />I am always positive. sObviously the gap between us and City is big, but we will fight until the end</p>

We have to accept it and to focus on the next game, which is very important also for us, in the FA Cup. We focus also for the league, but we have to say congratulations to the team, Sevilla. They played really well, and they deserved to go through.<br /><br />There is no excuse. There is no excuse. We had a big game, as you know, against Liverpool. We won. With high confidence we came to play this game, but today they played better than us and they deserved <b>[to win]</b>.<br /><br /><b>[FA Cup now represents United’s only realistic tilt at silverware]</b> We have to be focused on <b>[Brighton’s visit]</b> that because they’re a good team and we have to win. We have to go with everything to try to go through. We know that our supporters are sad because of this result. We are also sad, and we have to win to go back to winning ways, so I hope that the team reaction is going to be good. We have to forget this. We have to review our mistakes, to see what we have to do better and on Saturday is a new game. Life goes on and this is football, we have to accept that</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba has been told by Old Trafford colleague Nemanja Matic that he needs to be Manchester United’s main player]</b> With his personality, Paul needs to be our main player because he plays in that position and he needs to take responsibility. Don’t forget that he has had an injury this season - he was out for three months and it’s not easy to come back after that. The people always expect a lot from you when you play for Man United - we know that this is normal. But he is still young and he can still improve. He showed character and personality. If you saw him in the last 10 minutes, he was fighting a lot for the team and helping the team.<br /><br />I think Chris Smalling was the main star. I think this is the best game for our fans because I know what this game means for them, especially when we knew that, if they <b>[City]</b> won this game, they would be champions and we didn’t allow them to celebrate in front of our supporters. I think it’s the most important <b>[game]</b> and for our supporters, it was the best way to show the pride and the best way to show how we fight for our club</p>

This attitude echoes the humble beginnings in his career, which he also discussed. In Serbia I played in the third division <b>[at Kolubara]</b>, which is like League One in England - probably worse. I earned £70 per month at 17-18. I had the opportunity to go Slovakia and I said: ‘Let’s try it’. There is an interesting story because an agent wanted to take me to a Serbian club and I was not happy to do so. He asked: ‘Where do you want to go then?’ I was sitting at a table with him, playing third division, and I told him: ‘I wanted to go to Manchester United.’ He was like: ‘What is he talking about?’ I was joking but it shows everything is possible.</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic concedes that Manchester United have put themselves under more pressure by failing to land a trophy in 2017-18]</b> When you don’t win one year, the next year there is always more pressure. This is football. When you play for Manchester United, it is a normal thing and we have to accept that and deal with that. When you win the trophy it’s different and you feel better but the most important thing is that we can look in the mirror and know we gave our best. The team was sad after the game <b>[FA Cup final]</b>. We know we deserved more but this is football. This is a final - everything can happen - so as I said we have to be focused on the next challenge. I think that we have improved this year. As you know, United last year were sixth. The year before that, fifth. So we improve, we are second. The only team who is better than us this year is Man City. Obviously, they play amazing football. But we are second and we are in the Champions League next year, which is the most important thing.<br /><br />We played 90 minutes’ good football at Wembley. I don’t know how it looked from the outside but I felt in the first half we also played football. Obviously it was better in the second half but in the first half we controlled the game, though we conceded a goal from one mistake. Some games we played much better in the second half. We have to try to play 90 minutes in the same way</p>

  <p><b>[Matic waiting on Mourinho’s response to red card as he prepares for rest]</b> We will see on Monday! I think the first yellow card was a clear yellow card. The second one, I’m not sure. It was a foul but I’m not sure if it was a yellow card. It’s OK. I accept the decision of the referee and I will have one game to rest.<br /><br />He said we had to concentrate and that we could not allow them to create the chances because if they score a goal we are in trouble. We knew that. But they have quality, they have confidence because they won the first four games. They scored and after that it was difficult for us. We had some counter attacks to finish the game but we didn’t score. We are happy. We are happy for this win<br /><br />{On Chris Smalling]&lt;/b&gt; I was surprised that he did not go to the World Cup because he has played for Manchester United regularly. I was surprised but it was the decision of the coach of course. Chris is great. As you see, in the box he is always dangerous. Last season he scored some important goals for us</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic admits that he was forced to play through the pain at Manchester United last season]</b> I’d had this injury for a few months and, when I went to America, in the first training session, I didn’t feel well and I asked the doctor to see what he could do. I had the operation in Philadelphia as, after the scan, the doctor recommended surgery as the only way to fix the problem. I feel good now. I could see I couldn’t give my best because this injury was serious. It was painful so I needed to fix it. Sometimes, you can play through the pain and I played the last few months of the season with the pain but I think, for this season, it was better to fix the problem. I didn’t want to spend time during the season fixing it as I need to be ready for the season that we have</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United forward Anthony Martial can become one of the best players in the Premier League]</b> Anthony is a great player and he needs to understand that. He is still young and I think if he continues to score in the next games he will get that. If he reaches his top level he can be one of the best players in the league for sure. Sometimes I don’t think he understands how good he is. Sometimes he is quick, he is good with the ball, he can run. He has everything that a Manchester United football player needs. Sometimes I don’t think he understands that. If I had his ability with the ball and I was as quick as him then I wouldn’t pass to anyone and I would score every game!<br /><br />To be serious, he does need more confidence and this comes with results. When you don’t have results it is very difficult for players to have that high confidence. If we can get results over the next few games and improve as a team he will show that he is very important for us. The manager speaks with him about it. I have told him once. But he is a great person and a great guy and I am happy for him that he is scoring. It is great. The quality is there, and he just needs to be more consistent. I am glad we have him in the team. In football and in life you have difficult times and you have to get back on track and that is exactly what he is doing</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic has explained his reasons for declining to wear a poppy on his shirt]</b> I recognise fully why people wear poppies, I totally respect everyone’s right to do so and I have total sympathy for anyone who has lost loved ones due to conflict. However, for me, it is only a reminder of an attack that I felt personally as a young, frightened 12-year old boy living in Vrelo, as my country was devastated by the bombing of Serbia in 1999. Whilst I have done so previously, on reflection, I now don’t feel it is right for me to wear the poppy on my shirt. I do not want to undermine the poppy as a symbol of pride within Britain or offend anyone, however, we are all a product of our own upbringing and this is a personal choice for the reasons outlined. I hope everyone understands my reasons now that I have explained them and I can concentrate on helping the team in the games that lie ahead..</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic is adamant that Jose Mourinho is good for English football]</b> He’s a great person. He’s a different man outside the job and off the pitch. He does have a lot of pressure though because everyone expects him only to win. When we don’t win everyone is waiting to see his reaction. He likes to win and when we don’t win we are hiding from him at the training ground. He’s happy when he’s winning but when we lose, like every manager, he wants us to do better. He tries to find a way to be winning as soon as possible. One thing is for sure that since he’s been in the Premier League he’s changed a lot in the league. The Premier League has become more interesting with him<br /><br />We are all united. When we win we are all together and when we lose we are all together. It’s not true what the media are writing. We are working hard and we will continue like this. The Manchester United name obligates us to be professionals and try to turn the situation as soon as possible and this is exactly what we are doing.</p>

We have to stop them in their attacks, there is a way to do it and the manager knows that. We will prepare for the game. I expect a hard game but, in a derby, everything is possible, and we will be ready for that.<br /><br />I think that we believe more that we are a good team, we have also improved and mentally we are stronger.

This is the way to fight so if we play like this for the next season then we will be one of the teams who is going to fight for the title<br /><br /><b>[On <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> He’s always positive.

When you finish the season with a trophy it’s different. We will try to do that. We have the Champions League to play and the FA Cup and Man United always wants to do the best that is possible. We want to be in the top four and we will try to do everything. We have the quality to do that<br /><br />We didn’t play badly against Arsenal. We created a lot of chances, we played some good football. But this is the Premier League. Every team has quality and we cannot win all the time.

If anyone is to blame for this it’s me. When you win the battle in midfield it’s easier to play. We didn’t do that today.<br /><br />It’s shameful. We have to look for the mirror, everyone has to see where he made mistake and what he must do better. The more guilty are the more experienced players and in this case it’s me.

When you are one of the best goalkeepers in the world people talk so much about his mistakes. When a goalkeeper at a ‘smaller’ club makes a mistake, its spoken about for one or two days, but one of De Gea’s mistakes is being spoken about for seven days. I’m very confident that this mistake won’t affect his career. He doesn’t read newspapers. He is one of the best goalkeepers in the world and will be for years to come. I am very happy to have him in the team. He is a great guy, a great goalkeeper, and is probably the best player at United over the last four or five years. He is very focused on his job and is a good character. It’s good to have people like him in the dressing room<br /><br />We have to be focused on our games and not to think about Chelsea and Arsenal. We know that the chances are very small, but we have to go until the end.

The next game is always the most important, so when the fixtures come out, the most important is the first game, so you are focused on your first game.

I’m happy that our strikers are in good condition, tonight Anthony was man of the match, every chance he had went in. Let’s see in the future what he can do for us. But I’m happy for him. Congratulations to him<br /><br />I think it’s always good play with top players. Not only them, we’re lucky we have top players in every position. So tonight I played with Bruno and Paul, I think we did well, it was good there, I’m sure in the future we can improve a lot together, and also with Scott <b>[<a href="scott-mctominay.html">McTominay</a>]</b> and <a href="fred.html">Fred</a>, whoever plays with us; I’m happy with the team performance and the way we controlled the game. I think we had control during all 90 minutes, of course we knew they were going to have some dangerous counter-attacks because tactically they play well. We analysed them very well, we treated them with respect, I’m so happy with the team performance, 3-0 against a team who creates problems for every team in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> midfielder Matic defends Novak Djokovic for hosting tennis tournament which spread coronavirus]</b> People need to understand that the situation in Serbia was better than here. The country allowed everyone to do whatever they want, everything was open, the shopping centres and the restaurants. So, they started to live normal lives because our country was closed for three months completely. You were not allowed to walk on the street, you couldn’t leave your home, so it was different than <b>[in England]</b>. But when they opened, they said, ‘You are more than free to do whatever you want’. Before that tournament, there was a game with 20,000 people and nobody said anything about that. I just wanted to say that it is not his fault that he made the tournament. He just wanted to help the players play competitions. I don’t see that he <b>[did]</b> something wrong</p>

  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic positive about his ‘soldier’ role in <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>’s squad]</b> I always try to be professional and give my best when I am on the pitch, it doesn’t matter if it is training or a game. I’ve played football for a long time already and this situation is normal, sometimes you don’t play and the coach doesn’t see you as a first option. You can accept it or not but you have to be professional. You have to work hard, wait for your chance and use it. This is exactly what I did. Now the situation is different, the coach trusts me more. I’m a soldier and I wait for the instructions from my coaching team. To be honest, when you don’t play of course you think about everything but in my head, I always try to be positive. I always believe in my quality and I know if work hard my time is going to come again<br /><br />I’ve followed him for a long time because I played in the Portuguese league at <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>. I knew he would bring quality for us. He played for a big club with a lot of pressure to win, but I didn’t think he would adapt so quick. From the first minute in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> he made the difference. I’m happy for him and happy we have him in the team. He’s playing in the position where he needs to make the difference. He has all the ability to be the leader on the pitch<br /><br />Scott knows that I am always there for him if he needs some advice, he is still learning. I am happy with how he has progressed, he is improving. I’ve said already a few times that he will be a very important player for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> in the future</p>
