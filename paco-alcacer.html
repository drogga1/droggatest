I’m very happy. To tell people that I played with Leo, Luis and Ney is something that few players can say. The images that I can have with them will be very nice for the future<br /><br />Did I ever think about leaving Barca? Never, and I don’t plan to leave. The club took a chance on me and I’ll try to be here for a long time, working hard and improving as a player. A feeling of relief after my first goal? Yes, because I’d been on a fairly long run without one. The result and opponents didn’t matter. I needed to score because ultimately it was a release, not only for me but also any striker on such a negative run. I had to score, even if it was with my backside!</p>

I left in order to feel happy playing. The decisions I was able to make, I made. The conversations with <b>[coach]</b> Ernesto <b>[Valverde]</b> were private and I decided to look for minutes elsewhere.

  <p><b>[Paco Alcacer says he feels important again since joining Borussia Dortmund]</b> Since joining BVB, I’m finally feeling important again. I’ve played very little in Barcelona for the past two years. That’s why I understand that I haven’t always played from the start so far. Every footballer wants to play. I’m not happy when I’m sitting on the bench. But if we’re having so much success as a team, it’s OK. Because getting a title is always great. I only have one thing in my head: I want to score goals and help the team. This has worked perfectly in the past few months. Actually, I’ve been a little surprised with the ease that I’ve been scoring the goals with. But I have to say that my teammates have a big part in it. They often make it easy for me to score.<br /><br /><b>[Alcacer has made just 12 appearances in the league]</b> If you suddenly have to play every three days after not playing regularly for two years, that’s a big change for the body. I was aware of that. But I work with the coaching team to get my body up to 100 per cent efficiency. I want to avoid injuries in the second half of the season</p>

If he improves and picks up other qualities, he will be one of the best in the world<br /><br /><b>[Asked if this is the most confident he’s felt in his career]</b> It could be. The numbers suggest that. I feel confident and comfortable with my teammates – which is a plus on the pitch. It’s a question of confidence and feeling comfortable on the pitch. Minutes are important.
