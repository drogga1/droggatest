  <p><b>[Paco Alcacer on loan at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> from Barcelona]</b> I decided to look for minutes away from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. After having two years with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and not playing an important role, not everything went as I’d hoped. I’m happy now, in the end it comes down to decision making</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Dortmund’s Paco Alcacer says he is ‘too ambitious to sit on the substitutes’s bench’ as he looks to increase he is game time at the Bundesliga club]</b> I do not like to sit on the bench because I’m a very ambitious person. I’m a happy, funny person, but when I’m sitting on the bench, I do not like anything anymore, then I’m a complicated guy, which I do not like<br /><br />We were so close to winning a big title - and in a relatively easy way. Football has its own funny moods and we did not make it. I try to help with my goals and that we can climb one more place in the table</p>

  <p><b>[Paco Alcacer believes that his <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> team-mate <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> has what it takes to become one of the world’s best]</b> He’s a kid, 19 years old, with great quality. If he keeps his head, he will be a top player. There’s uncertainty at that age, but as a player and a person in the dressing room, he’s top. If he improves and picks up other qualities, he will be one of the best in the world<br /><br /><b>[Asked if this is the most confident he’s felt in his career]</b> It could be. The numbers suggest that. I feel confident and comfortable with my teammates – which is a plus on the pitch. It’s a question of confidence and feeling comfortable on the pitch. Minutes are important. The treatment from my teammates, having an understanding with them, that’s also key<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he would celebrate against his former club if he scores, Alcacer wouldn’t rule the possibility out]</b> I wouldn’t know what to do, because at the end of the day you’re really happy <b>[to score]</b>. A lot of people behaved really well with me there, a lot of people also said things that you don’t like, but the respect was always there</p>

  <p><b>[Paco Alcacer has accused several people of treating him badly at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> ahead of a Champions League reunion with his former club]</b> I’ll decide in the moment. I have respect for many people there. Many people behaved very well with me but many people behaved very badly. My team-mates and the fans treated me well. As in any job, if people trust you, you give your best, and if they don’t trust you, you don’t give it. It’s very important for me to see those signs of trust and in the end many people did not show it<br /><br /><b>[Alcacer was asked about <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s influence at Camp Nou]</b> It’s clear that a player of that level is important for the team and for the club. You will always ask for his opinion and listen to him. Hopefully he will play next weekend, against Granada, and not against us!</p>

  <p><b>[In two years at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, Paco Alcacer scored 15 goals. he said, referring to a front three of <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a>, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, for whom he was the back-up]</b> I have the best striker in the world ahead of me, to the right the best player in the world and on the left the best in the near future<br /><br /><b>[Moments such as a hat-trick in just 30 minutes against Augsburg helped the 26-year-old produce a record-breaking number of goals from the bench as he ended the 2018-19 season with 19 strikes to his name, from 15 starts]</b> Since joining <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">BVB</a>, I’m finally feeling important again. I’ve played very little in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> for the past two years. That’s why I understand that I haven’t always played from the start so far. Every footballer wants to play. I’m not happy when I’m sitting on the bench. But if we’re having so much success as a team, it’s okay. Because getting a title is always great. I only have one thing in my head: I want to score goals and help the team. This has worked perfectly in the past few months<br /><br /><b>[On the other hand, with the likes of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, Suarez and <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> just a handful of the superstars that cast a shadow over Alcacer, he can be forgiven for perhaps not feeling ‘important’ during his two-year stint]</b> I do not like to sit on the bench because I’m a very ambitious person. I’m a happy, funny person, but when I’m sitting on the bench, I do not like anything anymore, then I’m a complicated guy, which I do not like<br /><br /><b>[Alcacer is not bitter over how his spell at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> transpired]</b> I don’t think I’ve lost two years. In terms of the number of minutes I had it’s clear that I’d have liked to play more, but I have improved a lot as a footballer and as a person<br /><br />I have respect for many people there. Many people behaved very well with me but many people behaved very badly. My team-mates and the fans treated me well. As in any job, if people trust you, you give your best, and if they don’t trust you, you don’t give it.
