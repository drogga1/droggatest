  <p><b>[Stevan Jovetic Will Emerge From His Slump With Fiorentina]</b> I do not like talking about players this way, in the end everyone always speaks of a crisis. Any player can have ups and downs. <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> have a great prospect <b>[in Jovetic]</b>, but it’s normal that at times he does not play well<br /><br /><b>[The latest reports out of Florence suggest that coach <a href="cesare-prandelli.html">Cesare Prandelli</a> will adopt a rotation system between winter signing Mario Bolatti and Jovetic for future matches]</b> Of course this is to be expected. <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> have a large squad and <a href="cesare-prandelli.html">Prandelli</a> will adopt the best players for each chosen strategy</p>

  <p><b>[CSKA Moscow midfielder Milos Krasic is tired of waiting for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> to make an offer to the Russian club, the player’s representative in Italy has revealed]</b> For now we have no news from <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. The player would be happy to come to Italy. He is also wanted by Fenerbahce, who continue to press on. Now let’s see what the boy decides to do, because he cannot wait forever</p>

  <p><b>[Vlado Borozan says both <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> and Fenerbahce wanted the Serbian international, but it was the 25-year-old’s will to join the <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> that prevailed]</b> Krasic was requested by two clubs prior to Juventus: Fenerbahce and <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. But it was the player who decided to join <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, and he did everything he could to go there. <b>[Inter director Marco]</b> Branca was clear that he held Krasic in high esteem, but the side had other ideas this season, and pulled out of the race early. Krasic was the protagonist, giving a big hand in his negotiation. <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> had a bad last season, just like Diego, but Wolfsburg has done very well to agree to personal terms with him. The German side won’t sell anyone - not even <b>[Edin]</b> <a href="edin-dzeko.html">Dzeko</a> - and will engage Diego</p>

  <p><b>[Branislav <a href="branislav-ivanovic.html">Ivanovic</a> Won’t Leave <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> For Juventus]</b> There is nothing true regarding contact between <a href="branislav-ivanovic.html">Ivanovic</a> and <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. It’s a rumour that has come out without foundation. Maybe people linked <a href="branislav-ivanovic.html">Ivanovic</a> with <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> as one of my colleagues is Milos Krasic’s agent. <a href="branislav-ivanovic.html">Ivanovic</a>’s deal expires in 2011, but he is about to renew with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, and so I don’t think he will move. That’s for sure.</p>

  <p><b>[Milos Krasic will stay at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> even if Luigi Del Neri is replaced by Antonio Conte]</b> He is perfectly suitable for the tactics of <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>. I never doubted that Krasic could leave this summer</p>

  <p><b>[Milos Krasic’s agent says client is likely to leave <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in January]</b> I think by the end of the January transfer market he will have left. <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> want him preferably to go abroad. Right now I’m open with almost all teams to become involved, but there are absolutely no advanced negotiations. The signs of his departure have been clear for a while since he is not in <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>’s plans. A player like Krasic cannot be kept on the bench</p>

  <p><b>[Milos Krasic could leave <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in the summer after failing to fit in coach <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a>’s system]</b> In <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a>’s system, the wingers must also help out in defensive duties and Krasic does not have these characteristics. He has become unrecognisable at <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> because the problem is tactical. He is still a great player and in June we will see where he will play next season. Krasic has a lot of interested clubs, not only in Italy, so I do not think he will have a problem finding a good club</p>

  <p><b>[Borozan, though, refused to give any indication as to where Milos Krasic is likely to end up in the summer, despite heavy speculation that the 27-year-old is bound for England]</b> Krasic will certainly leave at the end of the season. We’re talking too much about Krasic at this moment in time. Let’s just wait until the end of the season</p>
