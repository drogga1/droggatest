  <p><b>[Sevilla midfielder Vicente Iborra says Leicester deserve respect in the sides’ Champions League last-16 tie because they won the Premier League last season]</b> The tie is at 50 per cent and we will respect our rival, despite their inconsistent season. They are suffering down at the bottom, but we shouldn’t forget that last season they achieved something of real value when they won the Premier League. They deserve our respect.<br /><br />Emery gave us many good things. He gave us the ambition, the winning mentality, the idea of never giving up until the match is over. There is still an important group of players from when he was here. They know the philosophy of the club, the importance of the dressing room, and we are working to get to where we want to be<br /><br />We are really excited that this moment has arrived. We are aware of how difficult it is going to be, but it’s a special opportunity and we want to take advantage<br /><br /><b>[Argentine coach Jorge Sampaoli took over from Unai Emery in the summer]</b> I think the important thing is the results. At the start of the season we had a new coach with a new philosophy and new players and those conditions meant we didn’t have an identity to start with, but the results helped us to keep working and allow us to get accustomed to the new philosophy<br /><br />What I want is to play and I don’t mind where. I’m always ready to play wherever the coach sees fit and I work to take those opportunities when they come around. I work to stay in the team on merit<br /><br /><b>[A move to Sunderland]</b> I think I have grown along with the club since I arrived. I have won titles, I feel loved and I feel valued. My family are happy and I believe I am at a top club. There were many reasons to stay<br /><br />If I had one wish for this season it would be for us to win a trophy</p>
