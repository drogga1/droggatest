  <p><b>[Beckenbauer thinks Müller’s treetrunk legs may be the secret of his success]</b> He can turn so quickly. I think it might be his body. He has such short, powerful legs. I played against him in practice many times. We all knew about his moves, but we could never do anything about it. No player in the world has his ability to score. He doesn’t need any room, he can score when he’s surrounded by opponents. He just smells a goal coming</p>
