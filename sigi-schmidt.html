  <p><b>[Seattle Sounders coach Sigi Schmidt on his first visit to Azteca Stadium, speaking ahead of his club’s trip to Mexico City next year to take on 2015 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Club World Cup participants <a href="club-america.html">Club America</a> in the <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> Champions League quarter-finals]</b> So there were five of us and we had four tickets. We had a box, so you were allowed to park your car in the stadium. We couldn’t go into the stadium with five, so we drew straws and I got the short straw so I had to get into the trunk of the car and we drove in. It was 1983, and we were watching the opening game between Australia and Mexico at the Under-20 (FIFA Youth World Championship). When we got inside, they banged on the trunk and let me out, thankfully, so that I could see the game. I promised myself then and there that the next time I went to Azteca, I’d be on the field. Ten years later, I was on the field standing next to (former U.S. national team coach) Bora (Milutinovic) as an assistant. I’m hoping this trip to Azteca is much better to that one</p>

  <p><b>[After Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid replaced Giovani dos Santos with Servando Carrasco at halftime and shifted Jonathan dos Santos into his brother’s playmaking role]</b> We played him in Gio’s role and he actually played very well in the second half in that role. He’s active, and he’s busy. He makes those final runs as well. You know that might be a role that we have to look at as we move forward.<br /><br /><b>[On Giovani dos Santos]</b> We really don’t know right now the extent of the injury, so we’ll have to see. It’s not something where we caught it late. I think we caught it pretty early and so we erred on the side of precaution by taking him out at halftime</p>

  <p><b>[New system offers potential glimpse into LA Galaxy’s future with Zlatan Ibrahimovic]</b> We’re going to have to try and figure that out. I didn’t want to think about that a whole lot <b>[before Saturday]</b>. I wanted to make sure we had this game plan right. I’ll probably throw some lineups or different formations on the board and see what I think works and what makes sense.</p>

  <p><b>[Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s arrival presents a big challenge for Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid]</b> I think players are players. They want to hear when they are doing well, and they want you to be honest if they’re not doing well. They look for praise at the right opportunities, and they’re willing to take criticism at the right places. All the big names, they have one thing in common for me and that is they have a tremendous desire to win, and their ego to accomplish that is very strong. Zlatan’s going to be no different than that, but all the other guys <b>[I’ve coached]</b> as well. Luis Hernandez, an Obafemi Martins, Freddie Ljungberg, they all wanted to win and were all very, very competitive. So you build upon that.<br /><br />He’s Zlatan, he’s very confident in his abilities. That’s what’s made him the player that he is, and he’s ready to go, so we’ll see how he feels<br /><br />We feel pretty good about his injury, it’s just he hasn’t had games in a while so it’s maybe going to take him a little bit to get his game rhythm again. But obviously we’re early in our season. He’s a world class player, a player who gives us size up front, but he also has the ability to score goals, which is an important quality. Also, his experience, and his winning attitude that he has in leading teams to victory. Knowing how to win is an acquired skill</p>

  <p><b>[The LA Galaxy welcome Los Angeles FC to StubHub Center on Saturday]</b> Chivas never probably achieved that full status of a rival, but this is definitely something that’s there now <b>[with LAFC]</b>. I think the front offices are competing against each other, the academy teams are already competing against each other, and now it’s a chance for the first teams to go after it as well. I think it’s good for the league, for the sport and it’s great for the city of Los Angeles.<br /><br />It’s just a matter of us holding onto the ball when we have the ball. They can’t be dynamic if they don’t have the ball. They’re a team that’s predicated on their speed up front. Those four guys go forward and the other six sort of keep their back safe in defense. They’re not shy about letting you have the ball and looking for their chances to counter<br /><br />It’s a challenge, I think challenges are what we all live for. Having a rival in the city is fantastic for the city because it forces each club to maintain a higher standard than if there was no rival, so having that rivalry is great</p>

  <p><b>[Ibrahimovic’s new coach noticed the joy with which his new player seemed to embrace training]</b> I’ve seen it in other players, that appreciation for the game after you’ve been away from it. A really good example was Chad Marshall when we were in Columbus together. We shut him down for the last three or four months of the season <b>[due to concussions]</b> and I asked him what do you think, and he said ‘I really love this game’. Sebastian Lletget is another good example. When it gets taken away, you miss it and it’s something you really appreciate after going through something like that. If you got hurt and you didn’t miss it then it’s probably time to hang it up.</p>

  <p><b>[Sigi Schmid has stepped down as head coach of the LA Galaxy. Dom Kinnear will serve as interim coach]</b> I have coached at various levels of soccer in the United States for over 35 years, where I have dedicated myself to furthering the sport in our country. After careful consideration, I have decided to step away from coaching at this time, but would like to remain in the game. With six games remaining as the club fights for a playoff spot, I understand the timing of this decision is unfortunate. However, I believe this group can come together and fight for a spot this season under Dom’s guidance.</p>
