  <p><b>[Seattle Sounders coach Sigi Schmidt on his first visit to Azteca Stadium, speaking ahead of his club’s trip to Mexico City next year to take on 2015 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Club World Cup participants Club America in the <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> Champions League quarter-finals]</b> So there were five of us and we had four tickets. We had a box, so you were allowed to park your car in the stadium. We couldn’t go into the stadium with five, so we drew straws and I got the short straw so I had to get into the trunk of the car and we drove in. It was 1983, and we were watching the opening game between Australia and Mexico at the Under-20 (FIFA Youth World Championship). When we got inside, they banged on the trunk and let me out, thankfully, so that I could see the game. I promised myself then and there that the next time I went to Azteca, I’d be on the field. Ten years later, I was on the field standing next to (former U.S. national team coach) Bora (Milutinovic) as an assistant. I’m hoping this trip to Azteca is much better to that one</p>
