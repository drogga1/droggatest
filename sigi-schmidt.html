  <p><b>[Seattle Sounders coach Sigi Schmidt on his first visit to Azteca Stadium, speaking ahead of his club’s trip to Mexico City next year to take on 2015 <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Club World Cup participants <a href="club-america.html">Club America</a> in the <a href="concacaf.html">CONCACAF</a> Champions League quarter-finals]</b> So there were five of us and we had four tickets. We had a box, so you were allowed to park your car in the stadium. We couldn’t go into the stadium with five, so we drew straws and I got the short straw so I had to get into the trunk of the car and we drove in. It was 1983, and we were watching the opening game between Australia and Mexico at the Under-20 (FIFA Youth World Championship). When we got inside, they banged on the trunk and let me out, thankfully, so that I could see the game. I promised myself then and there that the next time I went to Azteca, I’d be on the field. Ten years later, I was on the field standing next to (former U.S. national team coach) Bora (Milutinovic) as an assistant. I’m hoping this trip to Azteca is much better to that one</p>

At only 25 years old, Perry is already an MLS veteran and will be a great addition to the LA Galaxy on and off the field.</p>

Big players have an impact on your team, whether that’s Zlatan or whether that’s <b>[Lionel]</b> Messi or a Neymar - guys like that have an impact on your team.</p>

  <p><b>[LA Galaxy look to rebound in 2018 while confronting a new crosstown rival]</b> People are always enamored with what’s new and LAFC right now is new. They’re building a new stadium. I think we understand that and we understand that maybe some of the attention in the city goes towards that but we’re also looking forward to that challenge.<br /><br />Obviously having another team in LA I think is fantastic for the league. It’s going to create a great rivalry, <b>[and]</b> I think the true competitive spirit within the two organizations and teams is there. Having been in Seattle, certainly the Seattle-Portland rivalry is fantastic and supporters on both sides of the equation are very dedicated to their teams and motivated in supporting their teams. I think we’re going to see the same thing in LA. I think the Galaxy is going to bring out the best in LAFC supporters and the LAFC supporters are going to bring out the best in the Galaxy supporters<br /><br />Our pressure is what we put on ourselves, what our expectations are for ourselves. Whether LAFC is in the market or not, our expectation would be the same. We want to be a team that makes the playoffs, we want to be a team that competes for championships and we want to erase the memory of last season, and that has nothing to do with LAFC</p>

  <p><b>[After Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid replaced Giovani dos Santos with Servando Carrasco at halftime and shifted Jonathan dos Santos into his brother’s playmaking role]</b> We played him in Gio’s role and he actually played very well in the second half in that role. He’s active, and he’s busy. He makes those final runs as well. You know that might be a role that we have to look at as we move forward.<br /><br /><b>[On Giovani dos Santos]</b> We really don’t know right now the extent of the injury, so we’ll have to see. It’s not something where we caught it late. I think we caught it pretty early and so we erred on the side of precaution by taking him out at halftime</p>

I’ll probably throw some lineups or different formations on the board and see what I think works and what makes sense.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s arrival presents a big challenge for Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid]</b> I think players are players. They want to hear when they are doing well, and they want you to be honest if they’re not doing well. They look for praise at the right opportunities, and they’re willing to take criticism at the right places. All the big names, they have one thing in common for me and that is they have a tremendous desire to win, and their ego to accomplish that is very strong. Zlatan’s going to be no different than that, but all the other guys <b>[I’ve coached]</b> as well. Luis Hernandez, an Obafemi Martins, Freddie Ljungberg, they all wanted to win and were all very, very competitive. So you build upon that.<br /><br />He’s Zlatan, he’s very confident in his abilities. That’s what’s made him the player that he is, and he’s ready to go, so we’ll see how he feels<br /><br />We feel pretty good about his injury, it’s just he hasn’t had games in a while so it’s maybe going to take him a little bit to get his game rhythm again. But obviously we’re early in our season. He’s a world class player, a player who gives us size up front, but he also has the ability to score goals, which is an important quality. Also, his experience, and his winning attitude that he has in leading teams to victory. Knowing how to win is an acquired skill</p>

  <p><b>[The LA Galaxy welcome Los Angeles FC to StubHub Center on Saturday]</b> Chivas never probably achieved that full status of a rival, but this is definitely something that’s there now <b>[with LAFC]</b>. I think the front offices are competing against each other, the academy teams are already competing against each other, and now it’s a chance for the first teams to go after it as well. I think it’s good for the league, for the sport and it’s great for the city of Los Angeles.<br /><br />It’s just a matter of us holding onto the ball when we have the ball. They can’t be dynamic if they don’t have the ball. They’re a team that’s predicated on their speed up front. Those four guys go forward and the other six sort of keep their back safe in defense. They’re not shy about letting you have the ball and looking for their chances to counter<br /><br />It’s a challenge, I think challenges are what we all live for. Having a rival in the city is fantastic for the city because it forces each club to maintain a higher standard than if there was no rival, so having that rivalry is great</p>

  <p><b>[Ibrahimovic’s new coach noticed the joy with which his new player seemed to embrace training]</b> I’ve seen it in other players, that appreciation for the game after you’ve been away from it. A really good example was Chad Marshall when we were in Columbus together. We shut him down for the last three or four months of the season <b>[due to concussions]</b> and I asked him what do you think, and he said ‘I really love this game’. Sebastian Lletget is another good example. When it gets taken away, you miss it and it’s something you really appreciate after going through something like that. If you got hurt and you didn’t miss it then it’s probably time to hang it up.</p>

  <p><b>[Sigi Schmid has stepped down as head coach of the LA Galaxy. Dom Kinnear will serve as interim coach]</b> I have coached at various levels of soccer in the United States for over 35 years, where I have dedicated myself to furthering the sport in our country. After careful consideration, I have decided to step away from coaching at this time, but would like to remain in the game. With six games remaining as the club fights for a playoff spot, I understand the timing of this decision is unfortunate. However, I believe this group can come together and fight for a spot this season under Dom’s guidance.</p>

  <p><b>[MLS coaching legend Sigi Schmid passed away on Christmas day at the age of 65]</b> On Tuesday, December 25, Sigi Schmid passed away at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles due to a personal health matter. Our family is deeply saddened by his passing and is taking this time to grieve the loss of a tremendous husband, father, leader and mentor. We also recognize how much Sigi meant to so many people across the U.S. Soccer landscape and around the world at different levels of the game. That community meant a great deal to him as well, and for that reason, it was important to us that we share the news of his passing. While we mourn his loss, we appreciate privacy during this challenging time and will not be issuing further statements.</p>
