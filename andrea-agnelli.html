  <p><b>[<a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> president Andrea <a href="gianni-agnelli.html">Agnelli</a> calls for VAR after accusing referees of bias against Italian clubs]</b> This isn’t about one or two points, but rather going forward in a massive tournament that brings so much money and prestige. We can’t allow these incidents to occur. For some reason, the vanity of the refereeing designator is trying to scientifically prove he is unbiased and keeps assigning referees who are against Italian clubs.<br /><br />Players make mistakes, so do referees, but this official completely lost control of the situation. A referee in Madrid for the quarter-final must have seen the first leg, realise the <b>[Paulo]</b> <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> red card was excessive and understand the various situations.<br /><br />The referee tonight was in total chaos. It’s a pity, the performance of the boys remains, we confirmed - as <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> did last season and Roma last night - you can come back from 3-0 down to turn things around. Incidents happen, the referee didn’t understand the moment at all.<br /><br />The most important thing is we have the technology, it exists and is in use, so we have to bring it into the Champions League. The referee tonight, when he sees it back, will be the most disappointed person here to realise what happened.</p>

He has received many bids, both as player and off-pitch. He knows that he has my full support for the future. I wish for him to enjoy Saturday at Allianz Stadium. I’d just like to say a massive ‘thank you’ to Gigi<br /><br /><b>[He admitted that his back operation in 2010 marked something of a crossroads in his life]</b> That was the turning point for me. The moment when everyone - quite rightly, let’s be fair - thought Buffon was at the end of the road. I found within myself, also thanks to them, the strength to say I want this great career to become a unique one. It meant working hard, suffering, sweating, even improving although I was 32 years old and had won the World Cup. Now eight years later, we have many more trophies and much more satisfaction compared to eight years ago. That was unthinkable back then, even for me. I am a person who is nourished by challenges and dreams. It’s not about achieving it, the essence of the sportsman and of life in general is to fight for that dream.</p>

When you start to use the VAR, you will never go back because you understand that this is the right way. I spoke to <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> president <a href="aleksander-ceferin.html">Aleksandar Ceferin</a> about this, he understands our position and told us that VAR will be implemented, but <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> are comprised of 53 Federations and an appropriate preparation is needed before they can proceed. We are very respectful with regards to <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s request that the referees are given proper training so they can maintain the standard set by the leagues that have already introduced VAR.<br /><br />We hope that next season <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> can be in a position to introduce the technology into the Champions League and Europa League. We are all working in that direction. When you start working with VAR and see that the margin of error is reduced by another five per cent, it becomes a path you must go down</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus president Andrea Agnelli has confirmed that the Italian giants made an operating loss in the 2017-18 season]</b> Within our club, we must be capable of significantly increasing our commercial revenue to consolidate our position at the top, both nationally and internationally. We will be playing our matches on Italian and European pitches but the commercial challenge is global. Internationally, your club must identify new forms of sponsorship, new opportunities for digital visibility and new ways to expand our business, with everything geared towards the same primary objective that this management group has always had: to provide the resources needed to maintain a winning team.<br /><br />Italian football is struggling to close the gap with other footballing nations but signs of rejuvenation offer hope, for the first time in years, that the future might be brighter. In the last few seasons, growth has been notably lower than elsewhere in Europe. In his first few months as president, Gaetano Micciche has imposed a management style typical of the business and finance world he comes from. The Lega Serie A can now legitimately assert its leadership, which is its natural role but one it lost during the dark years</p>

  <p><b>[ECA chairman Andrea Agnelli on FIFA’s new Club World Cup]</b> The main priority at this stage must be for stakeholders to engage in a detailed assessment of how the landscape of international football might evolve post-2024 prior to addressing specific competitions. FIFA’s decision to revamp its Club World Cup starting 2021 is one ECA cannot support.<br /><br />We have the responsibility to take decisions for FIFA and we took the decision… FIFA has decided and we are moving on. There was a vote and UEFA didn’t agree but UEFA understood the process we were going through. I understand the position of UEFA and Europe. The whole situation with the various stakeholders - the leagues, clubs and players’ trade unions - is much more complicated than in other parts of the world. But we’ve taken up the dialogue again. We’re in football, after all, and in football we’re not waging war against each other, so I’m confident that with UEFA and all European clubs we can have fruitful cooperation in the future</p>

  <p><b>[Massimiliano Allegri​ is not worried about his position with Italian giants Juventus]</b> My job is to be there in certain moments and make general evaluations. Ajax fully deserved to qualify, but at the same time we are aware that for the last five or six years we’ve been a stable presence in the Champions League quarter-finals and so want to keep that progress going, year after year, year after year. Ajax are a club who work on cycles and this is one that started a couple of years ago. They deserved it, not just over the one match, but throughout the two legs. Of course, this is a competition where a good half-hour can make the difference between a trophy and elimination. We’re about to win the eighth consecutive Scudetto and that is extraordinary. Juventus were 43rd in the UEFA rankings and are now fifth, so we have to evaluate the whole situation.<br /><br />We had done well in the first half, albeit a little too frenetic when we won back possession. Football is vicious, as you concede a fortuitous goal, the fear sets in, we got stretched out in the second half and should’ve had a different approach.
