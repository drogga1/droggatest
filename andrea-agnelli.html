  <p><b>[Juventus president Andrea Agnelli calls for VAR after accusing referees of bias against Italian clubs]</b> This isn’t about one or two points, but rather going forward in a massive tournament that brings so much money and prestige. We can’t allow these incidents to occur. For some reason, the vanity of the refereeing designator is trying to scientifically prove he is unbiased and keeps assigning referees who are against Italian clubs.<br /><br />Players make mistakes, so do referees, but this official completely lost control of the situation. A referee in Madrid for the quarter-final must have seen the first leg, realise the <b>[Paulo]</b> <a href="paulo-dybala.html">Dybala</a> red card was excessive and understand the various situations.<br /><br />The referee tonight was in total chaos. It’s a pity, the performance of the boys remains, we confirmed - as <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> did last season and Roma last night - you can come back from 3-0 down to turn things around. Incidents happen, the referee didn’t understand the moment at all.<br /><br />The most important thing is we have the technology, it exists and is in use, so we have to bring it into the Champions League. The referee tonight, when he sees it back, will be the most disappointed person here to realise what happened.</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli wants VAR in Champions League by 2019-20]</b> The support that the referees receive from the VAR is huge and that’s why the ECA wants it to be introduced as soon as possible in <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> competitions.<br /><br />In the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, 95 per cent of decisions were correct, while in Russia with VAR this percentage rose to 99.3 per cent. When you start to use the VAR, you will never go back because you understand that this is the right way. I spoke to <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> president <a href="aleksander-ceferin.html">Aleksandar Ceferin</a> about this, he understands our position and told us that VAR will be implemented, but <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> are comprised of 53 Federations and an appropriate preparation is needed before they can proceed. We are very respectful with regards to <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a>’s request that the referees are given proper training so they can maintain the standard set by the leagues that have already introduced VAR.<br /><br />We hope that next season <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> can be in a position to introduce the technology into the Champions League and Europa League. We are all working in that direction. When you start working with VAR and see that the margin of error is reduced by another five per cent, it becomes a path you must go down</p>

  <p><b>[European Club Association (ECA) chairman Andrea Agnelli believes the Champions League needs to change because it has become predictable]</b> We started thinking, some months ago, about what is it that we want within the ECA. What are the principles we want to go by? When I say ‘we’, I mean representatives from Poland, Greece, Finland, Portugal and also representatives from the big leagues. What we felt was, if we want to create a platform that allows for all clubs to succeed on and off the pitch, more European football is good for the game. Possibly the introduction of a relegation system to deliver sporting dynamism across Europe. If we think about the group stage of the Champions League, all of us can guess 15 out of 16 who will qualify for the last 16. The first two teams in each group of the Champions League are probably written. We want to find more relevant games. Much has been said about wanting to kill domestic leagues. No - we want to maintain symbiosis with the leagues. We absolutely agree that champions should have access to international competitions<br /><br /><b>[Agnelli believes football is now vying for attention against non-traditional competitors]</b> We will now have to tackle a shift in consumer behaviour. We’re looking at ‘Generation Z’, the new digital natives who are turning into adulthood. We have to look at what is the behaviour of ‘Generation Z’. We should seriously start to think that the competitors are not clubs next door but League of Legends, e-sports, Fortnite. I think those are going to be the ones who are going to be our competitors going forward. It is fair to say and assume that, in the quarter-finals of the two competitions <b>[Champions League and Europa League]</b> you have six to seven of eight clubs that come from the big five leagues. That is mainly thanks to the economic advantage they have.<br /><br /><b>[Maurizio Sarri’s side moved to the summit on Sunday with an impressive 2-1 win at nearest rivals Inter]</b> I think <b>[Inter]</b> are challengers. It was a good game on Sunday. It was a solid game. It is a domestic league. They are true in their values, when you have a stronger team it comes out over 38 games. The only exception is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, which is not as certain as in other countries. <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, a duopoly in Spain with <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. This is an element of why reform should be put in place <b>[in European competitions]</b>. I am happy with that <b>[domination for Juventus]</b>, I won’t complain too much about it. But is this what a fan wants to see? Total domestic domination. You will find five out of eight teams winning the big five that are the usual suspects in Europe</p>

If someone is happy where he is, it is difficult to move. We are very happy with <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Sarri</a>.

We can affirm that <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> are the biggest club in Italian football, but also one of the biggest clubs in Europe. Our growth is confirmed by our <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> ranking - we are currently fifth but have reasonable grounds to think about finishing fourth.<br /><br />When we look at the main clubs in Germany, England and Spain, we see that their turnover ranges from €489m (£423m/$552m) at <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Borussia Dortmund</a> to almost a €1 billion (£865m/$1.1bn) made this year by <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. These realities must be our benchmark. Our current level of turnover, excluding the transfer of players, is about the level of turnover that <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> had when I took over the presidency of <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> in 2010.
