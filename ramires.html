  <p><b>[Former Chelsea midfielder Ramires has revealed the truth behind his move to China]</b> I see a lot of people saying that I came to China just for the money, but that’s not true. If you look at the situation I was going throughat Chelsea at the time of the transfer you will see that I was <b>[Guus]</b> Hiddink’s last option in my position and this was frustrating me a lot.<br /><br />The situation was only getting worse and at that moment came the interest of the Chinese club. Jiangsu introduced me to a long-term project where I would be a key player, they offered me everything I could think of and more, and I decided together with my agent and family that this would be the best decision. The money issue weighed on the decision, I put it on the scale that I am already 29 years old and that an irrefutable opportunity like this may never come again. But the way things were happening at Chelsea was the main reason.<br /><br />In relation to the Brazilian national team, I do not think I gave up on my country, so much so that some Brazilians who are playing in China are constantly called up. I think it depends more on the evaluation of the coach of the Selecao than on where you play. It has always been a pleasure and a great pride for me to defend Brazil and I still have this desire to be called back. I see myself in total condition to help and I will try to continue doing a good job for that to happen<br /><br />I cannot deny that the special moment for me was when I scored the goal over Valdes on Camp Nou in the semi-finals of Champions League. The importance of that moment was so great that people asked me to talk about the goal and did not ask for the title. It was something magical, that was eternalised in my memory and in the memory of every fan of Chelsea<br /><br />I’ve had a lot of friends at Chelsea, it’s hard to talk about one or the other. It was a very good group to work with and I miss them all, especially Willian, Kenedy and Diego Costa, who were the ones who had the most friendship out of the field recently</p>

  <p><b>[Ramires is planning a return to Chelsea at some stage]</b> Chelsea? I’ll always have special affection for them and I want to play for them again before finishing my career. I know the doors of Stamford Bridge will always be open to me and that wearing their jersey again would be spectacular.<br /><br />There’s been lots of talk about Inter, but nothing concrete has come my way, at least until today. Everyone knows Inter are a great club and that playing in Europe again is a wish of mine, but for now I’m thinking about helping Jiangsu have a great 2018. Nothing else is going through my head right now</p>

  <p><b>[Ramires reveals why <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> was always destined to become a top manager]</b> I knew Frank very well. His understanding of positional play is one of the best I have come across and he was always paying attention to movement so it’s easy if you’ve got eyes for such things. He had passion for the game and he had love and the energy was there and when there is that in the eyes as well it’s easy. You just have to look at my goal against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> to see his awareness. I remember that I just ran in the direction of the goal to wait for the pass. The ball came and the rest is history. Sometimes, I have an impression that this goal is more remembered for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans than the title. I can’t find words to describe that moment. I felt truly blessed<br /><br />I miss London. I learnt so much living there and got along well with everyone. I miss <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> but the club and the fans will always be in my heart. I think that I got the respect of everyone because I always tried to give my best on the pitch. The English fans are thankful for that, and I admire it. It’s an honour for me to be part of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s history. When I arrived at the club, I was mentally ready for the league, I had stayed in Portugal and I think that prepared me for any surprises a young footballer might have when he moved to a new country. Normally when you move to Europe as a young player there are a lot of things you’re confronted with but because I had already settled in Portugal, I tapped into that experience and applied it when I arrived in England. I also have to say that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> had some really good players who welcomed new players and made them feel at home so that was really helpful</p>
