  <p><b>[Ramires is planning a return to Chelsea at some stage]</b> Chelsea? I’ll always have special affection for them and I want to play for them again before finishing my career. I know the doors of Stamford Bridge will always be open to me and that wearing their jersey again would be spectacular.<br /><br />There’s been lots of talk about Inter, but nothing concrete has come my way, at least until today. Everyone knows Inter are a great club and that playing in Europe again is a wish of mine, but for now I’m thinking about helping Jiangsu have a great 2018. Nothing else is going through my head right now</p>

  <p><b>[Ramires reveals why <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> was always destined to become a top manager]</b> I knew Frank very well. His understanding of positional play is one of the best I have come across and he was always paying attention to movement so it’s easy if you’ve got eyes for such things. He had passion for the game and he had love and the energy was there and when there is that in the eyes as well it’s easy. You just have to look at my goal against <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> to see his awareness. I remember that I just ran in the direction of the goal to wait for the pass. The ball came and the rest is history. Sometimes, I have an impression that this goal is more remembered for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> fans than the title. I can’t find words to describe that moment. I felt truly blessed<br /><br />I miss London. I learnt so much living there and got along well with everyone. I miss <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> but the club and the fans will always be in my heart. I think that I got the respect of everyone because I always tried to give my best on the pitch. The English fans are thankful for that, and I admire it. It’s an honour for me to be part of <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s history. When I arrived at the club, I was mentally ready for the league, I had stayed in Portugal and I think that prepared me for any surprises a young footballer might have when he moved to a new country. Normally when you move to Europe as a young player there are a lot of things you’re confronted with but because I had already settled in Portugal, I tapped into that experience and applied it when I arrived in England. I also have to say that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> had some really good players who welcomed new players and made them feel at home so that was really helpful</p>
