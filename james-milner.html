  <p><b>[James Milner admits it is time Liverpool put another bit of silverware on the board following a six-year trophy drought]</b> We want to win trophies - that’s why we’re all here. This is one that we can win. It’s the early stages and there are a lot of tough games to come, I’m sure. Everyone loves the FA Cup, whether you’re playing a top team like Everton or a lower-league side it’s never easy. It’s a fantastic competition to win and it’s time we put another bit of silverware on the board.<br /><br /><b>[On Virgil van Dijk]</b> That’s why he has been brought here. He is a top player and to step in like he did, into a big game like that, is the reason why he has come - to play in those sorts of games. He handled the occasion fantastically and defended well. He has already shown he is going to be a big threat in the other box. I’m delighted for him; you always want your debut to go well and it couldn’t have gone much better for him</p>

  <p><b>[James Milner boasting about bettering Neymar &amp; De Bruyne on Champions League assist chart]</b> He has told a few of us that over the last couple of hours, to be fair! He is a fantastic player. It doesn’t really matter how old he is, he is as fit as anyone and you can see that on the pitch in how much he contributes to the team. He was brilliant again at Porto. He’s got a lot of assists in the Champions League, so hopefully he can continue it.</p>

  <p><b>[James Milner says Mohamed Salah’s stunning efforts for Liverpool this season have left his team-mates tripping over awards in the dressing room]</b> Mo’s ridiculous. In the dressing room the other day, by his spot there were seven trophies on the floor, all his player of the months from someone. I’m stepping over them in my flip-flops. ‘Mo, will you move this! I can’t get to my spot. Do us a favour, will you!’.<br /><br /><b>[Milner can see why, with those claiming that Salah can be stopped by forcing him off a favoured left foot seemingly blind to the talent in front of them]</b> It’s easy to say that, but actually stopping it… You can say that about Messi for 15 years that his right foot is not as great as his left. There’s a great example of me when I went to press him <b>[Messi at Camp Nou in 2015]</b>, got him by the touchline, he nicks it through my legs and he’s gone, incredible. The best players find a way</p>

  <p><b>[James Milner has insisted that Liverpool are not thinking about a potential title charge this season]</b> That is for other people to talk about really. Obviously, you guys are going to discuss it. For us, we just want to start the season well and keep improving as a squad, and see where that takes us. We feel we can beat anyone on our day and we have proved that, but it is about having that consistency. We all know how difficult it is to win a League title, to have the consistency over 38 games. We will let other people talk about the challenges, and it is down to us to just go out there and perform, and get as many points as we can<br /><br /><b>[Milner has praised the club’s recruitment of Fabinho, Xherdan Shaqiri and Alisson Becker]</b> You look at the team that started the game <b>[against West Ham]</b> and the players on the bench - and even the players who were injured and didn’t make the squad. It is very strong and that is exactly what you need, all the best teams have that strength in depth and competition for places. It is not easy changing teams and learning a new system as well - and the way we play is different to a lot of teams, so it is going to take time. But they have settled in well already and I am sure they will get better and better</p>

  <p><b>[James Milner admits that Liverpool have to get over the line in their ongoing efforts to land major silverware]</b> A club like Liverpool is used to winning trophies, it’s expected. It’s something we expect as a squad and individuals; we all came here because we want to win trophies and be part of that. It has been pleasing to get to three finals, and two of those European finals, since I’ve been at the club but you have to get over the line ultimately and it doesn’t matter if you don’t. Those experiences are going to stand us in good stead hopefully for finals to come, going through that together and those experiences. The more finals you get to, not only do your chances go up of winning one, but you get that experience of being there. And you know how it feels to lose, ultimately. So next time you go there, hopefully there’s less pressure on you. As a team, getting to those finals has helped but we have to get over the line in one sooner rather than later.<br /><br />I think I missed one game last year through injury and that was the last <b>[league]</b> game of the season. The body is definitely holding up. I feel very good and very fit - I want to play every single game. Obviously that’s not going to happen, I’m sure, and you need to rotate to be successful with the amount of games we have. And with the quality that’s in the squad, I’m sure that’s going to happen. But as long as I’m performing every time I step onto the field and making it as difficult as possible for the manager to leave me out of the side, I can’t do any more than that. The biggest thing for me is that I want to be successful at Liverpool: to win trophies and for me to be a part of that and contribute to that</p>

  <p><b>[James Milner warns Liverpool attack will start to fire]</b> The amount of chances we are creating is pleasing and I think you would be more worried if you weren’t creating the chances. I’m sure they will start going in a bit easier soon. Sometimes you have to find a way to get a point or a win in whatever way you can and it was a positive point. There are still areas we can improve on but they are a top team, they have shown that at the start of the season and they showed that the other night. We knew it would be tough but I think it’s a good point at the end, and hopefully we can use this momentum from late in the game, scoring like that, to take into the last two games before the international break.</p>

We have had enough chances to get back into the game and we didn’t take them. Passing the ball wasn’t good enough. We need to win our games, it’s on our shoulders, we have some good sides to play and it’s in our hands but we will have to play better than we did tonight.</p>

  <p><b>[James Milner says Liverpool have not thought about the prospect of dropping down to the Europa League]</b> I don’t think that’s crossed anyone’s mind to be honest. Our aim is to get out of the group: get the result and get through. If we don’t do that we don’t deserve to be in the Champions League and we’ll take whatever happens from there - Europa League or whatever. At this moment in time we’re just focused on getting through the group<br /><br />You can’t really be surprised by that. If you are surprised by that you are a bit foolish. As a player you can’t do anything about it can you? You just still have to press but when you do that it doesn’t make it easier when you are on the front foot and trying to win the ball back. It’s then in the referee’s hands to give fouls if he thinks it is a foul. As players you know that in Europe decisions are probably given slightly easier than they are in the Premier League but that is part of European football. I am used to that now<br /><br /><b>[Asked why last season’s finalists have been below par away from home during the current campaign]</b> Red Star we didn’t play well, Napoli we conceded in the last minute. Here <b>[Paris]</b> we didn’t start well in the first 10 minutes but after that it was a pretty even game and we had chances to win it. That’s it in a nutshell. There are a lot of differences in European football: the style of play, teams building up slower, midweek games - there’s a lot of that goes into it. We’re not that experienced in the Champions League. We had a good run last year and that will definitely help us but we got through in the final group game last year and look where we ended up. You don’t see any of the lads panicking, we are comfortable we can go and finish the job at home<br /><br />It is what the best teams do, bounce back. We have a big game at the weekend so that helps but we knew it was a tough group all along, the Champions League is tough. But to have it in your own hands going into the last game and having a home game - we’d like to have it sewn up by now sure we would - but I don’t think you can ask for more. If you had said ‘you have to win your last home game to get through the group’ I think everyone would have been fine with it. It isn’t going to be easy, they <b>[Napoli]</b> are a very good team. At Red Star people said it was a poor result but I’d say it was more of a poor performance than a poor result, we didn’t play well enough. It was never going to be an easy place to go, it’s a tough group. To have the last game at home, if you don’t get the win you don’t deserve to go through</p>

It wouldn’t surprise me if the league lead changes hands a couple of times before the end of the season. We’ve just got to take care of our business. The last couple of games we haven’t played that well, but we’re still picking up points and that is a positive that we’re not losing games. There’s plenty we can improve on - which is nice. The preparation hasn’t been great with injuries. But I think as a squad we are dealing with that well and Ads <b>[Lallana]</b> has come in and done really well tonight, looked good on the ball. He’s a quality player so it’s good to get him minutes. Hopefully, we can get a few more bodies back and push on.<br /><br />I thought I might have been offside, but obviously you play to the whistle. I think Mo <b>[Salah]</b> had one after that where he looked on to me so they even out.

  <p><b>[James Milner laughs off title pressure after Liverpool slip]</b> Concerned?! Concerned being top of the league in February? No, I’m happy!<br /><br />That’s the key word, clear. We are clear at the top of the league in February. <b>[Talk of pressure]</b> is irrelevant really. You take care of your own games. If someone said we’d be three points clear at this stage of the season we’d have taken it. There were people saying at the start of the season that Man City are the best team the Premier League has ever seen and stuff like that, so to be just close to them is good for us. There’s been a lot of talk outside the dressing room but the boys have been pretty good at focusing on what we can control. There’s always talk outside the dressing room with Liverpool, I saw it last time when they were going for it with City <b>[in 2013/14]</b>. We’ve got to keep going, focus on our football and try and enjoy it<br /><br />Enjoy it? Is that possible, when the pressure is so great, when the longing is so vast? Yeah. Playing for relegation and livelihoods and people’s jobs, that’s pressure. I’ve been fortunate enough to win titles, I’ve been unfortunate enough to get relegated as well. I’ve experienced it, and these are the times you should be enjoying. There’s a long way to go, a lot can happen, and it wouldn’t surprise me if the league lead changes hands a couple of times before the end of the season. We’ve just got to take care of our business. The last couple of games, we haven’t played well but we’re still picking up points. That’s the positive side, we’re not losing games, even if there’s plenty we can improve on<br /><br />It’s a point gained, I think. It’s not an easy place to come, we didn’t play our best, but you’re going to have times in the season where it’s like that. You’re going to have poor runs. Our preparation for the last few games hasn’t been brilliant with the little niggles and injuries we’ve picked up. But hopefully at the end of the season we can look at it as a good point. I don’t think West Ham’s record against the top teams is too bad and they were always going to be up for it. We didn’t play our best and there were thing we could have done better. We had our chances, they had theirs. A point is probably fair.</p>

We’re very lucky with squad we have, the movement, link-up and understanding. I thought it was a good team performance. The crowd was immense. There’s not many better in the country when it is like that - its like a 12th man. It’s been a tough few weeks with players injured and ill. Georginio Wijnaldum was nowhere to be seen yesterday and then he produces a performance like that.<br /><br />We knew a clean sheet was important - we haven’t had one for a few games. Getting the first goal was important but we have done that in the previous two games and not won. We can’t rest on a 2-0 lead. Getting the third just killed the game. It was all about staying professional. If there were any point to prove then it was in our dressing room. We were good all over the pitch. We have to stay relax. There are still 12 games to go. We shouldn’t be thinking about it <b>[the title]</b>. It will go down to the wire</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool midfielder James Milner says his side were not good enough in their goalless draw against Manchester United]</b> A clean sheet is pleasing because it’s not an easy place to come, especially given the run they have been on. We made all the running but didn’t get as many chances as we would have liked. We had a few chances from set plays. The least we wanted was a clean sheet and see what happens, but we’re disappointed not to win the game as we go into every game to win. Hopefully, it’s a good point come the end of the season, but we will only know if it’s a good point after 38 games. I just don’t think we were good enough with our movement or final ball at times. We didn’t manage to open them up around the box as much as we’d like. United are a confident team and well organised so it’s never going to be easy to break them down. But, with the player’s we’ve got, we would have liked to have created more opportunities. There’s a long way to go. We have to look where we can improve when we have got the ball.</p>

  <p><b>[Fit-again <a href="alex-oxlade-chamberlain.html">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> and Joe Gomez are capable of making a big impact for Liverpool]</b> I think it’s important that we have everyone available. That’s why you need a squad when you have these sorts of injuries and stuff. Ox has obviously been out a long time and was playing fantastically well before he got injured, Joe the same. He’s been brilliant when he’s played this season and formed a great partnership with Virgil. And all credit to Joel <b>[for]</b> coming and stepping in when he’s had his own injury problems - he stepped in straight away like he’d never been away - and obviously Dejan is coming back and things like that. So it’s important with the amount of games you’ve got and the intensity of the run-in that we have the squad, and everyone’s going to have a big impact on the end of the season even if they’re not out on the field - just in training keeping that intensity and pushing people for their starting places. I think the more difficult it is for the manager to pick a team, the better it is for the team to achieve what we want to achieve<br /><br />I think so - I think it’s always difficult when you’re injured and with a long-term injury like Ox has had and Joe has had in the past as well, they have to be so mentally strong. It’s long hours, tough hours and you’re away from the team at times. When you are around the lads in the gym it’s important that you have that interaction and help where we can and make them feel part of the squad still and lift their spirits. We know how hard it is for them and how hard they’ve worked. Ox coming back, he had a little setback in the game before the international break but he’s back again already. You expect that when you’ve been out that long, but I’m sure he was loving being back out on the field again. We all know how good he is as a player so to get players like him back and fit and ready to go, it only gives the manager more selection problems and it’s great for us as a squad.</p>

In the past that consistency hasn’t been there but this year I think there’s been times where we haven’t played well and managed to get the three points, and that’s a sign of a good team as well. So over the last few years you’ve just seen us improve all the time step by step and hopefully we can keep doing that and be successful.<br /><br />It’s always tough after the international break no matter who you’re playing, really. We know how important every game is and you’re getting three points whether you’re beating Spurs or whoever. Every team’s tough to play and every team’s tough to beat, and you saw that at Fulham as well (when Liverpool won 2-1). They haven’t had the best of times and we just managed to get over the line, so we know how difficult it is, especially when the boys have been travelling all over the world, playing for different teams and playing in different systems</p>

Obviously it’s disappointing for them <b>[City]</b> and they’ll be pushing hard for the remaining games of the season. We can keep one eye on it but all we can do is concentrate on our games and we can control what our results are.<br /><br />That’s what we have to do and that’s what we’ll try to do. It’s not easy, there are a lot of tough games coming up thick and fast. We’re used to that, we do it all the time. We’ve been used to a game every three days for the majority of the season but like I say when there’s a bit of added extra pressure on them towards the end of the season and it maybe takes a bit more out of you mentally.

It’s a bit of a waste of energy, isn’t it, willing the ball into the goal and things like that. I can’t do anything about it. Maybe I’ll put my phone away for a couple of hours and check it after. Maybe I’ll go and grab some food or whatever.<br /><br /><b>[He needs a favour from United]</b> It’ll be the first time in my life! But there are three games left. United will be a challenge, but it’s the old cliché - any game is tough in the Premier League no matter who you play. To try and win a league title is not easy, whoever you play. Trust me, I know. Remember QPR <b>[on the final day in 2012]</b>? To beat anyone is tough when it is all on the line. We’ve still got some tough games ourselves, and we have to win those and keep the pressure up<br /><br />I think for a long time we have had our head around the fact that we just need to win all of our games. And if we do that and it’s not good enough, you have to hold your hands up and say ‘well done City’. We know they’re a top team and they’ve done it before. They have a great points total but so have we. It’s about encouragement from our side at how we have improved. Of course it’s frustrating that we could have one defeat all season and it might still not be enough, but all we can do is win the rest of our games and keep putting them under pressure<br /><br />To be successful, you need a good squad. It’s impossible to win or challenge for a Premier League without that, and it’s the same in Europe. The amount of games you play, the injuries and suspensions you will pick up. There’s competition for places everywhere, and that’s what you need. We have quality players throughout, and some who aren’t even travelling sometimes. Someone who hasn’t been spoken about much this season is Simon Mignolet. It’s incredible how he is around the training ground, he has the best attitude I’ve ever seen in my life. Every single day, he pushes himself and pushes Ali and the boys to improve. Nobody will ever speak about him in the press because he’s not on the field, but he’s been so important for us this season. That’s exactly what you need, great characters. Even if you’re not playing as much as you would like, the characters in the dressing room are still standing up</p>

He was giving me plenty in Spanish going down the tunnel at half-time as well. He was calling me ‘burro’. It translates as donkey but I think it’s also used in Spanish football as a general term for someone who goes around kicking people. I asked him if he was all right, but he wasn’t having it. I don’t think he realised I understood his Spanish. He said: ‘That foul you did, that’s because I nutmegged you’. I left him to it at that point and went into the changing room. Look, I’ve only got admiration for him. He has earned the right to say what he wants.<br /><br /><b>[The midfielder also noted it’s staying within the limits - his intention was never to hurt <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>]</b> The stuff he did in that game, stuff he has done his whole career, it makes him tough to play against.

I wasn’t the first and I won’t be the last. He’s an incredible player. But with players like that, you have to let them know you’re there and not let them have everything their own way. You just need to try to disrupt their rhythm. You don’t want to hurt him but it’s a physical game and, if he’s running the game, you try and knock him out of his stride. It’s part of the game, the mental side<br /><br /><a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s an amazing player and the special thing about the night was to turn it round against a team like that with the best player in the world in there and <a href="luis-suarez.html">Luis Suarez</a> and <a href="gerard-pique.html">Gerard Pique</a>, too.

I think there’s a calm around the club, both inside and outside, and people are confident we can get it done. But City are so good they’re capable of winning every game. The gap is not that big so we have to just keep pushing, and not worry too much about the title</p>

I’d be interested in going abroad and experiencing a new league, a new style of football, new lifestyle, too, but that all just depends on where it is and also on my family too. I think I’d be more interested in coaching than the media side. I see people going into punditry all the time but I think in terms of who I’ve played for and with and what I’ve learnt as a player it would be a shame not to pass that on within football to young players.

How he went about his business, he struggled with injuries but the amount of injuries you saw him play through as well which nobody would have ever known, was incredible. He would put his head on the line.

Virgil is probably a bit different to that. Maybe a bit more of a Rolls Royce, if you like, and he doesn’t seem to make too many tackles. He gets in the right spot and moves the ball away. Maybe he’s got a few more diagonals in his locker than Vinny had, although Vinny did have that as well. And Vinny had the greatest ball strike, I suppose, when he lashed one into the top corner!

  <p><b>[James Milner believes <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> ranks alongside the best defenders ever to have played in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>]</b> He’s right up there. I’ve been very fortunate to have played with some amazing centre-halves. You look at Rio <b>[Ferdinand]</b>, Jonathan Woodgate, <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vinny Kompany</a>, and Virg is right in there with all those guys. He reads the game so well, he’s quick, he’s strong, he’s good on the ball, he’s a good communicator and he’s deadly in the air. And his positioning is so good. You can see that after the game when you look at how far players have run. He’s run miles less than everyone else, even the other centre-halves, and you think ‘how is that possible?’ but it’s because he reads the game so well. He’s an incredible player for us, and a big part of what we do. The spine in the team is massive and he is obviously a rock in that defence.<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> put the clip out recently. The ball has come over his shoulder, he’s got a forward sprinting to close him down, hunting him down into the corner and he’s just knocked it over his shoulder, first-time, into my path. It was one of those moments in a game where I nearly stopped and applauded before I controlled the ball myself! It was ridiculous defending, but that’s the sort of thing he does<br /><br />Hopefully he’ll keep improving as well. But the players he has around him - <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a>, <a href="joel-matip.html">Joel Matip</a>, <a href="dejan-lovren.html">Dejan Lovren</a> - I don’t think their impact on him can be lost either. Virgil gets a lot of credit and rightly so, but look at the rest of the back four and the goalkeeper, look at the screening of the midfield, and look at the other centre-halves alongside him. The competition is massive in the team, but really Virg is there and it’s about who will partner him.<br /><br />I think any time you play a derby, whether it’s a behind-closed-doors friendly match at the training ground or a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> game, with or without fans, both clubs are desperate to win. We’re playing for the fans whether they’re there or not. We know how much it means to them. They’ve got to walk around the city and see each other regularly, so we need to give them those bragging rights. It’s straight into the deep end with a derby first up, but maybe that’s a good thing. There’s no time to ease yourself in, it’ll be flat out from the first minute and that’s what we’ve been preparing for. Hopefully we can start well and get back on the run we were on before we finished<br /><br />The fans are part of everything we do. The support they give us is amazing. But as long as the fans know that they are with us and that we are playing for them, that’s what matters. They’re still a massive part of what we do. We just need to do this small period without them. They’ve had a long wait and we’ll be pushing as hard as we can to secure that league title</p>

Those two times I was there we were never at the races - and that was everybody. That’s something I’ve learned from. This team has proved we can react well and go again after a disappointment. We came back from losing the Champions League final and we’ve come back from finishing second with 97 points, but it’s a new challenge to go again when you’ve been successful. Can we deal with that? Can we keep showing that hunger and keep playing in the same way?<br /><br />Being as good next year as we have been this year won’t be enough because City will raise their game and so will <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and other clubs. All these teams are pushing for the top and when you’re right at the very top everyone wants to take it away from you. We are now there to be shot at - and we have to be big enough to deal with that.

Not so much the record, I think it is just the responsibility of pulling on a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> shirt and going out with that responsibility to win a game. That is what is expected of us and you are always pushing to be the best you can. And how many chances do you get to reach that amount of points, it is incredible. You wouldn’t want to look back and think ‘Oh, we won the title but the last seven games we were poor, we didn’t get at it’.<br /><br />And obviously with not knowing how long we will get off once we complete the season, these next games are sort of preparation for going into next season as well. It’s so important that we keep getting up to speed and back up to that level, so we will be pushing as hard as we can to finish the season strongly. That’s why it’s so important to finish with as many points as we can but also take that stepping stone for next season.</p>

  <p><b>[James Milner exclusive: There from the start at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> To see one of the young lads throwing up on the side of the training field in one of his first training sessions, that sets the tone, you know what you’re in for. We had to adapt to that, there were a lot of injuries early on. People were saying, ‘You can’t do that!’ You could, you just had to get used to it. Straight away you saw the tempo and the intensity in that first game at Spurs<br /><br />It was ridiculous really, it wasn’t like we had played at a slow tempo under Brendan <b>[Rodgers]</b>. That journey started then with the manager’s methods and how he wanted us to play. You saw it come in bit by bit. One week the quality would be there and the next week we would be miles off it. That was a process again; the consistency started to come in and, eventually, learning how to win ugly and become a more rounded team<br /><br />All his training sessions are based around how we play. You’re reacting to the next situation, always being switched on. If you are doing a shooting drill there might be three balls coming in at once. You might be passing one and a millisecond later there’s another one coming at you to shoot. It’s a bit different to anything I’ve done before, it’s based around needing to be switched on at all times in a game. Defensively, as well, it’s not training man-for-man or two blocks of four, it is doing two or three jobs at once.<br /><br />It was what the manager needed at the time. There’s always going to be positions you prefer but you do what’s needed for the team. I suppose at that point I could have turned around and said, ‘No I don’t want to do that, I want to leave’.<br /><br />He came to ask me to do it in pre-season and my mindset was, ‘OK, how can I be the best I can be in that position?’ and I started to learn the role. A few of the boys were a bit surprised when we set up at pre-season training the next day and I was at left-back, but that was part of the fun<br /><br />Yeah I think so, you can see how he is around the team, but it’s also wanting to be part of that. Do you want to walk away from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and a manager of his calibre and not be part of something? I did the job as best I could and the year after that I don’t know what was in his mind. Maybe he thought, ‘Left-back, that’s him done,’ so it was a challenge to force my way back into the reckoning in midfield and I managed to do that<br /><br />There are times in a game where situations are different and you have to adapt to that, maybe take the sting out of the game if you’re ahead. Maybe put a tackle in to get the crowd up, to set the press and get the tempo up. I would never, ever go into a tackle to hurt somebody, that’s not something I would ever do, but you can go in and let them know you’re there. You can win the ball and be fair and put in a decent tackle, that’s still allowed, that’s part of the game.<br /><br />It’s changed a bit since I first came through as a winger, when the first tackle was free. The ball would come into my feet and I’d get launched in the first few minutes and there would be nothing more than a quick chat. The game has changed but getting in a big tackle or putting a press on, they’re important moments in a game and there’s a few in the team who can do that.<br /><br />It was great to be all together, that was special. Watching that game and getting over the line together with everything that has gone on. It’s taken a lot of effort, patience and mental strength. Coming back from the disappoint of the year before and everything you go through in a league season.<br /><br />It’s always special and I knew how big it would be for the club when I first signed if we could win the league here. We know how long they’ve waited, the amazing support we’ve been given at every single game, whether it’s been around the world or at home. You can see what it means to everybody<br /><br />You never know in football, what’s around the corner, but I just want to contribute and win as many trophies as I can for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and add to the great history here. I’m biased, but I think <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> will be a better place for <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> in it, and it will be weird to play against them next season<br /><br />It seems a long time ago since I pulled on that shirt, you look back at photos and see how big the shirts were back then. Plenty has changed since then, unfortunately I was part of the team that got relegated and they haven’t come back and recovered just yet. It would be great to see them back next season and their fans are incredible as well<br /><br />There are opportunities outside football when you’ve finished, sometimes you look at coaching or management and think that would be good. Then you see managers being sacked after eight games and think, ‘Nah, that’s not for me.’<br /><br />My thoughts change day by day, but I think it would be a shame to move out of football when I’ve been so fortunate to work with the managers and players that I have done. With the experience and knowledge I’ve gained from those amazing people, it would be a shame to leave the game and not give that back to people coming through</p>
