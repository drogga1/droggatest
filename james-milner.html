  <p><b>[James Milner says Lionel Messi called him a donkey during the first leg of their Champions League semi-final for a rough tackle that sent the Barcelona star to the turf]</b> He wasn’t happy. He was giving me plenty in Spanish going down the tunnel at half-time as well. He was calling me ‘burro’. It translates as donkey but I think it’s also used in Spanish football as a general term for someone who goes around kicking people. I asked him if he was all right, but he wasn’t having it. I don’t think he realised I understood his Spanish. He said: ‘That foul you did, that’s because I nutmegged you’. I left him to it at that point and went into the changing room. Look, I’ve only got admiration for him. He has earned the right to say what he wants.<br /><br /><b>[The midfielder also noted it’s staying within the limits - his intention was never to hurt Messi]</b> The stuff he did in that game, stuff he has done his whole career, it makes him tough to play against. If you try and stop him, you can’t be scared of being made to look foolish. I’ve done it. I’ve been nutmegged by him and it has been viewed a million times. I wasn’t the first and I won’t be the last. He’s an incredible player. But with players like that, you have to let them know you’re there and not let them have everything their own way. You just need to try to disrupt their rhythm. You don’t want to hurt him but it’s a physical game and, if he’s running the game, you try and knock him out of his stride. It’s part of the game, the mental side<br /><br />Messi’s an amazing player and the special thing about the night was to turn it round against a team like that with the best player in the world in there and Luis Suarez and Gerard Pique, too. There are not many teams in the world that could turn around a deficit like that with two of your star players gone. It was such a team effort</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> got stronger, setting themselves on the course for this decisive sixth European Champions Cup]</b> You don’t always get what you deserve in football. Ninety-seven points wasn’t enough, we lost out to an incredible <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> team. Last year, getting to the final. We got to another one this year which shows the heart, the balls, this team has to go and do that again, especially what happened in the semis. It doesn’t mean you’re going to win it but I think those experiences and disappointments we’ve gone through, it’s helped us become the team we are and deal with ups and downs and weather the storm like we did tonight. I think just being in European finals helps, you know what’s coming.<br /><br /><b>[He has been depended upon by <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> to deliver dressing-room pep talks]</b> We do everything as a team and we try to do it together, so everybody helps where they can. I’d be pretty foolish if I hadn’t learned a thing or two in the long time I’ve been playing so I just try and help, get the tempo set, and get us going. The job the manager’s done since he’s been here, the recruitment of the club as well, to build the team we have and get to back-to-back Champions League finals, 97 points in the league. You can see how we’ve improved year and year and hopefully we’ll keep improving because it’s such a young team. I’m an older guy and hopefully I can use that experience but there are so many leaders in this squad<br /><br /><b>[He was upsetting people again in the semi-final when clattering Lionel Messi, who infamously referred to Milner as a ‘donkey’]</b> Coming back against Barcelona, the experience and the ability of their team, going to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> away … there have been some amazing performances all through the year and that’s down to the team spirit that’s within the squad and that’s everyone together<br /><br /><b>[There were financial penalties too as the Reds were simply not paying as much as <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a>]</b> It’s felt like a journey since I’ve been here and we’ve had a few close scrapes so to get over the line is amazing and we’re going to enjoy this one. But we all know it blows over very quickly and it’s in the past and you have to go again. But it’s so important to get that first one as a group of players. I experienced that at City when we got that first one, scraped over the line against Stoke in an FA Cup final, and from then you have that belief and you know you can do it. Hopefully that can be the same but, first of all, we don’t want to think about that - we want to enjoy tonight</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> midfielder James Milner has revealed that the club are yet to open discussions regarding a potential contract extension]</b> As it stands, last year we spoke to the club and asked them if they wanted to do something and they said not at that time. We haven’t heard anything since, so that’s where we are at. All I can do is concentrate on my football and do what I can. But in terms of where I am with my contract, that’s what has happened up until now and I haven’t heard anything from the club<br /><br /><b>[Milner doesn’t see his veteran status as a barrier to success moving forward]</b> I’d like to think so. Everyone pipes on about my age and stuff I understand you are going to get that. There are three things to it: availability, fitness and performance level. Hopefully I am delivering all three. I am just going to keep concentrating on my football, keep contributing to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and be the best player I can be for as long as possible. I remember making my debut and how lucky I was to have senior players around me. If I can be half as good with these guys as the older players were with me at Leeds, I will help them as much as I can</p>

I thought so yes, it was a disgraceful tackle. We know it’s only a friendly, but I mean, you don’t see many red cards in friendlies, do you? Their guy said it is down to the referee and it’s a tackle and a foul, but it’s very disappointing. We <b>[responded]</b> in the right way. It is a tough one for the referee because you don’t want to use red cards in friendlies and it is a rare thing to see. It’s not easy to get hold of the game, you don’t normally see too many tackles <b>[like Gnagnon’s]</b> but it is a disgrace really</p>

  <p><b>[James Milner wants <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to get into the habit of winning trophies, with the UEFA Super Cup presenting them with another opportunity to claim major silverware]</b> I think it’s very important - I think you want to get in that habit of winning trophies. I think the Super Cup’s a special trophy to win because you’ve got to win a big trophy to get there as well, so I think it’s important. We’re playing against another top team, another English team, obviously, again. I think it’s a good way to start the season if you can win a trophy and it’s more silverware for the club if you can do that<br /><br /><b>[Milner expecting a tough test from a Chelsea side working under the guidance of club legend <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a>]</b> We know it’ll be a tough game and two good teams, early in the season which is never easy as well. Obviously there’s been a lot of players away from both teams in various tournaments in the summer, so it’s always a tough time of the season with players at different stages of their fitness and <b>[having had]</b> different <b>[amounts of]</b> time-off and things like that, but it’s the sort of game where everyone will click in straight away and be ready for it. And at that level, no matter how long you’ve had off, just because of what a good game it’ll be to play in and it’s a chance to win silverware and there will be a great atmosphere as well. It’s important to get a good start to the season and there’s nothing better than winning a game like that</p>

  <p><b>[Though far from their scintillating best, James Milner was happy to see a number of younger <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players stake their claim for more minutes and increase competition for places]</b> It’s always tough when you have a mixture of guys who haven’t played many minutes and a group of youngsters, but you could see the style of football we wanted to play. We lost our way a little bit in the second half, and didn’t keep the ball as well, but I thought it was a pretty solid performance. When you look at how good our squad is, it’s not easy for the youngsters to get to the level they need to be, but they’ve shown they want to get better and better. Everyone is pushing, and that’s what the senior boys need - competition for places</p>

  <p><b>[James Milner could have been forgiven for feeling his age as he lined up for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s Carabao Cup clash with MK Dons on Wednesday]</b> It shows how good they are to be anywhere near our first team. But then they’re expected to come in and play the way we play, which isn’t easy. I thought they all did very well. That’s what we’re there to do, to help. That’s the role. Hopefully, the more they’re with us and they train with us, they’ll feel more confident as well. It’s a fine line between knowing what’s expected and the standards and also giving them that confidence as well. Every player’s different so it’s about getting it right, but I think you can see <b>[with]</b> the boys there’s so much talent there, and their attitude is there as well<br /><br /><b>[It was the performance of 18-year-old Scouser <a href="curtis-jones.html">Curtis Jones</a> which caught his eye]</b> It’s tough to keep going. You see glimpses but there are so many distractions. They have to keep their foot on the accelerator and keep pushing as hard as they can. I’ve seen a massive difference in Curtis in the last year. He’s always had that ability but seems a bit more mature now; <b>[he’s]</b> defending well, getting his angles right when he’s defending. He needs that guidance, and that’s what I was saying about a fine line. There are times when you need to encourage but also times where you need a rocket as well. Like I say, over the last year I’ve seen that difference in him. I think he’s realised as well that if you want to play for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, that’s as important as the stuff on the ball. Not only that, he’s got so much ability and skills and tricks, and it’s about using them in the right area. I think he’s learning that more and more now - you don’t want him doing it on the halfway line, you want him getting hold of it in the final third. That’s where you do your tricks and get people in the box. I said to him before the game, ‘I wouldn’t want to defend you in the box, so get them in there and drive at them’. He’s got great ability.<br /><br /><b>[Milner was also enthused by what he saw from the Reds’ other young talents]</b> Harvey hasn’t been with us that long, but you see how good he is on the ball, very comfortable. But he impressed me with his closing down today and his reactions. <a href="rhian-brewster.html">Rhian Brewster</a> is an out-and-out goalscorer, you know that he’ll score goals. He’s got that hunger and he’s learning from one of the best there is at the other side of the game, <a href="roberto-firmino.html">Bobby Firmino</a>. He might not be able to do the Cruyffs that Bobby can do but he is ruthless in front of goal, he’ll get plenty of goals. Ki-Jana, another one, great talent, very comfortable on the ball and great for him to get a goal, fantastic, and hopefully that will give him that boost</p>

  <p><b>[James Milner believes <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s exuberant touchline antics are part of an authentic package that helps drive <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> forward]</b> The biggest thing with the manager is that what you see is what you get. He doesn’t have one front for the cameras and then he’s completely different with the players. He’s honest with the players and he lives every minute of it. He’s on the side and he’s bouncing around, he wants to be out there. That energy’s big for us when we’re down. He seems to judge it right, when to put an arm round the shoulder after a game. If we haven’t played well or something he knows what to say at half-time, or if you need a rocket he’ll give you that as well. He seems to judge those situations very well<br /><br /><b>[Now 33, ex-England international Milner is the most senior member of <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a>’s squad]</b> You’ve always got to try to improve as much as you can, so I’ll go into every training session, every day, with that mindset that you never know anything. I’m sure the manager’s learned things and he’s been in football a lot longer than me. I think if you’ve got the mindset where you think that you know everything, you’re going to be struggling</p>

The lads that are in there, I think it says a lot about the team and the job we are doing as a club and a squad collectively. There are probably a couple more who weren’t in there who could have been so that says a lot about the team and getting to back to back Champions League finals helps as well.<br /><br />We play as a squad, the team comes first, everyone does their job on both sides of the ball, individual awards are great, they come along but you have to be doing the business as a team and winning trophies as a team. You can see that is the mentality of the squad, the team always comes first. If there are individual awards to be picked up along the way that’s great and its recognition for the job that you’re doing but every single player would sacrifice individual awards for the team trophies</p>

It’s when he goes central, that’s when he’s dangerous because he can turn on the right or left.

That is what we want, everyone back, fit and firing and providing competition for places all over the field and that is what we have got now<br /><br />He was delighted in the dressing room, of course. Everyone can imagine what he has gone through with the long hours in the gym on his own and then even when he has come back, there’s been frustration over where he was before his injury and that <b>[lack of]</b> sharpness and how he felt on the field with the speed of the game and things like that. We have seen all that and try to help him through, so when he gets a night like this it is amazing and makes it all worth it.

And the manager has a tough decision to make every time he picks a team.

But it’s very hard to use VAR when you’ve still got opinions on the decisions and the atmosphere is being ruined. You score, there’s an explosion of noise and then it’s over to VAR. You wait. Is it a goal?<br /><br /><b>[Milner benefited from a late VAR intervention to convert a stoppage-time penalty in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s 2-1 win against <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester City</a> on October 5]</b> I had the experience of a penalty the other week. That was a new experience as they’re debating if it’s going to be a penalty. I think there’s use for it - if we can improve it. But football is a game of human error on the field and in officiating as well. They have a very tough job and I’m all for making their lives easier, but not at the expense of the flow of the game. If the VAR took away controversy I’d back it 100 per cent. But we’re still having discussions about VAR. I don’t think many footballers feel differently<br /><br />It’s so difficult to win the league. I’ve been fortunate to win it a couple of times and last year we were so close. We were flying. We were winning every week and felt we should be 10 points clear. And you’re still second. Last year, if you’d have said: ‘You’ll only lose one <b>[league]</b> game all season,’ I’d have snapped your hand off. But it wasn’t good enough. This season we have a team that can do it. I think there’s a calm around the club, both inside and outside, and people are confident we can get it done. But City are so good they’re capable of winning every game. The gap is not that big so we have to just keep pushing, and not worry too much about the title</p>

  <p><b>[James Milner says Van Dijk is more of a Rolls Royce than Kompany]</b> They are massive players.

How he went about his business, he struggled with injuries but the amount of injuries you saw him play through as well which nobody would have ever known, was incredible. He would put his head on the line. An unbelievable leader, a great captain with so many great qualities on that side, and rightly so, one of the greatest defenders to play in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. Virgil is probably a bit different to that. Maybe a bit more of a Rolls Royce, if you like, and he doesn’t seem to make too many tackles. He gets in the right spot and moves the ball away. Maybe he’s got a few more diagonals in his locker than Vinny had, although Vinny did have that as well. And Vinny had the greatest ball strike, I suppose, when he lashed one into the top corner!

  <p><b>[James Milner believes <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> ranks alongside the best defenders ever to have played in the Premier League]</b> He’s right up there. I’ve been very fortunate to have played with some amazing centre-halves. You look at Rio <b>[Ferdinand]</b>, Jonathan Woodgate, <a href="vincent-kompany.html">Vinny Kompany</a>, and Virg is right in there with all those guys. He reads the game so well, he’s quick, he’s strong, he’s good on the ball, he’s a good communicator and he’s deadly in the air. And his positioning is so good. You can see that after the game when you look at how far players have run. He’s run miles less than everyone else, even the other centre-halves, and you think ‘how is that possible?’ but it’s because he reads the game so well. He’s an incredible player for us, and a big part of what we do. The spine in the team is massive and he is obviously a rock in that defence.<br /><br /><a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> put the clip out recently. The ball has come over his shoulder, he’s got a forward sprinting to close him down, hunting him down into the corner and he’s just knocked it over his shoulder, first-time, into my path. It was one of those moments in a game where I nearly stopped and applauded before I controlled the ball myself! It was ridiculous defending, but that’s the sort of thing he does<br /><br />Hopefully he’ll keep improving as well. But the players he has around him - <a href="joe-gomez.html">Joe Gomez</a>, <a href="joel-matip.html">Joel Matip</a>, <a href="dejan-lovren.html">Dejan Lovren</a> - I don’t think their impact on him can be lost either. Virgil gets a lot of credit and rightly so, but look at the rest of the back four and the goalkeeper, look at the screening of the midfield, and look at the other centre-halves alongside him. The competition is massive in the team, but really Virg is there and it’s about who will partner him.<br /><br />I think any time you play a derby, whether it’s a behind-closed-doors friendly match at the training ground or a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> game, with or without fans, both clubs are desperate to win. We’re playing for the fans whether they’re there or not. We know how much it means to them. They’ve got to walk around the city and see each other regularly, so we need to give them those bragging rights. It’s straight into the deep end with a derby first up, but maybe that’s a good thing. There’s no time to ease yourself in, it’ll be flat out from the first minute and that’s what we’ve been preparing for. Hopefully we can start well and get back on the run we were on before we finished<br /><br />The fans are part of everything we do. The support they give us is amazing. But as long as the fans know that they are with us and that we are playing for them, that’s what matters. They’re still a massive part of what we do. We just need to do this small period without them. They’ve had a long wait and we’ll be pushing as hard as we can to secure that league title</p>

Those two times I was there we were never at the races - and that was everybody. That’s something I’ve learned from. This team has proved we can react well and go again after a disappointment. We came back from losing the Champions League final and we’ve come back from finishing second with 97 points, but it’s a new challenge to go again when you’ve been successful. Can we deal with that? Can we keep showing that hunger and keep playing in the same way?<br /><br />Being as good next year as we have been this year won’t be enough because City will raise their game and so will <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and other clubs. All these teams are pushing for the top and when you’re right at the very top everyone wants to take it away from you. We are now there to be shot at - and we have to be big enough to deal with that.

We know this will hurt <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> so they’ll come back firing - but it’s down to us to try and go again.<br /><br /><b>[Milner went on to insist that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are fully focused on finishing the 2019-20 campaign strongly with a view to setting a new points mark]</b> It’s definite motivation. Not so much the record, I think it is just the responsibility of pulling on a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> shirt and going out with that responsibility to win a game. That is what is expected of us and you are always pushing to be the best you can. And how many chances do you get to reach that amount of points, it is incredible. You wouldn’t want to look back and think ‘Oh, we won the title but the last seven games we were poor, we didn’t get at it’.<br /><br />And obviously with not knowing how long we will get off once we complete the season, these next games are sort of preparation for going into next season as well. It’s so important that we keep getting up to speed and back up to that level, so we will be pushing as hard as we can to finish the season strongly. That’s why it’s so important to finish with as many points as we can but also take that stepping stone for next season.</p>

We had to adapt to that, there were a lot of injuries early on. People were saying, ‘You can’t do that!’ You could, you just had to get used to it. Straight away you saw the tempo and the intensity in that first game at Spurs<br /><br />It was ridiculous really, it wasn’t like we had played at a slow tempo under Brendan <b>[Rodgers]</b>. That journey started then with the manager’s methods and how he wanted us to play. You saw it come in bit by bit. One week the quality would be there and the next week we would be miles off it. That was a process again; the consistency started to come in and, eventually, learning how to win ugly and become a more rounded team<br /><br />All his training sessions are based around how we play. You’re reacting to the next situation, always being switched on. If you are doing a shooting drill there might be three balls coming in at once. You might be passing one and a millisecond later there’s another one coming at you to shoot. It’s a bit different to anything I’ve done before, it’s based around needing to be switched on at all times in a game. Defensively, as well, it’s not training man-for-man or two blocks of four, it is doing two or three jobs at once.<br /><br />It was what the manager needed at the time. There’s always going to be positions you prefer but you do what’s needed for the team. I suppose at that point I could have turned around and said, ‘No I don’t want to do that, I want to leave’.<br /><br />He came to ask me to do it in pre-season and my mindset was, ‘OK, how can I be the best I can be in that position?’ and I started to learn the role. A few of the boys were a bit surprised when we set up at pre-season training the next day and I was at left-back, but that was part of the fun<br /><br />Yeah I think so, you can see how he is around the team, but it’s also wanting to be part of that. Do you want to walk away from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and a manager of his calibre and not be part of something? I did the job as best I could and the year after that I don’t know what was in his mind. Maybe he thought, ‘Left-back, that’s him done,’ so it was a challenge to force my way back into the reckoning in midfield and I managed to do that<br /><br />There are times in a game where situations are different and you have to adapt to that, maybe take the sting out of the game if you’re ahead. Maybe put a tackle in to get the crowd up, to set the press and get the tempo up. I would never, ever go into a tackle to hurt somebody, that’s not something I would ever do, but you can go in and let them know you’re there. You can win the ball and be fair and put in a decent tackle, that’s still allowed, that’s part of the game.<br /><br />It’s changed a bit since I first came through as a winger, when the first tackle was free. The ball would come into my feet and I’d get launched in the first few minutes and there would be nothing more than a quick chat. The game has changed but getting in a big tackle or putting a press on, they’re important moments in a game and there’s a few in the team who can do that.<br /><br />It was great to be all together, that was special. Watching that game and getting over the line together with everything that has gone on. It’s taken a lot of effort, patience and mental strength. Coming back from the disappoint of the year before and everything you go through in a league season.<br /><br />It’s always special and I knew how big it would be for the club when I first signed if we could win the league here. We know how long they’ve waited, the amazing support we’ve been given at every single game, whether it’s been around the world or at home. You can see what it means to everybody<br /><br />You never know in football, what’s around the corner, but I just want to contribute and win as many trophies as I can for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and add to the great history here. I’m biased, but I think <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> will be a better place for <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> in it, and it will be weird to play against them next season<br /><br />It seems a long time ago since I pulled on that shirt, you look back at photos and see how big the shirts were back then. Plenty has changed since then, unfortunately I was part of the team that got relegated and they haven’t come back and recovered just yet. It would be great to see them back next season and their fans are incredible as well<br /><br />There are opportunities outside football when you’ve finished, sometimes you look at coaching or management and think that would be good. Then you see managers being sacked after eight games and think, ‘Nah, that’s not for me.’<br /><br />My thoughts change day by day, but I think it would be a shame to move out of football when I’ve been so fortunate to work with the managers and players that I have done. With the experience and knowledge I’ve gained from those amazing people, it would be a shame to leave the game and not give that back to people coming through</p>
