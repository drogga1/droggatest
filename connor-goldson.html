<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Rangers defender Connor Goldson says he thought playing against Celtic would be equivalent to taking on Barcelona]</b> Obviously this is the first time I have played in a derby but when I came here in pre-season I heard a lot of people say how much better they were, how they beat Rangers 5-0 last season. I thought they were going to be like Barcelona. I am not just saying that. There was such a down in our football club of how big the gap was, it was like some of our players, that are maybe not here any more, were looking at them like they were nowhere near catchable. I am not going to say they are not a good team. They are a good team and we respect them. But I think we are getting closer and the players that the manager has brought in have been together for two, three months. We will get closer.</p>

  <p><b>[Hearts vs Rangers]</b> I’ve heard Tynecastle is one of the best atmospheres in the country. There is nothing better than winning away, making the home fans quiet and hearing our fans. This is a proper away game with a team that don’t like Rangers, we don’t like them and we go there for three points.</p>

  <p><b>[Connor Goldson is also relishing a potential showdown with <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> giants United]</b> Maybe it’s inevitable we get <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Hopefully, we do. We want to play against the big European teams and there’s a few in the hat. It would be good to test ourselves against the best. Rangers are about group-stage football. The gaffer reminded us at the start of qualification that we needed to deliver European football to Rangers. It’s a massive selling point to any player coming here. We all want to take this club to have as high a profile as possible and as players, we want to play against teams from different countries</p>
