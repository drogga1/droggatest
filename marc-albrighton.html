  <p><b>[Leicester City winger Marc Albrighton hinted that beating Sevilla in the Champions League was an even better feeling than winning the Premier League title]</b> It’s tremendous, everything about it. We had the belief from minute one that we could get a result and we have done that. To walk off that pitch knowing you’re through to the last eight of the Champions League is something else. It is very difficult to remain calm, but with the fans behind you and knowing the prize at the end it does get you through. Coming here, you see the fans around the ground as we arrive. All the flags and displays, walking out to that was brilliant. Through the game the fans were fantastic and after the game was something I’ve not experienced before, even probably when we won the league. That was special but this was a different place<br /><br /><b>[On Kasper Schmeichel]</b> I think Kasper is the one who won us the tie, I would say. The two penalty saves were massive. Especially the one tonight, came at a crucial time. We took a lot of heart, a lot of relief and a lot of confidence going into those last ten minutes</p>

  <p><b>[Marc Albrighton on <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a>’s form and their Champions League lifeline]</b> We have been given another lifeline. We could have been dead and buried by now. With some of the results that we have had, we probably should have been. We need to look at this as another opportunity. It is an opportunity for us to put things right<br /><br />I thought we were comfortable throughout the first half. We went one up and could have scored more but it was not to be. In the second half, it was just a lapse in concentration for 20 minutes - if that - and all of a sudden we are down in the game. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is unforgiving. You cannot afford to make mistakes. Whether you are playing a top team or a team down the bottom, you will get punished straight away. Just the way that we capitulated, none of the players or staff accept that. It is totally against what we are about and we are certain that it will not happen again. There are ways to lose football matches and that was not one of them<br /><br /><b>[Kasper <a href="peter-schmeichel.html">Schmeichel</a> apologised to the <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> fans after his error]</b> He did not need to do that. He has been an incredible goalkeeper, leader and team-mate for as long as I have been here. He has saved us so many points over the years and even just this season. For him to come out and front up is really big of him but none of the lads expect that from him. A mistake is a mistake, it happens<br /><br />Football is very fickle. One day you are on top of the world, the next you are feeling as low as a snake’s belly. You have to manage your emotions. We have to have a calmness of the mind when things go well and when they go bad. Do not get too high or too low<br /><br />Whenever things go wrong, it is the first thing that people want to know. Is it a bad dressing room? Is there unrest? It is nothing like that. It is an indifferent run of form but there is no major issue. It is such a together group. We have a squad in which everyone gets on. There are no egos. Everyone works for each other. The fans know that. It is difficult to put your finger on what has changed. We have been doing the same things but we have not been consistent enough and it just has not gone for us. It shows how well we did in the early part of the season to still be in the mix. We are still on track<br /><br /><b>[<a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> are coming out on the wrong side of these close games now]</b> We have done very well in periods of games. <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, we dominated but for 20 minutes in the first half there. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, we dominated in the second half. It is just these lapses in concentration that are costing us points at the moment which we cannot afford. We are a young squad and there are going to be inconsistencies. It is a learning curve. That main thing is to learn from it. We need to start doing the basics right<br /><br /><b>[Add to this the loss of <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a> in recent games]</b> These players are top players so we have missed them greatly. But I think we have strength in depth here. We are raring to go for Thursday. They have their way of playing and they stick by it. It is going to be a tough game. It would be disappointing to not have anything to show for what a great season we have had. The fact that we are still in the mix tells me something is going to happen. I am a big believer in fate. We are still in it. It is in our hands. I believe that we will get there</p>
