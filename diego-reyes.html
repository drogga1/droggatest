  <p><b>[For Diego Reyes, who headed in the winner Tuesday, coach Juan Carlos Osorio has helped the team find a winning formula]</b> I think you have to get used to winning games. You have to go out with a lot of humility, with your feet on the ground knowing what the goal is because what we’re looking for is going to the World Cup. It’s an excellent group. I feel really comfortable. I’m happy and grateful to come here because it’s gone really well for me and, beyond that, it’s an honor and pleasure to represent my country. We’re great teammates, a great group, a big family and I’m happy to be here.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico stars vital to Porto’s hopes of beating Liverpool in Champions League]</b> He’s a demanding person who likes things to be done well. I’m happy he’s given me minutes, that he’s given me a chance to show myself. I think every one of these minutes are very valuable for me, even more so in a team where there’s so much internal competition. I have to take advantage of every minute and try to catch his eye by surpassing his expectations</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Reyes will not take part in the World Cup because of a hamstring injury]</b> However, today along with the coaching staff I’ve decided to make a decision that hurts my soul because I think it’s the best for my teammates because I’m not sure I can achieve the best version of myself in such little time. That’s why I’ve decided, along with <b>[manager]</b> Juan Carlos Osorio that I won’t make up part of the 23 players who will fight for the World .</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico lost a second defender Tuesday with Diego Reyes ruled out of the World Cup]</b> I’ve decided to make a decision that hurts my soul because I think it’s the best for my teammates because I’m not sure I can achieve the best version of myself in such little time. That’s why I’ve decided, along with <b>[manager]</b> Juan Carlos Osorio that I won’t make up part of the 23 players who will fight for the World Cup. There’s nothing left for me to do than wish Erick, my teammates and the coaching staff the best of luck and to thank them for the opportunity and the unconditional support during the last few days. I’m convinced they’ll make history because of their talent and because this united and committed group can do big things.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico was stretched by Haiti. It was stretched by Costa Rica. It will be stretched by either Jamaica or the United States]</b> It’s really good. Honestly, it makes me really happy for them. They gave everyone a big surprise in the tournament. They deserve our respect. We hope the level keeps growing for the tournament and Concacaf also improve their level</p>
