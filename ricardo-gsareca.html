  <p><b>[Peru are unexpected semi-finalists, with this the first time they have reached the final four of the competition since 1983]</b> We’re a strong team that has been brought together out of adversity. We have not worked based on what others think of us, but on what we think of ourselves. We’re up to the task and we have a great chance of doing it</p>

  <p><b>[Head coach Ricardo Gareca is quietly confident of upstaging another South American powerhouse Brazil]</b> I think we have great players that can surprise in a match of that level. We will attack the strengths of the team, because you know that talking individually about each Brazil player is not the best way. I trust my players. We are capable of finding the answer on how to win</p>

  <p><b>[Peru coach Ricardo Gareca also weighed in on <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s outburst following the defeat to Brazil]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is an authoritative voice, that does not mean I agree with him. I respect him a lot - not just the player but the person. He seems to be very focused. But apart from the opinion we have of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, we can agree or disagree with him. I like that we would know what we have to improve in South America, but that does not necessarily mean that there is corruption or that we are corrupt.<br /><br />There is more and more information from Europe, where our children and grandchildren know more and more European players, and it seems that we want to imitate them in everything. There are good things in Europe, but we also have good things in South American football, too. I would like to defend South American football. If you speak of corruption, you must have convincing evidence. Football is a game and an individual can go wrong</p>
