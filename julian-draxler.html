  <p><b>[Julian Draxler has admitted his anger at Paris Saint-Germain manager Unai Emery]</b> It was insensitive. I didn’t know what was going on. I was surprised and angry. The goal for 1-1 went in but it did not change anything for us. I felt we needed to keep pressing and playing offensively. We lost a man, and even though we got it to 1-1 the whole stadium knew the game would not turn around because we didn’t have the intensity on the pitch. Real Madrid played it out confidently and were not nervous at all.<br /><br />We played the ball back and forth but you cannot score just doing that. You have to put pressure on Real Madrid when you are 3-1 down, not just pass it back and forth and hope something falls for you. We needed to put pressure on the opponents right from the start. We didn’t do that so we deserved to be eliminated<br /><br />In the summer we spent €400m and everyone was talking about how it was going to change things, but we have failed to get through this round again. I am still convinced this team has a lot to give, but you can see in games like this that there is still something missing if we want to win the big trophy. That should make us think again</p>

He has had a very, very strong season in England. I’ve known Leroy for a long time, we’re friends, so I’m especially sorry for him. But we all have to accept the decision, the national coach will have had his reasons. Leroy is certainly not as relaxed as he always is. He will be very disappointed, but it will not throw him off track.<br /><br /> have been here permanently since I was 18 years old. I know the processes and I’ve matured as a player. At some point there will be a change, and then there are players who have to grow into new roles. It would be desirable for me to take a leading role. But that is of course only done by performing at club level and for the national team. You don’t stand up and say: As of today, I’m a leader. It’s a process. But it’s already my goal to accomplish that<br /><br />Professionally, everyone is convinced of him. I have no prejudices. It may have been said that he is a difficult guy, but he has his personality and I am really looking forward to meeting him. It’s certainly an advantage if you can communicate in German. I’m very much looking forward to Thomas Tuchel and I am pleased that he is coming to Paris</p>

I played 47, 48 games last season and am convinced I will play them this season as well. I like the club and the city.

I can’t stay in my comfort zone, but must prove myself in training. In the end I hope Thomas Tuchel is convinced by me<br /><br /><b>[on Thomas Tuchel]</b> In a technical way he is a very good coach.

  <p><b>[PSG midfielder Julian Draxler has said Tuesday’s season-defining match at Red Star Belgrade will be like a final]</b> It’s like a final. We have to win there, at least we have to get one point. We saw Liverpool and Napoli’s games there, it was hard for them and it will be hard for us, but we beat Liverpool at home and we have big players in the team. I’m sure we’re going to win there and make it to the next round.<br /><br />The Champions League is very important because all the teams are at a high level like we are. I think that matches like this you don’t win just playing football, you have to fight. We showed it against Liverpool during the last match but in Champions League you have to show that at every game if we want to go as far as possible<br /><br /><b>[PSG defeated Red Star 6-1 at Parc des Princes]</b> It will be a different game. We know we were very strong in Parc des Princes but … during the last games you could see that also in Ligue 1 we had some problems.

  <p><b>[Julian Draxler said he’s never seen a player as good at such a young age as his PSG team-mate Kylian Mbappe]</b> It’s hard to say, he’s already a world-class player. But he’s now 19 or 20 years old so to win the Ballon d’Or he needs some more experience, but he’s still so young. If he continues like this he will win it one day. I’m sure. Because I’ve never seen a player of his age who played as good as he is currently playing.<br /><br /><b>[On Neymar]</b> We know that Neymar has great skills, he’s a great player so we try to find him everywhere on the pitch. If he plays on the left side we try to find him on the left side, if he plays as number 10 we try to find him at the centre. He doesn’t really care in which position he plays, he tries to be everywhere on the pitch. For us it’s not a big difference but of course if you have a player like him you have to give him the ball. That’s also kind of my role at the moment. I try to defend well with <b>[Adrien]</b> Rabiot, Marquinhos or <b>[Marco]</b> Verratti. It doesn’t matter, if we have the ball we try to find Neymar and Mbappe because they are very dangerous and they can score out of nothing<br /><br /><b>[on Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, it depends on the form, what kind of season you played, which team you play <b>[for]</b>. Sometimes it’s also a bit of luck that you need but what I can say is the two are amazing players and they both deserve the Ballon d’Or one day</p>

I am as happy today as the day I arrived! Sunday will be a big match. The fact that it could be my 100th for Paris just makes it all the more exciting.<br /><br />I think I can do better. But when Neymar and Kylian arrived, I have been playing more and more in midfield, even in front of the defence in recent matches. I’m not a goal scoring machine like them or Edinson Cavani. But since I’ve been here, I have progressed over the two years, especially since the coach Thomas Tuchel came to the club. Like I said, I’m very happy</p>

  <p><b>[How Julian Draxler went from fan to friend of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> legend <a href="raul-gonzalez.html">Raul Gonzalez</a>]</b> When <a href="raul-gonzalez.html">Raul Gonzalez</a> stood in front of me, I couldn’t talk. I wanted to say in English, ‘Hello, I am Julian.’ But only mumbling came out. I gave him a quick hand, went on fast, sat down and shut up. I always liked him. When I saw <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> earlier in the Champions League, he was on the pitch, sometimes even as the captain of the Galacticos. And suddenly the same person is standing in the locker room next to you, you have to pinch yourself. You ask yourself in the first moment how Felix Magath has done it that Raul plays for Schalke now. And the next moment you’re wondering how you actually managed to be in the same room with him right now<br /><br />At some point I realised that he understood very early on that I had great talent. I also played relatively early in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. Raul used to play as a number 10 and I on the left wing. He knew that he needed to get me on the right track so I could give him assists. I absorbed everything from him and tried to change my game in a way that he is happy with me. If he had said I was not ready, I probably would not have played anymore. I asked him after training sessions or games, which runs I should do if he has the ball, which kind of pass he wants to have if I have the ball. He realised that I wanted to learn from him. Nowadays there are many 17, 18 or 19-year-old’s who think: ‘I’m doing it’. For me it was the other way around. This eventually led to a friendship<br /><br />He never said I had to <b>[become a professional]</b>, but he pushed me very hard in that direction. If we lost on Saturday or I played badly, the weekend was over for the whole family. He was really angry and very, very critical. Sometimes I did not feel that my performance was so bad. He then made it clear to me that that was not enough. My dad was definitely demanding. In retrospect, I’m incredibly grateful to him because I’ve developed such an ambition that otherwise I might not have had<br /><br />I used to say that I would never go to a party until I did my first pro game. And that was really the case. I drank my first sip of alcohol after winning the cup final. After that, I also went to a party for the first time. Before, there was only school, training, school, training, school, training</p>

  <p><b>[Draxler reveals the Schalke abuse that shaped his career]</b> Schalke was not an employer for me like any other. There were many eyes on me. When we lost, I did not just hear from the fans that I was shit, but from my neighbours, my family, and my family’s friends. For example, I was at my uncle’s birthday. At the party was someone, who attends every Schalke game, suddenly telling me what an asshole I am.<br /><br />That’s just the way people speak in the Ruhr area. Since you do not mince words. At the moment, people do not care if you are only 19 years old and still in the development phase. At the same time, people have a very good sense of whether you are really 100 per cent present on the course or whether you have a fuss in your head. Initially, as a teenager, you tend to take on a defensive posture and you’re thinking, ‘What are you trying to tell me? I already know how things work’. But in retrospect, you realise that people were mostly right<br /><br /><b>[While Draxler struggled to escape criticism, he did make a positive early impression at Schalke]</b> That was Hollywood. Three days ago I had given my debut as a starter in Hannover. It was not a very special game, I did not play well, but it was pretty cool because we won 1-0 and it was my first win with Schalke. And then Nurnberg. After that, nothing was the same in my life as before. I have thousands of memories about it. You will never forget such an experience. Today, when I look at the interview I gave after the match, I hardly recognise myself. At that moment I did not know where to go with me and tried to be professional. But I was 17, I would have liked to hug the cameraman. The next day I was supposed to go to school, and I said, ‘I’m not going to school’. The goal changed everything</p>

  <p><b>[Julian Draxler has explained why joining Wolfsburg was a better choice for his career than a move to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and also revealed he may extend his contract at <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a>]</b> At that time, a transfer to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> was discussed. The problem was that football is also a business and I do not decide on my own. Transfers also include fees and contractual issues. It must all fit and that was unfortunately not the case with <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. Back then, I had already told Schalke that I definitely wanted to go. I had practically said goodbye and I knew I had to leave to progress personally. It was important to me in choosing the club that certain conditions were right. The 2016 European Championship was just around the corner. So, I had to move to a club that had a good team and played in the Champions League. It was also important to me that it was a club that was in (Germany coach) Jogi Low’s field of vision. That was the case with Wolfsburg. Kevin De Bruyne had just moved to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> for a huge sum, so Wolfsburg had the financial means to pay the transfer fee to Schalke. That’s how I deliberately opted for Wolfsburg. Wolfsburg was the bridge to a club where I saw myself <b>[in the future]</b>. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t the case that I didn’t care about things in Wolfsburg. I am an athlete, I want to win. I also have to pay respect to the club<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is not bad for me to say publicly that Wolfsburg was not the club I dreamed of as a child. I still stand by that. Wolfsburg wanted to benefit from me and I wanted to benefit from Wolfsburg. The fact that the collaboration was not designed to be for five or six years was clear to everyone. From the start, it was agreed that we would sit down if a suitable offer was there and they wouldn’t block my path<br /><br /><b>[The 26-year-old has not always been a regular starter during his time at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and was linked with a move to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in the summer]</b> Because I was quite satisfied with my playing time in the season before. I have a coach that makes me feel like he wants to have me in this team and appreciates my qualities. I feel at home in the club and in the city. Besides, I have a contract until 2021. At some point I have to look where the journey is going. It may well be that I extend at PSG<br /><br />I am aware that I do not have the role at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> that I had at Schalke or Wolfsburg. At the same time, I know that I have the quality to play many games and help the team. Of course, I would like to take on even more responsibility and not worry about whether I play every major game of the season or not. At the same time, I have to be realistic. To be an undisputed starter at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, you must be one of the world’s top five, six, seven players<br /><br /><b>[Draxler said of <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a>]</b> I had no real picture of him because I had never met him before. But I was curious and inquisitive. In interpersonal relationships, opinions, as so often in life, diverge. I finally got to know him as a very open, very direct and very correct person. I am very satisfied with our relationship. It is true that sometimes he can be a difficult guy. That’s not bad at all. He has very high standards. In times when we win several games in a row, there are days when he seems a bit relaxed. Then, for example, there’s a Wednesday when everything is still fine, and on Thursday he suddenly yells and says it’s not going to happen. In any case <b>[it’s an advantage to have a German coach]</b>. Under <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>, I realised that playing abroad was different. I consider him a very good coach, but with him the communication was sometimes not that easy. When you talk to Thomas and he clearly tells you in two sentences in German what is good and what is not good, that is certainly an advantage</p>
