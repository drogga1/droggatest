  <p><b>[Julian Draxler on why he quit Schalke for Wolfsburg]</b> Even when I returned after my six-month injury layoff, I felt the expectations loaded on me to almost single-handedly win games. That’s when I realised it was time to move on. I became convinced that I would not have been able to withstand the pressure and the expectations</p>

  <p><b>[Draxler unsure of Leroy Sane future amid <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> links]</b> I don’t feel like he is forcing a transfer, but in football anything can happen. I didn’t ask him personally if he’s going or not, but there have been some jokes. I’ve just said to him ‘mia san mia’ (Bayern’s club motto) all the time in the last few days. When the media discusses a possible transfer of a great player like him, then you are curious. But you have to leave him alone and not ask him personally about what he will do. That would be too much. I think he would help <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> a lot, like every other team in the world. I’m curious to know what will happen, but I think he looks happy at City and doesn’t necessarily want to leave.<br /><br /><b>[Draxler and Sane are set to share a pitch over the next few days as they attempt to help Germany past Belarus and Estonia in Euro 2020 qualifying]</b> We’re on the path to building a completely new team with a new hierarchy. It remains to be seen who will take responsibility and put in the effort. There are many new players on the team. With <b>[almost]</b> 50 caps, I obviously have a certain level of experience, but far be it from me to say that I’ll take over complete responsibility. Everyone has to help out in order for us to be successful again - that goes for me as well</p>

I have heard nothing from the club <b>[in regards to leaving]</b>. I have not talked to anyone, I know nothing.<br /><br /><b>[Draxler, one of the few remaining members of the 2014 World Cup-winning squad, said earlier this week he is pleased to be part of this new-look German side]</b> It’s been a while since I’ve been part of the team and I’m very happy to be back again. A lot has happened over the last few months. We’ve started to build up a new team. Something had to happen after our bad World Cup showing. We are highly motivated and want to achieve big things during the next objectives that lie ahead of us. It will take time until we’re back at the same level as the 2014 and 2016 teams, but if we keep working hard on ourselves then we have the potential to find our way back to our old strength</p>

In this case you need someone who plays behind them in the build-up and thinks more defensively.<br /><br />At the beginning, he maybe did not know where to put me. I had the most games, but not the most minutes<br /><br /><b>[Draxler was also the centre of attention earlier this year after a supposed falling out with Neymar]</b> We had a disagreement, that happens, but when it’s with Neymar, it’s in the media<br /><br /><b>[Despite a somewhat disappointing season for PSG, in which they won yet another Ligue 1 title]</b> I am far from saying I cannot stand it anymore or I have to go away, on the contrary, I feel very well, I have a super coach and I’m in a super club. I start training on July 8 and prepare for the new season and if I’m offered a contract extension, I’ll listen to that<br /><br />I have to admit, that I did not reach my highest level during the World Cup. The most important thing is to never give up and start a new approach. We won’t be the favourite at Euro 2020, but we have the potential to play for one of the first places</p>

  <p><b>[Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Julian Draxler says the club must do better in Europe next season]</b> All of them are exceptional players, it is hard to find in the world players of this level. But of course they have their own minds, their own heads, they live football, they want to score every game, so they have an ego. So sometimes it’s not easy for the whole team, but if you are lucky enough to play alongside these players, it’s just a pleasure every day<br /><br /><b>[The Germany international is pleased with the success <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a>’s side has achieved in the French game]</b> It’s two-and-a-half years now since I arrived and I won a lot of (domestic) titles so I am happy about that. I became a better player than I was before, so that’s positive, but what is negative is what we achieved in the Champions League. We did not go far in the Champions League and that was one of the goals when I signed.

  <p><b>[How Julian Draxler went from fan to friend of <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> legend <a href="raul-gonzalez.html">Raul Gonzalez</a>]</b> When <a href="raul-gonzalez.html">Raul Gonzalez</a> stood in front of me, I couldn’t talk. I wanted to say in English, ‘Hello, I am Julian.’ But only mumbling came out. I gave him a quick hand, went on fast, sat down and shut up. I always liked him. When I saw <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> earlier in the Champions League, he was on the pitch, sometimes even as the captain of the Galacticos. And suddenly the same person is standing in the locker room next to you, you have to pinch yourself. You ask yourself in the first moment how Felix Magath has done it that Raul plays for Schalke now. And the next moment you’re wondering how you actually managed to be in the same room with him right now<br /><br />At some point I realised that he understood very early on that I had great talent. I also played relatively early in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. Raul used to play as a number 10 and I on the left wing. He knew that he needed to get me on the right track so I could give him assists. I absorbed everything from him and tried to change my game in a way that he is happy with me. If he had said I was not ready, I probably would not have played anymore. I asked him after training sessions or games, which runs I should do if he has the ball, which kind of pass he wants to have if I have the ball. He realised that I wanted to learn from him. Nowadays there are many 17, 18 or 19-year-old’s who think: ‘I’m doing it’. For me it was the other way around. This eventually led to a friendship<br /><br />He never said I had to <b>[become a professional]</b>, but he pushed me very hard in that direction. If we lost on Saturday or I played badly, the weekend was over for the whole family. He was really angry and very, very critical. Sometimes I did not feel that my performance was so bad. He then made it clear to me that that was not enough. My dad was definitely demanding. In retrospect, I’m incredibly grateful to him because I’ve developed such an ambition that otherwise I might not have had<br /><br />I used to say that I would never go to a party until I did my first pro game. And that was really the case. I drank my first sip of alcohol after winning the cup final. After that, I also went to a party for the first time. Before, there was only school, training, school, training, school, training</p>

  <p><b>[Draxler reveals the Schalke abuse that shaped his career]</b> Schalke was not an employer for me like any other. There were many eyes on me. When we lost, I did not just hear from the fans that I was sh*t, but from my neighbours, my family, and my family’s friends. For example, I was at my uncle’s birthday. At the party was someone, who attends every Schalke game, suddenly telling me what an asshole I am.<br /><br />That’s just the way people speak in the Ruhr area. Since you do not mince words. At the moment, people do not care if you are only 19 years old and still in the development phase. At the same time, people have a very good sense of whether you are really 100 per cent present on the course or whether you have a fuss in your head. Initially, as a teenager, you tend to take on a defensive posture and you’re thinking, ‘What are you trying to tell me? I already know how things work’. But in retrospect, you realise that people were mostly right<br /><br /><b>[While Draxler struggled to escape criticism, he did make a positive early impression at Schalke]</b> That was Hollywood. Three days ago I had given my debut as a starter in Hannover. It was not a very special game, I did not play well, but it was pretty cool because we won 1-0 and it was my first win with Schalke. And then Nurnberg. After that, nothing was the same in my life as before. I have thousands of memories about it. You will never forget such an experience. Today, when I look at the interview I gave after the match, I hardly recognise myself. At that moment I did not know where to go with me and tried to be professional. But I was 17, I would have liked to hug the cameraman. The next day I was supposed to go to school, and I said, ‘I’m not going to school’. The goal changed everything</p>

  <p><b>[Julian Draxler has explained why joining Wolfsburg was a better choice for his career than a move to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> and also revealed he may extend his contract at Paris Saint-Germain]</b> At that time, a transfer to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> was discussed. The problem was that football is also a business and I do not decide on my own. Transfers also include fees and contractual issues. It must all fit and that was unfortunately not the case with <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>. Back then, I had already told Schalke that I definitely wanted to go. I had practically said goodbye and I knew I had to leave to progress personally. It was important to me in choosing the club that certain conditions were right. The 2016 European Championship was just around the corner. So, I had to move to a club that had a good team and played in the Champions League. It was also important to me that it was a club that was in (Germany coach) Jogi Low’s field of vision. That was the case with Wolfsburg. Kevin De Bruyne had just moved to <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> for a huge sum, so Wolfsburg had the financial means to pay the transfer fee to Schalke. That’s how I deliberately opted for Wolfsburg. Wolfsburg was the bridge to a club where I saw myself <b>[in the future]</b>. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t the case that I didn’t care about things in Wolfsburg. I am an athlete, I want to win. I also have to pay respect to the club<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is not bad for me to say publicly that Wolfsburg was not the club I dreamed of as a child. I still stand by that. Wolfsburg wanted to benefit from me and I wanted to benefit from Wolfsburg. The fact that the collaboration was not designed to be for five or six years was clear to everyone. From the start, it was agreed that we would sit down if a suitable offer was there and they wouldn’t block my path<br /><br /><b>[The 26-year-old has not always been a regular starter during his time at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and was linked with a move to <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in the summer]</b> Because I was quite satisfied with my playing time in the season before. I have a coach that makes me feel like he wants to have me in this team and appreciates my qualities. I feel at home in the club and in the city. Besides, I have a contract until 2021. At some point I have to look where the journey is going. It may well be that I extend at PSG<br /><br />I am aware that I do not have the role at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> that I had at Schalke or Wolfsburg. At the same time, I know that I have the quality to play many games and help the team. Of course, I would like to take on even more responsibility and not worry about whether I play every major game of the season or not. At the same time, I have to be realistic. To be an undisputed starter at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, you must be one of the world’s top five, six, seven players<br /><br /><b>[Draxler said of <a href="thomas-tuchel.html">Tuchel</a>]</b> I had no real picture of him because I had never met him before. But I was curious and inquisitive. In interpersonal relationships, opinions, as so often in life, diverge. I finally got to know him as a very open, very direct and very correct person. I am very satisfied with our relationship. It is true that sometimes he can be a difficult guy. That’s not bad at all. He has very high standards. In times when we win several games in a row, there are days when he seems a bit relaxed. Then, for example, there’s a Wednesday when everything is still fine, and on Thursday he suddenly yells and says it’s not going to happen. In any case <b>[it’s an advantage to have a German coach]</b>. Under <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>, I realised that playing abroad was different. I consider him a very good coach, but with him the communication was sometimes not that easy. When you talk to Thomas and he clearly tells you in two sentences in German what is good and what is not good, that is certainly an advantage</p>
