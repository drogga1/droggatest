They’re making it a reality, so let’s hope he likes it. I hope Alexis sees what he means to the club and our fans.

We’ll speak when the season is over because if I speak now, that would take my focus away from qualifying for the Champions League and winning the FA Cup<br /><br />I don’t think it has been a very good season for me because I came here to win trophies, to be competing in the Champions League and to win the Premier League, and I feel disappointed that we aren’t in a position to win the Premier League or the Champions League.

Sometimes the frustration more than anything is about the fact we could be challenging for the Premier League title. I’ve always said we have great players here, it’s just about having the mentality of being a great player and going out on to the pitch already thinking about winning. That’s what we’ve done in the last three games. We had the mentality to win at all costs and we won and we won well.<br /><br />I don’t know whether it would be successful or not, but I think it would be positive to beat Chelsea in the FA Cup final.

I want to clarify that Henry never told me to leave the club, it was a personal decision. He LOVES the club and someday it would be nice to see him as the Arsenal coach because he loves the club.<br /><br />He indicated it is important for the club for me to be here. I also believe that the club itself cared about me joining, and I got the impression that they were keen for me to come here and wear the number seven shirt. I think that also gets through to the player. Players sometimes need to feel important and loved by the club. That was one of the things that attracted me to come here, along with the manager, who is a person who won everything in Italy, the same as he did in Spain, and he’s a manager who likes to win</p>

It was a great pass from Paul Pogba, and when the ball was in the air I wanted to hit it to the near post but then I saw the goalkeeper go the other way so I changed to the far post to catch him off balance.<br /><br /><b>[On Jose Mourinho]</b> He is a coach that demands a lot, and when we lose he gets very angry. We need those kind of demands to get the best out of us. He asks me to play a free role, to enjoy myself, to attack, defend, to do everything! What can we take from this season? It’s been difficult, I think next year we have to go for it. It was a tough change for me. The coach told me to speak with him as he’s not used to bringing in players in January. It has been demanding but we hope to win the final. United are special because of their history, they have so much history on a world level. You guys can see that when you come to the stadium. The fans too, I have come here and I want to win everything next year with this team and with the coach<br /><br />I have already written to him, not on social media but I wrote to him personally. I sent him my congratulations and he thanked me. It’s sad because he is a football legend, a gentleman who shows respect and professionalism and I only have words of gratitude for him</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez admits he was hoping for more world-class players to arrive at Manchester United]</b> I would have liked that they had signed many more world-class players. But it’s the club’s decision<br /><br />The truth is that <b>[Fred]</b> impressed me a lot in his first game. t’s what the team lacked - someone who plays ‘jogo bonito’, as they say in Brazil. And Andreas Pereira too. I think they are two players who have quality and they could help me a lot<br /><br />Today I am more comfortable. I am calm. My team-mates have to be focused. I also have to. I depend on them. If they are well, me too. It’s <b>[improving]</b> positively, it goes better. I think it will be seen now in the games when we play with Paul <b>[Pogba]</b>, with Fred with <b>[Romelu]</b> Lukaku and with all the rest who are playing. We will understand better which is the best way <b>[to get the most out of the team]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez sounds battle cry ahead of new season]</b> The first four or five months were a learning period. Now I want to go all the way, I want to fight for everything. I am preparing myself mentally and physically to face all that lies ahead. Now that I know my team-mates, I can focus on what I want to win. I am here to demonstrate the quality I’m here for. The time has come for United to win more trophies. We need to be fighting among the best.<br /><br />As Manchester United … as a big team, pressing forward, and with a desire to win - with the mindset that distinguishes United from others. United is a big team. Even though we have improved a lot, we need to keep improving. Now it is time to prove it, to fight for the top spots, and I think this is the season to do it</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez wants to make the Manchester United fans really happy]</b> Obviously, I want to make the United fans really happy. I want to score goals. I want to bring them joy. I want to win silverware. When we lost last year’s FA Cup final to Chelsea, I was not happy. Not happy at all. In fact, I was sad because I just wanted to make our wonderful supporters happy. I saw the fans who had come to pack out Wembley Stadium. They were all around me - all red. I liked it. Wembley was all red.<br /><br />The goal there <b>[at Wembley]</b> against Tottenham comes to mind. It was such a great moment because the United fans were right on top of us and it was a lovely moment to be able to celebrate along with them. When I was younger, I liked United. I swear. As a small child, I liked United. I really liked them. And I want to show this and bring the people joy because, obviously, I want to win<br /><br />I want to keep showing my love for football. I know what I can do. I have belief in my ability. United are such an important club, not only in England but on a global level, and I would love to help bring a trophy to the supporters</p>
