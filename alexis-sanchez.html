It is something that fulfils me as a player, and as a team too, so we can demonstrate that we can hold our own with the best. Of course I respect them, they have a great team and great players</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez admits he has struggled to learn English]</b> I’m trying to learn and it’s going alright. In any case, with all the travelling I’ve had to do there has not been much time - we were away a lot on international duty or with the Champions League. But I enjoy learning English, I learnt Italian and now am cracking onto the English. The club is helping me a lot and there are some team-mates who speak Spanish or Italian that can help me</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez speaks about the highs and lows of being a professional footballer]</b> As a footballer, everything you’ve achieved can easily be lost and then you are nobody. That’s just how life is and that’s why you shouldn’t let things get you down. That’s the reason I treat every match like a final. I try to do that in every game - to give 100 per cent. Life is like a set of scales. One minute, you can be right up there, and the next, really low</p>

I’ve always said that. It’s the club that’s won the most in England. When I went to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> it was fantastic - I was happy there - but United were growing at the time, they were buying players to win something.

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez has stated that he is at <a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> to win something, with the Chilean adamant that he retains his passion for the game despite a disappointing spell at Manchester United]</b> First of all I’d like to thank my teammates, it’s a great group here and they welcomed me from the very first training session. I’m here to help the team win something, because I want to fight. The coach wants to win too and that’s why I’m here. I have the same desire to win something, to play football. I love football and playing makes me happy. Now I’m here, I’ve arrived at a great team with excellent players. I’m here to fight for something. What struck me the most about my experiences in the past? In <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> it was the physicality, the pace, the strength, the intensity. I think it’s a different kind of football from both the Italian and Spanish leagues<br /><br />Playing <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> is always a special occasion, I won a lot there, it will be a very tough game but we have the players to win, so let’s go and fight. I want to win something, but we have to fight together, you can only win as a group. If we stay tight as a squad then we can succeed. Both myself and the whole team will do our best to get as far as possible and to win something, that’s why I’m here</p>

There was <a href="carles-puyol.html">Puyol</a>, who for me is an incredible captain, the best I have had in my career so far. It was a nice thing, it teaches you to play football differently, with possession of the ball. In <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, I learned a lot in the sense of improving myself.

They have the confidence to play there. If we have one chance or two chances, we cannot waste them. I played with United there and we wasted three or four clear chances. Then they have one or two, they get in, and you’re 3-0 down. If you want to beat <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, you can’t miss any clear chances</p>

I already knew the coach and some players, and I think the club is preparing something nice for the future. If I’m not mistaken, Inter haven’t won anything for seven or eight years. Yes, it was a bit like finding love for football, together with the desire to win something with this club. I believe the coach wants to win everything. You can see it from how we train and how we play games. He conveys his desire to the players and is positive for both the club and the team in general<br /><br />When I arrived, there was talk that it might be the best <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> <b>[team]</b> in history.

Plus, I had team-mates you could give the ball to, knowing that then they would give it back to you perfectly. If you train with such strong players you can only improve. I try to improve myself every day and this helped me grow as a player. At <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> I learned a lot, in the sense that I grew up. There were great players who had won the World Cup and they allowed me to improve day after day, even physically.</p>

When I do go to Tocopilla, I try to set up events and give footballs just to see the smiles on the children’s faces as I honestly believe that small children are the most important things in the world.
