  <p><b>[Luis Enrique explains decision to axe ‘disloyal’ <a href="robert-moreno.html">Robert Moreno</a> from Spain coaching staff]</b> The only person responsible for <a href="robert-moreno.html">Robert Moreno</a> not being on my staff is me. On September 12, I met him at my house and he told me that he wanted to coach at the European Championship and then, if I wanted, he would be my assistant. I understand that he is ambitious, that it is his dream to be a coach, but for me it is disloyal, I would not do it. For me, it is a big flaw. I understand his position but I do not share it.<br /><br />I told him I no longer see him as my assistant and that I don’t know when I will be back, but that I feel like working. He finished the meeting in a cordial way and I called the people on my staff to let them know my opinion and that of the other side, so that no one misrepresents my words.<br /><br />From there, I must say that I never approached the federation. I never called them. Professionally I have no reason to criticise <a href="robert-moreno.html">Robert Moreno</a>. He is very prepared and is a very good coach. His words said one thing and the facts were very different. I am not the good one in the movie, but neither am I the bad one</p>

I am very lucky to have been in a club for so many years that gave me everything<br /><br />We have to try to prepare for the Euros in the best way and recuperate a good line of action, being in the hunt to win trophies. I see the national team capable of winning things - in fact that is one of the challenges that I think about as the head coach of Spain. I have never hid this, but it is obvious that we are within a process. And there are a group of other national teams with great potential. We are part of this group of six or seven national teams that can access the goals - our performance will say if we can get there or not<br /><br />For a player to get a call up to the national team, they must meet a series of conditions. Firstly, they have to play in their team, play well, compare their level with other players and then fit in to what we want. Williams is a great striker and can definitely get a call up. We call players up who can contribute and I’m delighted that new players are emerging for call ups</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Barca boss Luis Enrique says Training <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>? You can’t tell him much as he’s already an artist]</b> How do we train <a href="lionel-messi.html">Leo Messi</a>? There is a little bit of everything. I cannot tell him how to dribble or how to pass or shoot because he is an artist at those things and it’s clear that we don’t have to advise him on these topics. But things relating to the systems we use, situations or things as a more general level that benefit us, for sure we tell him. How to create pressure in a certain way, where do we want the ball, what spaces on the pitch should he be taking up to try to receive the ball <b>[…]</b> we tried to influence him regarding all those things</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Enrique says Playing behind closed doors is sadder than dancing with your own sister]</b> Playing behind closed doors is sadder than dancing with your own sister. You have to understand that football is a business - and it will help to pass the time during lockdown. I, if I was still a player, would like to start again as soon as possible. I am not afraid<br /><br />I have always said that <b>[Louis]</b> <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">van Gaal</a> was the best or one of the best coaches I ever had. But over time I have realised that <b>[Javier]</b> Clemente (former Spain boss), through the energy he created and also his tactics, reached a new level. If he told me ‘go through here, go through there’, if he told me to throw myself in front of something then I would. I would have thrown myself in front of whatever was necessary for him. So yes - and this is the first time I’ve said it - I would like to have a lot of Javier Clemente’s qualities as a coach</p>
