But the crowd were great, this is a great place to play. It was just handbags with a Celtic player. We changed him to give him a rest, but it was nothing tactical <b>[to avoid a red card]</b>.<br /><br />It was quite a hard game. We expected Celtic to press high. We were good at the break and improved as the game went on. It was a very difficult group and it was great to finish first with a game to spare. In one of the toughest groups, we have come top. I have to congratulate the team. In the first half I can’t remember Celtic having a clear chance and Messi as usual was at a really high level<br /><br /><b>[Luis Enrique also brought on 21-year-old defender Marlon for his Barcelona debut in the closing stages]</b> Gerard Pique received a knock to the foot, so it was to give him a rest.

We are not normally a team that delivers tackles that are worthy of yellow cards. Perhaps it’s for protesting so that’s something we have to look at<br /><br /><b>[On Fifth-placed Real Sociedad]</b> They play good football and are on a very good run.

  <p><b>[Luis Enrique disgusted with Barcelona display]</b> If I look at the result, it’s the most positive assessment I can give from this season. To finish 1-1 is almost a miracle. Winning would have been unfair and I have to congratulate Real. We couldn’t even string five passes together. Without the ball, we were disastrous.<br /><br />They pressed us with six players and we didn’t find the middle-range and long-range passes. We didn’t even win five per cent of the duels. If you don’t match up in this type of duel and you concede the advantage, there’s little you can do. In the second half we improved a little but nowhere near enough. We drew the game because of an isolated bit of play between Messi and Neymar, but little else. We don’t deserve to take a point back to Barcelona.<br /><br /><b>[Gerard Pique says Barca could not hope to defend the title if they repeat such a display]</b> I understand that interviews at the end of a game are dangerous. You haven’t adjusted to the reality of the situation. To give up on LaLiga on matchday 13 would seem an exaggeration to me.<br /><br />We have to start improving. We’ve produced the worst game of our era and we’ll certainly see a different Barca in the Clasico. The battles will be important and they will be decisive. I’m sure that we will fight</p>

He won’t be playing Wednesday because he is suspended, but we are just waiting on confirmation <b>[for El Clasico]</b>. But in theory he is selectable.<br /><br /><b>[On Paco Alcacer]</b> I think you should leave the guy in peace. Why put pressure on a player not getting much playing time. Paco needs to be left to develop in peace with the time he is getting on the pitch, which isn’t much. So let’s not dwell on the negatives of a player who has come here to help us. It’s ridiculous to put him under such pressure<br /><br />I have infinite theories. We are trying to resolve it. It’s not one simple thing that you press one button for and everything works. I understand the situation - naturally. I gave my clear opinion before and after every game. Evidently we need to improve but I see no signs for excessive worry other than isolated episodes that have happened. Perhaps we need to be more consistent, even the players acknowledged that, but let’s not exaggerate. We did that in my first season but we went and won the treble</p>

They wanted to win but we have experience in this kind of knockout tie. As much as I’m not happy, we tried to create problems for a team who changed its system to put five players in defence.<br /><br />We struggled in the first half, we were pretty bad. In the second half we created more chances and could have won but the tie is open and you have to wait for the second leg. Now we focus on one of the best games that can be seen in the championship and we are motivated to face our rivals.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has played down the significance of Saturday’s Clasico with Real Madrid]</b> Regardless of the result, I don’t think anyone could say it’s decisive. It’s the 14th game of the season. Clearly Madrid could take a very interesting lead but whatever the result I don’t think it will be determinant in the league. The game is a chance to beat Real Madrid and to get closer to the top of the table, nothing more.<br /><br /><b>[Luis Enrique does not think a win would end the criticism of his side either]</b> It’s important to win the Clasico as they are a direct opponent with the same aspirations as us but to think winning would put all criticism behind us is not going to happen. There will always be criticism.<br /><br />I think Real Madrid will be similar to last year and the start of this season, they have no problem in letting the opposition have the ball. But they have great transitions, they have quick players, they move the ball quickly with short passes. We are going to try to control the ball more, play the possession game, try to generate space that we can then exploit.<br /><br />They are a very organised side, a team that does not need the ball to compete and who base their game on the transition out of defence and on set-pieces. They are achieving very good results, they have very good players and for us it’s a very special game against our eternal rivals. We are at the Camp Nou and we go in with the intention of playing well against a very good opponent.<br /><br /><b>[Luis Enrique denied suggestions he would tinker with his line-up with the injured Gareth Bale not involved for Madrid]</b> I am not going to deny he’s a very important player for their team but that doesn’t condition what I do anyway.

  <p><b>[Luis Enrique warned Barcelona they are some way off being La Liga title contenders]</b> In the second half we were able to find our players between the lines much more easily. I think we controlled the game; we didn’t suffer in any transitions by Real Madrid. There were two clear chances for Leo and Neymar, but we can’t really talk about justice in football. It’s all about scoring. In the last few minutes it was more down to Real needing to score. We need to improve our performances, especially at home to get more points because we are a long way from where we want to be.<br /><br />The game is played until the final minute - we had it in our hands but it wasn’t to be. The only chance we have of overturning this <b>[Madrid’s six-point lead]</b> is winning all our remaining games. If the game finished in the 89th minute we’d all be happy, but I’m not going to answer hypothetical questions. We were superior and I don’t think football was fair to us, but we could improve every aspect <b>[of our play]</b>. That’s why we are ambitious. We could improve every aspect. If you look at the numbers <b>[in the league table]</b> it is obvious we are very far off where we need to be to be champions.</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Enrique wants his Barcelona players to get a morale boost by beating Borussia Monchengladbach]</b> Without any doubt, the coaches are judged by results.

I don’t see concerns, only football situations that can be improved. The plan is to be alive in every competition, to come up with chances to win every trophy possible. It’s an ambitious, demanding plan, to get to May with the chance of winning everything.<br /><br /><b>[Luis Enrique hopes to see Camp Nou given an entertaining performance]</b> If you talk about attitude, it’s a big mistake. If this team has anything, it’s ambition. I’ve never seen a lack of attitude. Winning is always a cure for what ails you. We’ve had an almost perfect group stage and so the game is almost incidental. But it’s a Champions League game in front of our own fans and we want to have fun, irrespective of the players I’ll use<br /><br />Messi will play tomorrow, from the start.

  <p><b>[Luis Enrique challenges Barcelona to pile pressure on Madrid]</b> Every pitch is difficult. We knew it would be key to get the first goal. We were by far the better team and it was a fair result. The last few metres are always difficult. They bring a lot of players back there. The pitch was heavy and that made the ball circulation difficult. But we go home happy. They had a chance that could have made things difficult but I’m happy with what I saw out on the pitch. It’s about improving our form to try to put pressure on the leaders, on Real Madrid.<br /><br />Along with the centre-backs, Busquets is the one who starts the play. He only needs half a second to find a pass. He is the one who directs the play and it’s thanks to players like him that we’re able to settle games like this. In order to combat a team that sits back, you need a good structure in order to move the ball and press. That doesn’t mean the opposition can’t cause some danger with a long ball, as we saw, but I think we overcame all the difficulties</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Enrique insists Andre Gomes can play in Busquets role]</b> When we play Gomes in the pivot role, he shows that he is quite capable of playing in that position. His best position is in the middle, because of his ball control, piercing runs and good kick, but he can also play a supporting role, so he’s a useful resource to have. It’s good both for the team and the players to have such versatility and especially in midfield because of the way Barca play, it helps with our passing game, for creating chances and for generating pressure.<br /><br /><b>[Sergi Roberto is another player whose versatility has earned praise from Luis Enrique]</b> Sergi Roberto gives us different options; he’s a great utility player. We designed a squad this year so that he can play more as a full-back, but that does not stop him from playing in other positions</p>

But I don’t focus on the details of goals or assists. At the end of the day, I don’t think <b>[how many goals he’s scored]</b> is important.

We’ll miss you a lot but we’ll remember you every day of our lives with the hope that in the future we will meet each other again. You will be the star that guides our family. Rest, Xanita</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Enrique explains decision to axe ‘disloyal’ <a href="robert-moreno.html">Robert Moreno</a> from Spain coaching staff]</b> The only person responsible for <a href="robert-moreno.html">Robert Moreno</a> not being on my staff is me. On September 12, I met him at my house and he told me that he wanted to coach at the European Championship and then, if I wanted, he would be my assistant. I understand that he is ambitious, that it is his dream to be a coach, but for me it is disloyal, I would not do it. For me, it is a big flaw. I understand his position but I do not share it.<br /><br />I told him I no longer see him as my assistant and that I don’t know when I will be back, but that I feel like working. He finished the meeting in a cordial way and I called the people on my staff to let them know my opinion and that of the other side, so that no one misrepresents my words.<br /><br />From there, I must say that I never approached the federation. I never called them. Professionally I have no reason to criticise <a href="robert-moreno.html">Robert Moreno</a>. He is very prepared and is a very good coach. His words said one thing and the facts were very different. I am not the good one in the movie, but neither am I the bad one</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Enrique not ruling out <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> return]</b> I think I can coach anywhere I’ve been <b>[before]</b>. I’ve left the doors open at all of them.

I am very lucky to have been in a club for so many years that gave me everything<br /><br />We have to try to prepare for the Euros in the best way and recuperate a good line of action, being in the hunt to win trophies. I see the national team capable of winning things - in fact that is one of the challenges that I think about as the head coach of Spain. I have never hid this, but it is obvious that we are within a process. And there are a group of other national teams with great potential. We are part of this group of six or seven national teams that can access the goals - our performance will say if we can get there or not<br /><br />For a player to get a call up to the national team, they must meet a series of conditions. Firstly, they have to play in their team, play well, compare their level with other players and then fit in to what we want. Williams is a great striker and can definitely get a call up. We call players up who can contribute and I’m delighted that new players are emerging for call ups</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Barca boss Luis Enrique says Training <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>? You can’t tell him much as he’s already an artist]</b> How do we train <a href="lionel-messi.html">Leo Messi</a>? There is a little bit of everything. I cannot tell him how to dribble or how to pass or shoot because he is an artist at those things and it’s clear that we don’t have to advise him on these topics. But things relating to the systems we use, situations or things as a more general level that benefit us, for sure we tell him. How to create pressure in a certain way, where do we want the ball, what spaces on the pitch should he be taking up to try to receive the ball <b>[…]</b> we tried to influence him regarding all those things</p>

  <p><b>[Luis Enrique says Playing behind closed doors is sadder than dancing with your own sister]</b> Playing behind closed doors is sadder than dancing with your own sister. You have to understand that football is a business - and it will help to pass the time during lockdown. I, if I was still a player, would like to start again as soon as possible. I am not afraid<br /><br />I have always said that <b>[Louis]</b> <a href="louis-van-gaal.html">van Gaal</a> was the best or one of the best coaches I ever had. But over time I have realised that <b>[Javier]</b> Clemente (former Spain boss), through the energy he created and also his tactics, reached a new level. If he told me ‘go through here, go through there’, if he told me to throw myself in front of something then I would. I would have thrown myself in front of whatever was necessary for him. So yes - and this is the first time I’ve said it - I would like to have a lot of Javier Clemente’s qualities as a coach</p>
