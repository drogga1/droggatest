In looking at his performance, it is only something you can find out when you come to play for Barca. In overcoming different situations on the field and the things that he has done. You can only see when he is here. I think you get players from time to time and you think they are going to turn out and play well because they did well at their previous teams. But they come to Barcelona or Real Madrid with extra pressure, their performance gets diluted and it becomes more difficult for them to do well.

Very few players are at his level. The things we have seen him do with Madrid and Betis, they mark him out as different. He does not panic, he doesn’t lose possession, he handles the pressure, makes the final pass, he pushes forward… He marked Modric out of the game and forced him forward. He is a special player, there aren’t many like him in football. If a debutant plays that kind of game and accepts the challenge we can only ask more of him.</p>

I’m going to stick with the same system, the 4-3-3. If we compare this national team with the one who won the World Cup and two Euros, we will lose, for sure. But we don’t need to compare with our past, we need to compare with our rivals and we are at the same position as we were when we arrived, ninth <b>[in the FIFA world rankings]</b>.
