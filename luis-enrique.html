On September 12, I met him at my house and he told me that he wanted to coach at the European Championship and then, if I wanted, he would be my assistant. I understand that he is ambitious, that it is his dream to be a coach, but for me it is disloyal, I would not do it. For me, it is a big flaw. I understand his position but I do not share it.<br /><br />I told him I no longer see him as my assistant and that I don’t know when I will be back, but that I feel like working. He finished the meeting in a cordial way and I called the people on my staff to let them know my opinion and that of the other side, so that no one misrepresents my words.<br /><br />From there, I must say that I never approached the federation. I never called them. Professionally I have no reason to criticise <a href="robert-moreno.html">Robert Moreno</a>. He is very prepared and is a very good coach.
