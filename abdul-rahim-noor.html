  <p><b>[Malaysian facilitator Abdul Rahim Noor told BenarNews that <a href="udomchai-thammasarorat.html">Udomchai Thammasarorat</a>’s strange behavior shocked him]</b> On Saturday night, Udomchai told the Malaysian <b>[officials]</b> that he would only meet the separatists’ panel head, Sukree, despite everyone being present for the dialogue. Udomchai also told Malaysia that the people from his team could meet with the separatists on Sukree’s panel. This request was deemed strange by the separatists and to me, it was a strange behavior on the part of Udomchai. I was shocked<br /><br /><b>[Abdul Rahim said it was up to the two sides to determine when they would meet, and that his role was one of a facilitator]</b> Udomchai told the Malaysian team he took that stand because Thai Prime Minister <a href="prayuth-chan-ocha.html">Prayuth Chan-o-cha</a> wanted him to. If Udomchai was supposed to meet me only, why bring along the delegation for just one night in Kuala Lumpur</p>

  <p><b>[Former inspector-general of police Abdul Rahim Noor sees no harm in events commemorating the Hat Yai Peace Accord]</b> There is nothing wrong if we want to remember the incident or historical moment, where our government signed that peace accord in Hat Yai, 30 years ago.<br /><br />This can be as a sign of thanks that the problem with communists was resolved and that there is no other purpose than to be grateful that our country is safe.</p>
