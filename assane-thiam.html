  <p><b>[When Nike gatecrashed Paris: How one man’s vision sparked football furore in suburb Nanterre]</b> The world is ours’. That’s the name of my organisation. It is my spirit. It is my ambition. When I wake up in the morning, I have this in my mind.<br /><br /><b>[At the age of 19, that dream had him working for Stellar Group, an agency with the likes of <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a> on its books. It was then that he arranged his first big transfer: Yassin Fortune’s £3m move from Lens to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. But after not receiving the payments he was due for his role, Thiam decided it was time for a new dream]</b> I said: ‘I have learned a lot and I need to give back to my community’. So, I started to make tournaments<br /><br /><b>[Five years later and he had brought one of football’s most exciting young players, <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a>, to Nanterre, hoping to inspire young people growing up in the same difficult circumstances he did]</b> Everybody is very proud. Every game on the TV, kids send me photos of the <b>[Nike]</b> boots. ‘The boots are on the foot of <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>!’. Nanterre is a big place in France for events now, because the pitches are very big and everybody in France, maybe in the world, knows it and knows the Nike launch<br /><br /><b>[The idea of paying for a kickabout is foreign to Thiam]</b> <b>[Growing up]</b>, we played football every day because you need nothing. You just need friends and a ball. You can even play alone. The most learning to play football is in the street. This is where I learn. If you look at the national team of France, every player comes from the suburbs. The passion is here and has been for a long time<br /><br /><b>[Nanterre is a shining example of that, with that passion at the heart of an area turning its reputation around]</b> Every kid, the parents, are very proud because the neighbourhood has a good image now. When you make tournaments with your connections, for you it’s nothing, but for the kids, they never meet professional players, so it’s big. I try to give a good spirit. If you are a kid and you grow up in a poor neighbourhood, you see all the bad things. For me, the best thing for a kid to have is an example. If you have a good example, you can grow up good and you can have ambition. Before, the image <b>[of Nanterre]</b> was of a very difficult and very poor neighbourhood with stories of drugs and murder. Now, it’s about good things<br /><br /><b>[It’s that which has created some notable alumni: Abdoulay Diaby, Mali’s captain; Mickael Malsa, an ex-Ligue 1 midfielder with Sochaux; and defender Moise Adilehou, who went to the Africa Cup of Nations this year with Benin. But Thiam has now arguably surpassed all of them to become Nanterre’s proudest son]</b> You don’t have to leave your neighbourhood. You can bring the world to your neighbourhood</p>
