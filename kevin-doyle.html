  <p><b>[Republic of Ireland striker Kevin Doyle not chasing <a href="robbie-keane.html">Robbie Keane</a>’s goalscoring record]</b> That’s going to be untouchable for a long, long time. I’m just trying to get as many as I can and play for as long as I can. It’s not all about scoring goals. That’s going to be untouchable for a long, long time. I’m just trying to get as many as I can and play for as long as I can. It’s not all about scoring goals<br /><br />I enjoy both of them, I enjoy trying to set up as much as scoring. Strikers nowadays, it’s turning more into a game like that. It depends on who you’re playing with and how you’re playing. With Ireland it’s the way we play. I’m used more as the target man to hold it up, but obviously I’m doing both and trying to get involved with everything<br /><br /><b>[Doyle, who turns 27 in two weeks, also said that he was used to playing as a lone striker with his club and that helped him develop his all-round game]</b> Maybe with <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> when we play one up front I’m in sort of a similar role. When we play two up front, not so much. It’s good to be able to try to do them all. I think the managers appreciate it and to be either the one who’s getting on the flick-ons or doing it yourself. For some reason the ball seemed to be moving a lot in the warm-up. Shay <b>[Given]</b> had mentioned to hit it as soon as you get it so I struck it sweetly enough and it flew in. It was nice to see it going in</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> striker Kevin Doyle signs new four-year contract]</b> I’m delighted to have signed the new contract. It’s something we’ve talked about for a while and to be honest it’s been agreed for a while between myself and the manager and it was just a case of everything getting it all sorted. I don’t really think there was anything in the speculation this summer. I’d actually spoken to the gaffer on the very first day of pre-season when we talked about this contract and I was keen to get it done. I am very happy here and am just looking forward to carrying on with the season</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Doyle to join Colorado Rapids]</b> I am delighted and very excited to be moving to the Colorado Rapids. With so many great players moving to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to join up with the great American talent already there, it’s a great time to play in this league.<br /><br />Sporting Director Padraig Smith, President Tim Hinchey, along with Technical Director Paul Bravo and Head Coach Pablo Mastroeni have impressed me with their ambition and vision for the club. And Colorado is a great place to bring up a family<br /><br />I know from talking to <a href="robbie-keane.html">Robbie Keane</a> that <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is a great league to play in and I look forward to being another top Irish player there. I will be sad to leave <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a>, a truly great club that I’ve had the privilege to play for. I will always be grateful to the fans for their support; it is they who make <a href="wolves-fc.html">Molineux</a> such a special place. To be involved in the current squad that is on an exciting run is now my only focus, as it would mean so much to me to see us get back to the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Ireland international Doyle retires due to concussions]</b> Today I’m sad to announce that after listening to medical advice I will play no further part this season and will be retiring. This year it has been clear to me that heading the ball was becoming problematic and causing me to have repeated headaches. Two concussions this season and numerous others over the years have made this more concerning. After consulting the experts in this field, it has been decided that to avoid the possibility of these symptoms becoming more serious and permanent, I will be hanging up my boots for good<br /><br />I will take this opportunity to thank everyone who has supported me during my career, especially my family, all of the coaches and teammates I’ve had and the fans of any team I’ve played for whether in Ireland, the UK or the USA.<br /><br />I’d also like to thank the staff and everyone involved with Ireland during my 12 years in the national squad, they have always been supportive and for that I’m very appreciative</p>

  <p><b>[Kevin Doyle says new Ireland assistant <a href="damien-duff.html">Damien Duff</a> told him coaching was the last thing he wanted to do]</b> Keith has been with Stephen a good while so it’ll be easy for him, Damien knows them both so well and it’ll be interesting to see them work.<br /><br />This is a massive job for both of them, they’ve had fantastic club careers. Damien is a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> winner… it’s different as a coach but he’s put the groundwork in over the last number of years<br /><br />Speaking to him about it I didn’t think he would be a coach and he didn’t think he would be a coach. He told me once he dipped his toes in the water he just loved it.<br /><br />He loves everything about it and is really passionate about it. To have him coaching and wanting to be involved is really impressive, shows you what a top bloke he is. He was getting up at six o’clock in the morning to have the Shamrock Rovers under-15s in training, he was putting the hard yards in<br /><br />It wasn’t something he talked about too much in his playing career, wanting to be a coach. He told me the last thing he wanted to do was be a coach. It’s purely a love from once he did it, he’s passionate about it. That’s what you have to be in your job. He’s got a long-term plan I’d imagine to be the Ireland manager one day, or be a manager in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> or Airtricity League, but he seems to be going about it the right way</p>
