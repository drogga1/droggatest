  <p><b>[Standing at 158 centimetres tall, Josh Nisbet is officially the shortest player to ever grace the A-League]</b> It was an awesome experience and it’s kind of an iconic photo now that I look back at it. Usain Bolt’s an incredible bloke and athlete.<br /><br />Obviously there’s benefits and disadvantages of being shorter but it’s never really fazed me, it’s mainly other people who believe you need to be taller. Never bothered me and the coaches now obviously don’t believe it either. When I was younger a lot of coaches said you need to be taller or you’ll be better when you’re taller. A lot of doubt whether it would work out because of my height but look at me now<br /><br />I played my junior football in Queensland. Ben Cahn brought me down and said we’d give you a run in the A-League if you put in the work. He’s a very good coach, got a lot of potential and it was great he was able to take me under his wing<br /><br />I was working at Woolworths when the phone call came. That was a pretty great feeling but I was in the middle of work so had to go back to it. The bosses knew it was good news as soon as they saw me</p>
