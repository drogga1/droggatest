  <p><b>[Nice striker Alassane Plea has confirmed that he is likely to depart the club in the summer]</b> There have been talks and I don’t think that next year I’ll be here any longer<br /><br /><b>[Previously]</b> I know there’s been interest from Spain with teams that have been following my progress and watching me. Moreover, <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> is a league that’s very technical and is suited to attackers</p>

  <p><b>[Borussia Mönchengladbach striker Alassane Plea is understood to have attracted interest from a number of English clubs]</b> Even before I came to Mönchengladbach from Nice, there had been inquiries from <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. But I thought Gladbach were the better move, and it turned out to be the right decision</p>

  <p><b>[Plea, Thuram and Co. are determined to secure a return to the Champions League after a three-season absence]</b> I just hope that we win a lot of games, put in some great performances, and at the end of it all, qualify for Europe. We want to improve on last season at the very least. We have a good team with plenty of quality and a great coach to back that up, who prepares us so well for every game. Now it’s down to us to give the best performances we can every weekend when we step out on that pitch</p>
