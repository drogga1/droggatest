  <p><b>[With the Merseysiders preparing for the start of their second full season under the 50-year-old, there is now no mistaking their distinctness]</b> We have taken positive steps forward to create a common idea of playing football. We are not fully satisfied because there is always room to improve and there is always a next level to reach. We know having a specific way is important because it gives one direction to the entire club. It’s a message to say, ‘This is us, this is what we believe in, and this is what we will continue to work on’. We play simple and quick. We don’t want to get fixed in a situation by an opponent. We want to make sure we are well-orientated. We are always working hard to play good football<br /><br /><b>[There is also no point singling out individuals for errors]</b> We have one big headline: everyone is responsible for everything. Even if one player makes a mistake, as a team we could have given him a clearer option, offered more protection, been more aware of the situation. This is what we try to live by because we can only achieve things together. Individual quality will always be less than the complete power of the team<br /><br />Football is a game of mistake management. You can’t avoid making mistakes, but you can be better prepared in how to minimise them and deal with them</p>

  <p><b>[Mohamed Salah’s exploits at Liverpool, which have delivered 37 goals, suggest he can reach the levels of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> I personally noticed him for the first time during our friendly match with Borussia Dortmund before the 2013-2014 season against FC Basel. At that time he tore everything up on the right wing. Since then, his name has been in our thoughts. After his strong season at AS Roma, he became really interesting again for us in Liverpool, so we included him in our scouting missions. His greatest strengths are his mixture of speed and goal threat. From the moment we got an eye on him, he scored a goal almost every second game. We also watched him in the national team to get a sense of what his best position is and how it fits with our system. He has been scoring goals for almost two years now and suits our age structure perfectly. He also has a strong personality. Although he is a goal-getter, he plays for the team and also defends and creates goals. We made an absolute top transfer with him.<br /><br />He is calm and knows exactly what he wants. He is very balanced and manages to get his body into shape, allowing him to perform every three days. This is of course a valuable factor for any coach, when someone practically guarantees this level of performance. He is totally down to earth despite the current hype and shows no ego at all. Constantly performing at this level over such a prolonged period of time, as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo do for example, is a great art. To have the ability to adapt to certain, perhaps new situations, to learn new things, to stay hungry - this is what distinguishes the really great players. They can practically never be defeated. We have the impression that he is on the right track in this regard. He always listens attentively when it comes to defending, for example, and constantly asks where and how he can improve</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid have become a results monster]</b> In recent years they have become a results monster in the Champions League and have an insane experience. If you go through their final squads of the last two years, they have only exchanged one position in 2017 compared to the previous year and would theoretically be in a position to set up the same team again this year as in the last final. Meanwhile, they have the next generation with players like Marco Asensio or Lucas Vasquez in the hindquarters, all of which are incredibly good and already very experienced. Real are simply extremely experienced; they know each other blind, have incredible footballing qualities and experience in abundance. We want to and must play the game of our lives to meet this challenge.<br /><br />We did not suffer a total failure in any of the lost finals. Besides we haven’t lost all the finals, we’ve also won one. If you add in the German Supercup, which resembles a final, then we’re up to three victories. Ultimately, each final always tells its own story. The only commonality I can see is that we hardly ever went to a final as a favourite, but always fought our way there through above-average performances</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool coach proud of how Reds responded to ‘painful’ Coutinho exit]</b> His change was very painful, because we lost his quality and special style of play. So we had to ask ourselves: Can the group deal with this? Can we respond to this urgent call to change? In the end we answered in the affirmative. Phil was a formative figure with us. It was a pity he left. Fortunately, we have managed to absorb his loss collectively. Of course, one notices whether a player is happy or unhappy. When a club approaches a player and suggests things to him, such as he might force a situation that complicates the situation for his current employer, that’s not nice and distressing for everyone. Of course, that was also a topic in the group, even though Phil had made the best possible contribution to the team until the last day in Liverpool.<br /><br />We’ve already looked around, but when you do that, you notice relatively quickly how much the prices have exploded since the Neymar transfer last summer. Every club knew that there are now €222m in Barcelona. This led to a few incredible stories and a spiral that you felt, for example, not only with us, but also in Dortmund <b>[where Borussia Dortmund lost Dembele for £135.5m]</b>.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> assistant coach Peter Krawietz has insisted that the spending power of rival <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> teams means that the Reds’ hopes of winning the title remain ‘insanely ambitious’]</b> Much more important <b>[to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and the coaching staff]</b> is always the entire work. We do not just focus on the championship, we want to initiate long-term development and improvement. Against this background, the championship is undoubtedly a goal and our maximum desire. We know, however, that <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> will probably not be the financially strongest force in England in the next few seasons. Therefore, this remains an insanely ambitious goal. We will keep trying. However, the fact that squad quality and depth are a major factor in this cannot be ignored.<br /><br />Put it this way, it did not surprise me that this player against our player, in a duel, tries to act with all the means he can. Whether he wanted to <b>[hurt <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Salah</a>]</b> or not, he has done his team a great favour<br /><br /><b>[Following the match in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> said it was one of his side’s best performances of the year]</b> We played a really great game there and put <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in a game situation that they neither expected nor are used to. As an away team, we dominated the ball possession and pressed them so hard that they had to resort to completely different means than usual in home games. It was almost inexplicable that we did not score with our good chances. With this feeling, we then went to the return leg. We always knew we could play a style that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> does not like again. And we always knew that it can be a relatively fun evening when we combine our pressure with successful finishes in front of goal<br /><br /><b>[The winning strike that night came from <a href="divock-origi.html">Divock Origi</a>, but was set-up by the quick thinking of <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> , who picked out his Belgian team-mate from a corner before <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> players were in position to respond]</b> We rehearsed that for weeks! No, that was actually due to Trent’s responsiveness. The fact is that we repeatedly address fast-paced set pieces, we consider different scenarios around a corner or free-kick and continuously practice them. But we encourage and demand variability from our players in every case. In this case, long-term training and constant repetitions resulted in a wonderfully spontaneous action</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Krawietz says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s biggest challenge at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> four years on from taking over as manager is to keep setting new standards]</b> It’s always like this - teams who are successful will always be something like a role model. It’s an honour. And a challenge as well, because the standards are set and in order to improve you have to go on, you have to keep the level high and always look at the little details.<br /><br />For example, this season there are new rules about goal-kicks. With this, we have to think anew about the details and that keeps it interesting. We’ll try to get better and keep the high level and standards. The game is developing; we try to be inventive. Our philosophy, our style of play won’t change too much but the details are always interesting. It never gets boring! With the energy and the fuel, you need to go on, try to proceed and try to stay successful<br /><br /><b>[<a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> has struck up a big affinity with Reds fans and the city of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> during his reign, a factor Krawietz says is vital to their methods]</b> We always felt something like an identity with the club we were working for. In Mainz, it was our hometown where we grew up - so obviously it was easy because it was natural. We found this in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> pretty quickly. And it is, and was, the same here in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. The more you learn about this city, of course adapting a little bit, and learn how people think and what they expect … of course, it helps if you have a little bit of success!<br /><br />Then people can see from the outside things are going forward. This is what we always wanted. We thought the things we want to invent take a bit of time - a long-term idea - and we’d come somewhere where we’d try to make an impact for the whole club, something that stays for longer even if you are not here anymore. Something which stays - not only trophies and a good time - and that it can go on. It worked in Mainz, it worked in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and I hope we are in a good way to do it as well in Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Krawietz has offered an insight into the recruitment process at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> If a coach gears his team to a certain style, he will certainly have to pay attention to a certain requirement profile. If, for example, he decides on a high level of attacking pressure, this requires a certain degree of organisation. This is defined by the compactness of your team. This means, firstly, that these defenders have to be tactically skilful and courageous and, secondly, that they have to have a certain amount of speed because they naturally give up space. So that would be a prerequisite for defenders, and others are the attitude and tenacity of the whole team<br /><br />Basically, in the end, it should not be a question of condition. It should be: how organised am I? With how much willingness do I really want to carry out this approach over 90 minutes? This is also a question of your own assertiveness. Now it all comes down to this: how impressed is a team at the moment when this method doesn’t work? Large space for the opponent, he might get a big scoring chance. Are you now ready to press as a team, do you stay convinced and draw energy from the moments when your plan is working out? There is a high demand on concentration and stamina of the inner attitude, less on the stamina of physical strength</p>
