  <p><b>[Peter Krawietz says <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s biggest challenge at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> four years on from taking over as manager is to keep setting new standards]</b> It’s always like this - teams who are successful will always be something like a role model. It’s an honour. And a challenge as well, because the standards are set and in order to improve you have to go on, you have to keep the level high and always look at the little details.<br /><br />For example, this season there are new rules about goal-kicks. With this, we have to think anew about the details and that keeps it interesting. We’ll try to get better and keep the high level and standards. The game is developing; we try to be inventive. Our philosophy, our style of play won’t change too much but the details are always interesting. It never gets boring! With the energy and the fuel, you need to go on, try to proceed and try to stay successful<br /><br /><b>[Klopp has struck up a big affinity with Reds fans and the city of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> during his reign, a factor Krawietz says is vital to their methods]</b> We always felt something like an identity with the club we were working for. In Mainz, it was our hometown where we grew up - so obviously it was easy because it was natural. We found this in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> pretty quickly. And it is, and was, the same here in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. The more you learn about this city, of course adapting a little bit, and learn how people think and what they expect … of course, it helps if you have a little bit of success!<br /><br />Then people can see from the outside things are going forward. This is what we always wanted. We thought the things we want to invent take a bit of time - a long-term idea - and we’d come somewhere where we’d try to make an impact for the whole club, something that stays for longer even if you are not here anymore. Something which stays - not only trophies and a good time - and that it can go on. It worked in Mainz, it worked in <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> and I hope we are in a good way to do it as well in Liverpool</p>

  <p><b>[Peter Krawietz has offered an insight into the recruitment process at Liverpool]</b> If a coach gears his team to a certain style, he will certainly have to pay attention to a certain requirement profile. If, for example, he decides on a high level of attacking pressure, this requires a certain degree of organisation. This is defined by the compactness of your team. This means, firstly, that these defenders have to be tactically skilful and courageous and, secondly, that they have to have a certain amount of speed because they naturally give up space. So that would be a prerequisite for defenders, and others are the attitude and tenacity of the whole team<br /><br />Basically, in the end, it should not be a question of condition. It should be: how organised am I? With how much willingness do I really want to carry out this approach over 90 minutes? This is also a question of your own assertiveness. Now it all comes down to this: how impressed is a team at the moment when this method doesn’t work? Large space for the opponent, he might get a big scoring chance. Are you now ready to press as a team, do you stay convinced and draw energy from the moments when your plan is working out? There is a high demand on concentration and stamina of the inner attitude, less on the stamina of physical strength</p>
