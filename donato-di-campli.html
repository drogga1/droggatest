  <p><b>[Donato Di Campli on <a href="marco-verratti.html">Marco Verratti</a>]</b> France stole the Mona Lisa. Then they stole Marco, the best Italian of his time. They say that <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> is worth €100m. <a href="marco-verratti.html">Verratti</a> is worth just as much. The biggest clubs are interested in him</p>

  <p><b>[Marco Verratti’s agent insists the Italy international is more than happy with his adventure at Paris Saint-Germain]</b> I believe that would be a major difficulty. Marco is more than happy with his adventure at Paris Saint-Germain, a club with which he has a contract until 2021 and one where he is greatly admired by the supporters. It’s obvious that he wants to win.<br /><br />There are a lot of teams interested in him, but you would have to ask PSG. Will he stay in Paris for life? I can assure you - no. I can confirm that he has had offers from Italy, but I have no news at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Marco Verratti’s agent has warned suitors that he costs more than his weight in gold]</b> How much does he cost? It’s difficult, it’d take a lot of gold bullion. So much … and even then it won’t be enough. I think that he doesn’t have a price because PSG don’t want to sell him. Marco has a contract until 2021 and he wants to respect it, winning the league and the Champions League.</p>

  <p><b>[Marco Verratti’s agent has hit out at reports that the PSG star was seen exiting a nightclub after midnight in the build-up to the Ligue 1 giants’s Champions League meeting with Barcelona at Camp Nou]</b> I don’t want to get into the relationship with PSG but what’s certain is that which was written by l’Equipe is completely false. We will pursue legal action and we are studying which path to follow. The image of Verratti is sacred and we will not allow anyone to discredit it. It’s one thing to criticise the boy technically but it’s another to get into personal issues, saying things that are absolutely untrue<br /><br />Inter? Marco has a contract until 2021 with PSG and it will have to be the club to tell us to leave because we’re fine <b>[in Paris]</b>. We have nothing to say on other things</p>
