  <p><b>[<a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> swooped minutes before the summer transfer window closed to seal their latest signing, recruiting <a href="derby-county.html">Derby County</a> goalkeeper Scott Carson on loan]</b> It’s an honour to have signed for City on loan. It’s something I didn’t expect but an opportunity I simply could not turn down. To be part of this squad - the champions of England - is a dream come true<br /><br /><b>[Carson joins the likes of <a href="rodri.html">Rodri</a> and <a href="joao-cancelo.html">Joao Cancelo</a> in moving to the Etihad over the summer]</b> I can’t wait to see Pep’s work on the training field up close. What he has achieved in his management career has been amazing, and it’s every player’s dream to play under him. Hopefully, my experience will prove useful as we try and make it three <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> titles in a row</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> keeper Carson on Istanbul, <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> and <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>’s genius]</b> It’s one of those mad nights where you just think ‘it was meant to happen. You could play that game 100 times and Milan would win 99, but sometimes destiny is on your side<br /><br /><b>[Carson was an unused substitute as <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> pulled off their miraculous comeback at the Ataturk Stadium. He was just 19 years old, and had moved to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> just four months earlier. His professional career, to that point, totalled just eight matches]</b> I felt strange, to be honest. I’d not been at the club long, so it didn’t really feel like my success, if you get me? I didn’t feel like I’d earned it.<br /><br />Yeah. You see some people at the front of the celebrations and they have barely played. That always sat uncomfortably with me. Josemi was one of them. The whole time I was there, I don’t think I spoke to him once. I’m not sure he spoke a word of English to be honest, but he made sure he was front and centre when the cup was being lifted! I’ve seen other players do it, and you think ‘what are you doing?’. You have to think how it’s going to look. If you’ve played most of the games, fair enough, but I’d only been at the club a couple of months. I arrived when most of the groundwork had been done<br /><br /><b>[He swapped shirts with the great <a href="gianluigi-buffon.html">Gianluigi Buffon</a>, but left the ground fretting after allowing <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a>’s second-half header to slip through his hands, gifting <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> what looked like a vital away goal]</b> All I was thinking before the game was ‘don’t let them down. <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Benitez</a> never told me I was playing until an hour-and-a-half before kick-off, which was probably a good thing as it meant I didn’t have time to think. I made a save in the first half from <a href="alessandro-del-piero.html">Del Piero</a>, and maybe I was thinking ‘this is easy’. I went too early for the <b>[<a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Cannavaro</a>]</b> header, and it’s gone in. Luckily there was no social media then, so I got off lightly, but even though we won 2-1, I’m thinking ‘have I cost us there?’. I have never been so relieved as when the final whistle went in the second leg <b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> drew 0-0 to progress to the semi-finals]</b>.</p>
