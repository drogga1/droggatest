  <p>This election would be much better if the NCPO <b>[National Council for Peace and Order]</b> fully transition government over to a political faction, they should not be running at all. I have no problem personally with Prayut Chan-ocha but if he stepped in as prime minister, he would step in with no integrity and there is no way he could last long. After the election, his command will be blowing in the wind</p>

  <p><b>[In an interview with the Financial Times this week, he would not confirm reports that he had demanded the prime minister’s post in exchange for joining a Pheu-Thai led government. However, Mr Anutin confirmed he was interested in the top job]</b> I am the only candidate nominated by the Bhumjaithai party for prime minister, so if I have enough votes to form a majority, why not?<br /><br /><b>[He says he will not commit to either camp before the coronation and the announcement of final results in early May]</b> According to the timetable, nothing can be achieved before May. We have our big event coming along, so things will really proceed after our historical ceremony <b>[referring to the coronation]</b><br /><br /><b>[He objected to the notion of ‘democratic’ and ‘military’ political camps, which he described as ‘just wordings’]</b>After the election, some people are still trying to create factions again, so what’s the point of having an election? We need to reunify and reform<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether he saw himself as a kingmaker for the next coalition, he laughed and answered in a riddle]</b> Why don’t we watch the dance and see who looks best on the stage?</p>
