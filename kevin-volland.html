  <p><b>[Bayer Leverkusen team-mate Kevin Volland says <a href="kai-havertz.html">Kai Havertz</a> is a man in demand, with the likes of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> all said to be on his trail]</b> He should sit down with his parents and make a decision that he supports 100 per cent. My simple advice to him would be: Do what you really want to do<br /><br /><b>[He added on his first experiences of a hot prospect]</b> It was immediately obvious that Kai is a gifted footballer. He was tall but not as athletic as he is now. I can still remember a duel with him. I said to myself: ‘Oh, the youth player, I will easily defeat him in a duel’. However, I found that Kai was more robust than I thought. And he has always shown himself eager to learn<br /><br /><b>[Volland once had the opportunity to head for the Allianz Arena himself, but he opted to link up with 1860 Munich at 15 years of age as he saw better potential for progress and first-team development]</b> I saw at 1860 the greater opportunities to become a professional. At that time, 1860 attached great importance to youth work and relied on good youth players for the first team. It was different with <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a>. They already had an outstanding squad and the financial means to bring some world-class players in<br /><br /><b>[Leverkusen are currently competing alongside the <a href="juventus.html">Bianconeri</a> in Champions League Group D, with Volland saying of the challenges they pose in the wake of a 3-0 defeat in <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a>]</b> After the game against <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> I would say <a href="juan-cuadrado.html">Juan Cuadrado</a> <b>[is the hardest I’ve faced]</b>. He made life pretty difficult for me. I knew in advance that he was a great offensive player, but had thought that he would have his weaknesses on the defensive side. Then he got me constantly on my feet</p>
