  <p><b>[Brahim Diaz has rejected the opportunity to join <a href="getafe-fc.html">Getafe</a> on loan]</b> We’ve asked <b>[Madrid president Florentino]</b> Perez for Brahim. Perez told me that they’re OK with that, but it depends on what the boy wants - and it seems like he doesn’t want to leave Madrid right now. So we’ll have to see. Our coach likes him; it’s a possibility</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="getafe-fc.html">Getafe</a> president opens door for Angel Rodriguez to move to Camp Nou]</b> Who wouldn’t like to go to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>?. The club has to be prepared for this. It’s not an issue of the release clause but one where I cannot deny a player that has given us so much and has had spectacular performances, the opportunity to join a big club. The price would not be an obstacle<br /><br />I have a good rapport with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> but right now no one at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> has contacted me. There have been a few names circulating but I’ve told him (Rodriguez) to continue to work, score goals and be calm…whatever has to happen will happen</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="getafe-fc.html">Getafe</a> refusing to travel to Milan for Inter clash due to coronavirus fears]</b> Unless things change, tomorrow <b>[Wednesday]</b> <a href="getafe-fc.html">Getafe</a> will not travel to Italy. We have asked <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> to look for an alternative to play in Milan. We do not want to get into the middle of the coronavirus, we have no need. We have also asked the <b>[Royal Spanish Football]</b> Federation for help to demand the suspension. If we have to lose the tie, we will lose it. I will not be the one to assume any risk. It makes us very emotional, but if it has to be this way, it will be. I have been told to ask the Ministry of Public Works for a special permit <b>[to allow travel to Italy]</b>, but I will not ask for any permission. I will not go to a place where I do not want to go. The people of Inter with whom we have spoken recognise that it is incomprehensible that we have to travel there. I am not going to consent. <a href="getafe-fc.html">Getafe</a> will not fly. We are not going to go to Italy. Either the game is moved from there, or it is postponed. The most sensible thing would be to postpone it. <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> tells us to ask the government for a special permit <b>[to travel]</b>. I will not do it, I will stick to the laws of my country</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="getafe-fc.html">Getafe</a> were refusing to travel to Italy for their scheduled last-16 first leg against Inter]</b> The Spanish government, which is what we have to follow, has banned return flights between Spain and Italy. The Italian government has banned its own competition out of fear of further spread of the disease. If we were to put ourselves in the firing line by playing there, it would be a contradiction that doesn’t make any sense. It would be great to play the tie against Inter and we were very excited as a club and a fan base, but if that can’t happen and we have to lose the tie, we’ll do so with our heads held high</p>
