<blockquote>
  <p>Two-and-a-half years ago, he had just completed the penultimate year of high school and was eyeing an aviation engineering degree. He was an ambitious, rap music-loving student heading to Egypt, his parents’ country of birth, for a summer holiday<br /><br />On Tuesday, his tenth court hearing is due. The mass trial, which has been postponed and adjourned for more than a year, is to be attended by 493 other defendants but there are concerns the date might again be moved further forward<br /><br />In any case, ‘the sheer number of people involved in Ibrahim’s trial renders any concept of due process or the right to a defence meaningless,’ according to Reprieve, a UK-based rights group that campaigns against the death-penalty, a punishment that Ibrahim could face if convicted<br /><br />The recent hunger strike has alarmed Ibrahim’s family, human rights organisations and those who have shared a cell with him; their greatest fear is that the Irishman - who suffers from depression - is close to suicide<br /><br />A rush of tear gas, live fire and rubber-coated steel bullets hit the mosque. Ibrahim was shot in the leg and hand - injuries which to this day have not been properly treated<br /><br />The siblings slept in the mosque overnight. The next day, they were all arrested and taken to a military camp, later to be moved to prison. The sisters were released on bail after three months and returned home to South County Dublin<br /><br />Colm O’ Gorman heads Amnesty International in Ireland and is among the activists campaigning for Ibrahim’s release<br /><br />Ibrahim’s father, Sheikh Hussein Halawa, is the Republic of Ireland’s most senior Muslim cleric and the imam at the country’s biggest mosque, in Clonskeagh. Scared that Egyptian authorities might target him, he remains in Ireland and has not seen his son for over a year<br /><br />The people that know Ibrahim say that at 17, he did not have political ideas. Days before his arrest, he had been visiting tourist sites and unlike his sisters, he hadn’t attended previous rallies. He is not a dual citizen. He is an Irish passport holder who paid for his visa on arrival<br /><br />Baher Mohamed, an Al Jazeera journalist who happened to end up in a cell with Ibrahim. They shared a space for around six months, along with Peter Greste and Mohamed Fahmy, the other journalists with the network accused of spreading ‘false news’ during their coverage of demonstrations protesting the military overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi in 2013<br /><br />Mohamed says he felt protective of Ibrahim, who was excited to be able to speak in English with the journalists. Describing him as noble, decent, kind, stubborn and a pacifist, he recalls their time together as sometimes desperate<br /><br />Though the particular institution they were jailed in together, Al Masra, had slightly better conditions, they were traumatised by recent experiences in other prisons: Insect infested and cramped sleeping conditions, solitary confinement, little - sometimes rotten - food being served, aggressive guards, no fresh air, poor quality uniforms that caused allergic reactions, no exercise, and regular lockdowns including during festive periods such as Eid<br /><br />Baher Mohamed was freed in September this year after a presidential pardon, along with Fahmy. Greste was released in February, news which <a href="ibrahim-halawa.html">Ibrahim Halawa</a> celebrated genuinely, without envy, Mohamed says.<br /><br />Around 600 people were sentenced to death in 2015, more people are actually being executed, and at least 15 mass trials have taken place since March 2014, Reprieve has found<br /><br />Human Rights Watch has said that between July 2013 and May 2014, under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s leadership, authorities ‘detained, charged, or sentenced at least 41,000 people … straining Egypt’s prisons and aggravating hugely overcrowded conditions’</p>
