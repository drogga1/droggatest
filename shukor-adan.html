  <p>[Shukor Adan admitted that they lost to a better team] This is football, and we are disappointed with this defeat but we must switch our focus to Super League now. We didn’t blame anyone for this defeat. We know JDT is a good team and I think we did our best already.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Shukor Adan stated that the team has responded well since Sathianathan took over the squad from Azmi Mohamed] The arrival of Sathianathan as a coach really played an important role to the team. We are yet to lose under him, so I think the players can accept his instruction really well. I believe the team really need his experience in local football in order for us to go through the whole season.<br /><br />First game, some of us don’t have the experience playing in the AFC Cup, so we were nervous. We did or best but we were unlucky so I hope we can give our best in the upcoming game against Hanoi FC</p>
