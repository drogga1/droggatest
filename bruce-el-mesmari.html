<blockquote>
  <p><b>[El Mesmari, the Mexican ‘Bruce Lee’ dreaming of a Brazil reunion]</b> Mum tells me I was named Bruce after Bruce Lee. They were going to call me Brandon, after his son, but I’m really grateful they didn’t as I don’t like the name.<br /><br /><b>[he even considered dedicating himself to martial arts, before settling on football in the end]</b> I was a black belt but, when the time came to make up my mind, I chose football<br /><br /><b>[does this talent for football run in the family?]</b> I don’t think so to be honest. None of my ancestors played the game. I’m the first<br /><br /><b>[Family ties]</b> When I found out that the World Cup had been switched to Brazil, I was very happy. I knew I’d be able to see my relatives after many years. I’ve been in contact with them since before the tournament, urging them to come and watch me<br /><br /><b>[In his side’s opening game against Paraguay, the 17-year-old came off the bench in the 55th minute]</b> My heart was beating fast. I’d been working towards that moment since I was a young boy. A World Cup in your age category… it’s something every young kid dreams of. They live in Sao Paulo. They promised me that if we get to the knockout phase, they’ll come to watch me, so it’s extra motivation to get through<br /><br /><b>[Of course, the dream scenario would be to go all the way and help Mexico win a third world title in this category on 17 November]</b> We’ve come here prepared to lift the trophy. Obviously, we’ll be taking things one game at a time, but we know what we’ve come here to do and will be giving our all to achieve it … football is what I love the most, and I think I’ll achieve great things</p>
