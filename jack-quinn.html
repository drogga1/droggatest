<blockquote>
  <p>We were thrilled to have <a href="leo-varadkar.html">Leo Varadkar</a> in the office. I have participated in the Washington Ireland Program for many years. In our office, right up to the office I am in today, our interns work. The interns are not there to make copies. They work, they sit down with the rest of our staff who are there for ten years or more and they do all that needs to be done.<br />,br&gt;Leo was actively involved and it was a busy time in the Congress so I hope he got a good flavour of what Congressional office in the United States looks like and the work that is done in a district that represents 700,000 people<br /><br />He was an ambitious young man who was bound for success in a lot of different ways.<br /><br /><b>[Mr Quinn recalls that <a href="leo-varadkar.html">Leo Varadkar</a>’s internship in Capitol Hill was during the controversial period between the Bill Clinton and George W Bush administrations]</b> After the presidential election we had the whole business of the Supreme Court cases over who would be the president. The calls that were coming into my office were off the charts on both sides of that issue. It wasn’t enough to say ‘Thanks for calling’. These people expected answers and Leo actually led some of the others in our office with developing those answers so that they were complete and left people satisfied. I hope that kind of experience was helpful but I must tell you, he gave us more that we gave him</p>
