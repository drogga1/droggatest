  <p><b>[Former <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> striker Andy Gray says <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> is a better player than <a href="naby-keita.html">Naby Keita</a>, <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Georginio Wijnaldum</a>, <a href="phil-foden.html">Phil Foden</a> and <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a>]</b> I know he’s a Villa fan, his family are all Villa fans, he loves the club and he loves being captain. But Jack’s 24 now and I think there is a decision coming at the end of this season. And I hate to say it, but I don’t think he’ll be there in August.<br /><br />If I was a coach of any of the top six, and I include <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in this, he would make the team better. He is, in my opinion, better than any of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s midfield players. I think he is better than Keita. I think he’s better than <a href="gini-wijnaldum.html">Wijnaldum</a>. I think he’d get into the City side. He’s much better than <a href="phil-foden.html">Foden</a>. I just think he’s that good.<br /><br />When you give someone a football, you watch somebody on a football pitch. He has a football at his feet and in his control. Special players, they just stand out. He might make mistakes, Jack, and he’s only 24. But the ball is part of his body. He moves with it beautifully. He has a goal in him. He creates for other players. He works hard. He’d walk into Spurs’ side. At <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> , I know they talk about <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> but I think right now he’s better than <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a>. If he’s getting sold this summer then I guarantee you that a host of the biggest clubs will be after him</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Gray on <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a>]</b> I’ve seen most things in this league in the last 25 years. I haven’t seen anything like him. I said at the beginning of the game that he was special, he’s more then that, he’s irreplaceable</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Gray urge <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> to sell <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> and bring in <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> for £70m]</b> We don’t know how football is going to come through this <b>[the coronavirus crisis]</b>. We don’t know if football is ever going to be the same again and whether It’ll affect player values and salaries. We’re entering a world of unknowns. But when the dust settles, if I could sell <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> for £100m and bring in <a href="jack-grealish.html">Grealish</a> for £70m I would do it in a heartbeat. It’s a no-brainer. United still might be able to get their money back on <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>. We know his value commercially and on social media with his millions of followers. That’s important to football clubs these days and it gives him an added kudos. But fans aren’t really bothered about all that. They just want him to contribute on the football pitch. He’s pretty much failed at United. Is it his own fault or just bad luck with injuries? I think it’s probably a combination of the two. I don’t know <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> so I’m not judging his character, I’m judging what he’s brought to United and it’s been nowhere near enough. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> seems the right fit for him - and his agent has been edging towards that</p>
