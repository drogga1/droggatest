  <p><b>[Singapore’s AFC Asian Cup qualifying draw]</b> We have been drawn against good teams in our group. At this stage, we are aware that there are no easy games and we will prepare ourselves accordingly. We are looking forward to the first match on 28 March, and will try our best to qualify for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup in the United Arab Emirates.</p>

  <p><b>[V Sundramoorthy has announced that veteran defender Baihakki Khaizan will not be considered for selection during Singapore’s upcoming 2019 Asian Cup qualifying campaign]</b> Baihakki is a long-time servant of the national team. We appreciate his commitment to the national team, and respect what he has achieved with the Lions. However, he is not part of my plans for the Asian Cup qualifiers, and I thought it was important to meet him and tell him this myself. I thank Baihakki for what he’s given to the team</p>

  <p><b>[Varadaraju Sundramoorthy has said that he may utilise youngster Irfan Fandi as a defender]</b> He has a good physical presence, is strong in the air, a ball winner and fits into the role of a central defender. I have confidence in Irfan that he is a good central defender. I believe that Irfan is a hard-working player. Although he is still young, he is consistently improving his play as a central defender.</p>

  <p><b>[Singapore Lions Coach, V Sundramoorthy hoped for a packed stadium and said that it would provide invaluable exposure to his players as well]</b> Argentina are one of the top international teams and have in their squad many world-class players such as Barcelona forward Lionel Messi, Paris Saint-Germain winger Ángel Di María and Manchester City striker Sergio Agüero.<br /><br />FAS has worked very hard to finalise the match, which will benefit our players and coaches in terms of invaluable exposure as well as enhance the level of sporting entertainment for fans in Singapore. I am looking forward to leading my country out against such the two-time FIFA World Cup champions, and we hope that Singaporeans will come out in force to cheer us on. A packed stadium on 13 June will make a huge difference and give our players the boost they need against a team with so many talented world-class players.</p>
