  <p><b>[Switzerland coach Vladimir Petkovic urges Swiss improvement for Romania clash]</b> I always try and look at a team overall and I was impressed by the Romanian side as a whole. They did a great job and caused France a lot of problems - France are an excellent side. From a physical and psychological perspective they were doing very well. We will see if they can match that coming into this game. What we gave against Albania probably won’t be enough against Romania<br /><br />I’ve never said that anyone is a favourite but I think when someone finishes first then I give them a bit of an advantage. For this match, what will matter most is who approaches the game better. We really have to up the tempo throughout the 90 minutes because we’ve really seen that this Romanian side are able to play at a certain tempo for 90 minutes and they can threaten the opposition. With three points and qualification, clearly we want to do things correctly to write a great chapter in Swiss football history. Switzerland have never succeeded in winning two group matches so that would be a great thing to achieve and something to build on for the future</p>

  <p><b>[Petkovic takes heart but wants more against France]</b> I hope you’re satisfied because I am. We started well. <b>[I am pleased not]</b> only with the result, but the performance. I have to compliment my team on their psychological strength. In the first game we were not free, but today we showed we can do better<br /><br /><b>[But Petkovic, who replaced ailing striker Haris Seferovic with live-wire youngster Breel Embolo for the final half hour, believes there is more to come from his attacking players operating in front of Granit Xhaka]</b> We have to create more chances. During the next game against France we’ll have to do better and we have to finish our chances better. We have to concentrate on our game and just play better. I don’t know if <b>[Xhaka’s]</b> transfer has helped. He is in a good moment and a good place. I always said that a player needs a team to show his quality. He was helped out by his team-mates. From my point of view I think we dominated the 90 minutes. I saw the opposition fighting to the end, but so did we. Sometimes our opponents created some chances, but we stayed concentrated throughout<br /><br /><b>[On whether his team’s present haul would secure a last-16 berth, Petkovic preferred to err on the side of caution]</b> I think it’s too early to make any calculations. We’re not here to count points, but to play, and play even better in our third game - perhaps even win it against the favourites. We can do even more</p>

  <p><b>[Petkovic denies deliberate <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a> fouls as Switzerland rough up Brazil]</b> No, most of the duels were perfectly clean and very often we had one-on-ones with <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>. One of the key ingredients <b>[of the result]</b> was to neutralise him but there are different players in the Brazil squad who have great quality and they have shown that on the pitch. Of course, it was a strategic, psychological type of discipline and I am very proud of the discipline with which my team played and they did everything we talked about, which was very important in one-on-one situations but also collectively against this opponent. We were not actually able to implement it in the first half and that invited Brazil to be dangerous.<br /><br />As far as yellow cards are concerned there were a bit too many. I didn’t see any bad fouls. My team played it very cleverly. We did some good things and I’m pleased. I hope people will start taking notice of us. Sometimes there is a lack of recognition and that’s a pity because we played very well and only conceded once. We demonstrated that this team always believes in itself and we will continue to play with that consistency.<br /><br />Tomorrow we will recover a bit and then focus on the very difficult match coming up against Serbia. The opponent’s defensive players were not well-positioned - it wasn’t a foul. I didn’t see the penalty but I don’t complain because we have referees outside and inside the field. I saw it as a very clear situation</p>

  <p><b>[Switzerland boss Petkovic says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> the cherry on top for street smart Portugal]</b> Congratulations to Portugal. They had street smarts, they had the cherry on top of the cake and that made the difference. Four shots, three goals. On the one hand, we were up against a very strong opponent, but over 90 minutes we showed we’re a strong team and that we can make life for a top side difficult, too. We were trying to keep the score; we had the chance to get a second but didn’t take it. We got outnumbered at the back and conceded. Their top player made the difference<br /><br /><b>[Switzerland’s penalty was awarded in remarkable circumstances, with referee Felix Brych penalising Nelson Semedo for a trip on Steven Zuber after a VAR review, having initially given Portugal a spot-kick for a foul by Fabian Schar on Bernardo Silva]</b> The foul wasn’t that clear - the penalty we were given - but it was the right decision and in conformity with the rules and the referee did a very good job.</p>

  <p><b>[Switzerland coach and former Lazio manager Vladimir Petkovic admits he wanted to draw Italy but is certain they’ll be hard to stop in Group A]</b> I wanted to get Italy in the draw, while the Nazionale were fortunate too, seeing as they were paired with three opponents who will all battle for second place. It will be a pleasure for me to return to Italy and above all to Rome. We can’t wait. They <b>[Italy]</b> are one of the candidates to win the trophy. They’ll play three group games at home, but in the knockout rounds, anything is possible. I’ve been really impressed with the mentality that Mancini has given to this team. Winning helps to gain confidence and that brings solid results. The Azzurri have many new players, much like Switzerland, and we’ll see a lot of promising young faces in the tournament. The main problem is that not many of them are first choice players at club level</p>
