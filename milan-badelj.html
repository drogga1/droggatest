  <p><b>[For those that attended the Davide Astori’s funeral, their abiding memory will forever be the poignant tribute made by <a href="fiorentina-fc.html">Fiorentina</a> midfielder Milan Badelj, who had inherited the captain’s armband]</b> Dear, Davide. I take the word of… Your name in Hebrew means ‘loved’, and to see all of those that are here today to show you affection, I believe that this really was your name<br /><br />Davide, with your deep look, you managed to get inside people and stay there. You are not like all the others. You are the one that without knowing the language well, still managed to speak to all of us, speaking from the heart and keeping us united. You have the gift of the universal language of the heart<br /><br />Your mother, your father, they must know that they didn’t make any mistakes with you. You are exactly the son and brother that everyone would want to have. You are the best team-mate. that a guy could ever dream of. To have you at our side made us feel safe, to think ‘it’s okay, Davide’s here’. We cannot forget your laugh, your world of jokes with everyone. You, ‘world famous designer and part-time footballer’, as you used to love to describe yourself. You are football, though, that pure game that children play<br /><br />Our thoughts are with your family, Francesca and your princess Vittoria. The obligation of everyone that will be close to her will be to tell her who Davide was, because as your daughter grows up has to know who her father was. A man, with a capital ‘M’. I’ll finish with a story. In the morning, when you used to arrive in the physio room, you were always the one to turn out the lights. That’s what you were for all of us: light.<br /><br />Thank you, Davide</p>

  <p><b>[How Fiorentina have come together to create history following Astori tragedy]</b> Our thoughts go to your family, to Francesca and to princess Victoria. The task of all those close to her will be to tell her who Davide is, because your daughter growing up will have to know who her father was. A great man. I will finish with an anecdote. In the morning, when you arrived in the physiotherapy room, you were always the one to turn on the light. You are this for all of us; you are light. Thanks, Davide.</p>
