  <p><b>[Virat Kohli gives his views on a couple of The Best <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Men’s Player award nominees]</b> I take a lot of inspiration from <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. The way he has stayed on top for so many years, it’s nothing but down to hard work. I have heard he is the most hardworking footballer in the world and that’s why he is where he is. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is a freak, but this guy <b>[Ronaldo]</b> is giving him a run for his money because of his hard work</p>

  <p><b>[Virat Kohli is a superstar in his own right, with the India captain an iconic figure in the world of cricket, and he has had his say on the <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> versus <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> debate]</b> Tough question. But I would say <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is the most complete player that I have seen. Whether it’s the left foot, right foot, speed or dribbling skills, he’s amazing. I have not seen a better goalscorer. He revolutionised the sport and everyone followed him. His place is special, but if I had to take only one in my team who will give energy and intensity, it’s Cristiano<br /><br /><b>[While placing himself in Team <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, Kohli concedes that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> forward <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is a special talent and one that sits only fractionally behind a <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> frontman in his eyes]</b> It’s a personal preference. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is a freak, absolute natural talent, and his ability is second to none. For me, what stands out is the ability or the will to put in the effort in every single minute of the game. <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>’s drive separates him from everyone else. Playing at the top level, everyone has talent, but I don’t think anyone has the will that he has</p>
