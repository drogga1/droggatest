  <p><b>[Jerzy Dudek on <a href="karim-benzema.html">Karim Benzema</a>]</b> When I first saw his first training session, I was impressed.

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek writing in his autobiography, ‘Jerzy Dudek: A Big Pole in Our Goal’ about his falling out with manager <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafael Benitez</a> when he sought a move away from the club that he felt was being delayed by his boss]</b> To be completely honest, I genuinely considered punching Rafa in the face. Then the consequences of doing so flashed through my mind. Would he let me go? Or would it just lead to a massive media scandal? Surely I couldn’t stay if I gave him a smack? Punching a <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> manager who had won the European Cup only a few months earlier wouldn’t have looked too good on the CV, I guess, but I was still angry</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek has revealed that he was so desperate to leave at the end of his <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> days that he considered punching manager <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafa Benitez</a>]</b> Pepe was a great guy, but Rafa had signed a new goalkeeper at a moment when I felt like I was at the peak of my career. I told Rafa that the <b>[2006]</b> World Cup was on the horizon and I needed to be playing football. Cologne were interested, but a few days before the window closed, they called and said, ‘Why is Rafa not even talking to us?’ I was surprised - I thought everything had been agreed. The next day, I stormed up to him after training. He said, ‘They only offered a loan deal, and you’re too important for us. They want to give us £800,000, but what if <a href="pepe-reina.html">Reina</a> gets an injury? I can’t put £800,000 in a suitcase and put it between the goalposts’. Then I had this crazy thought - ‘I think I’ll just punch him in the face’. This evil whisper in my head was telling me that if I hit Rafa, they’d let me go to Cologne.<br /><br />Looking back today, I appreciate even more that I played for a club with the history of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Last year, I went to Madrid with my son and watched <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> win the Champions League again. As a player, I never understood why supporters cried after big wins - but when I saw the players running around with the cup in their hands, I had tears in my eyes. I understood even more about the love I still get from Reds fans</p>
