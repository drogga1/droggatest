  <p><b>[Manchester City are the best team in Europe and promise to put on quite a Champions League show against Napoli]</b> We are happy to have won a tough game, as it’s always difficult away to Roma. There’s a long way to go yet, we must stay calm and focus on recovering our energy to face the best team in Europe right now, Manchester City..<br /><br />I hope it’ll be a great game. Naturally, as a defender, I can’t hope for it to end 4-3, but everyone is waiting for these two teams who attack and score a lot of goals. We hope for a great performance and will be concentrated in Manchester. We’re in good shape too, I think the team has improved its mentality from previous years and doesn’t make the same mistakes. Because of that, we are getting more consistent results</p>

  <p><b>[Cristiano Ronaldo has been warned that he will struggle to get 40 goals for Juventus]</b> It’s true that in Italy, football is more tactical and defensive, as well as being very physical, so you have to know how to play. Cristiano’s a great player with tremendous quality, but in Italy it’ll be harder for him to score 40 goals. Also, I hope he doesn’t because it would be good for Juventus but bad for Napoli.<br /><br />He also started slowly with Madrid last season. He didn’t score goals at the start of the campaign, yet he finished up again with some mindboggling numbers. If Cristiano has spent his entire career scoring bags of goals every season, it’s not by chance</p>
