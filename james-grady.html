<blockquote>
  <p><b>[James Grady coached <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> from the age of 12 as part of the programme and it was there that the youngster’s unique ability first came to light]</b> He knows he doesn’t need to beat five players to look good. Billy understood it was better to be good than look good at a very early age. I describe him as a Modric-type player. He isn’t very big but he is technically as good as anyone with both feet. He has a tenacious side, he won’t overcomplicate things. He can dribble when he has to, he sees passes and he will get it and keep it until he can find a better pass.<br /><br />The biggest talent that he has got is that drive and real hunger to be the best. I have worked in football since I was 20 years old. I am 48 now. He is the role model I would still use if you want to get anywhere in football. He is hard-working, nothing is going to stop him. He came back to the school after he signed for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. He did a Q&amp;A and one kid asked him, ‘How was the jump from Rangers to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>?’ He said, ‘At Rangers, my mindset was I wanted to be the best at my team and club. I want to be the best here. I went to <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, I am now in an environment at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> where I need to try to be the best in the world. Not the best in the club because <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> can sign the best young players from all over the world’</p>
