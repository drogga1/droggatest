<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Wellington Phoenix owner looking to sell the club’s A-League licence]</b> As has been well reported in recent times, the A-League is in transition including a significant investigation by FIFA into the best governance model for the FFA and the impacts this will have on A-League and its independence. The FFA has a stated desire, noted without consultation with the clubs through APFCA, to expand the A-League. This has instigated a storm of speculation around licences. There are a number of parties interested and these parties have been talking to a number of clubs around A-League expansion and licences. Wellington has not been immune to this and it’s only appropriate that as a club we keep abreast of all possible options going around the clubs.<br /><br />The Welnix ownership group has invested a significant amount of money and continue to do so including an unprecedented investment into the club’s Academy which is A-League leading and is producing some significant player talent, an investment largely unsupported by the national body. It is not appropriate for any further speculation and we will not be making any decision on the future of this club until the future of the A-League is clearer which may not be for some time. Ultimately we remain focussed on our two key metrics - attendance at home games and viewership on Sky</p>
