  <p><b>[New <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> signing Erik Sviatchenko on emulating <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>, while not giving much praise for a certain <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> and Brazil defender]</b> I talked to my mental coach, I said to him I like <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> but I also like <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> and he said to me, ‘Okay, but you have to be Sviatchenko.’ I said of course I have to be Sviatchenko but I thought maybe I should be a defender that’s why I’m in the defence. So I said maybe I should be more like Terry because I saw <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> at the World Cup and he was terrible. So I find out that it’s better to be a good defender than a dribbling guy that cannot defend</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic defender Erik Sviatchenko says that losing 7-0 at Barcelona was an eye-opening experience]</b> It was tough. To be fair, it was an experience even during the game. Now I can reflect back on it even more, but it’s never nice to be a part of a loss that big, but you also learn. I think you saw into the next game that we learned something about it, but from a personal perspective it’s all about the small details. You make one mistake, one pass, that might not go for a goal otherwise, it immediately is punished when you play against Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez and so on. But it was a good experience and it was something I thought about during the game too.<br /><br />It wasn’t a turning point because it was so early in the season, but it was an eye opener in some ways - we need to do much better if we want to be as good as we want to be. The potential is something we can dwell on, because it’s something that’s shown really quickly. It’s only been six months since the summer, when we started with the new team. What we have learned, where we are now, how we are playing, it’s been really good</p>

  <p><b>[On Brendan Rodgers]</b> One of the main changes is how we play, but also socially, it’s been a big thing since the summer that people have come closer together and working really, really well. Everyone wants the best for each other and that’s a good thing.</p>

  <p><b>[Midtjylland vs Rangers. Former <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> man Erik Sviatchenko admits about Midtjylland’s chance]</b> I think our chance of going through is 50-50, but it will be insanely difficult. It’s going to be two exciting ties - Rangers will come to Denmark with a lot of fans and they have a really strong team. I had the pleasure of playing against them five times while at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. Rangers are physical and fast. But we are at home in the first leg and I think we have a chance if we can keep another clean sheet - something we have being doing a lot of recently. We have one aim and that is to get into the Europa League group stage</p>
