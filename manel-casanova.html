<blockquote>
  <p>[How Brahim Diaz became Man City’s most exciting prospect] The clubs don’t come to me, they go to the parents. We tried to fight, we offered him a contract with objectives, sporting objectives, we assured him that if he stayed he would play in the first division at 16 years old. Something that in England he could not have.<br /><br />We saw that he was a kid who was different. He’s a player with great vision. He starts three steps ahead of the others. When he receives the ball, he already has three options to carry out. When you are like that they don’t know if you’re going to go left or right<br /><br />I see him play in European games for City and for Spain’s youth teams and he still has that vision of the game that very few have. I don’t like where he has been played. For example, in Manchester, in the European games, they have had him as a central striker. For me, it’s not strange, it’s an error. He doesn’t have the physique to play against defenders like that. He’s better as a No.10<br /><br />[With many City fans now hoping he gets his chance in the first team, Casanova, back in Malaga, suggests that may not be the height of his ambition] In his heart, he is a Barcelonista</p>
