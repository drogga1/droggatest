  <p><b>[Daniel James is seemingly closing in on a £15 million move to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Joe Allen believes he knows which performance earned the move]</b> That was the day that probably sealed the potential Man United move. He was electric. He scored, got two men sent off and caused carnage all game. It was one of the best individual performances I have ever seen as a fellow player. He looks ready to make the next step, if I am honest. He has the potential to be a top player and I think he is ready for it. When we went down to nine men, <a href="ashley-williams.html">Ashley Williams</a> got the short straw to go out to right-back to deal with him. I think Dan took it easy on him - and Ash was giving him about a 30-yard cushion.<br /><br /><b>[James came close to leaving Swansea during the last transfer window back in January. Leeds believed that they had a deal in place, but a proposed agreement fell through and the Whites were left empty-handed]</b> Leeds wouldn’t have been a bad move, of course not, but it has almost been a blessing it didn’t happen. In the second half of the season I think there is plenty of clubs above that level who have come to the fore and that is the sort of bracket he is in now. Second half of the season, he has been on fire</p>

  <p><b>[Wales midfielder Joe Allen adamant <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> has now been vindicated]</b> He has delivered, simple as that. He came in off the back of a great manager who had huge success. It was always going to be tough but he has got us there. I think questions have been asked of everything really - selection, tactics - but nine times out of 10 he has got it right. That is one of the big reasons we have made it. The ambition and target was to get to the Euros. We would have loved to have done it more easily but beggars can’t be choosers. Any way you get there is huge success. A lot of people are going to have to eat their words with some of the criticism which has been thrown at us</p>
