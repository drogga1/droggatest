  <p><b>[Andorra vs Wales]</b> The change in the amount of teams that qualify has given us a boost. It is a group filled with tough teams, but we feel we can compete with them all. We’ve got the likes of Gareth and Aaron, who have played consistently at the highest level for their clubs, and they are going to bring that to the table for us as well, which is fantastic. The start is vital. We’ve got the belief and confidence we can make a good start and make big things happen in this group. We would prefer to play on grass, that’s what we do week in week out and it’s an obvious preference. But we’ve all played on artificial surfaces enough times to know what to expect from it, and it’s not a problem.</p>

  <p><b>[Joe Allen has backed Wales coach Ryan Giggs’ leadership]</b> It’s been a great experience for everyone since he’s come in. A lot of new ideas have come into the camp and many players have had the chance to get game time and try and impress.<br /><br />We’ve spoken a lot about the youngsters that have come into the set up, and that’s what has given us a lot of confidence about the future. We can’t wait for the <b>[Euro]</b> qualifiers in March, it’s a few months away and this was our last chance to be together before then. Our task now as players is to make sure we’re ready to fire when those games come around. We’re excited to see who we’ll be up against</p>

  <p><b>[Derby County midfielder Bradley Johnson has been handed a four-match ban for a biting incident against Stoke City]</b> People asked me at half-time what had happened and suggested I’d been bitten but to clear it all up, that didn’t happen. He might have caught a bit of my shirt but I think we can lay that one to rest</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="daniel-james.html">Daniel James</a> is seemingly closing in on a £15 million move to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. Joe Allen believes he knows which performance earned the move]</b> That was the day that probably sealed the potential Man United move. He was electric. He scored, got two men sent off and caused carnage all game. It was one of the best individual performances I have ever seen as a fellow player. He looks ready to make the next step, if I am honest. He has the potential to be a top player and I think he is ready for it. When we went down to nine men, <a href="ashley-williams.html">Ashley Williams</a> got the short straw to go out to right-back to deal with him. I think Dan took it easy on him - and Ash was giving him about a 30-yard cushion.<br /><br /><b>[James came close to leaving <a href="swansea-fc.html">Swansea</a> during the last transfer window back in January. <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> believed that they had a deal in place, but a proposed agreement fell through and the Whites were left empty-handed]</b> <a href="leeds-united.html">Leeds</a> wouldn’t have been a bad move, of course not, but it has almost been a blessing it didn’t happen. In the second half of the season I think there is plenty of clubs above that level who have come to the fore and that is the sort of bracket he is in now. Second half of the season, he has been on fire</p>

  <p><b>[Wales midfielder Joe Allen adamant <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> has now been vindicated]</b> He has delivered, simple as that. He came in off the back of a great manager who had huge success. It was always going to be tough but he has got us there. I think questions have been asked of everything really - selection, tactics - but nine times out of 10 he has got it right. That is one of the big reasons we have made it. The ambition and target was to get to the Euros. We would have loved to have done it more easily but beggars can’t be choosers. Any way you get there is huge success. A lot of people are going to have to eat their words with some of the criticism which has been thrown at us</p>
