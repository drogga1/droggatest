  <p><b>[Kodjo Fo-Doh Laba is among the most prolific goal scorers in the world over the past few months]</b> My dream, like every African player, is to play in Europe. Evidently, it is difficult to make the big jump from Africa to Europe for a young African player and to make a successful career in Europe. In Africa, it is so complicated due to the lack of infrastructure that we don’t have. Only 10 players out of 100 are successful<br /><br /><b>[On Emmanuel Adebayor]</b> My captain and a role model for all of us in Togo. And for me as a centre-forward I learn so much from him. He always gives us advice and tells us what to expect when we play in Europe as he himself had a great time there.<br /><br />It’s funny but like all young Africans, I started playing in the streets of my neighbourhood with my friends. But football was my life. I was playing every day. Someone saw me and took me to the Jeanne d’Arc club near me and voila, this is how my football career started. Even if Togo is a small footballing country, our country still produces talent. For me, everything started at the university where I was playing.<br /><br />I finished as top scorer of the university competition, and by then a club of the first division in Togo recruited me. I did well and that gave me the opportunity to get a two-year contract in Gabon. My second year, I was nominated the best foreign player in the league<br /><br />I couldn’t get the travel visa authorisation to go. So I keep working hard, believing in myself and we always say: tous ce que Dieu fai est bon <b>[everything God does is good]</b>.<br /><br />The 2017 AFCON was beneficial for me. It was my first big international competition. Thanks be to God, I scored one goal and it made me grow as well as a footballer and gave me some visibility on the international stage. The media coverage is great; clubs send scouts from all over the world to see new talents so personally my wish and the wish of all my team-mates in the national team is to be there<br /><br />I played against a lot of very good African players like <b>[Riyad]</b> Mahrez, <b>[Serge]</b> Aurier, <b>[Alex]</b> Iwobi, <b>[Andre]</b> Ayew and others with the Togo national team and I don’t think the difference is that big. The only difference is they play in better leagues, where the level is higher, so they improve a bit quicker and get more mature. That helps.<br /><br />Recently Aurier asked me after a friendly game against Ivory Coast in France: ‘Where do you play brother?’ And I said: ‘Morocco’. And the same with Mahrez when we played against Algeria. Both told me: ‘Brother, you have talent so don’t give up and you will get your chance’.</p>
