  <p><b>[Matthew Upson says <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> has been left in limbo at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> by mismanagement and poor recruitment calls]</b> <b>[A loss to Southampton]</b> leaves <b>[Emery]</b> in real limbo because I think he’s struggling. I was at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and I saw a really poor performance from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> <b>[in the 2-0 defeat]</b>. It was almost like they tried to cater to not get beat at <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> who were on top form, and this is <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, and never really got any kind of grip of the game<br /><br /><b>[When asked if certain players have given up on the current coach amid regular calls for change]</b> Maybe, maybe that’s the case, maybe there’s already a loss of belief or whatever it may be in the manager. He came to the club Emery and he tried to change things, he tried to be more disciplined. Again you have to look at the recruitment don’t you. To spend what they have spent on an attacking wide player, with the other issues that need to be addressed in the team. I thought he had a decent first season. At the end of last season, you thought ‘<b>[You’ve got]</b> this summer now but you have to make progress this season’ and I don’t think they have</p>

  <p><b>[Matthew Upson says <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> has a ridiculous CV but will he want <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>?]</b> When you rattle out the list of names from <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>, <a href="ac-milan.html">AC Milan</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> and you can go on and on. The Champions Leagues he’s won, the league titles won across three, four different leagues - his CV is ridiculous. But when he comes into those clubs they’re never normally suffering too much. He’s taken over from a relatively positive reign and the team is in quite good health, shall we say, and I think this <b>[managing <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> or Arsenal]</b> would be very much a different challenge<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a> would embrace the challenges of managing Arsenal]</b> Only he can answer that question. But he hasn’t really looked to take on that challenge before. Now whether or not that’s because he hasn’t had to is a different matter. Maybe the timings of things has been perfect, he always waited and said ‘all right, that one’. It’s meticulous the way he’s gone about the clubs and the success he’s had from one to the other, the condition he’s taken them over in and the condition he’s left them in. It’s been such a polished career so far - is he going to change it for a different challenge? Perhaps he wants that. Perhaps his touch will get the best out of that current group of players</p>
