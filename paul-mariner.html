  <p><b>[Arsenal’s approach to the long-running Aaron Ramsey saga is puzzling]</b> He should be playing, he should be playing, it’s as simple as that. He’s <b>[Unai Emery]</b> playing <b>[Matteo]</b> Guendouzi who’s going to be a good player but he’s not ready yet. You’ve got <b>[Lucas]</b> Torreira who’s fantastic, put Ramsey alongside Torreira and you’ve got something going on. Some of the decisions that the club have made are puzzling. You talk about <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez going for nothing to Manchester United.<br /><br />Now Ramsey is going to, in my opinion, probably one of the favourites for the Champions League. He’s just going to slot in there for fun. It doesn’t make any sense to me why they’re doing this. He’d be foolish not to sign the deal - £7.2m for five years per year, thanks for coming, give me the pen. It’s madness. Arsenal now are going to have to go out and by £50-60m to replace him. He’s in the building, he’s a top player. It’s killing me honestly, I love this kid.</p>

  <p><b>[Mesut Ozil has offered absolutely zero to Arsenal since signing a lucrative new contract with the club]</b> I’m dumbfounded why Arsenal would let <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez go. Sanchez, when I used to go to Arsenal to watch him play, he was phenomenal. It didn’t pan out so much for United but they let Sanchez go, they’re letting <b>[Aaron]</b> Ramsey go for nothing! What’s going on? And with Ozil, there’s something going on with Ozil that we don’t know about<br /><br />Arsenal decided to put all their eggs in one basket with Ozil, right? But what’s Ozil done for the club? Absolutely zero! Zero. Yes, he’s a fantastic player, but he’s got to get fit. He’s never fit! There’s something going on with this kid that we don’t know about</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Mariner says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have to consider offloading <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> because the costs of keeping him outweigh what he is currently offering to the club]</b> If there’s interest, let him go and have someone else pay his wages. <b>[If he doesn’t go]</b>, you’ve got to get him back in the fold. It’s as simple as that. You’ve got to get in a room with him, talk to him, get him into being that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> player <b>[he can be]</b>. They can’t find anyone at the moment who wants to take him off their books, so you’ve got to get him back in your ranks. It’s very difficult, if a player isn’t switched on, it’s very difficult to get into him. At the present moment if he’s going to perform the way he is, you’ve got to find other players to perform instead of him. Find the players that are committed, and find a system that fits those players</p>

I looked at the body of work that he’s done and I said he needs to have studs in his shorts because he’s always on his backside. You look at his gear when he’s playing football, his shorts are absolutely full of grass stains and mud - he’s always on his backside, he doesn’t know how to defend properly. He’s got to go<br /><br /><b>[Everyone]</b> knows my feelings about <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a>. I don’t think he’s got any qualities that you want at a club like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I think he went way too far with what he did with the crowd, I think he’s done at the football club. Talking on the football side, I don’t know what he brings to the table, I really don’t. Go<br /><br />All I can judge <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> on is what he is as a footballer. What I see as a footballer, when he was playing for Germany, when he’s been playing for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in the past, he’s fantastic. At the present moment he’s an absolute shadow. As soon as he signed his contract he’s been a shadow of his former self. I’m going to let him go.<br /><br /><b>[He added on <a href="calum-chambers.html">Calum Chambers</a>]</b> What’s his best position? <a href="calum-chambers.html">Calum Chambers</a>’s a squad player.
