  <p><b>[On Mohun Bagan]</b> Mohun Bagan are a champions side and I don’t think them missing some players will make them play defensively. We have to plan accordingly and ensure we come off with a respectable performance and hopefully some points.<br /><br />In Shillong, we train on an artificial turf and we go around playing on natural grass. The venue is not a problem to me, whatever it might be</p>

  <p><b>[Shillong Lajong’s Thangboi Singto - Playing well doesn’t mean anything when you don’t get points]</b> efinitely. That’s what piss me off and sorry for my language. You see the first goal was poor defending, what else can you say. For the second goal too, we gave away a free-kick <b>[and conceded]</b>. What I can take from this game is we keep on pushing, we keep on playing much better than the other team but in a game winning is more important. But the good thing is that we got a goal, we created lot of chances and we maybe could have scored a few goals in the first half. In the second half, Dicka had a chance, Samuel’s brilliant effort was tipped over the bar by Rehenesh, Rupert too had a chance. So I think chances were there the only thing is that conceding silly was goals again very disappointing.<br /><br />I think maturity and experience counts in this type of situations but in football if you’re 21-22 years, I think you should be able to deal with that. Maybe we need to work more on our mentality - stay calm and composed. We’re trailing but we need to stay calm and composed. We must keep on probing, keep on trying and keep on playing as we can and the goals will come<br /><br />I think we were outnumbered in midfield. There was always Mohammed Rafique, Nikhil Poorjary and Rowllin <b>[Borges]</b>. That’s why I told the players to be more direct. You know instead of making all those short passes we wanted to go direct where we could create more chances. But again I mean playing well doesn’t mean anything when you don’t get points. That’s the end of the story</p>

  <p><b>[Shillong Lajong gaffer Thangboi Singto rubbished claims that he had admitted the penalty to Sen]</b> I admitted <b>[the handball]</b>? I never said that. Why would I say that? Because I didn’t see that also <b>[handball incident]</b>. I have four eyes but I didn’t see it sorry</p>
