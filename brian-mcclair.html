  <p><b>[Nemanja Matic has been backed to bring the best out of Paul Pogba at Manchester United]</b> United need someone who sits there behind Pogba, who played his best football when Michael Carrick also played last season. Michael is coming to the end of a wonderful career, so United need someone who can do something similar but who will be more mobile in the coming years. In the short term, I could see that someone like Matic would fit in. In some games, Paul Pogba has been in the wrong place and it has stifled his abilities which United bought him for. Pogba’s attributes are all about attacking. He can find a pass, beat a player and has fantastic skills. He can score goals. For him to have the best opportunity of success at Old Trafford, Pogba needs to be playing in the final third of the pitch as much as possible.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is misunderstood at Manchester United]</b> We viewed him as a creative player. I think people may get the idea because of his size he is a Patrick Vieira but that’s not what his attributes are about. His is about creating and scoring goals. He’s an old inside left.<br /><br />No one would have taken Jesse Lingard when he was 16 because he had the skeletal age of a 13-year-old. We allowed him to take that opportunity. Scott McTominay had all sorts of problems with his growth. He was growing too fast and his body had to catch up and he missed time through injury. You support them in a different way. At one point we decided to tell him he has got an extra year because he’s fretting about it all the time. Jesse was one of the best players all the way through in each age group. He was brave. You just have to wait for them. They are always going to grow, you just don’t know when. They have all the other attributes. The biggest thing is to be patient with them. You have to be. They are going through all sorts of stuff. A few have a stellar rise later but you can ask who were the best players in the youngest age groups and the coaches will say Marcus, McTominay, Jesse - even at seven or eight. We had to believe that would continue. The biggest challenge for any young boy is getting through puberty: looking at themselves in the mirror, styling their hair, putting smelly stuff on and noticing girls. If they get through that and still love football they have a chance</p>

  <p><b>[Former Manchester United star Brian McClair has urged Jose Mourinho to start smiling on the touchline]</b> There has to be a balance. You should, at some point, look as though you are enjoying it.<br /><br />It is fine to be critical, upset and unhappy - Sir Alex had those moments too, but there were several times where he looked very happy. Jose maybe enjoys himself internally but from a football point of view, the Manchester United fans would very much welcome to see him smiling and laughing at appropriate times. From an opposite view, your great rivals have been Liverpool and they have a coach <b>[Jurgen Klopp]</b> who does laugh and smile and look pleased to be there. That must grate as well at times if you are a United fan</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba needs to find greater consistency if he is to become a world class player like Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Pogba is doing pretty well at Manchester United. There is a bit too much social media nonsense, which is nothing to do with playing football, but Pogba has scored some important goals and played well in important games. World-class players grab the main events, the semi-finals and finals for club and country, the biggest league games. France won the World Cup this year, but I don’t know how many people would say that one particular player grabbed the whole thing. Pele grabbed World Cups, Garrincha and <b>[Diego]</b> Maradona too. <b>[Michel]</b> Platini grabbed European championships. Real Madrid, with players like Cristiano Ronaldo, <b>[Luka]</b> Modric and Sergio Ramos, grab the most important games when it really matters. They change games when things are going against you. Lionel Messi does the same. Cristiano did it when he was at Manchester United. A top Manchester United player needs to be at least 7/10 every game. And in the proper big games you need to make some 10/10 appearances.<br /><br />He was big, strong, quick and athletic. He wasn’t and isn’t a Patrick Vieira-type dominant midfielder like some have suggested; he’s more of a Lionel Messi-type player. That might sound daft, but he’s a player who can find a pass, beat someone, shoot and score. He has fantastic skills, but for him to have the best opportunity of success at Old Trafford, Pogba needs to be playing in the final third of the pitch as much as possible, whether that’s him on the ball, running into positions or shooting. That has been more evident in the last couple of games where he’s got into different positions and come close to scoring<br /><br /><b>[McClair has a warning for Pogba should he consider leaving for a second time]</b> The grass can always seem greener. But it doesn’t matter if you are going to be a Man United player for a week or for 15 years, you will look back at the end of your career and Man United will have been the best club that you’ve ever played for</p>
