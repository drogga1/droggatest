  <p>[Former Manchester United star Brian McClair has urged Jose Mourinho to start smiling on the touchline] There has to be a balance. You should, at some point, look as though you are enjoying it.<br /><br />It is fine to be critical, upset and unhappy - Sir Alex had those moments too, but there were several times where he looked very happy. Jose maybe enjoys himself internally but from a football point of view, the Manchester United fans would very much welcome to see him smiling and laughing at appropriate times. From an opposite view, your great rivals have been Liverpool and they have a coach [Jurgen Klopp] who does laugh and smile and look pleased to be there. That must grate as well at times if you are a United fan</p>

  <p>[Paul Pogba needs to find greater consistency if he is to become a world class player like Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo] Pogba is doing pretty well at Manchester United. There is a bit too much social media nonsense, which is nothing to do with playing football, but Pogba has scored some important goals and played well in important games. World-class players grab the main events, the semi-finals and finals for club and country, the biggest league games. France won the World Cup this year, but I don’t know how many people would say that one particular player grabbed the whole thing. Pele grabbed World Cups, Garrincha and [Diego] Maradona too. [Michel] Platini grabbed European championships. Real Madrid, with players like Cristiano Ronaldo, [Luka] Modric and Sergio Ramos, grab the most important games when it really matters. They change games when things are going against you. Lionel Messi does the same. Cristiano did it when he was at Manchester United. A top Manchester United player needs to be at least 7/10 every game. And in the proper big games you need to make some 10/10 appearances.<br /><br />He was big, strong, quick and athletic. He wasn’t and isn’t a Patrick Vieira-type dominant midfielder like some have suggested; he’s more of a Lionel Messi-type player. That might sound daft, but he’s a player who can find a pass, beat someone, shoot and score. He has fantastic skills, but for him to have the best opportunity of success at Old Trafford, Pogba needs to be playing in the final third of the pitch as much as possible, whether that’s him on the ball, running into positions or shooting. That has been more evident in the last couple of games where he’s got into different positions and come close to scoring<br /><br />[McClair has a warning for Pogba should he consider leaving for a second time] The grass can always seem greener. But it doesn’t matter if you are going to be a Man United player for a week or for 15 years, you will look back at the end of your career and Man United will have been the best club that you’ve ever played for</p>
