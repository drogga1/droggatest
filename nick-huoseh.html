<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Teenager’s former Edmonton Strikers coach Nick Huoseh says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> wanted <a href="alphonso-davies.html">Alphonso Davies</a> at Manchester United]</b> When <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a> was there, he really wanted him but it never happened. They waited and waited, and at the end I don’t think they had the same vision and belief as Munich. I met with one or two other clubs, but speaking with the Bayern guys and seeing their plan I thought it was the best place for Alphonso. Honestly, I was being offered things that guys might jump on but Bayern had a small squad, <a href="franck-ribery.html">Franck Ribery</a> and <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a> were retiring, and it was just a good fit. One of the English clubs, I asked about their plan for Alphonso, and they said they might put him with the second team, or send him on loan because they weren’t sure if he would get a work permit. But with Bayern, it wasn’t just a phone call. It was a PowerPoint presentation, put together by <b>[chief scout]</b> Marco Neppe and <b>[sporting director]</b> <a href="hasan-salihamidzic.html">Hasan Salihamidzic</a>. They showed his position on the field, where he was going to play, they showed how they had 19 players in their squad, play 50 something games a year, play a lot of matches a year and the average player plays 80 per cent of the matches</p>
