  <p><b>[Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola is too much of a tactical wizard]</b> The Spaniard is too much of a tactical wizard, and he does it all the time. He keeps changing his system between three and four at the back and he is the kind of manager who puts players in three different positions in three different matches, which is too much.<br /><br />Eventually he will find a system and things will settle down at City, but it is not working at the moment, especially in their defence. I understand why Guardiola is frustrated because City create so many chances in all their games, not just in last weekend’s defeat against Chelsea, and it looks unfair when they don’t win. But football is not fair, football is all about winning - however you do it.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba risks becoming a Manchester United flop like Memphis Depay]</b> Paul Pogba is going through the same thing at United as Memphis Depay. He may be the most expensive player in the world, but that does not count if he is spending more time on his dress style, the colours in his hair and his social media. Paul should ask Memphis - and he will realise that being successful and reaching top level in England is only possible if you perform every week and if you dedicate everything to your career. Memphis was heavily criticised because he found it more important to pimp his image than improve his football. He should have known that stuff on the pitch goes before anything.<br /><br />Pogba will also get the wrath of the fans. People will start to moan and have a go at him. Even for the biggest football stars in the world there is a big rule: Playing well for your club comes first, don’t let all the other stuff catch the limelight. That is my advice</p>

So for every player that’s frustrating.<br /><br /><b>[On Alvaro Morata]</b> He has been unlucky because he’s had the chances. He didn’t convert them and that of course for a striker is terrible.

It’s also to do with the rumours all the time about Conte - is he leaving, is he not leaving?

There are a lot of upset people, especially when you here Conte is going to leave. The players who are not playing all the time, they see a chance for a new coach and you get a little bit of a strange environment in the locker room. And you don’t want that.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea endured a tough season, but it was not the fault of manager Antonio Conte]</b> I’m not blaming it on Conte. I’m blaming it on the rumours from the beginning about whether he was going to have to leave or whatever. Nobody upstairs did anything about it. No one said: ‘Hey, that’s that a rumour, that’s not true. He’s our coach.’ That didn’t happen. The players who are playing, they don’t care, but the players who are not playing see an opportunity that if he leaves, maybe they can play. So, you get a lot of trouble into the locker room. You don’t need that as a coach. It’s not been a success. It has been a plaster on the wound. It’s been a very hard season. If they could exchange the Champions League place for the FA Cup, they’d do it..<br /><br />If you win something, then you’re in danger in Chelsea. The one who didn’t win anything stayed the longest - Claudio Ranieri. He was there for four years. All the others had to leave. It’s better not to win anything!</p>

  <p><b>[Ruud Gullit is questioning an apparent over-reliance on Eden Hazard]</b> Blues midfielder Jorginho completed more passes - 158 - than the whole of the Newcastle team combined. But for all that time on the ball, Chelsea did not do very much. They managed only three shots on target - one more than Newcastle - and ultimately needed a fortunate own goal to take three points. Chelsea must do more - especially, considering Liverpool and Manchester City’s impressive starts, if they want to be involved at the top of the table for the long haul.<br /><br />There were rumours that Real Madrid wanted Eden Hazard in the summer. It was crucial that Chelsea kept hold of the Belgian.Without him it is going to be very difficult for them. He is the one player who poses a consistent threat. On Sunday he was fouled five times - more than twice as much as any other player on the pitch - and Newcastle constantly had four or five defenders around him in an attempt to nullify his threat. He is world-class but it would be interesting to see how Chelsea cope without him. Against a defence as drilled and tightly packed as Newcastle’s, if you cannot get crosses in from good positions, Hazard is the only one who can unlock things with a piece of skill</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea’s decision to move N’Golo Kante out of his favoured holding position has been branded strange]</b> Jorginho is the man Sarri has brought with him from Napoli to channel Chelsea’s play through. He was heavily involved at St James’ Park <b>[against Newcastle]</b> but, in a game like this, that is an easier job to do, popping the ball around without being pressed. Generally in England, though, he will be asked to play at a higher pace and make quicker decisions. You do not get any chance of easy build-up, like you would in Italy. So far he has been OK, but let us see how it goes for the rest of the season. One of the knock-on effects of Jorginho coming in is N’Golo Kante’s move into a more advanced role. It is a little bit strange. He is not a goalscorer. He has got one this season, but it was more by accident. He is a world champion and I like him more in the holding role he played for France</p>

The worst part is you can see Willian and Hazard always dribble inside because they don’t trust him. But also when the crosses are in, I think there was a moment in the first half where you asked ‘where is Morata’, he wasn’t there. So they don’t trust him.</p>

<h4 id="2018-11-05-retrieve">2018 11 05 Retrieve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Chelsea cannot be considered Premier League title contenders even with an in-form Eden Hazard]</b> Of course, Chelsea can rely on the brilliance of Hazard to get them out of jail sometimes. That is what happened when he came on in the second half and made the difference against the Eagles. One of the other criticisms that is thrown at Sarri’s side is that they rely on the Belgian too much. They managed pretty well without him in their win over Burnley last week but, on Sunday, they needed him to give them that little extra and take the points. But even with Hazard in the side, I don’t look at Chelsea and see a side that can win the title. Manchester City are better than them, and Liverpool are further ahead too.<br /><br />I have heard a lot of people say that this Chelsea team is missing a top-class striker, but they have one in the 26-year-old Spain international - they just need to use him in the right way. The way they play would make it difficult for any centre-forward to be prolific, so I don’t think it is fair to say that the reason Morata has struggled for goals since his £60m move from Real Madrid in 2017 is all his fault. As we saw in Sunday’s win over Palace, Morata comes alive when the ball comes into the box and, to get the best out of him, you need to put crosses in. And if you give Morata that service he will do well - we saw that at Juventus and Real and, even at Chelsea, he scored more headers in the Premier League last season than any other player despite having a difficult season</p>

If you want to have a head figure speaking out against racism, it’s almost impossible that a black person can do that because people see them and say, ‘It’s him again, he’s always moaning’. I talk from a very privileged position and I am happy with the position I have, but I cannot speak for people who are not in my position, who are struggling. I hope things change and people see it is not because we want to complain but because it’s there. I hope people who are in a different position to me get listened to..</p>

  <p><b>[Gonzalo Higuain is not the right striker for Chelsea]</b> Higuain is an old-fashioned striker who needs crosses and, if he plays up front all the time, he will not see many balls there because of the way Eden Hazard and Willian play. Those two always come inside, and dribble or shoot, and try to do things themselves. So they don’t need a player up there who is a target man, because Chelsea don’t use one and, under <b>[Maurizio]</b> Sarri, they never do. Instead they need a centre-forward who can play in midfield too, and be effective on the ball as well as be a finisher inside the box. Roberto Firmino, who comes so deep for Liverpool, is the perfect example.<br /><br />The next time Sarri is asked about Eden Hazard he should avoid saying anything negative, whatever he actually thinks. It is very, very risky to criticize your players in public like Sarri did this week - even if you know you are right. Sometimes as a manager you really want to be open about what you are thinking, good or bad, and for the right reasons. You are hoping your players respond in the right way. But if that openness is misinterpreted by them, then you have more problems</p>

The way he <b>[Sarri]</b> reacted on the touchline says everything.<br /><br />I think he wanted to take him off because he wanted a goalkeeper who knows the players of Manchester City. I think the goalkeeper, because he was injured, feels they wanted to substitute him because of his injury. That’s why he goes ‘no, no I’m fine’. In that moment I don’t know if someone came to him and said ‘look, there is a reason for this’. But he refused to go off and I think that undermines the manager and his authority<br /><br /><b>[Asked how he would have reacted to such a situation]</b> You would go crazy.

Because seeing Madrid lately, seeing the first match they <b>[Ajax]</b> played at home - and they didn’t deserve to lose - I saw opportunities, especially in Madrid. Then you see the game Barcelona at Madrid, played them <b>[Real]</b> off the park as well. You see the midfield and you think to yourself, ‘Oh my God.

It’s not always him, it’s not like you give him the ball and he does something incredible. In a good environment he shines, and that’s what they need to create - if he stays. He’s a great player, I’ve seen it. What he doesn’t have is the stature for a midfield player. He has such long legs, but if you see the midfield players nowadays and they are all small. If he could play like <b>[Sergio]</b> Busquets it would be fantastic, but Busquets can only play like that because of the players around him. Put him in Swansea and he wouldn’t touch the ball. So it also depends on where you play and what kind of players you play with.<br /><br />Look at Tadic, you see how good he is. A different player at Southampton than he is with Ajax, a totally different player. So you play with different players around you, in a different system that suits and you play better</p>

So therefore he’s a player like, if you want to compare, a little bit Zidane. Wants the ball as well, glides past players and things like that. I like the way he plays, he’s very young also. In only two years with Ajax, he has developed himself in unbelievable fashion. Him playing at Barcelona will be nice.<br /><br />I worked with him a year ago when I was at the national team with Dick Advocaat. He was very young, he had to be patient. What I like about him is what is in this head. He’s very mature already for a young kid. He knows what he wants and he works hard. He’s a little bit of a type of midfielder that scores a lot of goals. A little bit like Lampard was for Chelsea. Scoring goals all the time, and he comes always in the right moment. He has the technique for it and also calmness when he’s in front of goal. So I’d compare him more with Lampard, scoring goals like he does</p>

  <p><b>[Ruud Gullit wants Eden Hazard to stay at Chelsea]</b> I think first, they have to be aware of what they want to do next year with the coach. I hope he’ll stay, hope he gets a chance to make his team. There are a lot of players in the Premier League who everybody thinks will go. Maybe Paul Pogba will go, Ander Herrera, Christian Eriksen, Harry Kane will go. It’s all maybes, we don’t know. Nobody can resist Real Madrid. It’s the biggest club on earth, so it’s difficult for them if Real Madrid comes, I think you will make that choice. Therefore let’s see what Real Madrid really wants to do. They have big plans, but let’s wait and see<br /><br />I think that Chelsea at the moment is a difficult club for managers because when you are successful, you get sacked. If you’re not successful, maybe you can stay. It’s a strange thing with Chelsea. I think when <b>[owner Roman]</b> Abramovich came in it was amazing because he brought money and that’s why he bought the best players. They were winning all the time. In the moment, the least expected, they won the Champions League with Roberto Di Matteo. And now there are other clubs in the Premier League who have almost the same amount of money. Manchester City have the same amount of money. Clubs are coming as well from the Championship who get £200 million from the Premier League. So they have money to invest. And that is the same problem that Manchester United now have. When they were successful, they were the only ones with the money. Now everyone has it. It became difficult for them as well. Money is an important thing and also to get the right players. Sarri came in a moment that the team needs to be rebuilt, he did not get a lot of time. I feel a little bit for him. I think he made a mistake with Jorginho. He is a good player in the midfield, right? But he already had one <b>[N’Golo Kante]</b>! From France. He won the World Cup. So why would you then buy another one? Now he plays in the right midfielder. Why? He is the best holding midfielder from France. Why would you do that? And I think that is the problem which started it, for me</p>

  <p><b>[Ruud Gullit says <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> must be better for Netherlands if he is to win the Ballon d’Or]</b> I think he did really, really well, especially with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I think that he was the missing link for them. For the national team I still think he needs to be better than that. Not him only, but also Matthijs De Ligt because out of the last 14 games, 10 games we’ve been 1-0 down. If you have such a good defence you don’t need to concede these goals all the time<br /><br /><b>[The last defender to win it was former Italy captain <a href="fabio-cannavaro.html">Fabio Cannavaro</a> in 2006]</b> It has to do with the whole team of course. It is something that he has to fix. Not he himself but the whole defence, with the whole team, in order to be that player. Of course, defenders have not been picked a lot. <a href="franco-baresi.html">Baresi</a> should have been picked but never was. So therefore it would be a huge boost for him if he gets picked</p>

  <p><b>[Ruud Gullit is happy to see young players finally get a chance at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, saying the club has let too many good players leave in the past]</b> I’m glad the young players finally get the chance. With players like <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, Kevin De Bruyne and <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a>, there have been too many good players leaving the club because they got the feeling their time would never come through at Chelsea<br /><br /><b>[Gullit believes club icon <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> was the ideal choice to replace <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> in the close-season]</b> Obviously the results aren’t great, but for me it’s most important that they show a clear philosophy with some good football. I’m so glad the youth finally gets the chance, even though it mostly happened because of the transfer ban. Now we should be patient. The players have the talent and with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> they have their ideal coach. He is a young manager, knows the club and already experienced everything they are feeling right now. It’s a good squad and I’m positively surprised about their level. They haven’t won many games yet, but that’s not important right now. It’s about young players discovering themselves and showing their capabilities to the crowd. Look at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. See what they have done with a young team last season in the Champions League. It’s not a bad thing to have young players, as long as they are good enough and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> has a great academy. I like the way they play football with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>. Now we should be patient and wait until they start winning matches. That’s a learning process</p>
