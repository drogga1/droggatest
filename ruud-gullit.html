  <p><b>[Ruud Gullit tells about his relationship with the late Johan Cruyff]</b> I had the privilege and the luck of having him in my life. I am very grateful because he looked after me. We also had plenty of arguments because he acknowledged my opinion-even if Johan always wanted to be right. He was like a genius kid of 12 who had to go to university because he was cleverer than the professors. He was thinking so many steps ahead that, for many people, it was almost difficult to follow. <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Johan Cruyff</a> was unique</p>

  <p><b>[Quote on Frank Rijkaard]</b> A good defensive midfield player with vision and strength. I played with him at club and international level for many years and he was one of the best. He controlled the midfield with his presence, strength and technique. He would help start attacks, but make sure the other team couldn’t get at the defence. Provided a great balance to any team he played in</p>

Is that true?<br /><br /><b>[Later, the dreadlocked striker would explain that]</b> I grew up free, I grew up in Amsterdam. Growing up free is great if you’re strong. Maybe I was helped a little by my star sign, Virgo. When I knew what road I was going to take, nobody could stop me. Am I stubborn? Maybe, but also strong and confident</p>

After three months he was usually operating in midfield, primarily because his teammates simply couldn’t understand his approach]</b> I would take a difficult ball, control it, make space and play a good ball in front of the right-back. Except that he didn’t want that pass. Eventually, Glenn said to me, ‘Ruud, it would be better if you do these things in midfield’</p>

  <p><b>[Dutch legend Ruud Gullit believes Frank Lampard possesses all the attributes to be a managerial success at former club Chelsea]</b> He must not make the mistake to get friends there. He has to make sure he gets some people there who have experience in managing and coaching teams. (Lampard) has done nothing yet as a coach. Chelsea gave me this opportunity as well and we won a lot, so that (inexperience) has nothing to do with it. I think it’s important for Chelsea that they have someone in charge they can relate to. I hope also they can get the right people around him who can help him. That will be the best thing for him</p>

  <p><b>[Ruud Gullit says Virgil van Dijk must be better for Netherlands if he is to win the Ballon d’Or]</b> I think he did really, really well, especially with Liverpool. I think that he was the missing link for them. For the national team I still think he needs to be better than that. Not him only, but also Matthijs De Ligt because out of the last 14 games, 10 games we’ve been 1-0 down. If you have such a good defence you don’t need to concede these goals all the time<br /><br /><b>[The last defender to win it was former Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro in 2006]</b> It has to do with the whole team of course. It is something that he has to fix. Not he himself but the whole defence, with the whole team, in order to be that player. Of course, defenders have not been picked a lot. Baresi should have been picked but never was. So therefore it would be a huge boost for him if he gets picked</p>

  <p><b>[Ruud Gullit is happy to see young players finally get a chance at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, saying the club has let too many good players leave in the past]</b> I’m glad the young players finally get the chance. With players like <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mo Salah</a>, Kevin De Bruyne and <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Romelu Lukaku</a>, there have been too many good players leaving the club because they got the feeling their time would never come through at Chelsea<br /><br /><b>[Gullit believes club icon <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> was the ideal choice to replace <a href="maurizio-sarri.html">Maurizio Sarri</a> in the close-season]</b> Obviously the results aren’t great, but for me it’s most important that they show a clear philosophy with some good football. I’m so glad the youth finally gets the chance, even though it mostly happened because of the transfer ban. Now we should be patient. The players have the talent and with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> they have their ideal coach. He is a young manager, knows the club and already experienced everything they are feeling right now. It’s a good squad and I’m positively surprised about their level. They haven’t won many games yet, but that’s not important right now. It’s about young players discovering themselves and showing their capabilities to the crowd. Look at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. See what they have done with a young team last season in the Champions League. It’s not a bad thing to have young players, as long as they are good enough and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> has a great academy. I like the way they play football with <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a>. Now we should be patient and wait until they start winning matches. That’s a learning process</p>

That was unlucky also with injuries but it is a stable factor to have defenders that can do the things that you need to do. A lot of teams don’t defend well. So, with Van Dijk, that was an issue that was done <b>[solved]</b><br /><br />Van Dijk was an example that I was right in Holland. If I say you have to learn how to defend people say, ‘You’re always with the defending’ and things like that. But that’s where it all started.

Bayern are still a favourite - I said before the season that they can win the Champions League.<br /><br />Bayern had problems this season, but also a lot of injuries. Now they have to overcome the first hurdle, but they have a good team and are still among my candidates for the title. It has to be said that there are no clear favourites this year with the exception of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.

He is a very good coach. I like him because he left something behind at every club. He didn’t win the Champions League with Bayern, but he changed the team’s style of play so that they made an international impression. Pep has his own style and everyone loves his football, even at Manchester City</p>
