  <p>[Socceroos midfielder Massimo Luongo has signed a new long-term contract with Queens Park Rangers] I’ve enjoyed my time at QPR so I’m really pleased to have signed this new deal. It was a big decision for me, but the right decision. The next few years will be really important in my career, and hopefully I can build on the progress I feel I’ve already made with QPR. I’m really enjoying my football here and the fans seem to have taken to me as one of their own, so I couldn’t be more delighted.</p>

  <p>[Australian midfielder Massimo Luongo has put the emphasis on France’s star midfielder Paul Pogba ahead of the Socceroos World Cup opener against the French] His price tag says how good of a player he is, the pressure is always on him because of how much he costs. Maybe he’s not doing enough, but as a midfielder, if a lot of midfielders can do half the things he does, then I think they’re a pretty good player. A lot of eyes will be on him, I think he’s capable of doing something special.<br /><br />At this level, everyone is even, the win is there for the taking. Individually, yeah, they’ve got some big, world class players especially in midfield. As I said, we’ve been working on a way to play as a team and the manager’s experience is doing it with a really good team, not individuals. It’s up for the taking … we’ve got to make sure we’re on, more than 100% because of their individual talents</p>
