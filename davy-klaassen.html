  <p><b>[Klaassen explained part of his game in 2014]</b> It has to do with assessing space, knowing where the enemies are, a sense of logical thinking and solving things</p>

  <p><b>[Everton complete deal for <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>’s Davy Klaassen]</b> I’ve walked around the training ground and talked with a few people and it feels good. I spoke a few weeks ago with <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Ronald Koeman</a> about <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. I wanted to come here and check if this was the right club for me and since I came here I feel so happy. It’s a great club. The moment that I spoke with the manager directly I got a good feeling. He’s an honest guy, we talked about the club, about the way he wants to play and that gave me a positive feeling. I talked to him about the club and everything we want to achieve and he was really positive. It’s difficult to leave <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> but I think this is a good step for me now and I’m really looking forward to my time here<br /><br /><b>[Klaassen’s arrival bolsters <a href="ronald-koeman.html">Koeman</a>’s squad at Goodison Park as they look to build on his first season at the helm]</b> I’m delighted we’ve been able to bring Davy to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. He’s a player who is only 24 but has a lot of experience and is a leader on the pitch. He has already captained <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> for two seasons and that shows you the type of person he is. He is hardworking, likes to press and, of course, will give us more creativity and goals. It is another major signing for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton Football Club</a> and I am really happy we have been able to complete the deal so early in the summer</p>

  <p><b>[Former <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> midfielder Davy Klaassen believes <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a> could be ready for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and has tipped the in-demand <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a> for the top too]</b> In a couple of years you will see a lot of <b>[Ajax]</b> players at good teams. For example, De Jong and De Ligt. I think they are amazing. De Ligt at 17 was playing like he was 30 years old because he was so massive and so good. I think they will have great careers<br /><br /><b>[While Klaassen is wary of anointing De Jong as the heir to <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Andres Iniesta</a>, he can envisage his compatriot becoming a hit at Camp Nou]</b> It’s always hard to compare to players like <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> for example, because he’s one of the best midfield players ever. But I think Frenkie is really good and maybe he can make the step to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and do well, so why not?</p>
