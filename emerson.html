  <p><b>[Former Brazil international Emerson has warned <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Alvaro Morata</a> to think twice about leaving <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> for a return to Real Madrid]</b> I’d tell <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a> to think twice before leaving <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> for <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are a team that every player dreams of. I lived that dream, so I know the environment and how difficult it is to play there. It was very different to Italy in terms of mentality and that made me struggle in the first few months.<br /><br />This is why I tell <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a> to think twice and carefully consider the situation. <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> are the top, but <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a> have found a calm about them, with an atmosphere around the club that helps to protect the players. In Madrid, if you don’t score for two games, you are considered unimportant, some kind of pointless extra. <a href="alvaro-morata.html">Morata</a> would not be given the kind of consideration he receives at <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>.<br /><br /><b>[Juve has been heavily linked with deals for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> defensive duo <a href="dani-alves.html">Dani Alves</a> and Javier Mascherano]</b> Dani has done stratospheric things with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, but <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> are two very different leagues. Of course he has great quality, but playing for a team like <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, who are at the top of Europe, is perhaps easier than in other realities</p>

  <p><b>[Former Brazil international Emerson lauds <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Arturo Vidal</a> and Charles Aránguiz]</b> <a href="arturo-vidal.html">Vidal</a> is a player that I really like, I’ve always liked, he’s very dynamic, he’s very intelligent and he’s at an optimum level, he’s part of the world elite. Chile has a good technique, with players with very good technical skills, always preserving their game and few teams can do that. Chile has grown a lot with players of many qualities and players with a very high level that they can understand what it is to play soccer, similar to the Brazilians. That is why the Chileans like Brazil and they identify with the Brazilian soccer and I like Chile very much. I love to see their matches. I think they have had competent coaches because their tranquility and mentality has been transferred to the players: that is important and that’s why it is a highly respected side<br /><br /><b>[Emerson named another Chilean player that is to his liking]</b> I saw Aránguiz play for Inter, I lived many years in Porto Alegre, I am a ‘Gremista’ and he played very well there so he was hated by me (laughs). He was doing excellent and I was very sorry when he was injured in Bayer Leverkusen -I love very much-, but he’s a very intelligent player, with a strong head and he went ahead. Chile knows that a World Cup is difficult and not only for them, even for Brazil that being local had a lot of pressure, and in others being favorites, as well. Chile has to keep working, and can grow more. It’s acute football, the coaches have given continuity</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea full-back Emerson labels reports suggesting he’s unhappy at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Stamford Bridge</a> ‘fake news’]</b> The world is going through a really difficult moment <b>[with the coronavirus pandemic]</b> and there are journalists who want to spread fake news around to have content. I don’t speak too much, but here is my only and last statement regarding this news. I never said that and I think definitely the opposite of what was mentioned, without my knowledge. Respect and gratitude always. Enjoy your family</p>

  <p><b>[Emerson has told <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> he feels ready to play for the first team amid rumours he could move to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a> this year]</b> First <a href="quique-setien.html">Setien</a> and then Rubi insisted I should defend better. I get forward easily, but it’s harder at the back. I started working on that and things have changed a lot. The reality is, in Brazil, I didn’t have to do as much as a defender. Closing spaces and tactics are much more at work in Europe than there. I didn’t think I’d get to this level so early. I think this season I’m having is without a doubt the best of my life. Things are going quickly for me. I’m young, but I’m ready to play for any team.<br /><br />Yes, I’m ready to play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I’ve also been asked before about going up to the Brazil senior team and my answer was the same. I’m not scared at all. Playing for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> is a dream I’ve had since I was a child. I was always a <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> fan for the Brazilian stars that played there, like <a href="ronaldinho.html">Ronaldinho</a> or <a href="dani-alves.html">Dani Alves</a>. And also for <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> or <b>[Eric]</b> <a href="eric-abidal.html">Abidal</a>. I have four idols: <a href="dani-alves.html">Dani Alves</a>, <a href="cafu.html">Cafu</a>, <a href="roberto-carlos.html">Roberto Carlos</a> and <a href="marcelo.html">Marcelo</a>. Many people compare my story with Alves’, yes. He’s an example. I also want to play in the Champions League with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and win as many cups as possible</p>
