  <p><b>[Shamrock Rovers boss Stephen Kenny hits back at Richie Sadlier]</b> As chief executive of St Pat, they spent millions and won nothing. They didn’t win a trophy. They changed managers and they had managers flying in and out. I don’t mind accepting criticism, but he is trying to be sensationalist.<br /><br />Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I am not normally sensitive to criticism. I am in the game long and enough and you are there to be criticised. That is part of it. But I think his comments were drastic. I just think for someone who was chief executive, they wasted millions and won nothing. They ran a club with a ridiculously high budget, an astronomical budget, and ultimately they didn’t win a cup or a league or nothing<br /><br /><b>[Moving on from Sadlier, Kenny admitted that his team had underperformed against Bohemians last weekend in the 4-0 defeat, but felt that the league title was not out of Shamrock Rovers’ grasp just yet]</b> Moving on from Sadlier, Kenny admitted that his team had underperformed against Bohemians last weekend in the 4-0 defeat, but felt that the league title was not out of Shamrock Rovers’ grasp just yet. As the manager I deserve criticism for the defeat and I am not shying away from that. But we are only eight points behind with 16 games to go and we are in all competitions. We are still capable of challenging for everything.<br /><br />sWe have a big game on Sunday against St Pat. I know it’s an important game for us. St Pat’s are an excellent team. They have been playing very well this season and have been getting a lot of plaudits, and rightly so. But if we win on Sunday, we are just a point behind them. That’s the reality, if we win on Sunday, we are just a point behind Pat’s with 15 games to go. That’s the challenge for us on Sunday<br /><br /><b>[Kenny admitted that he had no comeback for the 4-0 loss to rivals Bohemians, and took the blame for the loss, but with a lot of unrest from the club’s supporters, the match with St Patrick’s Athletic on Sunday could prove make or break for the 40-year-old]</b> I can’t defend overall losing like that and I’m not going to try. We made some bad mistakes and we were punished. But we have to move on. We can’t dwell on it. The main thing for us is to get back to winning ways.<br /><br />We had two good wins, beating Drogheda 3-1 and Shelbourne 3-2, and we dominated against Cork when we drew 1-1 in our previous game, and we are in both cups. I think it was a bad night. We let everyone down. We let all our supporters down and everyone connected with the club down.<br /><br />As a manager I am responsible for that and I do know that. We let our supporters down and we do owe them a performance. Hopefully we can address that on Sunday against St Pat.</p>

  <p><b>[Ireland make early Kenny appointment as McCarthy steps down]</b> The <a href="fai.html">Football Association of Ireland</a> announces that <a href="mick-mccarthy.html">Mick McCarthy</a> is to be succeeded as national team manager by <a href="stephen-kenny.html">Stephen Kenny</a> with immediate effect. The handover has been agreed with both men in light of the delay to the European Championship play-offs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.<br /><br /><a href="mick-mccarthy.html">Mick McCarthy</a>’s contract was due to expire on July 31 after the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Euro 2020 finals, with Stephen initially scheduled to step up from his Under-21 team role on August 1.<br /><br />This move allows <a href="stephen-kenny.html">Stephen Kenny</a> time to plan for the European Championship play-off semi-final against Slovakia later in the year</p>

  <p><b>[Stephen Kenny says <a href="damien-duff.html">Damien Duff</a> is under no pressure to iron out his immediate future with Celtic]</b> With respect to Celtic, they have to sort that out between them but Damien is trying to sort out his situation. It’s been immense for him, a great learning curve and he has really enjoyed it. He tells me what a fantastic club it is and how much he has enjoyed his time there. But we will have to see what develops as he was hoping to see out the season and win the treble there at least but I don’t want to speak about his future, he can do that</p>

  <p><b>[New Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny explains <a href="robbie-keane.html">Robbie Keane</a> omission from Republic of Ireland staff]</b> From my point of view, I wanted my own backroom team. I have the height of respect for <a href="robbie-keane.html">Robbie Keane</a> for what he has achieved in the game.<br /><br />Keith Andrews has been my assistant for the last 15 months and I have a very good rapport with him. With <a href="damien-duff.html">Damien Duff</a>, the reports coming out of Celtic this season have been absolutely outstanding.<br /><br />I’ve been given an opportunity. I’m not going to waste it - life is short. <br /><br />I want people coming to the Aviva Stadium, looking forward to seeing a team that really passes the ball well and has great creativity and hard work also.<br /><br /><b>[As it stands, Kenny’s first game in charge could come via a Nations League clash against Bulgaria in September, with a Euro play-off semi-final against Slovakia also set to be rescheduled around that time]</b> If it <b>[the play-off semi-final]</b> is the first game, I’ll make sure the team is prepared. But the most likely scenario, apparently, is late October or possibly even early November. If that is the case, it will give me a run of games. In the last game against Denmark, the back four of Matt Doherty, Enda Stevens, John Egan and Shane Duffy were terrific. We’ve got to improve the rest of the team in relation to how we’re set up and from an attacking point of view and how we can control games</p>
