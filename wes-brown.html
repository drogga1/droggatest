  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is coming good after shaking the pressure which accompanied an £89 million transfer to Manchester United]</b> Pogba came back to United with this great expectation, that he had to show the world how good he is straight away. A lot of pressure comes with that. With that out of the way he’s coming good, though we all know he can do even better. This season, especially after the World Cup that he’s had, he’s going to start expressing himself a lot more.<br /><br />I like Anthony Martial. I think he’s a great talent and he’s young. But he’s not been playing so maybe he and the manager don’t get on and maybe he’s not doing what the manager is asking. Ultimately that’s what the players have to do. You have to listen to your manager. He didn’t play many times last year so looking from the outside it doesn’t look good. He might be off.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba may be generating plenty of transfer talk]</b> Pogba will be staying. He’s a Manchester United player. He was captain on Friday, scored a penalty, had a great World Cup and I’m hoping that he just keeps that going and has a fantastic season for United. Maybe he’ll be given a bit more freedom this season, especially with Fred there now and still <b>[Nemanja]</b> Matic to come in. Fred looks like to get around the pitch, it looks like he likes defending so that may mean Pogba can advance a little bit. We’ll just have to see, it’s a bit early at the moment to see how that plays or whether he does become more attacking or if he’s more defensive.</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez remains a fantastic player and is no Manchester United flop]</b> I don’t think it’s not working. We all have faith in him, he was a fantastic player at Arsenal, he got bought in January. It takes a while to settle in and after one game I don’t think you can really say that. But you know he’s a fantastic talent and I’m sure he’ll be getting better all the time.<br /><br />I like Martial, I really do. I know he didn’t get much game time last season but he’s a player that if I was playing against he’s just a pure threat with his speed. He’s a player that United have who definitely can change a game and hopefully he can get in the team. Players will be fighting for positions and in that area there’s a good battle going on. They’ve got fantastic players<br /><br />I like Rashford, complete threat I would call it. I’d hate to play against him. I think he’s going to get better every year now, same with <b>[Jesse]</b> Lingard. They’re all sort of the same position and that’s what I mean, they’ve got to prove it, they’ve got to prove it in training, prove it to the manager and then do it in the games. And I’m guessing that that’s what it’ll come down to at the end of the day</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba’s reported feud with Jose Mourinho at Manchester United is considered to be normal]</b> I had a few arguments myself with Sir Alex Ferguson - it’s football. When the going gets tough - it gets tough. And United have had it tough over the three or four weeks, basically on results - they’ve lost some bad games. But personal football things where managers fight with players, players fight back - that’s normal; that’s been going on for as long as I can think of. Managers are managers, that’s what they do<br /><br />I don’t necessarily think Mourinho struggled to motivate the players in previous games. If you look at a few individual performances they just weren’t probably good enough. <b>[But]</b> regardless of what people say, no player actively goes out there and doesn’t play well <b>[on purpose]</b> - that is not the case whatsoever. And I’m sure you can ask any player that. They just need to start somewhere and that’s by showing a bit of fight, and that’s what they did against Newcastle in the second half.</p>

  <p><b>[Man-marking Eden Hazard could be go a long way towards Manchester United slowing down the Chelsea star]</b> I like the idea of man-marking. I remember the manager, Sir Alex, asked me to do that against Messi and Barcelona one time, with help from the team! I think it is quite simple: the less that Hazard gets of the ball, the less of a threat he is, so if someone can get tight on him pretty early on then hopefully he passes the ball off every time or we get a tackle on him. That’s a good game plan because, even though Chelsea have started the season really well, he is definitely the main threat.<br /><br />Obviously, man-marking Messi was hard. I remember thinking ‘just don’t dive in!’. But it was good and I enjoyed it. It was the Champions League semi-final when we were all focused, we all knew our jobs and you can remember that night yourself at Old Trafford, it was a great one to be involved in. It was a rarity for Sir Alex to specifically ask someone to man-mark an opposition player. He wasn’t really into man-marking someone as such, but we all knew what Messi could do and it was more of a case of necessity. The less he had of the ball, the more chance we had, because he’s one of the best footballers ever to be. I wouldn’t say that Hazard is Messi, but he’s started this season really well and he’s one of the top players in the Premier League. He is a clear and obvious threat<br /><br />Chelsea are unbeaten under Sarri and I am a little bit surprised. Having watched them you can see they are playing freely, they are enjoying it and Hazard has been that main danger. The way he gets forward and the way the team plays, it’s very exciting and they’ve started really well<br /><br />We need more of the focus that we saw in the second half against Newcastle. We need the passion that we showed. We just need to start with that same level against Chelsea. Confidence is massive, I’ve always said that, and that win should have lifted ours. If we want to start well after the international break, then Chelsea and Juventus are exactly the games that you want. These are the games you need to be up for and I am sure they will be</p>

  <p><b>[Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is being backed to get Manchester United enjoying their football again]</b> Ole is a top guy. A nice guy and he was great to play with. Obviously, he’s now managed a couple of different teams and he’s coming back in, which is brilliant. The board made the decision and opted to bring Ole in. I am sure he will be getting a smile back on the lads’ faces. He’ll be trying to get them to enjoy their football and, at the moment, it’s what we need. Ole coming in until the end of the season gives the whole club a boost and hopefully we can get some good results with him in charge<br /><br />Ole, as a player, was one of the best professionals I’ve been with. He was guy who came off the bench and scored goals and never lost focus. He was always committed and I do hope he will definitely bring those two things to the side and the players. I think he always made it known to the lads what he was trying to be and that is what he wanted to do - become a manager. I always thought he might be a manager because of the way he watched games, even when he used to come on as a sub he used to watch defenders to see who was tired, who he could attack and which ones he might go at. Back then, some of those things were not really known at that time and doing it at such an early age, you could see he loved the game. So it didn’t surprise me one bit that he became a manager</p>

  <p><b>[Ole Gunnar Solskjaer deserves the chance to force himself ahead of Mauricio Pochettino and Zinedine Zidane on Manchester United’s managerial wish list]</b> I haven’t seen Man United play like that in a long time. You could see everyone was enjoying it <b>[against Cardiff]</b> and obviously for the previous manager they weren’t doing that, so there was something wrong. Ole has gone in there, got the smiles back on and just said ‘go and play’. If Ole can keep this going then I can’t see a reason why we can’t make the top four. The lads will scare a few teams if they keep playing like that.<br /><br />Personally, I think it would be great if Ole gets the job full-time. I would like to see him stay if he did well. Obviously he’s been told it’s until the end of the season, but that could always change, you know how football is. If he can start producing, keep winning and playing like that, anything can happen. It’s nice saying we would like Pochettino and Zidane, but it’s not as easily done. If Ole did okay I don’t see a reason why he couldn’t stay on.</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United have been advised on how to avoid falling into Lionel Messi’s trap]</b> You do realise, watching Messi, that one thing you can’t do is dive in. His ball control is unbelievable. A joke<br /><br />Listen, with players like that, you’re not going to stop them being them, you just have to limit them and try to get them to focus on something else. Frustrate them. You have to. Out on the pitch, Messi doesn’t show any emotion. I’m probably quite like him in that sense. I don’t want anyone to know what I’m thinking in my head. So, because that’s what I do, I’m pretty sure that’s how he is inside as well. Emotional inside. Focused. He wants to prove to everyone that he’s the best. Just because he’s not showing it doesn’t mean he’s not thinking it on the inside<br /><br /><b>[Expanding further on how United sought to limit the impact of Messi]</b> People might say: ‘just send him down the right’. Ok, send him down the right. It doesn’t matter because his start speed is unbelievable with the ball. There aren’t many faster with the ball. Small dribbles. So fast. As soon as you dive in or you’re not quite there, he’s gone past you but he’s still got control of the ball. He’s cut in and he’s gone. The way he runs, his angles, he can run at speed, change direction at speed, little turns. He’s the best at it. As much as you’ve got a voice in your head saying ‘don’t dive in,’ you’ve got another voice saying: ‘you can have that’. You can’t. It’s a trap. So you have to listen to that first voice and just stay on your feet</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba’s selection in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year is a great achievement]</b> We know what Paul can do. He’s had a great spell and he’s scored some important goals for us this season, and assists actually. Obviously, the players rate him and I hope we see more of that. We need that to hopefully happen against Chelsea <b>[on Sunday]</b>. Of course it means a lot because, over the course of the season, you’ve performed well and have the respect of the other players. The players do actually vote on these things, you do sit there and do it. It’s something we enjoy doing. Even if they play for Manchester City or Liverpool, it doesn’t mean you don’t vote for them. You do what you think is right and that is why I think it’s always a good thing to do<br /><br />I don’t think you can <b>[argue with it]</b> at all. By far, they’ve easily been the best two teams slugging it out for the championship. So, for Paul to get in that team is a great achievement in itself</p>

So that’s why.<br /><br />Ronaldo is probably the best. He’s the sort of the guy that can do things on his own. We could all be playing badly and he would get the ball on his own and score. There’s not many players who can do that but he’s one of them</p>

He’s only young, he’s level-headed and everything he’s done, tackling, tracking back has been brilliant. I’ve even seen some of the better players not dare to have a go at him, they’re turning back and passing it. That’s the sort of player he is, no one wants to take him on because he’s going to go with everything. People say he slides in too much, but I think he times his tackles perfectly. When you have a player like that and people realise they can’t take him on, it’s an advantage to the team because they start playing back</p>

United need another striker and an attacking midfielder, that little wizard number 10. The defence is fine. The goalkeepers are fine. The ideal thing would be two strikers and two midfielders.

He has taken his time and he isn’t going to rush out and buy someone he doesn’t think is capable of playing for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. It will happen and he will get the players that he wants and then we can start talking about it. But it is a rebuilding situation and it’s going to take time. I think the club have to give him the time because otherwise you’re just starting all over again. You look at the squad and you know you need players and that’s the case no matter what manager is there. You have to let Ole get his players in and then you start from there. Straight away he said he had a plan and this is what he wanted to do and that it would take a while. You have to accept that and I’m sure United know that as well. He’s been brave because the expectations at United are so high</p>

  <p><b>[Wes Brown says <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>’s record-breaking £80 million transfer fee could be considered quite cheap nowadays]</b> I actually think it seems quite cheap nowadays. I think he’s brought a calmness to the whole defence. He’s still relatively young, but he’s very experienced already. He has an awareness about him and he’s very good on his positioning. There are games where you don’t really notice him, but that’s just because he’s doing his job. He’s winning his headers, he’s laying it off. We’re more solid with him at the back. He gives you a kind of, ‘we can do this’ attitude and that’s especially true when he has been playing with <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Victor Lindelof</a>. They have complimented each other well.

Since that game, he has just gone back to his normal level. The errors will happen every now and again - they happen to all players - but he’s just got straight back into it and that’s a good sign. It’s at the point now where, whenever he comes up against someone in a one-on-one scenario, you’re more than confident that he will end up winning the ball or clearing it. That shows his confidence as well as his ability. That, really, is all you can ask for in a right-back defender</p>

Everyone needs to perform every game. We can’t have mixed games with three or four players slacking off, that’s not how the game works.

  <p><b>[Wes Brown says Brandon Williams has come from nowhere to star for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> He’s come from nowhere, really. At the start of the season, a lot of attention was on <a href="mason-greenwood.html">Mason Greenwood</a> as the next young player to come through because everyone in youth football knew about him. His goalscoring record was fantastic at all levels, plus he had a bit of a taste of the first team last season, so there was an expectation that he’d do well this season. Brandon, though, has come in and hit his stride from the first game he played. He was straight into it. Not many people knew who he was, but he’s put in fantastic performances every time he’s played. It’s like he’s been playing at this level for a long time. I remember speaking to someone at the U23s and there were other players who were standing out more, but sometimes that happens. You get a break, you get on the big stage and you perform better because of the demands. You almost fall into the first team and you just push on<br /><br />He gets stuck in and every challenge, he accepts. He doesn’t try to shy away from anything. He won’t back down. Some managers, when you come up against a young lad, they’re telling you that he’s only young, only had a few games, try to get at him a little bit. I’m sure that will have happened with Brandon, but he accepts the challenge every time.<br /><br />As a defender, it’s always important to win your first couple of challenges in a game. If you do that, then your opponents have to rethink what they’re going to do. If he’s handling every situation they put him in, it becomes difficult for them. Before the game the experienced pros will be trying to get at him, but it seems like he likes that. He accepts the challenge and takes it on, which is very important. What I like about him is that he doesn’t seem to be fazed. He basically plays his own game. I think Ole has seen what he can do, he knows he gets forward and can do it comfortably, and he’s happy to let Brandon play his own game. It’s very exciting</p>

You can see players running in now and I think that’s a big step forward. The club can see what Ole’s doing and they’ll get behind him and support him</p>

  <p><b>[Wes Brown has credited <a href="bruno-fernandes.html">Bruno Fernandes</a> for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>’s improved form as he believes the Portugal star has lifted the team]</b> It’s interesting when players come in in January because you don’t know how they’re going to do when they arrive, sometimes it takes time for them to come in and settle. But Fernandes has come in and changed the whole team<br /><br />He is the type of player United have been missing. He wants to get on the ball and get those little dinks over the top and he has some special moves. By doing that he has brought a confidence to the team that wasn’t there before. He has been excellent and I think the team has bounced off him coming in and they just keep improving with him in it.<br /><br /><b>[Wes Brown thinks the January arrivals of Fernandes and <a href="odion-ighalo.html">Odion Ighalo</a> will positively impact the rest of the players in the squad]</b> When you get these special players in you want to do just as good or get better than them which improves the team. Everyone respects the fact that Fernandes is a quality player and that can only boost the rest of the team.<br /><br />It’s what United have needed the whole season and the confidence he has brought to the team is brilliant. I think they will manage to do it but they’ve had a few little opportunities to close the gap on <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> that they haven’t taken and they will eventually run out. But it’s these games near the end of the season that really count. It’s definitely there for the taking</p>

  <p><b>[Wes Brown says <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> defence has just started to click]</b> It has just started to click because they have been given time. <a href="victor-lindelof.html">Lindelof</a> and <a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a> have been brilliant. It has taken time but that was always going to be the case and I think they have done well. <b>[Aaron]</b> <a href="aaron-wan-bissaka.html">Wan-Bissaka</a> is doing exactly what I thought he would do, he is a great defender and he’s improving all the time with his attacking skills. And then there’s <b>[Luke]</b> Shaw and <b>[Brandon]</b> Williams who have good competition between each other which is pushing them both on<br /><br />You’ve got <a href="eric-bailly.html">Bailly</a> coming back now. He was brilliant against <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and has had another couple of good performances so it will be interesting to see whether the manager gives him time to see what he would be like with <a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a>. Having more players coming back is going to give some healthy competition at the back and I’m sure there’s going to be time to see different partnerships in the future<br /><br />I don’t necessarily think that’s the right thing to do. I don’t mind players coming in if they’re going to improve the squad but, in general the defence has been pretty good this season. You always want to improve. So if there are players that the manager likes and they’re available and they fit in the team then I don’t see a problem in that but I don’t think it’s necessarily needed in defence</p>

  <p><b>[Why <a href="axel-tuanzebe.html">Axel Tuanzebe</a> should stay at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a>]</b> It is difficult when you’re on the bench or not involved. But that’s when your character comes in and you suck it up and try and battle on and try and work as hard as possible. Axel is a brilliant player and, when he gets there, has to play well and give the manager a problem</p>

Any one of those three would be great. <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> would probably be number one, but <a href="james-maddison.html">James Maddison</a> looks fit and ready and determined and would also be a great asset for the club. <a href="jack-grealish.html">Jack Grealish</a> is an individual that gets things done, takes control of the game and has his own style. Any one of those three would be perfect I think.<br /><br />Football is going to get back to normality and we have to be ready. Of course we discuss players, we discuss plans and we evaluate what we need. Us and the coaching staff have discussed games on video calls like this. Who knows how the market is going to react to this? Who knows which clubs need to sell players? There might be a situation that we can exploit at Man United, we are the biggest and we are well off. I am sure we are capable of doing the business that we want to.</p>

  <p><b>[Wes Brown says <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> is like <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>, he makes the game easier for others]</b> Talent and excitement. We need someone exactly like that at the club. We’ve had them over the years and I’m sure if we were to sign him he would bring that excitement back to the club. It would be good for the team as well. We’ve had players like that in the past, like with <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. They’re the type of player who draw three or four defenders out and make the game a lot easier for the other players. If we could do it, it would be a brilliant signing.</p>
