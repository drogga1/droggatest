<blockquote>
  <p>[The Houston Rockets star James Harden has bought into the Houston Dynamo of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> and Houston Dash of the National Women’s Soccer League as minority owner in the two clubs] I’m very excited about the opportunity to join the ownership group of the Houston Dynamo and Houston Dash and proud to be a part of a club with tremendous history and a great future. Houston is my home now, and I saw this as a way to invest in my city and expand my business interests at the same time. Soccer in general, and especially <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, have exploded in this country throughout my lifetime. I’ve been a fan of the game for several years, and I know that Houston has a massive soccer fanbase, so it was an easy decision for me when this opportunity arose</p>

  <p>[Wilmer Cabrera sacked as Houston Dynamo coach amid poor patch in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> play] We’d like to thank Wilmer for all of his hard work and dedication over the course of the last two and a half seasons with the Houston Dynamo, including last year’s U.S. Open Cup title. We wish him all the best moving forward. At this time, we as a club believe the team will benefit from a fresh perspective as we enter the final third of our season and make a push to qualify for the playoffs</p>
