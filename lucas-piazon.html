  <p><b>[Lucas Piazon says he is ready to leave <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> on a permanent basis because he is fed up with being sent on loan every year]</b> My time at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> is already over. I’m 25, I’ve been on loan several times. I’ve been at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> since 2011, I’ve been on loan almost all over Europe. I’m tired of playing here and there, I need a place where I can feel at home. I want to know that in July I will return to the same place, to the same house. I’d have a good season on loan, but I’d come back and was soon loaned again. There was no point in going out on loan, playing well, coming back, not being used and being loaned again. There comes a time in your career that makes no sense anymore. By the way, I said exactly that three years ago and it didn’t go so well at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, it generated some discomfort<br /><br /><b>[Despite the lack of stability or first-team opportunities in London, Piazon says he does not resent <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> side for the way things have turned out]</b> I can’t just blame <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>, because I also accepted all that. But of course, there came a time when I thought that being loaned again would no longer be necessary, I had to go on with my life</p>

  <p><b>[How constant change made Lucas Piazon a man]</b> The first few days were not very easy because it was just me and my girlfriend. We had no help at home due to the lockdown, so we had to figure things out on our own and do everything ourselves. But I believe we did well<br /><br />I had a call from the coach, Carlos Carvahal, before I joined last summer. He convinced me that it would be a good move for me. I was actually close of going to another Portuguese club but I decided on Rio Ave after I spoke to the ‘Mister’. I signed for two years because sometimes one season is too short and you can end up having injury problems during the season and lose time. Then, when the season is over, you have to move again. Here, though, we have a talented group of players and Carlos and his coaching team are helping us have a good season<br /><br /><b>[Piazon, for his part, had recovered from a slow start to this season, starting nine of Rio Ave’s 10 games before the break, racking up two goals and one assist in the process]</b> I feel comfortable in my role in the team. Things are going well for us.<br /><br /><b>[Rio Ave will return to action with a home game against Pacos Ferreira and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>’s assistant loan player technical coach <a href="paulo-ferreira.html">Paulo Ferreira</a> is expected to be present]</b> He is the one closest to me. He speaks to me about games and he always tries to show me what I am doing well and what I can improve upon. I certainly feel I am a much more complete player now than I was in Brazil, where I didn’t defend at all. In Europe, I learned to play in a lot of different positions and matured as a player, as well as tactically. I believe I arrived from South America as a kid and, slowly, I became a man here in Europe. I think that I can improve further, too. I am still only 26, so there is still space for growth as a player. It is hard to say <b>[what I will become]</b> in football I just want to finish this season well and see where it will lead me.<br /><br /><b>[For now, though, the focus is not on impressing Ferreira but also new arrival Roman, who will be watching at home with Elizabeth as Piazon plays his first game since lockdown ended]</b> It will be nice but I just want him to see me as his best friend and someone he can trust and count on every single moment of his life. It has been a while since I played but I am feeling great. I believe that fatherhood automatically changes your outlook on life. We must be more careful about the decisions we make</p>
