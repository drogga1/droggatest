  <p><b>[Taking on all comers - Meet Everton target and Ligue 1 Rising Star Martin Terrier. His father, Frederic Terrier said]</b> There’s been a radical change in his character since September. Before, he trusted himself but did not display it.</p>

  <p><b>[The forward is more than happy to talk himself up]</b> I’ve got a lot of confidence in myself. It can be dangerous, but my head’s on my shoulders. I’m just aware of what I can do and that’s important in this business.</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon star Martin Terrier cannot wait to take on Manchester City in the 2018-19 Champions League]</b> We’ll get into the swing of the Champions League right away against one of the best clubs in the world! City are the favourites, the other two clubs are less impressive. I think the group is balanced and we can move to the second stage. We had just finished training at the time of the draw and we watched it all together. We were happy to take City, playing against them is very cool and the team proved last year that they love playing big games. To play against some of the best players in the world there, against Guardiola who offers a huge game, we are all looking forward to it<br /><br /><b>[On Nabil Fekir]</b> He is a very great player and in training I try to learn from him. In addition to being a very good player, he is also a very good captain. From the outside we often have different impressions of what is really happening inside. He talks a lot with the players. We have a group with a lot of young people and he gives his experience. sIt suits him well because he was in the same boat not long ago. If he sees us stressed he comes up, he speaks quietly and gives advice. It’s really good</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> have confirmed that Martin Terrier is conscious and recovering after he collapsed during their <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> clash against Toulouse on Sunday]</b> The news are good. The most important thing for us tonight is that Martin Terrier is doing well. We were really worried to see him out on the field like that, and to see him come out on a stretcher, but again the news are good. We’re reassured</p>
