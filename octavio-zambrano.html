  <p><b>[Octavio Zambrano placed winning at the top of his list of priorities for Canada’s underachieving men’s program]</b> We have been happy to participate, to be there, to just be one of the contenders. My perception is that we have not been keen enough to think that we can win that competition, that we have to win.<br /><br />You can’t step on the pitch without having the passion to want to win at all costs, fairly. And passion, if you don’t have it, if you don’t have that fire inside that takes you to make that extra move to really put your body and yourself in harm’s way to accomplish something that is huge and is important for this country, then you probably won’t be part of this program<br /><br />I had absolutely nothing to say on the selection process, which was done by Michael Findlay and his staff. I am going to mostly observe, but eventually there will be times when I will begin to interact with the players<br /><br /><b>[Zambrano expects to speak with the players in the lead-up to the Scotland match]</b> They have a game to play, this is the most important thing. I just want to observe, and I will find the right time and the right place to connect with them, I’m sure.</p>

  <p><b>[Canada has announced a 27-man roster ahead of its June 13 friendly against Curacao in Montreal]</b> Patrice Bernier is a stalwart that has played many times for Canada and has demonstrated his value. Patrice can also help our young players who are looking to earn their places in the national team.<br /><br />We have the perfect mix of experience and youth in this squad. We are looking forward to seeing how they come together on the pitch. With this camp, we have a chance to look at players for the CONCACAF Gold Cup, but also younger players that are part of our long-term plans</p>

  <p><b>[Canada coach Octavio Zambrano wants Patrice Bernier to delay retirement]</b> He shouldn’t retire, because he’s still good, he’s one of the best players on the field. The last time I was here I saw him play and he was probably the best player on the field and now that I see him I voted him as the best player from the Montreal team. I don’t see that when a player is at the top or at the top of his performance level, why should he think about quitting? This happens usually when it’s crystal clear that a player no longer has it, but he still has a lot more to give.<br /><br /><b>[On Ballou Jean-Yves Tabla]</b> Ivory Coast, I can’t tell him what they can offer to him. I don’t know and it doesn’t matter to me, but I do know having been in other places around the world and seeing how soccer is managed there. Comparatively speaking to what I think Canada can offer for him, I think it’s just night and day. I think he can be an iconic player with the national team of Canada and reap rewards that he could never think about doing with the Ivory Coast. And that doesn’t necessarily mean that he plays his soccer in Canada: he could play anywhere in the world, but I think the Canadian national team is really the place where he should play<br /><br /><b>[On Alphonso Davies]</b> He’s just a kid in reality, but he plays like a man - there’s no doubt. When he steps on the field, and I’ve seen him now enough times to say that even though he may be a kid at heart, when he’s on the field he makes his presence felt immediately, and he did it tonight. And I expect that type of performance in the national team. I like guys that are protagonists. When they come in they put their stamp on the field and he does it every time I see him</p>

  <p><b>[The Canadian men’s national team has announced its provisional roster for next month’s CONCACAF Gold C]</b> There is a motivation that Canadian players must have - the pride and the passion - in wearing the Canadian shirt. It is not a shirt that can be given to just anyone, it is something that players need to earn and, once they put it on, they need to feel something different</p>

  <p><b>[Davies, Bernier headline Canada Gold Cup squad while Larin left off]</b> We have a dynamic team that has speed and offensive weapons. We have a balance between offence and defence. We want to go forward and have a high tempo, but we also have to make sure we have the defenders that are up to the task in our end.</p>

  <p><b>[Canada’s Gold Cup goal is to score a goal]</b> We definitely want to get rid of the idea of, ‘It’s OK if we lose because we are building.’ That doesn’t compute. That doesn’t count. Yes, we can build, but winning is part of building. That is the message, and I think in the past we have had in Canada a very, I would say a very lax approach to these kind of competitions and we haven’t really put all the resources that we should have into these types of competitions. We’ve been preoccupied by other things<br /><br />I have been able to see a good amount of resources spent by the three Canadian teams into their academies. The three academies are very well organized and the people that are running them are quality people, they are professionals. I see the result of those efforts coming to fruition in a three, four-year span. Right now it’s too early to expect that, but if I can look at the U-15 showcase that we had only a month ago, I can tell you that I saw players who are 100 percent going to be professionals whether in the MLS or the coming CPL, the Canadian Premier League which is going to be another development prospect to give us a little bit more to choose from once that’s up and running. So, the future is certainly bright for Canada. I believe so<br /><br />That is a very, very important piece of this puzzle because Canadians abroad are numerous and there are a couple that are at an elite level<br /><br />We are looking at this Gold Cup as a combination of things. One, the experience for our young guys, that they believe themselves that they can play at this level and two, that we get out of the group stage at least and look to play some more meaningful matches as the tournament progresses. And obviously to show a different style of play, a different idea about how to play the game, not just being a team that relinquishes the protagonist to the opponent and is more worried about what the opponent is doing, how to react to it, rather than imposing our type of idea of football on the pitch. If we can manage to get a little bit of all those concepts while we play the Gold Cup I would say it would be a success<br /><br />You have to believe first off that you can do that and that you are able and capable and can have the type of empowerment that comes from knowing that you have prepared and you are in equal footing with your opponent. We have Mexico, the United States, Costa Rica, we have Honduras and Panama is coming up and all these other countries coming up with good resources. But I think Canada belongs, I think it should under normal circumstances, I think it should belong to that group</p>

  <p><b>[Alphonso Davies’s $13.5 million transfer to Bayern Munich broke a 10-year-old transfer fee record for MLS]</b> Bayern got a bargain, no doubt. One hundred percent. His best years are ahead of him and he has so much more in his game. I think they got a superb player for a very good deal. Alphonso is a player of three or four times that amount.<br /><br />Even when I had him, and watched him dominate, you could still see that he was a work in progress, with a lot of room to grow. Once he gets those tools, like strengthening his root foot and crossing, and timing his runs, once he perfects all that, he’s going to just be an amazing player<br /><br />His power is really impressive. He’s a player with certain physical abilities that are elite level. He’s a big kid that is very strong, but that strength and speed is also coupled with a very good sense of how to play in the last third of the field, which is really what separates elite players from non-elite players<br /><br />It was interesting to see him be bombarded by the limelight during that tournament. You could see the buzz, there were agents, scouts from different teams around the world in the lobby and I think he got a bit overwhelmed, but now he’s been through that and he can handle it. He may be only 17, but he has qualities you can’t teach, and he has also shown he can be fearless in situations where you might not expect a young player to be so poised. I’m sure most Bayerns don’t know much about him, but they should be very excited about the player Bayern is getting</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Alphonso Davies? The Canadian teenager Bayern beat out Europe’s best to buy]</b> I knew from the moment I was assigned the national team that Alphonso was a priority. Behind the scenes I knew there were processes in place for him to get his citizenship, but I was adamant about him getting it prior to the <b>[2017]</b> Gold Cup.<br /><br />One thing is to see him on video, but when I saw him alive and up close I knew he was something special and I immediately began talking to the federation president about his citizenship process and where he was at. Once I had him in camp, it confirmed everything that I thought about him<br /><br /><b>[Davies]</b> can play any position because he’s a footballer. He’s really and truly a kid with the soccer sense to know what to do wherever he’s at on the field. In that sense, in the football sense, he can play any position, but where he can be the most effective and he can be more productive is in the last third. He could play in the back, he could play in the midfield, but a kid like that you want up front because he’s going to find his way to the ball and he’s going to score</p>
