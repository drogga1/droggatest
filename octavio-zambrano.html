  <p><b>[Octavio Zambrano placed winning at the top of his list of priorities for Canada’s underachieving men’s program]</b> We have been happy to participate, to be there, to just be one of the contenders. My perception is that we have not been keen enough to think that we can win that competition, that we have to win.<br /><br />You can’t step on the pitch without having the passion to want to win at all costs, fairly. And passion, if you don’t have it, if you don’t have that fire inside that takes you to make that extra move to really put your body and yourself in harm’s way to accomplish something that is huge and is important for this country, then you probably won’t be part of this program<br /><br />I had absolutely nothing to say on the selection process, which was done by Michael Findlay and his staff. I am going to mostly observe, but eventually there will be times when I will begin to interact with the players<br /><br /><b>[Zambrano expects to speak with the players in the lead-up to the Scotland match]</b> They have a game to play, this is the most important thing. I just want to observe, and I will find the right time and the right place to connect with them, I’m sure.</p>

  <p><b>[Alphonso Davies’s $13.5 million transfer to Bayern Munich broke a 10-year-old transfer fee record for MLS]</b> Bayern got a bargain, no doubt. One hundred percent. His best years are ahead of him and he has so much more in his game. I think they got a superb player for a very good deal. Alphonso is a player of three or four times that amount.<br /><br />Even when I had him, and watched him dominate, you could still see that he was a work in progress, with a lot of room to grow. Once he gets those tools, like strengthening his root foot and crossing, and timing his runs, once he perfects all that, he’s going to just be an amazing player<br /><br />His power is really impressive. He’s a player with certain physical abilities that are elite level. He’s a big kid that is very strong, but that strength and speed is also coupled with a very good sense of how to play in the last third of the field, which is really what separates elite players from non-elite players<br /><br />It was interesting to see him be bombarded by the limelight during that tournament. You could see the buzz, there were agents, scouts from different teams around the world in the lobby and I think he got a bit overwhelmed, but now he’s been through that and he can handle it. He may be only 17, but he has qualities you can’t teach, and he has also shown he can be fearless in situations where you might not expect a young player to be so poised. I’m sure most Bayerns don’t know much about him, but they should be very excited about the player Bayern is getting</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Alphonso Davies? The Canadian teenager Bayern beat out Europe’s best to buy]</b> I knew from the moment I was assigned the national team that Alphonso was a priority. Behind the scenes I knew there were processes in place for him to get his citizenship, but I was adamant about him getting it prior to the <b>[2017]</b> Gold Cup.<br /><br />One thing is to see him on video, but when I saw him alive and up close I knew he was something special and I immediately began talking to the federation president about his citizenship process and where he was at. Once I had him in camp, it confirmed everything that I thought about him<br /><br /><b>[Davies]</b> can play any position because he’s a footballer. He’s really and truly a kid with the soccer sense to know what to do wherever he’s at on the field. In that sense, in the football sense, he can play any position, but where he can be the most effective and he can be more productive is in the last third. He could play in the back, he could play in the midfield, but a kid like that you want up front because he’s going to find his way to the ball and he’s going to score</p>
