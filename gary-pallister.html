  <p><b>[Gary Pallister talks about <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a>’s kung-fu kick]</b> Eric had a fuse on him. There is no doubt about that. Ultimately he exploded … Eric was always the number one target for supporters around the country. It wasn’t just players who tried to wind him up but fans felt as though they could do it as well. Some of the abuse he got was terrible. Eventually it took its toll on him I think and it all came to a head that night. He was such a hate figure because he was such a good player<br /><br />I think I was one of the only players that didn’t run over. I just stood there in disbelief. I was more in shock at what I’d just witnessed<br /><br /><b>[An equaliser from Palace defender <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Gareth Southgate</a> denies 10-man United victory. The away dressing room is ablaze with recriminations]</b> Eric was very subdued. He just sat quietly in the corner. He didn’t really say anything. I think he understood the magnitude of what had happened. Everybody was trying to come to terms with how we were going to deal with it<br /><br /><b>[<a href="eric-cantona.html">Cantona</a> did coaching sessions for children during the week at United’s old training ground at The Cliff. But under the terms of his ban he was not allowed to play in any organised matches. United attempted to schedule a series of training games against local teams to keep <a href="eric-cantona.html">Cantona</a> involved, but were censured in a letter from <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> once the matches became public knowledge. Deeply frustrated, <a href="eric-cantona.html">Cantona</a> informed United he was moving back to France]</b> He had his mind set that he wasn’t going to return to English football because of the way he was treated. He thought it was unfair. But the manager was obviously very persuasive. He came back the same player, the same genius</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Pallister has been impressed with Paul Pogba’s recent form for Manchester United]</b> Pogba in the past couple of months has really come to the party. Without playing badly he still struggled at first with the pace the Premier League is played at and wasn’t having the impact everybody thought a 95 million pound player would have. But we’re now seeing the talent he has in abundance. He is a terrific passer of the ball and the physicality is there for all to see. He is different to Robson and Keane who are the two best midfielders I ever played with. They were always kicking and shouting and wanting more and is Pogba like that? He is more laid-back and Vieira-like in his swagger.<br /><br /><b>[On Michael Carrick]</b> All the players appreciate what Michael brings to the team and over the past couple of years the fans do as well. He is such a clever player and different to the mould of Roy Keane or Ince or Bryan Robson. He’s very calm and calculated and makes astute passes while sitting in front of the back four. He gives Pogba the freedom to hurt opposition teams. He has taken the shackles off him</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Pallister believes Wayne Rooney has proved himself as one of the greatest in Manchester United history following his 249th Red Devils goal]</b> He’s been one hell of a player for Manchester United and to equal Sir Bobby’s record puts him up there with the greatest. Unfortunately he lost his place at United for the bigger games and when you’re at his stage of his career it’s easy to take a punt at him and shoot him down. You’re only as good as your last game and that’s the nature of the game now so he has to keep putting in the performances. But we should never forget that what he’s done is incredible and the player he was - and still is - is deserving of respect from everybody out there.<br /><br />But he is 31 and has played an awful lot of football so to expect him to be the player he was is unrealistic. Everybody adapts their game when you go past 30. Keane did it, Ryan Giggs did it, Paul Scholes did it. It’s about managing and Jose will do that and Wayne will too. He can’t play every game if you want longevity</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez adds a different dimension to Manchester United]</b> We used to say we had a great Formula One car but we didn’t have the driver. Eric then became the driver of that car. I think the same could maybe happen with Sanchez. He’s a dynamic player and he’s got an edge to him as well. I like that. I think he could maybe change the way that Man United approach a game. I’m just pleased that he’s here. He is going to add a different dimension to Manchester United.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba was dropped by Manchester United due to a lack of discipline]</b> He’s a physical, imposing midfielder. I think he prefers to play on the left-hand side of the midfield three. It’s not when he’s on the ball, it’s when he’s off the ball that’s the issue. He’s got great vision, but without the ball, he looks uncomfortable. As a team, Jose is trying to make them better without the ball, pressing higher up the pitch and winning the second balls, but it’s not something they’re good at currently. He wants more discipline and that’s why he dropped Pogba. I think that the rumours of rifts are rubbish, and he displayed against Chelsea that he had a bit of fire in his belly. He kept the ball and joined up with the attack, which is when he’s at his best. I learnt under Sir Alex that you have do as the manager says and if you don’t you’ll get left outside.<br /><br />The way United set up, you need that creative spark to get Romelu going. There are certainly bits to his game he needs to improve. He needs to be stronger when holding up the ball, being that pivotal figure, and then bring in the players around him. We need to be more creative in the final third, our build up has been a touch slow and lethargic. He’s scored 23 goals this year, which you can’t ask any more of your centre-forward, but with <b>[Alexis]</b> Sanchez, it will only benefit Lukaku</p>

  <p><b>[Mourinho will be making a huge mistake if he forgets about match-winner Marcus Rashford]</b> I think players always feel pressure when they lose game time, but it should also act as an incentive to play better and fight for their place. There’s always competition for places at Manchester United and it’s down to the players in question to fight for that place. Rashford and Martial have both got quality, but have also had some problems. Marcus has had a dip in form, but he’s young and he has to learn from this. He needs to focus on his training and impressing Jose. They both need to be more consistent.<br /><br />Marcus was good, and immediately he created dangerous situations and immediately brought <b>[a threat]</b> to the side and opened more spaces between defenders where our attacking players could make runs and penetrate these gaps. From the wider positional point of view he was very good for us<br /><br />At his age, what he’s doing is more than enough and the experience he’s getting at every level is more than enough for us to be happy with what we think is going to be his future. But because he had such an impact at the beginning, probably people expect him to play even more than he does, and score even more than he does and perform even more than what he does but it is not so simple. What I see makes me really happy, to see the same boy. Marcus is a fantastic boy, also very grounded. For sure, we love him and we believe in him, and he’s going to have the chances. The good thing with Marcus is that he can play in the three attacking positions, so even when he doesn’t start, to have him on the bench is such a security for me and for the team. He’s a fantastic option for us</p>

  <p><b>[Eric Bailly has been branded overzealous and rash by Gary Pallister]</b> I don’t think he is the finished article. I think overzealous is the description I would use for him at the moment. He’s not always going to catch the eye with stuff he does on the ball. He loves defending. He’s aggressive and willing to put his body on the line. As he grows in stature, he will get better and better. He’s not the finished article he could possibly be and is a little bit rash at times and desperate to win the ball. That comes with age and maturity.</p>

  <p><b>[Romelu Lukaku’s comments regarding a future move to Serie A are disrespectful]</b> I think it’s disrespectful at times if you start mentioning other clubs when you’re actually contracted to the club you’re at. If it’s in your mind I’ve got no problem with that but to put it in print I’ve got a problem with that. At a time when a club is under real pressure to have their leading goal-scorer say he’d like to move abroad - if that’s what he has done - is not the ideal scenario.</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba can look a little bit lackadaisical]</b> At times he can look a little bit lackadaisical with the ball but at other times he can light up the whole stadium. The latter is what people at Old Trafford want to see: I mean that ball he played for Fred against Wolves was a moment of absolute genius. He saw the pass, he executed it, and it was right out of the top drawer and he has the ability to do that god knows how many times in a game. When we’re out of possession people look at Paul and think he could give a little bit more for the team. And that comes from being an £89m player and being talked about as one of the best players in the world.<br /><br /><b>[On Alexis Sanchez]</b> I was absolutely buzzing when United signed him because his performances at Arsenal showed he was a world-class talent. But for whatever reason it has not been working out and I’m sure Alexis will be one of the first to say he has not been producing the form we expected of him. Maybe he doesn’t suit the manager’s style of play. Maybe he hasn’t been hitting it off with the forwards he’s playing alongside. But I think he will turn it around and he will score goals and excite the crowd. It’s about getting the balance right and then we’ll see the best of him</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> is considered to have succeeded at Manchester United where David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho failed]</b> He’s put himself in prime position, there’s no doubt about it. Everybody’s now talking about two defeats back to back and ‘has the bubble burst?’ and what have you. Let’s just remember what he’s done. He’s come in and been a breath of fresh air. For the first time since probably Sir Alex Ferguson left the fans are feeling excitement about going to watch Manchester United at Old Trafford. I think there’s been too much negativity with the way managers have tried to get Manchester United to play, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and even Jose <b>[Mourinho]</b>. I think Ole’s come in there and as people have said he’s taken the shackles off and let people go out and express themselves. That’s the way he was managed under Sir Alex and that’s the way he wants to manage these players now. You’ve got some of the best players in the world, give them their freedom to go and express themselves and show that they’re the best players in the world. He’s doing that so far.</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Pallister says Manchester United must continue to aim high]</b> United should be aiming high, there’s no doubt about it. They’re one of the richest clubs in the world, one of the biggest clubs in the world, so it’s only right that Manchester United has them expectations. We’ve taken knocks over previous seasons and we’ve needed a manager who understands what Manchester United’s all about. That’s not to say that that’s the be-all and end-all, you’ve still got to manage the club and do the right things and make the big decisions, but that’s something Ole’s probably going to be learning as he goes along. He does understand the history and the tradition, but it’s not just the history and tradition. The fact that we are one of the richest clubs in the world, the biggest clubs in the world, means that we should be playing a brand of football that is entertaining and successful, and not being intimidated wherever we go whether it be Man City or Liverpool, going there with the idea that we can win these games<br /><br />If I was a player under Ole I think I’d be quite excited. He gives players the freedom, and I think that’s what’s been lacking at Manchester United. If you’re supposedly among the best players in the world and you come in to Manchester United and you find things a little bit negative it takes the fun out of the football. These guys are very talented players, that’s why they signed for Manchester United, so they need to be given the freedom to go and showcase their talents, and I think that’s what Ole’s trying to do. I think everybody’s going to be better for a pre-season with Ole, Ole’s going to be better for working with these players for six months or whatever it is by the end of the season. I expect work to be done on the squad in the summer as even if you’re successful you have to work on the squad season upon season. Sir Alex Ferguson did that, it didn’t matter how successful we were, he was always looking to bring players in. So that’s not going to change, it’s then just the kind of quality you can bring into the club<br /><br />My parents bought me football boots, they took me to training. Whether basketball, cricket, football, athletics, I was doing everything and my parents were really supportive with that. My schoolmaster was very influential in my footballing career, he changed me from being a centre-forward at age 15 to being a centre-half at age 16, which fundamentally took me down the professional route so I’m thankful to him. And then Willie Maddren was the guy who brought me into the professional game when he was manager at Middlesbrough when I arrived as a 19-year-old. He had the time to give me one-on-one training sessions in afternoons after morning training</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Pallister says <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a> has what it takes to captain <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> after his impressive debut for the club]</b> <b>[Maguire]</b> is not afraid to put his head in where it hurts, he wins his tackles, he’s a big lad, a big unit and he has that presence that you need to be a captain and he leads by example. I’m not 100% sure if he’d be a screaming and shouting captain, but you can have all different types of captains. You can have a <a href="tony-adams.html">Tony Adams</a> or a <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> who shout and scream, or you can have an <b>[Eric]</b> <a href="eric-cantona.html">Cantona</a> who doesn’t shout and scream but just leads by example on the pitch. I don’t know which category he falls into, but he looks a figure of authority within the side and I could definitely see him becoming United captain in the future<br /><br />I think Maguire is such a dominant centre half, he does the basics really well and also has the ability to bring the ball out and help create things. Considering the kind of fee that he came in for and the pressure that he’s under because of that fee, the way he played was huge bonus for United. Everyone is expecting Maguire to be like <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a>, and whether he can play that role or not will have to wait to be seen. He’s made a good start, we know that he’s a quality player and we’re looking for those leadership qualities in that side, which I think have been lacking; hopefully Harry can provide that.<br /><br />He can head it, he can chest it, and he does all of the basics well. He’s got aggression but he’s also got that calmness and doesn’t panic when he’s given the ball in tight situations, and we all know how comfortable he is on the ball from watching <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and England. It’s early days but he brought calmness to the back four, but he’s only finding his feet within a team that he’s only played one game for. He’s only going to get better, and the same for Wan Bissaka; he’s only played one game but already his tackling, his spirit and his speed excites the fans</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Pallister believes <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> has the potential to be the world’s best midfielder if his talents are harnessed correctly]</b> The ball that he put through for <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>, the drive and making the goal for Daniel James; that’s the <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> that we want to see. If you can harness that talent then you have one of the best midfield players in the world, if not the best. It all depends on Paul, what he sees, what he believes and what he wants to do. If he’s not happy at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, as <b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>]</b> said, he wants players that want to play for the shirt; that are desperate to play for the shirt. Until we get closer to the end of the transfer window for the clubs in Spain then there will always be this conjecture. Ole has been very positive about Paul staying and wanting to get the best out of him as he’s a fantastic player and on his day we are talking about a world-class player<br /><br /><b>[Pallister was full of praise for the young English attacker]</b> There are big expectations on Marcus and I thought he put his penalty away clinically and I look at him as a more instinctive finisher. Sometimes he has too much time, but I thought on Sunday he was clinical as he had a little bit of time but he put his second away fantastically well. Maybe that’s something that Ole has been working on with him, as there was no better finisher than Ole Gunnar. When you get into those situations you want someone with a cool head and immaculate finishing, and Marcus was absolutely clinical with his second goal. There’s been a lot of expectation on Marcus for both England and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> for a while. He will play in a three-pronged attack either up front or on the flank, and he’s comfortable in all of those areas. He’s maturing, and there’s no doubt he’s the man now <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> has gone</p>

He’s six foot odd, can use both left and right feet, knows how to score a goal and he looks the real deal at the moment. He’s still got a lot of work to do, he has to mature and find his feet at that level.

United looked at a couple of options in the forward line but they couldn’t happen, which puts the pressure on young forwards like <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> who is 22 and Mason who is 17, <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial who is 24.<br /><br />It’s not a great deal of experience and I think that is a position in the team that Ole would’ve liked a bit more experience. Martial has been out a few weeks and <a href="jesse-lingard.html">Jesse Lingard</a> has had injuries, it’s been a struggle to keep everyone fit and he will have been frustrated by that. You need a different mentality away from home, and Ole will be disappointed with some of the performances especially away from home</p>

  <p><b>[Gary Pallister has compared <a href="harry-maguire.html">Harry Maguire</a>’s £80 million move to <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> to his own record arrival at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a>]</b> It was a big challenge and I don’t think you’re quite prepared when you come into a club like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, just how big it is and what it means. Not just here in Manchester, nor in the UK but when I started travelling abroad and realised how big this place is and what it means to people across the world. That kind of takes you aback and it does take time to settle in. There are very few people who can do it - <a href="eric-cantona.html">Eric Cantona</a> can walk in, with his chest puffed out, and say: ‘This is me, this is where I belong’ and just embrace that kind of pressure. For mere mortals like myself, it took me a bit more time</p>
