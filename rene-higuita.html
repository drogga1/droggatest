<blockquote>
  <p>[Bayern Munich star James Rodriguez is good enough to play for any team in the world] He is a natural leader. That’s why he’s the leading representative of the national team and our country and we hold him in high regard for that. He’s achieved things thanks to his ability, humility and work rate. He’s the complete player: he scores, he’s got a lot of technique and he’s a team player. He knows how to put a good cross in, find the back of the net and arrive late. He can play for any team in the world.<br /><br />[Asked if James could be compared to any of the legendary figures from his era] With El Pibe [‘The Kid’, Carlos Valderrama]. People wanted him to be fast, but he was fast with his mind. He was mentally quick, the one who stood out in our era. And the one with most experience. He’d already played in France when we were just leaving the country. The whole market opened up after that and it gives us a lot of satisfaction to see so many Colombians playing around the world now</p>
