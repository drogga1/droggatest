  <p><b>[Alan Pulido, who scored for the national team for the first time since a spring 2014 friendly against the United States]</b> The truth is that I was out of the national team for two years, and either of those tournaments would be good for my career.</p>

  <p><b>[Alan Pulido injury a painful blow for Mexico’s Gold Cup team]</b> I’m a bit sad because the Gold Cup was the goal I wanted. This dream is now behind me with my injury, a fracture in my right arm’s humerus. I had hoped to be able to participate and have a good showing at the tournament. Obviously, that goes away with the injury. At the end of the day, I’m calm because I know that I’ll be returning as quickly as possible and doing what I’ve been working toward in Liga MX and with the national team. I’m going to be back again</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas forward Alan Pulido injury to keep him out more than four months. Team doctor Alberto Robles said]</b> Alan will have his arm immobilized for around six weeks and in the seventh he could start to have movement. It’s estimated there will be a total of 18 weeks for his integration back onto the field with normal activity</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas forward Alan Pulido injury to keep him out more than four months]</b> I thought it was going to require surgery, but they took X-Rays and the doctors told me that the best thing is not to turn to surgery. It makes me happy because it doesn’t change the <b>[recovery]</b> time and this also was important</p>

  <p><b>[Chivas forward Alan Pulido says there was a chance to leave the Guadalajara club this offseason]</b> I still have a contract with Chivas, and my dream is to go to Europe again. Yeah, I knew there were some possibilities, but I focused on myself. I wasn’t going to make a decision while my agent and the club directors weren’t telling me anything. Today I belong to Chivas and am defending their colors.<br /><br /><b>[Pulido said with a laugh]</b> I didn’t hear that they booed me. They booed me? Those are things that happen. I see it as flattery. It means that since I left here things have gone well in my career</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico players eager for new manager to be named]</b> It’s urgent that the manager be announced now so we can know how he’s going to play and we can adapt ourselves to get better and be kept in mind.<br /><br />These type of games let you know where we are and the type of competition that is needed against teams like Argentina, where all their players are in Europe and they can have even two national teams and we can’t. But these games help to gain experience</p>

  <p><b>[in-their-prime Mexican internationals are moving to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, further igniting a budding rivalry with Liga MX]</b> It would be a privilege to play against other Mexican players in an international league. It will be a pleasure to face <a href="carlos-vela.html">Vela</a>, <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a> and other Latino players. We each want to show our own level and that, in return, raises the competitive level. We played together in the Mexican national team, so we know each other well</p>

  <p><b>[Pulido believes that coming and playing in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is a viable option]</b> It’s a good thing that <a href="tata-martino.html">Tata Martino</a> coached here. He won <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup. The fact that he looks at <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, at the league, is very important. Part of the reason I chose to come to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is because of that: I want to return to the Mexican national team. Of course, each league wants the best players. In Mexico, I do think that they get upset when a Mexican player decides to come to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> over Liga MX, but they need to respect each player’s decision. Players really analyze their decisions. The league here has changed a lot competitively but also personally, I chose to come here because I am the kind of player that enjoys challenges and this is a challenge that makes me very happy</p>

  <p><b>[Alan Pulido laments criticism of <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a>’s ‘Mexican legend’ remark]</b> In Mexico you can’t praise yourself. That’s how the Mexican culture is. When a foreign player does it, we all applaud him. We say, ‘What a great mentality this player has. Of course he’s left a footprint, which very few players have done<br /><br />The majority of young players want to be like <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a>. It’s not bad that he says that, that he recognize it. He’s not lying. It’s a reality. He serves as motivation for every one of us. He’s an emblem of Mexicans soccer. It makes me happy to know there are players with great talent who are able to succeed in other countries<br /><br />Other types of players support each other amongst themselves. They’ve got another culture that’s very different from the Mexican players. When it comes to speaking about a Mexican player, the criticisms rain down. They call you lucky. It happens in other jobs, in other situations in Mexico. They never give credit to the person who has put in the effort, they never applaud that.<br /><br />Something extra has to happen so you might be able to come out on top. They said <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a> was a ‘tronco,’ that he didn’t score goals. Then he was scoring goals, and they said it was lucky. You realize how the Mexican culture is. It has made me sad on a number of occasions.<br /><br />The fans don’t want to see success stories, even less if they’re Mexican. There, they praise the foreign player more when he’s top scorer. They celebrate it more and start to say he’s ‘a crack’. That’s how the culture is. It’s the reality</p>
