  <p><b>[in-their-prime Mexican internationals are moving to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, further igniting a budding rivalry with Liga MX]</b> It would be a privilege to play against other Mexican players in an international league. It will be a pleasure to face <a href="carlos-vela.html">Vela</a>, <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a> and other Latino players. We each want to show our own level and that, in return, raises the competitive level. We played together in the Mexican national team, so we know each other well</p>

  <p><b>[Pulido believes that coming and playing in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is a viable option]</b> It’s a good thing that <a href="tata-martino.html">Tata Martino</a> coached here. He won <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Cup. The fact that he looks at <a href="mls.html">MLS</a>, at the league, is very important. Part of the reason I chose to come to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is because of that: I want to return to the Mexican national team. Of course, each league wants the best players. In Mexico, I do think that they get upset when a Mexican player decides to come to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> over Liga MX, but they need to respect each player’s decision. Players really analyze their decisions. The league here has changed a lot competitively but also personally, I chose to come here because I am the kind of player that enjoys challenges and this is a challenge that makes me very happy</p>

  <p><b>[Alan Pulido laments criticism of <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a>’s ‘Mexican legend’ remark]</b> In Mexico you can’t praise yourself. That’s how the Mexican culture is. When a foreign player does it, we all applaud him. We say, ‘What a great mentality this player has. Of course he’s left a footprint, which very few players have done<br /><br />The majority of young players want to be like <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a>. It’s not bad that he says that, that he recognize it. He’s not lying. It’s a reality. He serves as motivation for every one of us. He’s an emblem of Mexicans soccer. It makes me happy to know there are players with great talent who are able to succeed in other countries<br /><br />Other types of players support each other amongst themselves. They’ve got another culture that’s very different from the Mexican players. When it comes to speaking about a Mexican player, the criticisms rain down. They call you lucky. It happens in other jobs, in other situations in Mexico. They never give credit to the person who has put in the effort, they never applaud that.<br /><br />Something extra has to happen so you might be able to come out on top. They said <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a> was a ‘tronco,’ that he didn’t score goals. Then he was scoring goals, and they said it was lucky. You realize how the Mexican culture is. It has made me sad on a number of occasions.<br /><br />The fans don’t want to see success stories, even less if they’re Mexican. There, they praise the foreign player more when he’s top scorer. They celebrate it more and start to say he’s ‘a crack’. That’s how the culture is. It’s the reality</p>
