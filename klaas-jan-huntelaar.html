  <p><b>[Robin van Persie faced criticism from members of the Netherlands setup after shooting instead of passing to Klaas-Jan Huntelaar when 1-0 down to Kazakhstan]</b> If that ball had come to me, I could have ran it in to the goal. I was focussed on that chance and wanted to score as soon as possible. If you must have the ball, you might get upset sometimes. That happens in a game. But we’ve won. That’s most important.</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar says that he has pleasant recollections of his time at Real Madrid]</b> Real is a beautiful club. I played there 10 years ago and I spent a small part of my career in Madrid. Feelings? It’s more about nice memories. The Bernabeu is a fantastic stadium, probably the best stadium I have ever played <b>[in]</b>. If you look up into the stands, you can see how steep it is. People are sitting so close to the pitch that you can feel their eyes burn in your back.<br /><br />At a certain moment, everybody had to leave, including the coach, technical director and chairman. They don’t really bother about a million more or less. That’s how it works, it’s football. They need you or they don’t. I could have stayed for a couple of years, but, for me, the sporting part was the most important thing. In the end, I also noticed the club took a different turn, so it wasn’t very interesting for me to stay<br /><br />If we play like we played earlier this season in the Champions League, we can make it very difficult for Real Madrid. But, at first hand, they are the favourites. We will only be satisfied if we qualify for the next round. It’s more realistic to think they will make it, but that’s not the way we think, because this is our chance to make history</p>
