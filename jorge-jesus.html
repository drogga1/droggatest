We have to put on a show too. Now we have a rulebook. Hours in which you can and cannot do things inside and outside the club. There is an idea in Europe that Brazilian players do not like to work. The Portuguese saying is that if you have more than four Brazilians in your team, what you’ve actually put together is a samba band. But I came to see them and it is not the case: they are very professional and know what they are doing</p>
