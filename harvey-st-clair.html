  <p><b>[Chelsea have seen highly-rated midfielder Harvey St Clair opt against signing a new contract at Stamford Bridge and instead complete a move to Venezia]</b> I’m really pleased that everything’s settled because it’s been on my mind for months. I’ll go out to Italy on July 7 to start pre-season preparations and I’m looking forward to it already, but it was a really difficult decision to leave Chelsea and one I didn’t take lightly. It’s been a very hard decision for me and my family. I first trained with Chelsea when I was six years old so I’ve been associated with the club for a long time now. They’ve done so much to help me over that period of time.<br /><br />They’re a great club with an unbelievable academy. I just feel like it’s the right decision for me at this point in my career. I really want to be playing regular first-team football if I can and with the depth of talent Chelsea have available to them then I just didn’t see that happening in the short term. That’s absolutely not a criticism of them - just a fact of life. It’s the level that they’re at. Venezia are really ambitious and looking to go places and, like I said, my focus is to be playing first-team football. It’s something I feel I need at this age.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea’s would-be loanee who chose a permanent move to Serie B instead]</b> I wasn’t going to go to Zenit St Petersburg or Watford. It was only Chelsea or Venezia, so I just felt that the best thing for my football development was Venezia. The opportunity arose and I liked the fact that it was a new challenge. Everything about the move made it seem like a no-brainer to me and I just thought, ‘Let’s go for it’. I think that British players are just looking for opportunities and I think in the English game that level in the Premier League is so high that it is more difficult for young players nowadays. I think I probably would have gone on loan had I stayed. I just felt like at this moment in time that the best moment for me was to come here and have a new challenge. Obviously Venice is a beautiful city but I didn’t come here for a holiday. I am here to develop as a player and play first-team football. I came here for a new challenge and opportunities to play senior football. It was an unbelievable experience to make my debut and one that I will never forget. The fans in Italy are very passionate and it was amazing to play in front of the home crowd and to make my professional debut was a proud moment for me. I watched a lot of Italian football when I was younger. There are the great teams in Italy, I remember watching the Champions League when Inter beat Barcelona. It seems like a great place to play football. The fans are great, so that helped me decide to come here<br /><br />The aim is for me is to play as many games as possible. To try to help the team as much as possible. Every day I want to improve to become the best possible version I can be of myself. I just want to try and do as well as possible<br /><br /> is very surprising how good they are. We have a few veterans in the team. We have a lot of experience, it is nothing like being around teenagers anymore. These are grown men who are very strong. We have a lot of technical players here as well. On the tactical side of things, they do quite a lot of video work. The manager will say what we are going to do. We look back on the last game and analyse the positives and negatives. Lots of stuff on corners, throw-ins, free-kicks and that side of thing is a bit different. As the level goes up, the detail goes up<br /><br />Joe Edwards is definitely one who I’d like to thank. Last season he showed a lot of faith in me and he gave me a lot of game time. He is a really good guy and a great coach. Michael Bill also, he always encouraged players to play with freedom which I like to do. There were a lot of great coaches at Chelsea who I could have named, but those two stand out to me</p>
