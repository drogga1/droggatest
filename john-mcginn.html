  <p><b>[John McGinn has brought talk of a possible move away from <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> to a close by penning a new five-year contract with the club]</b> I have loved every minute of my time at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> and I am delighted to commit myself to the club for the long term</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>’s John McGinn ‘had a little chuckle’ at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> links]</b> I had a little chuckle at it to be honest. I’m sure a lot of people did. It is up to me to go and prove it is justified. At that point, my whole mindset was on Villa and being successful here. I have still got so much left to learn and prove. In the environment here I am appreciated. I’m loved and respected by everyone - there is no better feeling. I still have to pinch myself driving in. I feel like one of the main players here but I still need to improve and get better. To have any speculation lingering about isn’t what you want. I’m just glad to be settled and to focus on the next five years<br /><br /><b>[But with a remade squad that features 12 new players, including record signing Wesley, even McGinn isn’t ready to make predictions on how their return to the top flight will play out]</b> I am not sure. There are a lot of new signings. A lot of boys have had to get their visas and stuff sorted, get used to the cuisine in <a href="birmingham-city-fc.html">Birmingham</a> and the temperature. It took me seven months to get used to it. They are nice lads, no egos, I think that is important, with Villa being in the Premier League. Speaking to some of the experienced boys they all say Villa had a reputation for bad characters and big egos. I don’t think we have that now. It is an important trait to have for a hard-working club. I think they have recruited well in that sense</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> (3) vs (1) <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> had been trailing through John McGinn’s well-taken first-half goal, although Villa ultimately could not keep up their impressive defensive effort as fatigue seemed to take its toll]</b> We’d have swapped it for a different result. We gave a good account of ourselves, but we need to be a bit braver going forward and stop the mistakes. A team like <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> punishes you<br /><br />It’s surreal. It’s been quite a nice journey for me - a few years ago I was playing in the Scottish Championship, so to score at a stadium like this for my first Premier League goal was obviously an incredible moment for me. We had confidence, it’s just a bit of an eye-opener that the jump up to the Premier League is massive. You can’t let Harry Kane go free in the box. The whole team is to blame; it’s not just individual mistakes</p>

  <p><b>[Goalscorer McGinn also hit out at the team’s mentality, with Scotland now looking likely to extended their miserable record of having failed to qualify for a major tournament since 1998 after squandering the advantage and losing 2-1]</b> It was a mixture of things, maybe we lacked a bit of belief and that is not acceptable. We have got to believe we can go and make it 2-0 and 3-0 because if we don’t do that we are not going to make any tournaments. We know we are capable in there and that is the frustrating thing. All the boys are gutted. We know we have messed up and we know what we have to improve on and, if it happens again, hopefully we will be in better position to solve it</p>

  <p><b>[Scotland international John McGinn said he’d swap his first goal for his country for three points after Russia came back to win their Euro 2020 qualifier on Friday night]</b> It was an amazing feeling, it’s something that’s been bugging me as I’ve scored at club level. I was really keen to do it but if i could swap it now for three points, I’d do that every day of the week<br /><br /><b>[He believes that trying to protect their slender advantage played into Russia’s hands]</b> We were in a really good position in a game we needed to win and I think everyone will agree that we started really well and positively. We dropped back and invited Russia onto us and they punished us for it. When we we were bringing our strength to them and playing high up the park, they didn’t have a chance to play. But we started dropping off and that allows them to put it into the big man and play to their strengths. We allowed that too often. If we’re going to qualify for a major tournament we’re going to have to improve and improve fast</p>

  <p><b>[John McGinn says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> players were arguing among themselves at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>]</b> A lot of their players were arguing and you could tell they were uncomfortable in the first half. When teams start arguing with each other you normally know you’ve got them but at the same time you have to respect they are such a good team, they just regroup, get together and go again. Unfortunately for us they did that<br /><br /><b>[While <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> matched <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for long periods at <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Villa Park</a>, McGinn concedes that the relentless will of the Reds to take maximum points]</b> You’re playing against the champions of Europe and they could be the champions of England this year. They don’t give up, they keep going and they probably tired us out too much right at the end. Chances were coming and we were just trying to keep them at bay but the ball just keeps coming back at you. It was two sloppy goals from our point of view but teams like <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> do that to you. They are relentless. It was the same with <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> last week, they just drain you mentally. You try your best to press them but they are top teams and full credit to them. I was speaking to a couple of the <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> lads and they said how impressed they were at the way we played them - carry that on and I’m sure we’ll be fine</p>
