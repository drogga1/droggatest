  <p><b>[Florentino Perez is famed for his ‘Galacticos’ transfer policy at Real Madrid, with it revealed that he has paid more than necessary for players in the past]</b> It was 2002, and for Madrid’s centenary celebrations we organised a match of some of the world’s leading players against Real Madrid. It occurred to me to call Kaka. He came and played brilliantly in the last 20 minutes. At the end of the match I spoke to Florentino and told him: ‘We’ve got an amazing player here who right now costs 12 million euros and in four years time he’ll cost 60’. The answer from Florentino for me was unforgettable: ‘Don’t worry Jorge. We’ll wait till he costs 60’.<br /><br />Nowadays, to buy a Vinicius, who still hasn’t broken through in the top-flight, is starting at 60 million euros. Did Florentino change? No. The market changed, now it’s incredibly difficult for the club to be able to wait for a talent to mature into a Ballon d’Or winner and then buy them just because you’re Real Madrid<br /><br />Now you have to get in before then, because if any Premier League club gets their hands on a major talent, it’ll be difficult to sign them later. You have to think with a certain amount of planning and buy at prices you can pay players who are bets for the future</p>

I think Madrid have interest in him, but I do not know about any offers or any potential bids but it would be nearly impossible to sign a player who can sell a lot like him. I would prefer if they go for Mbappe as he would be a long-term investment because he is six years younger and is already at the top level. He scores lot of goals, plays direct attacking football, breaks through defences and he will define the next decade of football, he reminds me of Ronaldo Nazario.

  <p><b>[Gareth Bale is no longer a priority for Real Madrid and Zinedine Zidane]</b> Something interesting happened on Sunday: his first touch was whistled, but then, when he was through one on one, he dinked the ball just over the bar and was widely applauded. People still expect promise that has never been fulfilled. To his credit, he has fulfilled this promise at critical times, with trophies on the line, but, judging his performances regularly, he has produced less than expected. At any rate, Bale would be starting if Madrid wanted to cash in. Zidane has other priorities. He’s looking at players for next season<br /><br /><b>[On Karim Benzema]</b> He’s really embraced being the main figure and in areas we never expected. A year or so ago, we would never have thought it, when he was more of a 10 than a nine. Now he’s playing as a nine and a ten and with confidence. At the moment, there is no bigger player at the club and people recognise that<br /><br />Real Madrid will make a mistake if they don’t sign another striker. They have to sign a player with different qualities, which is not easy; they can’t just sign another player to displace Benzema; it’s not worth spending 200 million in that position. Money has to be spent in other positions, in goalscoring midfielders. The starting striker position is covered at the moment</p>

You don’t see many teams waiting and throwing balls forward. The result is God-like.
