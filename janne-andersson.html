  <p><b>[Janne Andersson talks about the significance of shocking Italy to qualify for the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> WorldCup]</b> I cried a few tears. Look at some of the older players who felt that this was the last chance to make it to a World Cup - and now we did it. It’s indescribable. We have many heroes tonight</p>

  <p><b>[Sweden manager Janne Andersson confirms that the country’s all-time top scorer <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> will not be a part of his plans for Russia 2018]</b> <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Ibrahimovic</a> said no to the national team. He was not going to be in the team after the European Championship, and I respected him. If you rejected the team, I do not think you should come back. I respect what he said and those who said ‘yes’. <b>[Ibrahimovic]</b> has not called me, but he’s definitely not included in the plans for the World Cup</p>

  <p><b>[Janne Andersson offers his apology for the incident at the training camp in Austria, where a member of the Sweden coaching staff got into a closed training session and was told to leave. The Swede thought the training session was open, Andersson said, and left when asked]</b> He watched from more of a distance as a result. It took a long car journey into the mountains to reach the house but it was a perfect spot to observe the Korean team’s training<br /><br />It’s very important we show respect for opponents, always and in every way. If it has been perceived in another way, we apologise</p>

  <p><b>[Janne Andersson accuses Germany coaching staff of gracelessness in victory and rubbing it into their faces]</b> Some of the group leaders of their team celebrated by running in our direction, rubbing it into our faces by making gestures. That really got me annoyed and angry. We had fought it out for 90 minutes and at the end you should shake hands. So I was very angry with that<br /><br />People behaved in ways that you do not do. You should leave your opponents to feel sad. You do not act in the way they did. We reacted very strongly<br /><br /><b>[Sweden had been stunned when <a href="jerome-boateng.html">Jérôme Boateng</a>’s clear last-man push on Marcus Berg did not result in the award of a 12th-minute penalty]</b> I have not watched it but the people on my team who have say this is a clear penalty. If you have this VAR system, it is unfortunate that the referee feels so secure in the situation not to have a look. There are so many feelings around right now, but it is the most disappointing end to a game I have ever felt</p>

  <p><b>[Sweden coach Janne Andersson has brought <a href="alexander-isak.html">Alexander Isak</a> back into the frame]</b> It’s great that it has worked out so well for him. He has developed in most areas. In each match he has taken on more and more and made a number of nice goals here at the end. He was with the latest national team because he is good enough, not because he is young and promising. It’s great that things are going so well for him and that he’s getting the playing time he needs. It is also evident that he has been in a good training environment, he has developed most and grown as a player in several different ways</p>

  <p><b>[New <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a> signing <a href="dejan-kulusevski.html">Dejan Kulusevski</a> has been compared to former <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> star <a href="arjen-robben.html">Arjen Robben</a> by Sweden manager Janne Andersson]</b> Dejan hasn’t been with us for long, but has already shown he has great potential. Considering his pace, his ball control and his finishing, I see him as similar to <a href="arjen-robben.html">Robben</a>. He works hard and is very quick. If he continues like this, he will be in the Sweden squad for many years to come. A coach always appreciates a player who can take on multiple roles and it’ll be very interesting to see his tactical evolution. As things stand now, I think he’s perfect as a winger. <a href="dejan-kulusevski.html">Kulusevski</a> really lives for football and puts the work in. If I need to find a reason for his rapid ascent, that would be it. He’s still young, but I hope he is ready for <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>. As a national team coach, you always want your players in the top teams and I think he can really grow in <a href="juventus.html">Juve</a>’s current system. Italian football is an excellent place to learn about football in all its forms. In Sweden, we do learn about tactics quite young and that helps provide the foundations. It’ll be very interesting to see his tactical evolution</p>
