He has problems but he doesn’t have pain. He’ll need to undergo surgery at some point, but he will talk to our medical staff. He will think carefully about interrupting his current spell. It’s his decision and we will respect it because he’s a super-important player for us.

That’s what we have to focus on. We practiced a couple of things we want to see changed and the team did a really good job. I can’t change everything - 90 minutes is not enough to change a whole team, but it’s about the attitude and maybe changing one or two things tactically, emphasising one or two things differently. I want the team to be active and taking the initiative. We need intensity in defence when we are with and without possession. Since I’ve been here I’ve been fascinated by the talent in the squad. They have enormous potential to perform and we’re not seeing enough of that</p>

It was important for him to do so. He is in a very good way and is on the right track. It’s not easy to come to Germany and get a foothold straight away. He will show his quality again. We will see. I have been very satisfied with Alphonso. He has done very well defensively. His pace makes him an asset for us at the back. He is also very strong on the ball. I really like his development<br /><br />We need to approach the game with focus. They can surprise us if we’re not at 100 per cent. We want to end the year with three wins. It’s not easy, but that’s the target we have set ourselves. Not everything is perfect. You can never achieve perfection. We have to work better together, put pressure on the opponent early on.
