  <p><b>[<a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend Paulo Ferreira says he has been blown away by Reece James’ rapid rate of development over the past year]</b> He is a top player and a fantastic boy. For me, it was a pleasure to work with him last season when he was at Wigan. You could see the potential of the player and I thought he could come back to the club and do well. But if you ask me if I thought he would be doing what he has been doing, then I wouldn’t have believed you!<br /><br />But I am happy he surprised me. He is a fantastic boy, he is easy to work with and what he has been doing this season has been fantastic. He is really good going forward, with amazing crosses. You could see that at Wigan. But he has also improved a lot defensively. He is still a young player and learning. He has lots to improve on and too improve, you need minutes, to be tested and to make mistakes. But clearly he is going in the right direction</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s reform of football’s loan system]</b> I am really happy to do this job and to help and support the loan players. It is important and to see some of them back at the club is fantastic and I am really happy with that. It is good because we were able to bring players in even with not being able to sign players in the summer, so we looked for our loan players. Frank brought the ones who he thought were ready to play for the club and we are happy with that. I think what he has been doing so far has been good. We look forward to seeing the club win trophies in the future, especially with these young boys who are playing now. When they grow up, they will be the future of this club. <a href="reece-james.html">Reece James</a>, <a href="mason-mount.html">Mason Mount</a> and Abraham have all been very good. <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> has been outstanding recently: This is what you are looking for. They still need time and more opportunities but I have no doubt they will be the future of this club. We have players with great potential who we would love to see coming back next season again but that will be not our decision. That’s up to Frank on whether the player is ready to come, not mine. For us, it is just to make sure that we give the best support, help them, or to go for a bigger club and to continue their progression</p>

  <p><b>[Former Portugal team-mate Paulo Ferreira says <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> can continue playing until he is 40]</b> I’ve known <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> for a long time. His attitude, how professional he is, how hard he works - they are all outstanding. Until his body doesn’t allow him to play anymore, he will stay at this level. And I think he will last for four or five years more. He is still an important player who everyone respects. He is still feared because he can decide a game. I saw him develop of course. I played with and against him from the time he was 18 and he deserves to still be at this level for everything he has achieved and all the work he has put in. To still be playing at this level at 35, you have to look after yourself. You need to work hard, rest and eat properly. He does all that so when he says, he can go on until 40, I agree. Let’s see how his body handles it but if he doesn’t get injuries, then he can definitely do it</p>
