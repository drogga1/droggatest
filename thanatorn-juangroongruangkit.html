  <p>I believe that if the election is free and fair, it will be a landslide for the anti-status quo parties. I have been to 77 provinces in Thailand already and all of the people I talk to on my campaign trail, they are sick of the NCPO <b>[National Council for Peace and Order]</b> and I find very very few people who support Prayut Chan-ocha. But we also know the thai military will use all the tricks up their sleeve to stay in power</p>

This current situation is not democracy. It’s not to the benefit of the country. We need to prioritise the voice of the people and stop the NCPO holding on to power.

  <p><b>[Mr Thanathorn spoke at a forum held by the Foreign Correspondents’Club of Thailand about the future of his party]</b> A few weeks after the election, my mother was contacted by a senior Palang Pracharath Party member. By then, there were already many lawsuits against me and other senior party members. The PPRP man told my mother, ‘Khun Somporn <b>[Mr Thanathorn’s mother]</b>, we can clear all these lawsuits if you ask your son to transfer 20 MPs from FFP to PPRP’. My mum, who’s nervous and fear for her son’s safety and is not much into politics, called me and said, ‘Thanathorn, we’ve got an offer. You’ve won so many so why don’t you just give them 20’. This is the kind of society we live in</p>
