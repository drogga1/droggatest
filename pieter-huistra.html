  <p><b>[Van Dijk better than <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Vidic</a> &amp; is serious Ballon d’Or contender]</b> I’m biased anyway, so I would choose Virgil. He has more, he has a little bit more. <a href="nemanja-vidic.html">Vidic</a>, of course, without any doubt was a very good player, he played in a top team. In my view, Virgil has everything. He has the flair, he has the technique, he has the passing, he has the defensive leadership, he has the personality that catches people’s eye. I just admire the strengths of certain players. There have been very good defenders in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and when you <b>[Van Dijk]</b> are talked about in that group of players, then it’s a good honour<br /><br />He’s one of the contenders. There are always other players as well, but he should certainly be considered. A defender is often overlooked, but defending is a very important part of football. Attacking always starts from the defenders. Virgil is important in that, he can direct from the back. I always said to my central defenders, ‘you’re always the playmakers of the team, you decide how the attack will start’. So if you have a defender like Virgil, who is quick and direct and has a good diagonal pass or a pass in behind the opposition, it’s very effective and important</p>
