  <p><b>[Dax McCarty, the New York Red Bulls captain, on his French bulldog, who has been building up quite a following on social media]</b> Koji keeps getting media requests, interview requests. It’s certainly different. I’m used to being the main man in the house, but now that Koji’s coming up in the world she’s probably about to pass me in <b>[social media]</b> followers. I get a little jealous at times, but then I just realise that she’s just a dog</p>

  <p><b>[Nashville SC expecting to push out of Inter Miami’s shadow ahead of first <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> season]</b> This is a new beast. Coming up to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is a new challenge, and I think for everyone involved in the club. It’s not just the players on the field, it’s the front office, the coaching staff , the technical staff and even for the fans. It’s a challenge for us to step our game up and make sure that when February 29 rolls around, we’re ready to step on the field and win. I think the narrative surrounding certain expansion teams is that’s not possible, but I don’t believe that for a second<br /><br />I have a goal for myself and this team in that we want to win a trophy. What that is and how it will come, I don’t know. I haven’t even stepped on the field with my new teammates yet. It’s still to be seen, the areas we need to improve, but I’m extremely optimistic<br /><br />There is a certain recipe that certain teams have followed to be successful and other teams have done it differently. The beauty of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is that there’s no one size fits all category for being successful in this league. No one market can emulate any other market, especially in Nashville. We can’t try to emulate LAFC. We can’t try to emulate Atlanta United. We don’t want to emulate Cincinnati. All these clubs, you can learn little things well and where they haven’t done things well<br /><br />It will be interesting to see the different paths that Nashville and Miami take because we will be compared, rightly or wrongly</p>
