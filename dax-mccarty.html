  <p><b>[Dax McCarty, the New York Red Bulls captain, on his French bulldog, who has been building up quite a following on social media]</b> Koji keeps getting media requests, interview requests. It’s certainly different. I’m used to being the main man in the house, but now that Koji’s coming up in the world she’s probably about to pass me in <b>[social media]</b> followers. I get a little jealous at times, but then I just realise that she’s just a dog</p>

  <p><b>[A 2-1 Chicago Fire victory that snapped the Red Bulls 11-match home unbeaten streak]</b> It’s a really important result. I, more so than most, know how hard is to win here when you’re on the opposing team. It’s a gutsy performance, a really gritty performance and basically it was one that we needed.</p>

  <p><b>[Fire captain Dax McCarty was truthful when evaluating the team’s performance]</b> We’re below average right now and the results speak to that. It’s not easy times right now, we’re just lacking a little bit of quality all over the field. That’s the brutal honest truth. You have to be honest with yourself. When you reflect on teams and on games, you have to be honest and say that we’ve been second-best most of the season.<br /><br /><b>[On Mo Adams]</b> He was unbelievable. I thought Mo, he showed no fear. That’s the one thing you can’t do when you step on the field and play your first pro game. You have to be confident and he was and I thought he did his job. He broke up plays. He won his tackles. He won his battles. Against the Red Bulls, half the battle is winning second balls and making sure that they have trouble playing through the middle. You’re not going to stop them every time, but for the most part I thought Mo and I had a good connection and we tried our best to stimy them and make them go out wide, and it made for a frustrating afternoon. Kaku is a big talent, they bought him for a lot of money, and I thought he didn’t have a big influence in the game and I thought that was down to Mo having a great game<br /><br />You could see that there was something there. We’re constantly working with him on his positioning. You want a guy like that to play to his instincts because he has good instincts defensively. It’s just working with a guy like that, giving him confidence, making sure he plays simple, and then does his job on the other side of the ball. He’s a pit bull defensively<br /><br />I think that our rookies are fantastic. They’ve been brilliant. They’ve tried to make plays, and tried to do the right things. We’re just young, we’re a young group and you’re never ever going to have a perfect scenario where you put young guys on the field and they’re going to click and do everything right away<br /><br />I think a lot was made of my comments last week talking about we’re below average right now. Where we are in the standings speak to that. People tend to take that stuff and construe something that isn’t there. If you look at the standings, we’re below average. That is a fact, you can’t argue that. You have to be honest about it and you have to improve, and we were lacking quality in the attacking half of the field and the defensive half, and you have to make plays in both boxes if you want to win. It’s not just the young guys, it was everybody. We were just lacking a little bit of quality. People want to make a big deal out of these comments and almost make it seem like I’m saying we dont have good players in the locker room - we have great players in the locker room. We’re just needing to have a little bit more quality to get good results, therefore we’ll get more results and move up the standings</p>

  <p><b>[Nashville SC expecting to push out of Inter Miami’s shadow ahead of first <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> season]</b> This is a new beast. Coming up to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is a new challenge, and I think for everyone involved in the club. It’s not just the players on the field, it’s the front office, the coaching staff , the technical staff and even for the fans. It’s a challenge for us to step our game up and make sure that when February 29 rolls around, we’re ready to step on the field and win. I think the narrative surrounding certain expansion teams is that’s not possible, but I don’t believe that for a second<br /><br />I have a goal for myself and this team in that we want to win a trophy. What that is and how it will come, I don’t know. I haven’t even stepped on the field with my new teammates yet. It’s still to be seen, the areas we need to improve, but I’m extremely optimistic<br /><br />There is a certain recipe that certain teams have followed to be successful and other teams have done it differently. The beauty of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is that there’s no one size fits all category for being successful in this league. No one market can emulate any other market, especially in Nashville. We can’t try to emulate LAFC. We can’t try to emulate Atlanta United. We don’t want to emulate Cincinnati. All these clubs, you can learn little things well and where they haven’t done things well<br /><br />It will be interesting to see the different paths that Nashville and Miami take because we will be compared, rightly or wrongly</p>
