  <p><b>[Dax McCarty, the New York Red Bulls captain, on his French bulldog, who has been building up quite a following on social media]</b> Koji keeps getting media requests, interview requests. It’s certainly different. I’m used to being the main man in the house, but now that Koji’s coming up in the world she’s probably about to pass me in <b>[social media]</b> followers. I get a little jealous at times, but then I just realise that she’s just a dog</p>

  <p><b>[Dax McCarty is focused on his U.S. national team return right now rather than his surprising trade to the Chicago Fire]</b> It’s unbelievable to be back with the national team. It’s all MLS guys, everyone I know, former teammates, current competitors, we’re all a close-knit community. It’s been a little while, so it’s just a great opportunity to show myself and see if there’s anyway I can help the team and bring my qualities to the team.<br /><br />I thanked them a lot for coming out and visiting with me, that was a really classy thing of those guys to do, and I thanked them in person, and it was a good conversation that we had. I’m still processing everything, trying to digest the kind of whirlwind it has been. The wedding was incredible, literally everything was perfect, then to be able to come into camp, and be able to play, that’s all I’m focused on, trying to do my best for the national team. I think after all the dust settles, and I have a little bit more time to reflect on my time at Red Bull I’ll probably be prepared to talk about it more</p>

  <p><b>[Bastian Schweinsteiger keeps impressing teammates as he helps lead Fire to victory]</b> The thing with Bastian that you notice is he makes everyone around him better. He makes the game easier for everyone because he’s got a soccer brain. Not many guys that you play with in MLS have a soccer brain at the highest level, at a world-class level. He just sees plays develop before they happen. It’s always fun to play with players like that.<br /><br />It’s easy to play with good players. It’s even easier to play with world-class players. For me, it’s always refreshing when you get a chance to play with guys who have not only played at the highest level, but they’ve won at the highest level. You look at a guy like Thierry <b>[Henry]</b>. He’s won the Champions League, the Premier League, the World Cup. There’s not much he hasn’t won and that’s for a reason. It’s because he’s one of the best players in the world.<br /><br />Bastian comes in, he hasn’t played in a year and a half, he steps into the team and immediately you see his quality. And again, that’s because he’s been one of the best players in the world over the last couple of years. You look at their pedigrees, and you look at their CVs and you find yourself scratching your head at how anyone could question whether this guy was going to come in and help our team be successful<br /><br />Playing with Thierry was a little bit different because he’s more of a striker. With Thierry, you knew that if you gave him the ball he was going to dribble and make the killer pass and make something happen with his speed, athleticism and technical ability. Now, it’s a little different playing with Bastian, because he’s a very similar type player as me in terms of he’s more of a deep-lying playmaker. He likes to get the ball off of the defenders and likes to make the game from a little bit deeper. For me it’s been a pleasure being able to play with him these past few games, and just kind of try to take little things from his game and see what he does really well and see how I can incorporate that into my game, but also see how I can feed off him and make him better<br /><br />He wasn’t just going to come on vacation, and the main reason <b>[I believed that]</b> is he’s German. Do you know many Germans? They’re machines. They don’t know know how to give less than 100 percent. They don’t know how to do things half-assed. When they commit to something, they do it all the way<br /><br />Now it’s important that we, as a team, can make him feel as comfortable as possible so that he plays his best soccer. I think we’ve seen glimpses, especially throughout 180 minutes that he’s played, that he’s a game-changer and he’s capable of making plays that not many guys on the field are capable of making</p>

  <p><b>[Dax McCarty thriving with Chicago Fire]</b> I’m settling in, and I think a lot of that has to do with being around the team more. Again, we had <b>[U.S. national team]</b> January camp so I came into preseason late. Obviously the shock of the trade, mentally I wasn’t quite right. Still trying to process everything, it took me a while. I think finding a place to live, getting to know the neighborhoods in Chicago, getting to know my teammates a little better off the field, these are all things that contribute to making sure that players are comfortable and ultimately play their best soccer<br /><br />That’s something that Pauno has talked about wanting to be able to do in the future, is be tactically flexible with how we play. With Juninho being suspended because of a red card we decided to play three in the back and I thought in the first half it worked well for us. Tactically we kind of figured out a good rhythm with the ball and without the ball. I thought we limited their chances, and obviously we got a good goal<br /><br />It was a gutsy performance. We had to withstand a little bit of possession and a little bit of pressure from Columbus, but at the end of the day you’re at home you want to give the fans three points, so it was important to win<br /><br />That was a big disappointment, that kind of felt like a loss even though we came back and drew the game at the end. I was really upset with how the flow of that game went. Montreal basically had nothing the whole game and we concede two really soft, really poorly defended goals. That’s where I think we learned from our mistakes. We wanted to tighten things up in the back against Columbus. For us, that’s going to be the foundation of what’s going to make us successful this year. If we can be good defensively, and our attackers know they have that foundation to have freedom to go forward and express themselves and create chances and score goals<br /><br />I definitely don’t have it circled on the calendar. One thing that I want to make sure that I do is I don’t want to make it a bigger deal than it is. In my mind, I know it’s going to be a big deal. It’s going to be an emotional occasion for me. The thing that I try to do is focus on the here and now and helping this team get results, get wins.<br /><br />I had a moment of weakness, and did think about it the other day, and the only thing that I thought was, ‘Man, it’s going to be really weird going to Red Bull Arena and walking into the visiting locker room’. I’ve only done that once since I’ve been in MLS. That was with FC Dallas, in the first game I played with FC Dallas at Red Bull Arena. Every game I’ve played since then I’ve walked into the home locker room.<br /><br />It’ll be a weird feeling. I still don’t want to think about it too much. I don’t want the moment or the occasion of me going back there to take away from our team, and to take away from the Chicago Fire trying to just get a result. When you try to make things about an individual, or one player, it’s easier to get distracted and play poorly. I’ll try to treat it like any other game.<br /><br />After the game is over, regardless of the result, win, lose or draw, I’m going to try and soak in the moment. Red Bull, and New York and the fans, my teammates, meant so much to me for the five and a half, six years that I was there so I’ll definitely enjoy it afterwards</p>

  <p><b>[A 2-1 Chicago Fire victory that snapped the Red Bulls 11-match home unbeaten streak]</b> It’s a really important result. I, more so than most, know how hard is to win here when you’re on the opposing team. It’s a gutsy performance, a really gritty performance and basically it was one that we needed.</p>

  <p><b>[Fire captain Dax McCarty was truthful when evaluating the team’s performance]</b> We’re below average right now and the results speak to that. It’s not easy times right now, we’re just lacking a little bit of quality all over the field. That’s the brutal honest truth. You have to be honest with yourself. When you reflect on teams and on games, you have to be honest and say that we’ve been second-best most of the season.<br /><br /><b>[On Mo Adams]</b> He was unbelievable. I thought Mo, he showed no fear. That’s the one thing you can’t do when you step on the field and play your first pro game. You have to be confident and he was and I thought he did his job. He broke up plays. He won his tackles. He won his battles. Against the Red Bulls, half the battle is winning second balls and making sure that they have trouble playing through the middle. You’re not going to stop them every time, but for the most part I thought Mo and I had a good connection and we tried our best to stimy them and make them go out wide, and it made for a frustrating afternoon. Kaku is a big talent, they bought him for a lot of money, and I thought he didn’t have a big influence in the game and I thought that was down to Mo having a great game<br /><br />You could see that there was something there. We’re constantly working with him on his positioning. You want a guy like that to play to his instincts because he has good instincts defensively. It’s just working with a guy like that, giving him confidence, making sure he plays simple, and then does his job on the other side of the ball. He’s a pit bull defensively<br /><br />I think that our rookies are fantastic. They’ve been brilliant. They’ve tried to make plays, and tried to do the right things. We’re just young, we’re a young group and you’re never ever going to have a perfect scenario where you put young guys on the field and they’re going to click and do everything right away<br /><br />I think a lot was made of my comments last week talking about we’re below average right now. Where we are in the standings speak to that. People tend to take that stuff and construe something that isn’t there. If you look at the standings, we’re below average. That is a fact, you can’t argue that. You have to be honest about it and you have to improve, and we were lacking quality in the attacking half of the field and the defensive half, and you have to make plays in both boxes if you want to win. It’s not just the young guys, it was everybody. We were just lacking a little bit of quality. People want to make a big deal out of these comments and almost make it seem like I’m saying we dont have good players in the locker room - we have great players in the locker room. We’re just needing to have a little bit more quality to get good results, therefore we’ll get more results and move up the standings</p>

  <p><b>[Nashville SC expecting to push out of Inter Miami’s shadow ahead of first <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> season]</b> This is a new beast. Coming up to <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is a new challenge, and I think for everyone involved in the club. It’s not just the players on the field, it’s the front office, the coaching staff , the technical staff and even for the fans. It’s a challenge for us to step our game up and make sure that when February 29 rolls around, we’re ready to step on the field and win. I think the narrative surrounding certain expansion teams is that’s not possible, but I don’t believe that for a second<br /><br />I have a goal for myself and this team in that we want to win a trophy. What that is and how it will come, I don’t know. I haven’t even stepped on the field with my new teammates yet. It’s still to be seen, the areas we need to improve, but I’m extremely optimistic<br /><br />There is a certain recipe that certain teams have followed to be successful and other teams have done it differently. The beauty of <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> is that there’s no one size fits all category for being successful in this league. No one market can emulate any other market, especially in Nashville. We can’t try to emulate LAFC. We can’t try to emulate Atlanta United. We don’t want to emulate Cincinnati. All these clubs, you can learn little things well and where they haven’t done things well<br /><br />It will be interesting to see the different paths that Nashville and Miami take because we will be compared, rightly or wrongly</p>
