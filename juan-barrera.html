  <p><b>[Nicaragua captain Juan Barrera hopes Gold Cup can launch other teammates to clubs abroad]</b> I have a great memory of this game against Haiti. The stadium was full, a lot of people didn’t believe we were going to be able to come back. Thanks to God we were able to achieve our goal of making the Gold Cup. Now in the Gold Cup it hasn’t been as good as we hoped. We’ve always wanted to get points but sometimes it isn’t there for you. We’re a young national team, but we can’t hang our head.<br /><br />Personally, I think it’s really important that us Nicaraguans show the beauty there is in Nicaraguan football, playing in other countries. I think we can show it in the national team as well. When the national team does things well, a lot of people take a look at what’s happening. Nicaragua is a country where people want to know what’s happening. From there, personally, I want to continue playing outside the country. I think this is really important not just for me but for a lot of my teammates in this Gold Cup might be able to be seen by other countries<br /><br />I think Nicaragua is going to keep getting better little by little, but the truth is there’s a lot of difficulties between infrastructure, support, we might not have this bonus for the national team in terms of structure and administration. But there’s talent!<br /><br />There’s talent in Nicaragua and I think players are going to start leaving the country and show that Nicaragua now plays football, now can compete at a high level and we have hope in the future generations that already are starting<br /><br />The game against the United States is going to be a great game. We’ve never faced the United States. Right now we’re keeping a positive mentality and we’re going to go out and play like we do in every game, and play until the end</p>

  <p><b>[Nicaragua captain Juan Barrera claimed on Twitter he did not vote although his name is listed on <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>’s official document, which says he chose <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a>, <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> as his top three]</b> We have checked the voting documents submitted by the Nicaraguan FA and all documents are signed and confirmed with the official stamp of the Nicaraguan FA. Having compared with the vote sheets submitted by the federation and the ones we have published on <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>.com… we confirm that we have the right votes signed by the player. We are asking the Nicaraguan Football Federations to inquire on this matter</p>
