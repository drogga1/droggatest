  <p><b>[Amal Clooney to represent ‘hooded men’ in torture legal case]</b> It is very significant that we have people with the background and experience of Amal Clooney and the other barristers who are involved making this application<br /><br />The case of the ‘hooded men’ is one of the most significant judgements in human rights history. We think Amal’s track record speaks for itself, as do all of the counsels’ CVs in this case. It is an extremely rare application, an interstate case before the European Court.

  <p><b>[Ibrahim Halawa’s lawyers barred from hearing in Egypt]</b> Not allowing a lawyer to access his client’s hearing is gravely concerning and belies any suggestion that fair trial requirements are being met. Our client, <a href="ibrahim-halawa.html">Ibrahim Halawa</a>, has now been held for almost two years without trial. We are concerned that there has been yet another delay, this time of a further two months</p>
