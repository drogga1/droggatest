  <p><b>[Khalifa Stadium ready five years before kick-off]</b> This is a venue which holds a very special place in Qatar’s sporting history, and over the years we have seen some of the greatest football players from Qatar and the region make their mark here as well as world stars. This renovated stadium features many of the innovative elements, such as the new cooling technology, which we promised during our bid. We are excited to see the players take to the pitch for the game, and to welcome fans to the renovated stadium this Friday for an exciting match-day experience.</p>

  <p><b>[Hassan Al Thawadi, the secretary general for the committee in charge of the 2022 World Cup, has denied reports that Neymar is in line to be an ambassador for the showpiece in Qatar]</b> Let me tell you that PSG and Qatar’s World Cup are two independent projects. We are not interlinked. With regards to Neymar being the brand ambassador, he is a big star and if he continues in this way he will be one of the biggest stars. However, currently there are no plans.<br /><br />Xavi is one of our ambassadors. We are in discussions with former and current players. However, it is important to point out that we are not just after the stars but for role models who represent the values we believe in. Xavi is the ambassador for Generation Amazing which is a football for development programme in remote areas. Apart from him being the greatest midfielder ever, he understands the power of football. Neymar is not part of the plan for now in future if he will be, that’s a discussion for the future</p>

  <p><b>[Plans revealed for incredible ground-breaking 2022 World Cup stadium in Qatar]</b> Innovation has always been central to our plans for delivering a historic FIFA World Cup that leaves a legacy for Qatar and the world, and there is no better example of this than the design of Ras Abu Aboud Stadium.<br /><br />This venue offers the perfect legacy, capable of being reassembled in a new location in its entirety or built into numerous small sports and cultural venues. All of this in a stadium that delivers the atmosphere fans expect at a World Cup and which we will build in a more sustainable way than ever before.</p>
