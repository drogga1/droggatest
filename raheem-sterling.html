So to myself I said: ‘I need to play well for him because he’s never been at a football match. He’s never seen me on a football pitch’. So I wanted to win that game and we never won in the end but it was an alright performance from me. I was just so determined to do well</p>

This is one of the best clubs in the world and I’m here for the long haul. But you just don’t know what happens in the future. I’m still young and, like I say, I am loving every minute. Ever since I was a kid, 100 per cent it’s always been a dream of mine to play abroad somewhere. It would be nice one day to finish training and go home and sit in your garden and eat some dinner.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether the Bundesliga could be an option]</b> Not really – the language barrier. It sounds very difficult. Spanish sounds like… ‘Hola! Raheem!’ I feel that one I can definitely catch on. I hear Leroy Sane and Ilkay Gundogan talking and sometimes I think they’re having me on. I’m like, ‘You lot are not speaking to each other’. That’s not a language I could do</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling admits to having experienced a career low at Manchester City. He concedes that he found the going tough]</b> Probably my first season at City, purely because I came in excited for my move here and then it went from ‘This kid is going to be the next whatever’ and before making a mark I was written off. I was the golden boy six, seven, eight months before that, a big-money move, and it’s kind of switched without even hitting a ball. Before I’ve even done anything it’s just ‘He’s not good enough’. I was like, what’s going on?<br /><br /><b>[Sterling has learned from that experience, saying when asked if the criticism had got to him]</b> At first it did because I was 19, it was my first time as a professional football player and it’s a learning curve. Now you can say or do what you want and I wouldn’t take it in<br /><br /><b>[The England star said of his club boss Pep Guardiola]</b> He’s demanding, but it’s good. It makes you want to do better and – I don’t know how to explain this – makes you want to prove to him and show him every time you go on the field you’re playing for your position in his team, because of the numbers we have and the quality we have as well<br /><br /><b>[Sterling is also benefitting from having so-called leaders around him at Man City]</b> On the pitch, we’re not a shouting team, like, ‘Come on, guys’. The team is super relaxed in the dressing room, so chilled. There’s not a lot of shouting. Vinny, of course, the skipper, Fernandinho. But not everyone in the dressing room is shouting. We’re more chilled and when we get out on the pitch we do the talking</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling is hoping that Pep Guardiola will continue to pick him at Manchester City]</b> The biggest difference is that every season, the competition gets tougher, the level gets raised and that’s one of the best things here – that it’s always a high tempo. You’re always learning and competing on all fronts with other players for your position. The manager sets a high standard and it’s down to us as players to match that and try and put out our best. Hopefully the manager will put me on the pitch! I’ll try to get some minutes. It’s an important time for us – we have to get ready and get fit for the new season. That’s the most important thing – to try to get my fitness up and hopefully, I’ll score some goals</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling says he was happy to see former club Liverpool win the Champions League last season, but maintains winning the Premier League again is his main priority this season]</b> I was really happy for Liverpool, happy for some of the players I know to lift the Champions League. What we’ve done last season - every day, week in, week out - was exceptional. The Champions League is massive for us as a club but our most important thing is winning the Premier League. That’s our main objective going into this season. The Premier League is your bread and butter. The Champions League is the nicer-looking one, the most prestigious as people say, but every weekend you put in a shift. You’re going to tough places … you’re off to Crystal Palace, Burnley, it’s tough, you know. You put so much time into it. That’s why we cherish it. It’ll be harder than last season. To do this three times in a row is a massive challenge for us. Liverpool, all these big clubs, will try to take titles off us. But there isn’t any player here who thinks they’re at their best. There are no egos in our changing room, no player who thinks he’s Pele or Maradona<br /><br /><b>[That was a point underlined after last season’s FA Cup final. City beat Watford 6-0 with Sterling scoring twice]</b> I don’t know how to explain it … you see clips of him talking to you but it’s not like that every day! It’s one incident where he’s speaking to me. He talks to us as a group. You learn. If you don’t learn, you don’t play. It’s not like he’s sat there in a room with a pen and paper writing things down on what I should do. People will be judging me from now on, so every season I have to get better. If you don’t want to improve yourself then there is nothing Pep can do to help. He sets such high standards and it rubs off. That has improved me the most: the standards he sets. It makes sure I don’t fall from mine</p>

I talk how I talk. I’d like people to accept me for who I am and they do now. I’m really grateful. If there is anything that I feel could put Jadon in a bad light, I make sure I pull him up on it. He’s a good kid. He’s doing a lot more off the field than I was at that age in terms of his preparation work. I’m quite close with <b>[teenage midfielder]</b> Ian Poveda at City. It’s a similar story: from London, came up north. He’s always sat next to me on the coach. He’s a bit annoying at times, I tell him that every day! He’s my little friend, I try to give him advice. I let him have a feel for things himself but if I do see something I’ll go over</p>

The manager and us as players will make the right choice. We’ve got a lot of good candidates here. David Silva has been here for God knows how long – he’s been in the country longer than I have! There is Kevin, Dinho, we have a lot of players who can fill it<br /><br /><b>[The England winger does, however, acknowledge his responsibilities as a senior member of the Man City squad]</b> People do ask me a lot of questions for an opinion. I’m developing and maturing and people around the club can see that. I do have quite a say in the changing room and they do ask my opinion</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea ban supporter for life over racial abuse allegations after Raheem Sterling incident]</b> The club delayed reaching its decision in these cases in order to ensure that it did not prejudice the related police investigation. The Crown Prosecution Service has, however, recently announced that it has elected not to initiate any criminal prosecutions. This allowed the club to conduct its own investigation, which included seeking representations from the individuals concerned, reviewing video evidence, interviewing potential witnesses and obtaining expert opinions from two lip reading professionals. All individuals sanctioned as a result of our investigation were then offered the right to appeal and, where applicable, those appeals have been heard<br /><br />We understand that this incident has been the subject of discussion amongst supporters, and the club appreciates that emotions can run high during matches. However, in this case the behaviour of all six individuals crossed the line of what is acceptable. Furthermore, in the case of the supporter who was found by the club to have used racially abusive language, there is no place for this behaviour at Stamford Bridge and a permanent exclusion was the appropriate sanction. Given the particular circumstances of this case, the club did not consider that attendance at an education course in return for a reduced sanction would have been appropriate</p>

With the players we’ve got here - Gabriel Jesus, Sergio Aguero, Riyad Mahrez - there’s competition in training every day. It’s just a joy to put the ball in the back of the net and everyone here is trying to do that to help the team. It was quite difficult in the first half to get the cobwebs off. The breathing was heavy so some of the touches were sloppy, but once the team got into a rhythm you can find the passes easier and once that second goal went in things went a lot smoother and a lot more chances came</p>

Those are the ones that are disappointing and feel they can get away with stuff like this. We are in 2019 and we’re still talking about this. I can’t say I have the answer to stop it but as a society we need to nail down on this. The people doing it need to wake up and understand it’s a new era and discrimination is not something anybody should face. We need to grow up as a society and realise we’re only out here doing our jobs. We are human beings and we have feelings. It’s a touchy subject but I can’t tell you I’ve got the exact answer. But as a society we need to do better and appreciate each other more</p>

It’s a situation between two friends, Bernardo and Mendy. I can see exactly the point where some people can get touchy-feely on it, but I feel in that situation, Bernardo made a joke to his friend, you know? He’s not referred to his skin colour, he’s not referred to his lips, you know, in both pictures … they’ve both got small heads! The most important thing for me, he didn’t refer to colour. We all know, everyone can see that Mendy is a black lad. We’ve got to be proud to be black as well, if someone refers to our skin colour with an image, you can’t really be upset about it.

They’re two really good friends and it’s really sad to see. I can understand where the criticism has come, but I don’t feel it’s in any way intentional of trying to be racist. It’s not because it’s my team-mates, it’s just the way I view it. I don’t feel there’s any racism in it. But I can exactly see the point where people are coming from and Bernardo’s deeply sorry about it. He’s not in the wrong for me, but at the same time, I can see why people think it’s wrong.<br /><br />We’ve just got to be smarter on social media because we understand in this day and age, anything you say or do can quickly be judged and it’s just a really sad situation. The sooner the better that <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> can understand that this was in no way intentional discrimination. There’s not one moment that he uses a negative term to speak about his skin colour. He tried to make a joke, it wasn’t the best one but we’ve got to move on and understand it wasn’t intentional</p>

I feel like that’s what’s lacking here, it’s not just taking the knee, it is about giving people the chance they deserve. There’s something like 500 players in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and a third of them are black and we have no representation of us in the hierarchy, no representation of us in the coaching staffs. There’s not a lot of faces that we can relate to and have conversations with. When there’s someone from a black background I can go to in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> with a problem I have within the club, that will be when I know change is happening and not just in my field, also in Parliament. Once we do see those numbers shifting, that’s when I’ll be happy and the people will be happy<br /><br /><b>[Sterling, meanwhile, says its important for these conversations to continue going forward, even after the worldwide protests die down]</b> The protest is a great starting point, to make your voice be heard. But just protesting alone is not going to make a change in this country. It’s how we move on from here. It’s about highlighting things, the society that needs changing, and then acting upon it. We’ve done a lot of talking, and it’s time now to act</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling on Racism]</b> I know this might sound a little bit cheesy but the only disease right now is the racism that we are fighting. This is the most important thing at this moment in time because this is something that is happening for years and years. Just like the pandemic, we want to find a solution to stop it. At the same time, this is what all these protesters are doing. They are trying to find a solution and a way to stop the injustice they are seeing, and they are fighting for their cause. As long as they are doing it peacefully and safely and not hurting anybody and not breaking into any stores, they continue to protest in this peaceful way.</p>

  <p><b>[Sterling’s shooting boots return in time to finally bury Reds hoodoo]</b> It was weird at first, to see yourself in a different shirt and, against a club that’s done so much for you. It’s also emotional. But now I have matured past that and feel I have had some good games against them. Now I’ve got past that stage. It’s gone. It was a little thing but I’m now fully focused and fully ready</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling targeting FA Cup and Champions League glory with Manchester City]</b> It is difficult seeing <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> take the title from us, but they have been brilliant all year. They have been fantastic and deserved to win the league. <b>[The <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> game]</b> was just another game, but it was a chance to finish high.

Hopefully we can finish with an FA Cup final and a Champions League final.
