So to myself I said: ‘I need to play well for him because he’s never been at a football match. He’s never seen me on a football pitch’. So I wanted to win that game and we never won in the end but it was an alright performance from me. I was just so determined to do well</p>

  <p><b>[A look at the real Raheem Sterling]</b> If you’re doing something wrong - the times I’ve been caught doing balloons (filled with nitrous oxide), whatever, yeah, no problem. I accept if you’re a silly boy you get dealt with. But there are these times when you’ve been thinking about football, been at home, just trying to stay out of everyone’s way, and you’re still getting stuff. I see it as I can’t win<br /><br /><b>[That the father-of-two scored twice in a 4-1 victory over Tottenham just hours after the incident took place did not surprise another employee of Liverpool’s Academy]</b> At times when he was here, they’d be situations at home in London he’d need to deal with. We’d drive there, sort it out, drive back and I’d think to myself: ‘Just how is he going to perform?’. There were cases where we’d only get back to Liverpool at 2am and he’d have a game in the afternoon. But he was bulletproof, he would exceed expectations. All his issues disappeared once he entered the pitch</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling says he has inherited his distinctive running style from his mother]</b> My mum went to my little brother’s sports day and she sent me a clip of her running and I thought, ‘Ok, that’s where I get it from!’. I’d never seen her run before. It’s my mum. Don’t laugh but yeah. Before she had my sister she was in the Jamaica athletics team when she was young. I don’t think my running style is something to pass on though, I’ll take all the laughter myself.<br /><br />He said, ‘You need to catch up with me’. I said, ‘I can’t, you’re Sergio Aguero. He’s a player I look up to in crucial moments of games and he does what I want to be doing, and I try to keep on doing it. I’ve missed so many chances, I try to improve on it every day. I want to get better and help win crucial matches. If I miss a chance, don’t speak to me. I always try to improve. I’m a bit too harsh on myself, that’s how I am and that’s how I always will be - in order to get better<br /><br />If we keep playing like we are we’ve got a great chance, but at the moment we are just looking to the next game and that’s Burnley. We focus on that and then the next game, we are going out to win every game and if that wins the quadruple then that’s what it does</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling says Manchester City players are being butchered]</b> I find it a bit unfair at times. I feel that we haven’t been protected enough in certain situations. I think some of the challenges have been awful. It’s not what I expect to see in a top flight football match - especially when teams are losing and just go out to kick players. I don’t think that’s right. I do think we need to cut down on that because we’ve got a World Cup at the end of the year and majority of the players in the top flight and in our team will be playing in it and it would be sad to see someone miss the tournament due to a silly tackle and someone get away with it. These tackles can happen - but it can’t be every game we’re getting two players coming in with injuries. There are going to be challenges that are badly timed and probably not all of them are intentional but at the same time if it’s a dangerous tackle, it’s a dangerous tackle and I think the referees and officials need to cut these tackles out because as you can see some of the players are getting butchered, butchered out there and it’s sad to see. But I just feel we need to try and cut this out of the game.<br /><br />Especially if it’s a high tackle, when the studs are up. some of the tackles in the last few games should have been straight reds, maybe the refs didn’t see it at the time but it can’t continue for the rest of the season<br /><br /><b>[on Pep Guardiola]</b> He’s completely helping with the basics, helping me to become more ruthless. That’s what I’m trying to do. He and his coaching staff help with that. It’s been a great environment for me to continue learning and that’s the most important thing that I’ve got, that environment and the people around that are helping with my education in football<br /><br />Probably being in the box much more often, following things in and always trying to be around the box to try and sniff out a goal. <b>[I would describe myself]</b> not as a complete player, <b>[but as]</b> a player that’s learning, a player that’s loving his football at the moment. As I said it’s the environment that I’m in. I’m just loving it and hopefully that can keep happening. I’ve got plenty of room to grow. There’s fine things, little details that I need to sharpen up on. It’s something that I’m learning every day, that I’m trying to improve on and I’ll definitely get there<br /><br /><b>[Sterling was called over to Guardiola’s technical area after missing a presentable chance against West Brom in midweek, but instead of earning a rebuke he was embraced and given a kiss on the cheek]</b> It was a bit strange! I didn’t think he was going to kiss me, I thought he was going to give me some advice so when he kissed me I was thinking a bit; ‘oh ok’. I knew I was going to get a bit of banter from the boys after as well. But it was alright</p>

  <p><b>[On Pep Guardiola’s tactic]</b> I would be controlling it with the outside of my foot, slowing the ball down. He’s telling you to get to the left-back quicker. He brings you back to what you used to do with the Under-8s, open your body up, gets the rhythm going again. It’s simple stuff, stuff I already know. When you’re playing a game, you probably don’t pick up on it.</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling is aware of his finishing faults at Manchester City]</b> Forget what everybody says, I know what I want to do and what I need to improve on. Nobody needs to tell me. Of course, people see it and my problem is that when I have too much time to think that’s when I mess up a lot. If it’s more instinctive with less time to think I am much better. If it’s through on goal and I have too much time to think I try to over-complicate things. That’s when I do mess up at times. I have full confidence in myself and believe I will get it right in a matter of time. I have the World Cup <b>[with England]</b> this summer and then back to work again in pre-season and then continue trying to get better. It’s nice to have a little fun when your team is winning but at the end of the day I am trying to be more efficient and clinical.<br /><br />Coming into this pre-season, the energy and atmosphere and belief was really good. The belief when we were in the dressing room and when we went out onto pitches felt like we were in control. Last season I had it where I thought ‘it might not be our day today’ but there has not been a game this season I thought we were going to lose. Even the Champions League game against Liverpool at 3-0 down in the second leg I thought we were going to win. The whole year it has been like that. I always have that belief in the team that we were going to win. We have controlled games and our thing last year was that when we were doing well the counter-attack was always on, but this year we have solved it so we are a bit safer and that gave me reassurances that if we attack we can defend and stop them scoring</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling considers Colombia’s antics during a heated World Cup last-16 encounter to have been silly]</b> I just remember running in and someone stepped in front of me. There were a couple of times when I went over for a drinks break and he kept saying something. Obviously I don’t speak Spanish so I didn’t understand but then there was half-time too. I just kind of looked back at him, but we knew their game plan and exactly what they were trying to do. We knew what would get thrown at us and that was kind of silly from him. We just keep going, black that out and focus on the football. They’re a physical team. They were trying to do everything they could to get into our heads but we kept cool heads and that’s the most important thing. It’s up to the ref to clamp down it and we can’t really get involved in it.<br /><br /><b>[Sterling added on that incident, which came about as the South Americans protested the award of a spot kick for holding at a corner]</b> I didn’t see that, I just saw them trying to get into his ears. For <b>[Kane’s]</b> penalty we stuck together and we were trying to get the players away from each other. It’s credit to him - he works on this stuff in training every single day. Repetition. He keeps a cool head and I had no doubt even in the back of my mind that he wouldn’t put it away. Before the tournament <b>[Gareth Southgate]</b> has given us everything that could be thrown at us - every single possibility from going behind to the opposition trying to get you yellow or red cards. We knew we had to keep our heads</p>

  <p><b>[Sterling backs himself to end England goal drought sooner rather than later]</b> The main thing now is to keep trying to be a goal threat. When I was a bit younger, I wasn’t too interested in scoring goals. I was all about looking nice or trying to look nice and show people I’ve got a lot of ability. But no-one remembers the nice stuff you do on the pitch, it’s about the effectiveness and what you do for the team. I understand that now and I need to keep that going, especially because I need to get these goals. I think I’m probably more driven now. I’m much more confident when I’m in and around the penalty area, so I feel the goals will come for England as they have been doing at City.<br /><br /><b>[Addressing Kane’s luckless run]</b> It’s one of those where you always wait for that moment and then the chances will come. You have to keep your positivity and you just have to keep being persistent. The goals will come, I’m sure of that<br /><br /><b>[On Jaden Sancho]</b> He is a good talent and someone I’ve thought highly of since the first time I saw him, when he was training with us in pre-season. I thought highly of him, his work ethic and what he does with the ball. To go abroad so young shows a lot about the person. He could have taken the easy route and stayed at City, but he saw himself developing better. He’s knuckled down in Germany and, when you’re that age, it’s probably something you need. I’m really happy for him now he’s here with us <b>[England]</b>. Hopefully he can be for a long while</p>

You can get complacent at home but started well and carried on throughout the game. These are the games we need to capitalise on. The top teams drop points, we need to win. Big week this week. We go again in the Champions League. I thought it was a great team performance. Not just with the ball. We were brilliant at times today.<br /><br />Leroy Sane is always a man who looks up for me. He always has his eyes open. I was on a hat-trick but I am happy to set one up for him. I am grateful for the position I am in, learning and trying to get better. It is great times at the moment.

  <p><b>[Manchester City star Raheem Sterling says he loves to prove people wrong]</b> I grew up saying to myself, ‘I’d love to buy her <b>[my mum]</b> a house, so she could stop working, so she doesn’t have to stress about anything.’ When I tried to stop her from working, she stopped for a year but wasn’t having it. She couldn’t sit down. She got back into nursing. So I don’t see anything wrong with buying my mother a house.<br /><br />The story I could not get my head around was the breakfast one. I went for breakfast with my missus, and it said I’d gone for breakfast ‘despite not winning the PFA young player of the year’ <b>[award last April]</b>. What are you trying to get at here? It was just trying to be negative. I’d just gone for breakfast<br /><br />Honestly, I’m not even bantering, I don’t try to think about that side any more, negative or positive. I am more trying to be the best I can be, be happy, with myself and my family. A lot of young kids reach out to me, saying, ‘You’re an inspiration.’ They always tell me to keep positive and don’t look at what negatives are being said about me, and it’s good. I try to give them positives and show them no matter what someone says, what someone believes, to keep trying. I was told I wasn’t good enough to play for City, that I was a waste of money. Before I came to City I was meant to be one of the best young players in the world; two months there and I was the worst thing going. What happened there? The media perception changes - ‘He can’t do this, he can’t do that.’ I just tried to build myself up and be confident in myself and try to prove people wrong. That’s a big part of me, trying to prove people wrong. I thrive off that. If someone says I can’t, I say, ‘I can.’ I keep trying to do better</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling has revealed his admiration for Paris Saint-Germain and in particular Neymar]</b> I like watching Paris Saint-Germain. What I really like about Neymar is every time he loses the ball, or tries something, he goes again. He doesn’t get disheartened. He has that winner’s mentality. Watching Neymar against Liverpool <b>[in midweek]</b>, you’ve got the ball at the edge of his box, and he’s straight at you, trying to win the ball. He does do a lot of tricks but he does his tricks at the right time, for instance at the end of the game, the flick over the head, the rainbow <b>[against Xherdan Shaqiri]</b>.<br /><br />Signing was a no-brainer. The development of the last couple of years and with the manager being there again for numerous years and the players we have got, I will keep developing and keep getting better. Once upon a time, every time I got the ball I wanted to come inside, chop, turn and go at people, but it is knowing when to turn, when to do these things, and that’s why the manager is so good, he helps with my decision-making. He keeps telling us that, if we want to be the best team, the best players, we have to perform every game, not just in the league, but when the EFL Cup comes you have to perform in that, when the Champions League comes you have to perform in that, the FA Cup, perform, compete</p>

I just want to say I am not normally the person to talk a lot but when I think I need my point to be heard I will speak up. Regarding what was said at the Chelsea game, as you can see by my reaction, I just had to laugh because I don’t expect no better. For example you have two young players starting out their careers both playing for the same team. Both have done the right thing, which is buy a new house for their mothers who have put in a lot of time and love into helping them get where they are.<br /><br />But look how the newspapers get their message across for the young black player then for the young white player. I think this is unacceptable. Both are innocent, have not done a thing wrong but just by the way it is worded the young black kid is looked at in a bad light which helps fuel racism and aggressive behaviour. So for all the newspapers that don’t understand why people are racist in this day and age all I have to say is have a second thought about fair publicity and give all players an equal chance</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling has spoken out on the racist abuse he received in Manchester City’s clash with Chelsea in December]</b> The way they were looking at me, I had to see where all this anger was coming from. I was listening in to hear what they were saying. Nah, that can’t be what I heard.<br /><br />From the very start of my career, there has been a perception of a flashy kid from London: loves cars, loves the flashy lifestyle. I’m not saying I’m a saint or anything, but that is the complete opposite of who I am. These people do not know me. They will define me by what they read about me; that is how they will treat me. When people are making the public believe you are a character you aren’t, that is hurtful, and it is degrading<br /><br />These were cars that I had had between the ages of 17 and 23. But they made it that Raheem has one for Monday, one for Tuesday, and so on. All these cars are gone, sold. But what do you do when you sell a car? You buy a new one. But they have a picture of me in each car, so the story is that I drive a car each day. People see that and think that’s what he’s up to - buying cars, living the best life<br /><br />There is a lot more going on in this world than me going to Greggs. What is the need for it? What is the need for this story? Sometimes you ask what the motive is<br /><br />It is not just me. Whenever you see a report on a black player or a black entertainer it has to end up with money, or bling, or cars, or something flashy. With a successful white person, it is nice, short, sweet, what a lovable person. Name me one white player who is thought of as ‘blingy’. If he is showing you his car, showing he is on top of the world, if that is what he puts out, then call him flashy. But I’m not showing you that, so why are you calling me that? It is a stereotype of black people: chains and jewelry, bling and money. These are words that are associated with black people. If I was showing 10 cars on my driveway, if I was on Instagram biting my gold chain, or with two Rolexes on, you can call me flashy. But you can’t label me as that if I am not portraying that</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling says he knew Jadon Sancho was destined for the top]</b> First day I’d seen him training with us, I was really happy to see such a talent. I always knew he’d become the player he has, for sure. From minute one. I was playing right back against him one day in pre-season training and he spun me back and I nearly did my back in. He’s a great talent<br /><br />When he first mentioned to me he was thinking about going abroad, even though he was a City player, I was happy to hear that from him. To see that confidence, it reminded me of myself when I went to Liverpool. To have a couple of London teams and Liverpool to go to, I chose the further option, to have the time out away from my friends. So, when he said that to me about going, I knew he had a massive chance to go on to do big things. I wouldn’t say it’s about being scared or frightened in taking a risk, but being mainly content, mainly at ease, and he’s gone on and taken a step forward. I’m just really happy to see him doing so well. He’s doing massive things and I hope he stays level headed and keeps working and keeps learning<br /><br />I want to be like him. He’s a great talent and I’m just really happy for him. Off the field he is a top lad, and that’s the one thing I try to correct him on, off the field, because he’s a great person, just try to help him with advice. But on the field, be as arrogant as you want. On the field you don’t need to be level headed. For me, he just needs to keep doing what he’s doing and think the best of his ability because that ability can take him all the way to the top</p>

Obviously getting a move to City was a great opportunity for me and a great stepping stone, but I thought to give myself the best chance to progress and do well was to try to stay out of people’s TV’s and headlines. I tried to be seen to focus on football and make it the right headlines. It’s a difficult one because people formed an opinion on me and I can’t do anything to change that.

It’s a real sad situation we are talking about after a great win. I don’t think it was just one or two people that heard it, it was the whole bench. There should be a real punishment for this, not just the two or three people who were doing it - it needs to be a collective thing. This place holds 15,000. The punishment should be, whatever nation it is, if your fans are chanting racist abuse then it should be the whole stadium so no-one can come and watch. When the ban is lifted, the fans will think twice. They all love football, they all want to come and watch their nation so it will make them think twice before doing something silly like that.</p>

  <p><b>[Sterling calls for nine-point deductions for clubs whose fans are guilty of racism]</b> I would call for an automatic nine-point deduction for racist abuse. It sounds harsh, but which fan will risk racist behaviour if it might relegate their team or ruin their title bid. Small fines do no damage to clubs and countries, but one group of people who do have the money to make them take notice are sponsors. The next time that a club or governing body fails to act appropriately against racism, I would love to see that company pull its money out and make a moral stand. I don’t know how long it will take for things to change but we have to start now. I don’t want the next generation of black players to have to put up this evil.<br /><br />When I was a boy growing up in London, going to school and playing football, I didn’t know what racist abuse was because I never suffered any. So it seems crazy that, in 2019, I feel the need to write a piece in a newspaper calling for radical changes to the game that I love. But I do because the racism problem of football is so bad, runs so deep and is nowhere near being sorted. You will all have read about the various high-profile racist incidents in recent months: the abuse I received playing for Manchester City away to Chelsea; the booing that the black England players were subjected to in Montenegro; the nastiness that Moise Kean of Juventus endured in Italy and the endless insults thrown at players on social media. But that is sadly just the tip of the iceberg. Up and down the game, across the world, black and Asian players, fans and coaches are subjected to racism. Every day, from park football to the Champions League. In my opinion, the people who run the game are doing nowhere near enough to solve the problem. And that’s not good enough</p>

It’s not going to change anything. It needs to be at first within football - because that’s where I am and I can’t say about in everyday walks of life - to help people in our environment. And for people that have been suffering these things to have something that they know when they go on the football field that no one will dare to even chat one word at them.

In <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> we need to win all our games and finish on a high in <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and the Champions League. Hopefully we can finish with an FA Cup final and a Champions League final. We are a team that missed out on <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and we have got to go on and try to do our best as we can in all competitions and that is <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup and the Champions League.</p>

  <p><b>[Raheem Sterling believes his goals will only mean something if they help <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> to more silverware]</b> The most important thing to me is the value of these goals, that they add to the team. At the end of the day, we’re trying to win <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> Cup final and win the Champions League as well, otherwise these goals don’t really mean anything</p>
