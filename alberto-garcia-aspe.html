  <p><b>[Mexico’s path to the ‘quinto partido’ will draw attention at Friday’s World Cup draw]</b> First we have to talk about the group phase and after that see if Mexico can keep advancing to the final stages. But Mexico can advance to the fifth game. Hopefully this national team can move on even past that, but obviously we’ll have to see beyond even the group that they’re in, which team they could meet in the next round. That’s also really important: Which team you could face when you’re advancing to the next round.</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico’s path to the ‘quinto partido’ will draw attention at Friday’s World Cup draw]</b> I don’t think the players talk about the ‘quinto partido’. I think the ‘quinto partido’ is much more something the fans and the press <b>[chat about]</b>. The press is a big part of why we talk about this fifth game. Obviously the players do have it in mind. In 1994 we were right there and we’ve been very close to advancing there in other World Cups<br /><br />I think as a player, you concentrate more on the games that are coming, on moving on, but obviously you have the expectation of getting to this ‘quinto partido’ - not only the ‘quinto partido’​ but advancing ideally to the seventh game, right? That would be the final. I don’t think the players are thinking about the fifth game. They’re thinking about playing at the World Cup, defending the colors, doing their job and in the course of that you get to the ‘quinto partido</p>

  <p><b>[Mexico can manage World Cup Group F, but road to quarterfinals is brutal]</b> For me, the favorites today to win the World Cup are Brazil, Germany, Spain, and maybe England could be there as they’ve done things well lately, but I’d choose those first three first. So if you’re up against any of those, obviously you have to stay calm. I think for Mexico, sometimes it’s better to be in a more complicated group and then have an easier ‘cruce’ to be able to get to the next stage.</p>
