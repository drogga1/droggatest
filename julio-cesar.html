  <p><b>[Julio Cesar has hailed Neymar as the best player in the world]</b> For me, Neymar is the best player in the world today. Messi? I said the world; Messi is from another planet! But I think this is Neymar’s moment now. The whole world is following him and seeing how he does, even people who don’t follow football are interested in Neymar. They admire him, not only for what he does on the pitch but for how he carries himself off it. I’ve got a lot of respect for Neymar and I’ve had the pleasure of playing with him, of winning with him and, like a friend, I wish him all the best to win the Ballon d’Or.<br /><br /><b>[On Ederson]</b> He’s a goalkeeper who is improving all the time. He’s ready to play in the World Cup and he’s got all the ingredients to be the best goalkeeper in the world. He’s already a complete goalkeeper who is really strong coming off his line. People enjoy watching him. I like Jan Oblak at Atletico Madrid; he’s been excellent working with a team which does not concede many goals. Ederson, who I’ve mentioned, is formidable. And I have to mention <b>[Gianluigi]</b> Buffon, who is still playing at the highest level at his age, playing in two Champions League finals in three seasons. He’s older than me! And finally I must mention Manuel Neuer, another one of the best who takes my attention</p>

  <p><b>[Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho was more than a father to Julio Cesar during his time at Inter]</b> Mourinho was more than a father to me when I was at Inter. In only two years, Mourinho and his staff helped win everything. Inter contracted Mourinho to win the Champions League. Inter had success in that period winning Serie A, but the Champions League was different. The club had not won it for 42 years. Within two years, Mourinho had won it. It was a heroic win. That Inter team and Mourinho will be in the hearts of Inter supporters forever<br /><br /><b>[his career with Brazil’s national team came to an end in 2014 after they suffered a 7-1 defeat to Germany]</b> Unfortunately, I’ll have to reply to this question for the whole of my life. It’s a situation that, until now, the people who played could not find an answer to what happened.<br /><br />We met a very strong team who had been prepared since 2006 to win this World Cup in 2014. Germany had been building this team for a long time, their coach explained that. I respected this Germany team a lot. They were very well organised and every player contributed to making them a great team. We lost our concentration for 10 or 15 minutes. In that short time we were penalised by the team who would win the World Cup<br /><br /><b>[On Tite]</b> He’s given an identity to Brazil. After the World Cup in 2014, Brazil need to find its way again; Tite understood this. He worked hard, got Brazil playing well. We were very strong in the qualifying group; a very tough qualifying group. Losing only one game from 18 when you play all those really strong countries is fantastic. Every other team lost at least four games and this Brazil team is respected around the world</p>

  <p><b>[Former goalkeeper Julio Cesar has revealed Jose Mourinho told him that he saved more with one arm than Iker Casillas could with two]</b> When I got to the dressing room, I saw a message from Jose on my phone. The message was: ‘You’re crazy. He’s the one who should wear your shirt and not the other way around’. He told me I stopped more with one arm than Casillas could with two.<br /><br />He came to the dressing room to talk to me and I told him to keep his head, that Mourinho was difficult and that he had to face it. For me, Mourinho likes to go face to face with the players who are considered the stars in the team he coaches</p>
