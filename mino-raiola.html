  <p><b>[Mino Raiola, who is also the agent for the likes of Paul Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, has had his worldwide ban temporarily delayed by CAS]</b> The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has registered an urgent appeal filed by the football intermediary, Carmine ‘Mino’ Raiola, against the decision taken by the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Appeal Committee on May 28, 2019 (the challenged decision) which confirmed a previous decision of the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> Disciplinary Committee. In such decision, a three-month period of suspension from performing the role of sports agent in Italy which was imposed on Mino Raiola by the Intermediaries Committee of the Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) was extended by <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> to become a worldwide ban.<br /><br />Prior to the filing of his appeal, Mino Raiola also filed an urgent application to stay the execution of the challenged decision. On June 7, 2019, the president of the CAS Appeals Arbitration Division upheld the application. Accordingly, the worldwide extension of the suspension of Mino Raiola is stayed pending the outcome of the CAS proceedings. However, the suspension imposed by the FIGC in Italy is not affected by the CAS decision. Further to the parties’ agreement, CAS will conduct an expedited procedure with a shortened procedural calendar in order to allow for a final decision to be rendered at the beginning of July 2019.</p>

  <p><b>[Agent Mino Raiola’s worldwide ban has been lifted by <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a>.

This ‘Italian Ban’ is not a surprise, unfortunately. My personal concern is that it has been a sentence dominated by politics, without taking the rule of law into consideration. It is a sentence based on false grounds and lies. Law and justice must prevail in any civil and correct system and I hope my situation will be resolved within the right lines as the story continues. I guess the Italian Football Association has not forgiven me when I have criticised them for their role in the disastrous state of Italian football, as well as their role around the latest episode of the racism problem and my opinions could have had an influence in the evaluation of the matter</p>

No! If you come to that conclusion then the other conclusion is - if you sell <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> would you buy a better one? No! Where is he? But if you create your identity then maybe you discover that Paul is ideal. If you, say, want to play with two holding midfielders then where does Paul play? In several positions. At least when Ferguson was there you saw it was his team - the way they played, proactive, and the players that came in came in with an eye on how to play that game. So I say, make your identity of what you want your club to be and then find the ‘Lego’ parts for it. You need that clarity. A big club chooses the system and then chooses the players</p>
