  <p><b>[Bradley Simmonds: From <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> rejection to Instagram superstardom]</b> The problem with me was my injuries. I did my anterior cruciate ligament by going into an aggressive challenge. That’s something I probably do regret. I just loved getting stuck in then my fitness was never really 100 per cent. I had two operations. It was only meant to be six months but I had a bad operation so I needed another operation which extended it to 10 months. I lost my confidence and I came back really heavy.<br /><br />I was smashing the weights because I had so much time. When I was in rehab, I was excited for lunch because I spent a lot of time alone and then at lunch I could be with the boys again. I used to put a lot of food on my plate. Then I got released, simply just because at the time I was not good enough and injuries affected that. I went to Iceland and I had a really good spell with IBV. It was the top division of Iceland and I was in the Europa League, which was a great experience. Then in one of my last games, I snapped my ankle. It was really tough. My agent at the time had got me a trial at Caen in France. I was absolutely devastated. It took me a while to get back from that. I was thinking about going to America and <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> to get a trial over there but my heart and mind wasn’t ready for it. So I decided to stop playing football completely and start a new career<br /><br />I was playing centre back at first <b>[in the academy]</b> and I would always pull my sleeves up and try to be like <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>. I remember I used to do a boot camp with 60 people and I had to put my equipment all back in my tiny Smart Car. I got a follow from <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a>. I was properly buzzing. I decided to message him and offered my services. He said ‘yes, my wife would love to train and would you like to do it with my family and me?’ I was like ‘wow, this is a dream come true, this is mad!’ I went to the <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> training ground first and I drove there in my Smart Car. I saw my old team-mate Nathaniel Chalobah driving out in his Range Rover at the same time and I am in this tiny car.<br /><br />He is like ‘yes, Simmo, what are you doing here?!’ I was like I am about to train <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> and he was buzzing for me. I sat down with <a href="john-terry.html">John Terry</a> and I was star struck massively. He is a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> legend and I grew up playing for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. That’s when the relationship started. The following day the training started and I have been training him and his family for five years since then<br /><br />I had just finished football and I wasn’t sure what I was going to do. I joined Sports On Screen as a body double for <a href="aaron-ramsey.html">Aaron Ramsey</a> and <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a>. I was on set for Nivea for <a href="jordan-henderson.html">Jordan Henderson</a> and <a href="raheem-sterling.html">Raheem Sterling</a> was there. Sterling was like ‘yeah, this lad was a very, very good player. A proper player’. That made me realise that I was a good player but these injuries killed me. For me, that came from best I have ever played with<br /><br /><b>[The message Simmonds sends is being dropped isn’t the end of the road if you don’t want it to be]</b> Don’t get me wrong, if someone said: ‘Do you want to be a professional footballer in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>?’ then I would snap their fingers off and take it. That was my dream and I would still love to do that. But if things don’t work out there are loads of things you can do depending on what your interests are. You should use being dropped from professional football to motivate you to go onto something else, rather than to wallow and go down the wrong path. I love what I do now and hope to inspire, motivate and educate</p>
