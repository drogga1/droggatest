  <p><b>[In response to <a href="megan-rapinoe.html">Rapinoe</a>’s interest Teixidor, who handles women’s football at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, talks that her side are open to landing Rapinoe]</b> We will see in the future what deals we make because designing a team is something complex. I think we will be ready to buy these kinds of players but I don’t think we are in a similar moment to male football yet, in which the market is very important<br /><br /><b>[Teixidor also said that she was impressed by <a href="megan-rapinoe.html">Rapinoe</a>’s activism]</b> After watching her speech in New York after winning the World Cup we must say she is a great spokeswoman. I almost see her having a political or an activist career in the future, and I think it is good that women who have the chance can speak of the reality that still today it is hard to bring their claims to the highest level. People with such integrity and awareness in this fight are so important for so many people and those who assume that leadership position deserve all the respect</p>

  <p><b>[Camp Nou is in crisis, with threats of legal action hanging over a boardroom dispute that looks set to have serious ramifications on and off the field]</b> I’ve always said that things go well when there are good people in important positions. With good colleagues, everything is always easier. So, we’ll see what happens…</p>
