  <p><b>[Lazio chief <a href="claudio-lotito.html">Claudio Lotito</a> has claimed that monkey chants from supporters are not always racist, in the wake of widespread allegations of abuse in <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>]</b> he ‘buu’ chants don’t always correspond to a discriminatory or racist act. I remember when I was little, often people who were not black, who had normal, white skin, were booed by other players to discourage them from scoring a goal. It should be interpreted in the right way. We have so many black players, I don’t think that Lazio makes a distinction between skin colour. The club’s behaviour from this point of view is right in front of everyone’s eyes</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="claudio-lotito.html">Lotito</a>’s comments sparked a backlash from the public and the club moved to exonerate the president from any wrongdoing with an official statement on Wednesday]</b> An inappropriate term has provoked an exaggerated twisting of words and conveyed a message in stark contrast to all the long-established initiatives implemented by the club for the defence of ethical and moral values to which president <a href="claudio-lotito.html">Claudio Lotito</a> has always been aligned and have always placed him in the front line against any form of discrimination</p>
