  <p><b>[Who is Mariano Diaz? The €30m striker Real Madrid have stolen away from Sevilla]</b> Real Madrid have a buy option they are going to exercise. But we still have no communication from the player, who has told us that he wanted to play with Sevilla again and again. He has the ability to say one thing or another. We negotiated with Lyon and then they have 48 hours to decide. Real Madrid did it. Are we annoyed with Real Madrid? Not at all, this is football. We have to keep working. We have done what we had to do, in good faith, with an agent and a player who tells us on videos and audios that he only wants to play in Sevilla.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> reveal possible expansion into Mexico]</b> It is a project that I still cannot speak much about. I have no data, but it is true that we are open to any possibility both in Mexico and in some countries where there is an interesting project for our idea of internationalisation. It is a subject that we are studying, I am very ambitious, but I do not like to anticipate things when they are not yet achieved and signed. We see it with good eyes and we know the level of Mexican football. It is one of the places where we have hopes, ideas and sporting projects. This internationalisation is going to continue, not only in that area, but in others such as the subject of academies. We opened an academy in New York, another in New Jersey, another in Miami, but we have a different idea of projecting from academies in South America, Central America and I think it will be soon, and results in that sense will also start to be seen</p>
