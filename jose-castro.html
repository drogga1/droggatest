  <p><b>[Jose Castro says Newly installed Sevilla head coach Julen Lopetegui was the first choice of sporting director Monchi]</b> We’ve brought in the best sporting director, which is Monchi, and he says the best coach for the Sevilla project is Lopetegui. He is the best coach for me as well.</p>

  <p><b>[Sevilla reveal possible expansion into Mexico]</b> It is a project that I still cannot speak much about. I have no data, but it is true that we are open to any possibility both in Mexico and in some countries where there is an interesting project for our idea of internationalisation. It is a subject that we are studying, I am very ambitious, but I do not like to anticipate things when they are not yet achieved and signed. We see it with good eyes and we know the level of Mexican football. It is one of the places where we have hopes, ideas and sporting projects. This internationalisation is going to continue, not only in that area, but in others such as the subject of academies. We opened an academy in New York, another in New Jersey, another in Miami, but we have a different idea of projecting from academies in South America, Central America and I think it will be soon, and results in that sense will also start to be seen</p>
