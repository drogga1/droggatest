  <p><b>[Sevilla have confirmed that head coach Eduardo Berizzo has been diagnosed with prostate cancer]</b> We’ve explained the feelings of the club in the official statement but the important thing is that Berizzo feels strong and is awaiting the treatment he’s going to follow.<br /><br />This is a personal matter and from here on, we are going to make it clear that he is our coach. We aren’t imagining any situation where he’s not and we are going to support him and fall over ourselves for him because we are sure that this problem has a solution. He wants total normality, he’s in good spirits and he’s dealing with it naturally.<br /><br />We knew 15 to 20 days ago. He told the players after the Celta match and it was something we had to communicate. Eduardo was the one to make the decision and he didn’t want it to become mixed up in yesterday’s match. The news was scheduled for this morning, though last night there were rumours about it.<br /><br />I work closely with Berizzo and, for me as chairman, it comes as a massive shock because it’s heavy news. Straight away I was there for him, and so was the club. I have to also give thanks for all the calls we’ve received, both from the sporting world and outside.<br /><br />The President of FC Barcelona has got in contact to offer the club’s full medical team. I think that says it all. Many institutions have contacted the club to wish Berizzo well and I want to thank everyone for this</p>

  <p><b>[Sevilla have denied receiving any offers for midfielder Steven N’Zonzi]</b> N’Zonzi’s situation <b>[being dropped]</b> is due to a technical issue with the coaches and, as with all technical issues, he can change it. He travelled to London to visit his son with our permission. There aren’t any offers to sign N’Zonzi. I can’t talk about clauses or prices if we don’t have an offer. We respect the decision of our coaches, he is training with his team-mates but currently he isn’t playing. It’s a technical decision and the coaches have said in public that he can change this.</p>

  <p><b>[Who is Mariano Diaz? The €30m striker Real Madrid have stolen away from Sevilla]</b> Real Madrid have a buy option they are going to exercise. But we still have no communication from the player, who has told us that he wanted to play with Sevilla again and again. He has the ability to say one thing or another. We negotiated with Lyon and then they have 48 hours to decide. Real Madrid did it. Are we annoyed with Real Madrid? Not at all, this is football. We have to keep working. We have done what we had to do, in good faith, with an agent and a player who tells us on videos and audios that he only wants to play in Sevilla.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> reveal possible expansion into Mexico]</b> It is a project that I still cannot speak much about. I have no data, but it is true that we are open to any possibility both in Mexico and in some countries where there is an interesting project for our idea of internationalisation. It is a subject that we are studying, I am very ambitious, but I do not like to anticipate things when they are not yet achieved and signed. We see it with good eyes and we know the level of Mexican football. It is one of the places where we have hopes, ideas and sporting projects. This internationalisation is going to continue, not only in that area, but in others such as the subject of academies. We opened an academy in New York, another in New Jersey, another in Miami, but we have a different idea of projecting from academies in South America, Central America and I think it will be soon, and results in that sense will also start to be seen</p>
