<blockquote>
  <p>[Former Norwich City loanee Felix Passlack has admitted that it was hard to be happy about his marginalised role at the club during their successful Championship-winning season] Of course it was hard to be happy. If you are only used in a few cup games in such an exceptional season, then you can not be satisfied with it. I left for Norwich with the clear goal of becoming a regular but Max Aarons got his chance early in the season and overtook me. My opportunity never came because he continued to perform so well. However, I was very happy for the team and the entire club. I know what we have achieved means a lot to the fans across the region<br /><br />[Passlack also praised Daniel Farke as a coach] My exchanges with him were good. I think I got on his nerves though! I was often asking what I could do better, but he would tell me I was already training well enough. I wanted to not give up. I knew that in this league I was able to improve both physically and as a player. I have matured this season, as weird as that may sound. I think that is very important</p>
