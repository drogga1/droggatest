  <p><b>[USWNT feels right at home in France with record-setting night behind partisan crowd in Reims]</b> Amazing turnout. There have been fans all around our hotel. It’s been awesome to see people coming out, young girls coming out. Just seeing people cheer for us is exciting, it makes us happy and that’s why we play</p>

  <p><b>[USA midfielder Sam Mewis was answering a question about Alex Morgan’s incredible performance against Thailand on Tuesday night and said]</b> Alex getting four goals was crazy. She got five goals?! Oh my god, I thought she got four. That’s wild!<br /><br /><b>[Sam Mewis, who scored two goals on the night, was asked if she felt sorry for Thailand]</b> I give Thailand a lot of credit. It’s a World Cup and we just had to play our game but I think they can definitely rally, they have two more games and they definitely could perform in those games. I think this scoreline doesn’t depict exactly what they can do because if you look at their recent record I think they’ve done really well</p>

  <p><b>[Disgraceful? Classless? That’s exactly what the reaction to USWNT’s 13-0 win has been. If the outside commentary is getting to the USWNT players, you wouldn’t know it from what Sam Mewis - scorer of two goals on Tuesday - said on Thursday]</b> I don’t really think we as a team are super involved in watching and reading a lot of media about ourselves, to be honest. We had heard there were some things going on and I think we’re really trying to focus on the next game and on Chile. We respect Thailand a lot and I think that we’re just looking at the next game now</p>

  <p><b>[Sam Mewis started two of the U.S. women’s national team’s three group-stage matches at this World Cup, but both times she came into the side in place of an injured player]</b> I was nervous before the game. Realizing who my teammates are and who I’m surrounded with makes me a lot calmer, but there are moments where I get nervous.</p>

  <p><b>[Sam Mewis on USWNT media social habit]</b> A lot of us have just tried to spend less time on social media or looking at media in general, but I think at times there are so many positive things. You want to interact with people. I get a lot of messages from friends and people like that, so parts of it are really positive</p>

  <p><b>[The anticipation for game against France can partially be measured by ticket prices on the secondary market, which are currently at around €200 ($228) for the cheapest seat available at Parc des Princes]</b> I don’t know if that’s the right thing ticket-wise but I think it’s exciting that people are willing to pay that much to see the game.<br /><br /><b>[The U.S. will also have to be wary of France center back <a href="wendie-renard.html">Wendie Renard</a>, the tallest player in the World Cup]</b> She’s great in the air, she’s a really well-rounded player. We all have so much respect for her<br /><br />There’s going to be a lot of eyes on this game and I hope that it’s a good example of how great women’s football can be. We’re just excited we get to be a part of it</p>

  <p><b>[Jill Ellis has been criticized for her experimentation and lineup choices]</b> She’s pushed this team a lot and she has really high expectations for us. That’s an exciting thing for her and for the team.</p>

  <p><b>[The U.S. defeated Portugal 4-0 on Thursday as 49,504 fans made it a night for the record books]</b> It just shows how much support we have and how many people are willing to buy tickets. If fans like this are everywhere and continue to show support and spend money on tickets and jerseys and stuff like that, I think it’s just showing our value and that’s really great</p>
