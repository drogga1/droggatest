  <p><b>[Sam Mewis on USWNT media social habit]</b> A lot of us have just tried to spend less time on social media or looking at media in general, but I think at times there are so many positive things. You want to interact with people. I get a lot of messages from friends and people like that, so parts of it are really positive</p>

  <p><b>[The anticipation for game against France can partially be measured by ticket prices on the secondary market, which are currently at around €200 ($228) for the cheapest seat available at Parc des Princes]</b> I don’t know if that’s the right thing ticket-wise but I think it’s exciting that people are willing to pay that much to see the game.<br /><br /><b>[The U.S. will also have to be wary of France center back Wendie Renard, the tallest player in the World Cup]</b> She’s great in the air, she’s a really well-rounded player. We all have so much respect for her<br /><br />There’s going to be a lot of eyes on this game and I hope that it’s a good example of how great women’s football can be. We’re just excited we get to be a part of it</p>

  <p><b>[Jill Ellis has been criticized for her experimentation and lineup choices]</b> She’s pushed this team a lot and she has really high expectations for us. That’s an exciting thing for her and for the team.</p>

  <p><b>[The U.S. defeated Portugal 4-0 on Thursday as 49,504 fans made it a night for the record books]</b> It just shows how much support we have and how many people are willing to buy tickets. If fans like this are everywhere and continue to show support and spend money on tickets and jerseys and stuff like that, I think it’s just showing our value and that’s really great</p>
