  <p><b>[<a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> coach Jesualdo Ferreira has come out swinging ahead of this weekend’s clash with Leixoes, which for the moment takes precedent over the Champions League]</b> This is a tough game against a team that’s only lost once at home and, for me, is the sensational outfit this season.<br /><br /><b>[As for his own future?]</b> The issue of my contract renewal doesn’t bother me. We’re on three fronts and we want to win them all… winning with <a href="porto-fc.html">Porto</a> is all I’m concerned with</p>

  <p><b>[Jesualdo Ferreira, Al Sadd’s manager, insists his team aim to win over Al Shahania]</b> All the remaining matches will be really difficult, not just for Al Shahania but for Al-Sadd as well. Our aim is to go top and win the league title.<br /><br />The three of them will play against Al Shahania after they recovered completely and are physically and technically fit. My philosophy is clear and simple; depend on the full team, be it first string or substitutes. We are facing very strong teams and most of our players, old and young, are doing their work very well. The strong teams are the ones who have players training all week. Since last season, we have been depending on young players. I am confused now because there is Hamza who has been excellent recently and there is also Bounedjah who has returned. I am a fair man to all players but unfortunately, in some occasions, I face a great issue with regards to players in form. My aim is to always put the team first.<br /><br />In the last six games, we have only lost once. All that has been while we depended on our youth products who have been with the team from last season</p>

  <p><b>[Al Sadd manager, Jesualdo Ferreira, emphasized the difficulty of his team’s match against Al Shahaniya]</b> We have no option but to win this match and the remaining matches in the season if we are to decrease the gap between us and leaders, Lekhwiya<br /><br />Big teams don’t depend on certain star players, teams are built by hard work and training throughout the season. We at Al Sadd continually give chances to young players who always try to give their best to reserve their place in the team, and I always try to pick the best for the team</p>

  <p><b>[Jesualdo Ferreira, Al Sadd’s manager, admits his team’s game against Esteghlal Tehran of Iran will be so difficult]</b> The match will be tough and completely different from our domestic matches. I don’t know why it was decided that it will be a one-off match but this is the AFC schedule and we have to respect it. I’m really excited about the match, especially because of the stadium and the huge crowds. It will be a hard-fought match against a strong team who have a big reputation and lots of fans in Iran. We at Al-Sadd know this very well and are prepared to give our best. The players are all in high spirits and are looking to win and reach the group stage.<br /><br /><b>[When he was asked about Xavi Hernandez]</b> Xavi is a big player and I don’t need to talk about him. He always gives his best and serves the team. He is a role model for all the other players. We know what is required of us. We will look to play the suitable lineup for the match, which is like a final and could go to extra time. The players are in high spirits and are fully prepared to play in the proper manner</p>

  <p><b>[Al-Sadd coach Jesualdo Ferreira is determined to keep the pressure on Qatar Stars League leaders Lekhwiya after a 4-1 win over Al-Rayyan]</b> We won’t give up. There are two more rounds until the end of the league. Unfortunately, we made some mistakes in the previous matches. We will work to make up for that. I feel disappointed that we dropped points in matches which we had to win. We will attempt to return to the top and I hope Lekhwiya will slip up.</p>

  <p><b>[Al-Sadd head coach Jesualdo Ferreira registered his first win against El Jaish in the final game of the 2016-17 Qatar Stars League season]</b> We played against a team that has ended its footballing journey today. I personally had never <b>[before]</b> won against El-Jaish before during my time with Al-Sadd. The El-Jaish players were really down because of the decision to merge, especially as they were a big team and it is unfortunate that their journey has ended.</p>
