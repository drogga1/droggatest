  <p><b>[Guilherme ready to help KL go far in the cup after rediscovering scoring touch in style]</b> I hadn’t been happy that I couldn’t score previously. But I’m very happy now to have scored again, as a striker always needs to score in order to help the team. I want to continue scoring to help KL in the league and the cup. Furthermore next week we take on Kedah which is a tough game, but we’ll give our very best. It’s going to be 50-50 (against Kedah) as we have good local and foreign players. We need to fight from the first minute until the final whistle next Saturday. We need to believe in our chances in the cup, in ourselves and our style of play. After all it’s the shorter way to qualify for the AFC <b>[Champions League play-offs]</b></p>

  <p><b>[2018 a good season for Guilherme, who wants KL to come back stronger next year]</b> This has been a tough season for us, in the Super League and the Malaysia Cup. But we came here tonight with our heads high, did our job and won the game. What was left to play for was our pride. I’m very happy, I’ve played in 29 games and scored 25 goals all season. Those are good goals<br /><br /><b>[But already his mind is on the 2019 season, and Guilherme wants the club to build on what they have achieved in their first season back in Malaysia’s top tier]</b> It’s now time to rest, (but) it’s also time to turn our thoughts to the next season. I hope we can be stronger because we already knew where we stand this year. We now need to correct our mistakes, in order to make our team Kuala Lumpur a strong team</p>
