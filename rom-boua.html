  <p><b>[All Rom Boua had wanted to be as a boy was a footballer]</b> I was going to school in the morning and training in the afternoon. Looking back, it was an amazing experience<br /><br /><b>[There were highlights. The chance to play alongside future France international Bafetimbi Gomis stands out]</b> He was powerful, fast, technically gifted and an incredible finisher<br /><br /><b>[When Boua later moved to Scotland as a young man, he even tested himself against <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Wayne Rooney</a> in a friendly]</b> I had never run as much before in my life. The best experience I had as a professional was beating <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> 2-1 with Clyde in a Scottish Cup game. It was <a href="roy-keane.html">Roy Keane</a>’s first game playing for <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> after leaving Manchester United<br /><br />The worst experience I had was to be injured for three months after pulling my right thigh during a training session when I first joined Clyde. I was in a new country that I knew nothing about. It was the most difficult time of my football career as I had no close friends at the time or family to support me during my recovery in Scotland which was very isolating and a big test for me.<br /><br />I wanted to build a different career in IT so I decided to go back to studying and worked towards gaining my qualification. I chose computing and my plan was to use my qualification to further my career possibilities. I chose to study with The Open University as it is a respected academic institution and it is valued by potential employers. I benefited more through The Open University compared to traditional university as I was able to learn by using my own study style. I have two beautiful boys and an amazing partner who supported me throughout my studies. The flexibility of The Open University for me was key. It allowed me to study as I was unable to attend any night classes or day classes due to my work and family commitments. I was able to fit learning around my work and home life and study in my own time, while being at home with my family. If I was needed to help, I could stop what I was doing and pick it up again when I was free. I did not feel isolated. My tutor support was great and the online forum allowed me to connect, chat and share experience with fellow students and be part of a community.<br /><br />The skills I developed while studying with the The Open University - such as responsibility, time management and planning - contributed to getting my current role. Having my qualification definitely highlighted my CV to employers and knowing that I had that extra study behind me gave me more confidence going for potential jobs</p>
