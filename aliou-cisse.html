  <p><b>[Despite a timeframe of up to six weeks of recovery for Sadio Mane, Senegal have included the speedster in their squad for the World Cup]</b> In my mind, there is no doubt he will be with us for the double-header and that he will be 100 per cent fit. Until now, he has just been doing some individual training - running in straight lines. But from next week, he is going to train harder and start working with the ball</p>

  <p><b>[Senegal coach Aliou Cisse seemed more relaxed about admitting he is lucky to have a special talent to call on]</b> <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> is a unique player and he cannot be compared to any other Senegal player, even the major ones we’ve had in the past. And despite everything that has happened for him over the last two years, he hasn’t changed - he’s just as humble as he was when I first met him at the 2012 Olympics. Senegal isn’t only <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>, though, he has a good team built around him and I think it should be a little plus for him that we’re all behind him.<br /><br />He’s already one of the best - you can’t say he’s not. He plays for one of the most iconic clubs, one of the best in Europe, and he’s top notch for them. He’s absolutely unique because he is so unpredictable, that’s what makes him great - he can make the difference with a pass or shot. He’s already one of the best<br /><br /><b>[On <a href="robert-lewandowski.html">Lewandowski</a> he had no]</b> particular plan to stop him, just a collective plan to beat Poland</p>

  <p><b>[Senegal coach Aliou Cisse says his team are their own biggest enemies as their quest for a maiden Afica Cup of Nations trophy starts at the finals in Egypt in June and July]</b> We do not have the philosophy of fear. We have a positive philosophy. Today, the enemy of Senegal is Senegal. We must focus on ourselves and stop talking about our opponents. I have interests in my team, my strategy and what we want to do on the field and doing it well. We are keen to have a great tournament. We know that for us to win this Afcon, we will have to beat everyone. It will start with Tanzania on June 23. We will see in the round of 16 how that will happen. But our philosophy is to take the games one after the other. We know that everything can happen.</p>

  <p><b>[Suspended <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> star <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> to miss Senegal’s AFCON opener]</b> His absence should not in any way bother us. Certainly the presence of Sadio is beneficial but without him we remain strong. CAF have decided, so we will not linger <b>[on the subject]</b>. Certainly, with Sadio we would be very good, but even without him we will be very good. We all know that Sadio will have a good Nations Cup <b>[but]</b> the players around him have to raise their level. That’s how we’ll get there.<br /><br /><b>[Cisse expressed his displeasure with the rule that sees his star man suspended]</b> If we received a card in the qualifying round, I do not see the value of counting it during the final phase of the AFCON. CAF has decided that, but we will prove that Senegal exist without <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>.</p>

Now that he is not here, we will have to adapt to his absence. We have 23 players who are able to do the job and do the job properly. It’s the national team that’s important. Today, it is the collective that interests us more than ever, the collective must overcome the absence of <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mané</a>. We are not in a dynamic of negative thinking. We work to win and we work to make good results. And, as I said, the negative aspect is not part of our way of seeing things and our thinking.</p>

  <p><b>[Senegal head coach Aliou Cisse believes that <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>’s performances in 2018-19 warrant him being awarded the Ballon d’Or]</b> Why not? He has worked hard not only in the last year but since 2011, where I’ve known him to have great discipline and high professionalism. I followed him from his time in Austria and <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> until he arrived at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. What he has achieved this year is a result of great effort over many years and winning the AFCON will be an extension of those efforts. It will take him a step closer to the Golden Ball, which I think he deserves to win.<br /><br />No one can dispute the abilities of <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a>. He’s a world-class player and has proven as much. He’s always talking <b>[to me]</b> about everything, even when he’s with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I’ve tried to help him as best I can but more importantly, he has self-confidence and he managed to recover quickly. What’s happened <b>[the criticisms]</b> has motivated him to respond to everyone and I think he’s succeeded in doing that<br /><br /><b>[Senegal have been dubbed one of the favourites to win this year’s AFCON]</b> I think the favourites should be a team that has already won it before. It is not the case with us. We have not won this trophy before despite our achievements in reaching the quarter-finals of the World Cup and the final of the AFCON in 2002. Perhaps the press and analysts have made Senegal favourites because of the presence of big players like Mane, <a href="kalidou-koulibaly.html">Kalidou Koulibaly</a> and Gana <b>[<a href="idrissa-gana-gueye.html">Idrissa Gueye</a>]</b> and because we are at the top of the African ranking. But we do not look at winning the title yet, just the first round and our goal is to win all the matches at that stage of the competition. We will have to fight a lot of difficulties to produce our best possible performance and win the championship. There are many candidates to win it such as Cameroon, the holders, and host nation Egypt. Also Nigeria, Morocco and Tunisia are all very strong teams</p>

&lt;br.<br /><b>[Comparing his generation to the current crop of players he is leading, he said]</b> There is a great difference between our generation and the current generation. Now we have three different types of players, local players playing in Senegal, players who started their lives in Senegal and then worked abroad and others who were born and lived outside Senegal from the start. My goal is to make them all think the same way and succeed in finding a balance between these mentalities. Whoever grew up or played in Senegal has the culture of the country and the concept of playing for the national team and the warm African environment, which you may not find with those who started their lives in Europe in terms of atmosphere, culture and mental Always to find a balance between everyone.</p>

  <p><b>[Senegal coach Aliou Cisse has insisted his side will remain focused when they take on Tunisia in the semi-final of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations on Sunday]</b> Tunisia are a good team who do good things. We won’t underestimate anyone and we won’t lack concentration. We’ll take points as they come. There are still two matches. We came here with ambition, we hoped to play the quarter-final, we’ll keep our feet on the ground. Since 2006, we didn’t reach this level. It’s been 13 years Senegal haven’t been here, it’s already a progression. We’ll have more humility. I believe these are great professionals. I’ve always been confident in the work we’re doing.<br /><br />It’s been more than 17 years that Senegal hadn’t competed at the World Cup, it had been two finals they hadn’t got out of the group. In 2017 we did. We haven’t reached this far since 2006, so yes, it’s an evolution, we’re improving step by step. I called up 23 players and included Mbaye Niang - I know what he can do, what he’s capable of - he didn’t score, but you can’t forget everything <b>[he is doing]</b></p>

It was a team problem first and foremost. He’s won the Champions League and is focused on the goal of bringing this trophy back to his country. He dreams of it. He’s one of the group’s leaders and has an impact on everyone. He’s a model for all his team-mates</p>
