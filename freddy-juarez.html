  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake sack head coach Mike Petke following suspension for abusing referee. RSL have replaced Petke with assistant Freddy Juarez]</b> …the steepest sanctions ever imposed on an <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> coach. After further deliberations and a series of constructive discussions internally and with various members of our community, we have concluded, pursuant to his employment agreement, to immediately terminate Mike Petke’s employment<br /><br />At Real Salt Lake, we have the privilege to represent our great community and fans here locally and on a national and global basis. We hold all of our coaches, players, executives and staff to the highest standards of professionalism. As an organisation, it is vital that everyone, particularly our leadership, reflects and embodies our core values and the values of our community, treating all people with respect, civility and professionalism. Moreover, throughout our 15-year history, we have championed diversity, acceptance and inclusion throughout our organisation, our stadiums and our community. This is a responsibility that we take very seriously</p>

  <p><b>[Real Salt Lake coach Freddy Juarez was keen to stress the impact a player of <a href="giuseppe-rossi.html">Giuseppe Rossi</a>’s talent and experience could bring to the club]</b> It’s amazing to have a player of his skills in and around the guys. It’s a guy that can change the game at any given moment and he’s seen it all and done it all so he gives the team confidence. Beyond his skills, he takes the time to talk and spend time with the young guys. It goes a long way when your peers can lead you and hold high standards</p>
