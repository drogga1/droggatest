  <p><b>[Stefan Frei returns to Toronto hoping to win MLS Cup]</b> Back then, with all the struggles we had with Toronto I would have been really happy making the playoffs, let alone making an MLS Cup final. I remember sitting in the stands, high up on the north side, with the wind blowing in off the lake. It really didn’t cross my mind then that I might one day be back there playing in a final, but things really have come full circle.<br /><br />When I came back in January of preseason of that following year I was in the best shape of my life. Then 44 minutes into my first preseason game I get a boot to the face and break my nose, and that led to me not really having a chance to fight for the starting spot and consequently losing the starting spot<br /><br />That was the biggest blow to me because I thought if you put in all this hard work that you’re going to get rewarded in the end. I put in all this hard work to come back from this injury, for more than a year, and didn’t really get anything out of it. Mentally, that was a pretty tough pill to swallow<br /><br /><b>[On his decision to sign with the Sounders]</b> It was just too good of an opportunity to pass up, with the coaching staff that I knew was there, the success the team has had over the years, I felt like it was a team I wanted to be a part of. Not just in terms of trying to win things, but also personally trying to get better and get some confidence back and improve as an individual. It has ticked all those boxes. The first year had some growing pains, but I had a coaching staff around me that was assuring me and supporting me 100 percent, and it allowed me to grow<br /><br /><b>[The U.S. national team could potentially reap the rewards of Frei’s maturity as well]</b> It’s been mentioned to me before, and obviously it sounds like Bruce Arena wants to look at all his <b>[goalkeeping options]</b> as well. A new coach wants to see what’s out there. I think right now, for at least one more week, I want to give my full attention to the Sounders, and then I’ll have to make a quick decision after MLS Cup. We’ll see what happens.<br /><br />I’m happy to see them finally have success because their fans have stuck with them through thick and thin. I’m super excited for their fans, the Red Patch Boys in particular. I think if maybe <b>[Toronto FC owners Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment]</b> had calmed down a bit sooner that success could have come sooner. Hopefully going forward they’ll be a bit more patient with things</p>

  <p><b>[Stefan Frei makes save for the ages to help Sounders clinch title]</b> You just try to get balanced if you can and move your feet and see if there’s anything you can do. It’s funny because sometimes when the ball initially comes off the striker you are like, ‘Eh, that’s gone.’ You surprise yourselves sometimes. I was able to go, because sometimes you freeze. I was able to go and get a good jump and get a hand on it.<br /><br /><b>[As excited as he was about winning his first MLS Cup, Frei spared a thought for the TFC fans who left BMO Field heartbroken]</b> I feel a little sad for their fans because I was here for five years and there wasn’t much to celebrate on the pitch, yet they still kept coming back and supporting. They were always very good to me and my family. No bandwagon fans, they’re real fans, and I think they’re a big part of TFC turning things around. My new chapter is with the Sounders now, and we have amazing fans who deserved this trophy and I’m really glad we got it</p>

  <p><b>[On Tim Howard]</b> For him to still be playing at this level at his age is a testament to how good of an athlete and how skilled of a soccer player he is. I hope that he can play some more years, but whenever he calls it a career and quits he’s going to go down as a legend for sure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Cristian Roldan has evolved into fierce young leader for Sounders]</b> He’s starting to be my go-to guy when I want things to be on player’s minds. For example, when we’re in Houston and we have Nico and Cristian on yellows, he’s the one that went to and told him, ‘Listen, it’s your responsibility to make sure you don’t get a second yellow.’ That funny video of him dragging Nico away that isn’t a coincidence. That’s playing smart. We don’t want to shoot ourselves in the foot. I knew that he would carry that responsibility as a young guy. It shows how smart of a player he is.</p>
