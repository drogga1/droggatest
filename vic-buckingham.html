  <p><b>[<a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> couldn’t just understand the game of soccer, he could control it. Buckingham knew that from the moment he first saw a teenage <a href="johan-cruyff.html">Cruyff</a> in action]</b> He was the one who immediately struck a chord with me, as if he were my son. He was on his own and he showed us how to play. He was so mature. He was such a skinny little kid but he had such immense stamina. He could run all over the field. And he could do everything: set movements up, fly down the wing, run into the penalty area, head the ball in. Left foot, right foot, anything - and such speed</p>
