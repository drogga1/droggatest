<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Celtic vs Rangers]</b> It’s another thing to deal with but we move forward. The statement started by saying I’ve done a really good job and should be proud of what I’ve done. My position hasn’t changed. I haven’t spoke to the chairman this week - I haven’t felt the need to. I’ve got a contract until the end of the season. The chairman, as far as I’m aware, reiterated that in the summer a manager will be appointed. Whether that’s me or someone else, that appointment will have to take place. So my situation and reading of it hasn’t altered. <b>[Beating Celtic]</b> would be better for me personally but it’s about making sure we get this weekend right. We’ve got a big game, so let’s concentrate on getting that right. I’d prefer to speak wholly about the semi-final because it’s going to be my first experience of it and it’s going to be a really big day for the football club and the players. So my sole focus will be on the game, not what happens after that, not what happens in the summer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Rangers have dismissed manager Graeme Murty]</b> Graeme Murty has this morning been relieved of his duties as manager of Rangers. Jimmy Nicholl and Jonatan Johansson will take charge of the team for the three remaining matches of the season. Rangers are grateful to Graeme, who did not hesitate when asked last October to become interim manager after the departure of Pedro Caixinha and then, at the turn of the year, when he was offered the role as manager until the end of the season. Graeme has had to contend with difficult and challenging circumstances but conducted himself in a thoroughly professional manner. He will take some time to consider his options, which include returning to his role at the Rangers Academy. Jimmy Nicholl and Jonatan Johansson have already started preparing the team for the match against Kilmarnock on Saturday and they will be in place for the two remaining fixtures, against Aberdeen and Hibernian. The club hopes to be in a position to comment further on the managerial situation in the near future.</p>
