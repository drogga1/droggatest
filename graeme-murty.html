  <p><b>[Rangers have confirmed that manager Pedro Caixinha has parted company with the club]</b> Rangers Football Club announce today <b>[Thursday, October 26, 2017]</b> that Pedro Caixinha has left the Club. The decision to part company with Pedro was taken after careful consideration and the search for a new manager will begin immediately.<br /><br />Pedro was appointed in March this year but results have been disappointing and not commensurate with the level of investment that was made available. Graeme Murty, head development squad coach, will take charge of the first-team in the interim, just as he did earlier this year.<br /><br />The priority is to appoint a new manager as quickly as possible, but the Board will take as much time as is necessary to secure the right person capable of representing Rangers and providing the brand of football supporters rightly expect. We, the Board, appreciate this is a difficult time for all Rangers supporters and we thank you for your patience and know Graeme and the players will receive your full backing in the days ahead.<br /><br />We thank Pedro and his backroom staff for their efforts and commitment and wish them well for the future.</p>

  <p><b>[Dundee vs Rangers]</b> I said at the start when I came in that I don’t think about my status or my role. That hasn’t changed and my outlook hasn’t changed at all. It would be good for all involved if we had someone in place, whether that be me or someone else</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic vs Rangers]</b> It’s another thing to deal with but we move forward. The statement started by saying I’ve done a really good job and should be proud of what I’ve done. My position hasn’t changed. I haven’t spoke to the chairman this week - I haven’t felt the need to. I’ve got a contract until the end of the season. The chairman, as far as I’m aware, reiterated that in the summer a manager will be appointed. Whether that’s me or someone else, that appointment will have to take place. So my situation and reading of it hasn’t altered. <b>[Beating Celtic]</b> would be better for me personally but it’s about making sure we get this weekend right. We’ve got a big game, so let’s concentrate on getting that right. I’d prefer to speak wholly about the semi-final because it’s going to be my first experience of it and it’s going to be a really big day for the football club and the players. So my sole focus will be on the game, not what happens after that, not what happens in the summer.</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers have dismissed manager Graeme Murty]</b> Graeme Murty has this morning been relieved of his duties as manager of Rangers. Jimmy Nicholl and Jonatan Johansson will take charge of the team for the three remaining matches of the season. Rangers are grateful to Graeme, who did not hesitate when asked last October to become interim manager after the departure of Pedro Caixinha and then, at the turn of the year, when he was offered the role as manager until the end of the season. Graeme has had to contend with difficult and challenging circumstances but conducted himself in a thoroughly professional manner. He will take some time to consider his options, which include returning to his role at the Rangers Academy. Jimmy Nicholl and Jonatan Johansson have already started preparing the team for the match against Kilmarnock on Saturday and they will be in place for the two remaining fixtures, against Aberdeen and Hibernian. The club hopes to be in a position to comment further on the managerial situation in the near future.</p>
