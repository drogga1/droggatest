  <p><b>[Aleksander Katai on LA Galaxy’s Latest Squad]</b> I think this is a very good team. I think I can play in the playoffs in my first year. In most positions in the team, we have international players. I think we can do that<br /><br /><b>[He added on Chicharito]</b> I would love to play with <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a>. He’s a good player… It’s good when you have some big names. I played with <a href="bastian-schweinsteiger.html">Bastian Schweinsteiger</a> last year. He can help with advice and he’s played with really big clubs. He’s won everything, Champions League, everything. He’s a very experienced guy. All the big names, big stars, they’re experienced and they can help a lot</p>

  <p><b>[LA Galaxy condemn ‘racist and violent’ posts from Katai’s wife]</b> Earlier today, the LA Galaxy were made aware of a series of racist and violent social media posts by Tea Katai, the wife of LA Galaxy midfielder Aleksandar Katai. The LA Galaxy strongly condemned the social posts and requested their immediate removal. The LA Galaxy stands firmly against racism of any kind, including that which suggests violence or seeks to demean the efforts of those in pursuit of racial equality. The LA Galaxy stand with communities of color, and especially the Black community, in the protests and fight against systemic racism, social inequality, bigotry and violence. The LA Galaxy will hold a meeting with Katai on Thursday, June 4 and will determine next steps. Now is the time to reflect on our role in helping fight racism in our community</p>
