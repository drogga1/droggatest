<blockquote>
  <p>[Lyon youngster Mohamed Bahlouli has said that he aims to emulate Barcelona ace Philippe Coutinho] Lionel Messi is impossible to imitate. The one I’m looking at is Philippe Coutinho. I watch his games and his videos on YouTube. He has everything a modern attacking midfielder needs. He is capable expressing himself by dribbling, scoring or setting up other, all the time positioning himself to keep his team balanced.<br /><br />I would say that I am a technical player with a good vision of the game. I love going forward but I have to come back faster, make defensive work natural because it is not. I’m working hard to make it automatic. I have only short-term goals: to have the chance to train with professionals, to be in the squad and to sign my first professional deal<br /><br />I have always been compared to my brother, but I have never worried about that. We had the same coaches in Lyon, and they say that I have the same style of play. Sometimes, during training, some of them call me Fares!</p>
