  <p><b>[Conor Coady says Trent <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Alexander-Arnold</a>’s rise at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> is incredible]</b> It’s incredible. People have to realise how tough it is to make it at such a big club like this and realise what he has actually done. How he has gone about his business is absolutely brilliant. You see how much he loves <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club, I’ve heard him talk plenty of times saying he wants to go on to be <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> captain, he wants to spend his career at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, this is his club - and you really believe him when he says it. I hope people realise how tough it is to make it at a club like this, because it is tough, and the achievement is remarkable. The <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> game, the corner, will live in every <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fan’s mind for many, many years. To have that confidence to do that in front of the Kop was special.<br /><br /><b>[Conor Coady is delighted to see a fellow Merseyside native prove that progress can be made at a top club]</b> It’s mentality, it’s a will to win, it’s a belief in your own ability. It’s also a manager who believes in you, a manager who wants to improve you as a footballer. I remember a couple of years ago when he played against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> at <a href="manchester-united.html">Old Trafford</a> and <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Marcus Rashford</a> gave him a tough game, he played against <a href="crystal-palace.html">Crystal Palace</a> and <a href="wilfried-zaha.html">Wilfried Zaha</a> gave him a tough game - look at him now and he’s a completely different player. I think that’s down to him listening to the manager and improving each and every day. He has been brilliant</p>

  <p><b>[Wolves captain and lifelong <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> fan Conor Coady says <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Virgil van Dijk</a> has changed <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for the better and is always in control of what is happening around him]</b> Everybody realises how good he is as a footballer, what he has done for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> in the last couple of years and how he has approached the football club and improved the defence and the whole team. The best thing about him is he is always in control of what he is doing, he is in control of an attacker, he is in control of how to defend a one-v-one. I remember when <b>[Heung-min]</b> Son was running at him in the Champions League final, you always knew he was in control of what he was doing and he ended up making a tackle in the end - which he has done for the majority of the season. The way he has changed <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> has been brilliant to see.<br /><br /><b>[Despite beating Wolves on the final day, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> had to settle for second with 97 points - but Coady thinks <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a>’s side deserved the title]</b> Anybody would tell you the same, not just <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> fans. The way they did it and how they played, they deserved to win the league. To gather 97 points over a season is absolutely remarkable, they lost one game against <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> - which is ridiculous. I think that’s why everybody is happy that they won the Champions League, because they deserved something from the season. I just think City are an incredible football club - they are a fantastic team with brilliant footballers and a brilliant manager</p>

  <p><b>[The skipper is at the heart of the club’s pre-season tour to China, where owners Fosun have their headquarters, and is ready for the new season ahead]</b> It’s crazy. It’s mad to think where the club was just three or four years ago. It’s crazy to see what Fosun has done with the club and where they’ve taken it. To see a Wolves shop in China is amazing<br /><br /><b>[Fosun may not be first-mover when it comes to Chinese investment in football, but they are making up for lost time]</b> The owners have been incredible since the first day they came into the club. It was amazing when they first came in. They wanted to do right by the club and you knew that. When you see owners like that, it’s fantastic to be a part of. For a player like myself and a couple of other boys who were there before, to actually be a part of that and be involved, we are very, very lucky<br /><br /><b>[Fosun has been deadly serious in its quest to help Wolves move top of the next rank of English teams]</b> That’s something we’ve got to improve this season. We’ll look at the games where we struggled a bit last season and where we had to do different things in the game to win it and get better at it. Simple as that. But also to keep to that consistency in playing against the so-called bigger teams. We’re looking forward to it. It’s going to be even tougher this season, we know that, but we’re ready for it. We can’t wait to get started<br /><br /><b>[Key to the upcoming season will be avoiding the pitfalls of Burnley, who finished seventh last time out]</b> Burnley did fantastically well in what they did that year. The good thing is we can look back on things like that and learn from them as much as possible. We did it when we got promoted to the Premier League. We did it when the manager came in, in the Championship, and embraced everything. We’re not going to change now<br /><br />We look at the team we’ve got and I think we’ve got a fantastic team. The club will look at and sign whoever they want to sign, and we will welcome them with open arms as we always do and make sure we’re ready to fight on all fronts when they come in. For us it’s just about making sure we are ready come next week. It’s a huge game for us and one we can’t wait for<br /><br />We don’t want to put too much pressure on ourselves. All we want to do is improve on last season. If we can do that we’ll be OK. Fosun have fantastic ambition, if you’re involved with Wolverhampton Wanderers at the minute, it’s an exciting time to be<br /><br />I’ll never look too far ahead. England is the pinnacle of any Englishman’s career. They got to the Nations League semi-final, the World Cup semi-final, it’s such a tough team to break into so I would never say I want to do this, I want to do that. If it was to come, fantastic, but I’m not going to look too far ahead.<br /><br /><b>[Coady has come a long way since making the decision to seek first-team football away from the club which nurtured him, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> When I left <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I knew had to leave. It was a big step but it was something I had to do. A lot of people asked if it was hard, it wasn’t hard. It was something I needed to do to improve and get better as a footballer. To find myself at a club like Wolves now is absolutely amazing. I owe everything to Wolves and what they’ve done the last few years. They’ve helped me not just on the pitch but also become as a better person</p>

  <p><b>[Wolves captain Conor Coady has shown his frustration towards the treatment of influential team-mate <a href="adama-traore.html">Adama Traore</a>. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> ran out 2-1 winners at Molineux on Sunday afternoon]</b> Teams are ganging up on him - it’s one player, then another player. <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> were clever in terms of how different players were fouling him but it’s hard from our point of view to keep seeing that happen. They (Tottenham) were spreading things out. That’s what’s disappointing from our point of view. It was obviously something they’ve said and then carried out. It’s hard to take because he beats his man every time. We speak to referees every game. They say they can’t do much about it because they are booking them but they’re not red cards. I can see where they are coming from where it’s not a red card<br /><br /><b>[Coady believes players like <a href="adama-traore.html">Traore</a> are essential when it comes to playing in the bigger games]</b> He’s such a handful. So powerful and quick. He’s been absolutely phenomenal so far this season. He’s unstoppable at times. Teams can’t stop him. You saw him out there against world-class players. But at the same time, it’s so frustrating for us because he’s creating so much and when he gets past players to get brought down like that it’s disappointing. He’s a fantastic footballer, he really is. He’s a phenomenal player. He works so hard in training. You can see him listening to the manager every single day. You can see he’s improving every day as well</p>

  <p><b>[Wolves captain Conor Coady says VAR is ridiculous and confusing for players after his side lost 1-0 to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> on Sunday]</b> We feel massively hard done by. I can’t get my head around it. It is ridiculous. For me it is not working. Some people are saying it gets the right decision, but we’re the players on the pitch and it doesn’t feel right to me. Anthony Taylor is a great fella to speak to, but I ask a question and I don’t get an answer. We thought <b>[Virgil]</b> Van Dijk handballed it, but the referee tells me Van Dijk is too far away. He played the pass! VAR is affecting the game, you can hear the fans singing about it. No-one has asked us about it. It is still confusing, I can’t get my head around it, you don’t get answers on the pitch<br /><br /><b>[Wolves’ 3-2 win over <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> on Friday was also overshadowed by VAR reviews]</b> It is horrible for me, it is tough to take. A lot of people say it has come to the right decision but what is it, an armpit or a toe? It is so tough to take, it has happened twice to us in the last two games against probably the best two sides in the world. In the second half we controlled game and nullified <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to hardly anything but it is so disappointing that we are stood here talking about VAR rather than the the game and the way <a href="wolves-fc.html">Wolves</a> played</p>

  <p><b>[Wolves captain Conor Coady has lifted the lid on how team-mate <a href="adama-traore.html">Adama Traore</a> maintains his remarkable level of speed and strength]</b> He could’ve played NFL, he got offered when he was younger. He doesn’t do any gym on his arms or his upper body. It’s all power work on his legs to make him more powerful and explosive. He’s rapid, he’s some player. It’s credit to him, and how proud he can be of himself, he’s been fantastic for the team, you can see in his end product and the way he tracks back and defends properly and listens to the manager’s ideas and takes it on board. It’s credit to how hard he works, he’s one of the most hard-working players I’ve seen and it’s brilliant to have him at the club<br /><br /><a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> was good to me when I was young. I had a season training with the first team at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a>, and learning off them, that was big for me, but I always knew it was tough. I was always realistic, I was learning a lot off the first team, how to play and do things. I knew at some point I’d have to come away from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to really experience being a first-team player. It was the best decision I ever made, and <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> was great for that; he pushed that to send me on loan and try to improve my game. Even being on loan at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> (in 2013-14), I loved the season and it was a great club for me to go to, coming back I still knew it was going to be tough. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> were always getting better, they were always improving, and the players in my position were ridiculous, but I just wanted to play football. I knew where I was at, the type of level I was at, but I just wanted to be part of a first team, playing in games which meant something, playing against men</p>
