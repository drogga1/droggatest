My agent and my father have kept me away from the transfer issues and I am focused on playing football. I am in a great moment as the other day we qualified for the cup final and we are close to winning the double again. Coming to Croatia was the hardest decision in my life, but no one else offered me the sporting project that Dinamo did - both as a player and as a person. I think I made the right decision</p>

We’re doing well in the Champions League. There are two games left and we depend on ourselves to get through. There’s a lot of work to be done. The Champions League is a shop window for all young players, especially if you’re in a smaller league like Croatia<br /><br /><b>[On the speculation over a possible transfer back to Catalonia]</b> We will see what happens.

  <p><b>[Dinamo Zagreb attacking midfielder Dani Olmo has revealed that former club <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> have entered talks to bring the 21-year-old back to the Catalan club]</b> It makes me happy that the rumours have become a concrete proposal and that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> considered the possibility of bringing me back home. I spent six years at La Masia and they tought me life-long values.<br /><br />My goal is to go to the next European Championship and that will be difficult for me in the next six months if I only play in a minor competition like the one in Croatia. I want to take a step forward, not only to go to the European Championship but also to keep improving. It’s not that the club are putting me up for sale, I’m prepared to take a step forward in my career. As my own club even says, Croatia has become too small for me. If there is an agreement between both clubs then it is better to leave now, as soon as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Dani Olmo talks up <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> target]</b> I really like Peter Gulacsi, the goalkeeper, and the defence we have, Lukas Klosterman, <a href="dayot-upamecano.html">Dayot Upamecano</a> and Marcel Halstenberg. <a href="dayot-upamecano.html">Upamecano</a> is the future of France and the other two are Germany internationals. Then there are Christopher Nkunku and Patrik Schick, who have great quality, and <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a>, who is an aeroplane. In general, the whole team has youth, quality and self-confidence<br /><br /><a href="dayot-upamecano.html">Upamecano</a> is very good. With the ball he is very safe. I see him as a very complete centre-back. In one-on-one situations he is very powerful, very difficult to beat. He is very young, only 21 years old and is one of the best centre-backs. On the other hand, I already knew <a href="angelino.html">Angelino</a>. Our system suits him. It is the best for him because he is spectacular going forward and he is showing it. He is playing in everything and was very good against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> in the Champions League, getting an assist in that game</p>

But <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> was the team that bet the most. The sports director came to see me in Zagreb and the coach called me to convey his interest because he wanted me to be part of his staff. And that was very important to me. The project they offered me was not given to me by any other team. This is how I felt and I was determined that it was the best option. I am clear about the path I want to travel and what I have to do to achieve it.<br /><br /><b>[Olmo added on how close he came to going back to <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> They <b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>]</b> spoke to my agents in November as if they wanted to make the transfer very quickly, but then everything was postponed for one reason or another. And then near the end of January, when they asked me to wait to see, it was already almost done with Leipzig. At that time, I had already signed up. Because I wanted to go to a team that had a project now and in the future for me. Leipzig offered it to me and other teams did not. I went to the team that insisted the most and showed the most that they wanted me</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a>’s Dani Olmo thinks Liverpool-linked <a href="timo-werner.html">Timo Werner</a> should remain with the club]</b> He gives you a lot of options because he loves to move all over the pitch. He’s not a target man or a static striker, he likes to drift to the wings or drop into midfield to receive the ball and break the defensive line. He’s so fast and he has the killer instinct - he’s scored a lot this season. He’s a player that gives you a lot of opportunities in the way that he plays. I think the place that he fits best is Leipzig and the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. He’s doing pretty well where he is<br /><br />I love that player. I first met him in the Euro Under-21 semi-final and I realised he’s a strong, fast and aggressive player, very hard to beat, and he’s young like me - we were both born in 1998. He isn’t just a player for the future, but also for the present</p>

  <p><b>[Dani Olmo has explained his decision to join <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> from Dinamo Zagreb]</b> Maybe this is not a question to me. It didn’t happen and I am not sure if it was a real option. There were a lot of things published in the press but I was happy in Croatia. I knew sooner or later the moment of leaving would arrive, as happened. Leipzig was one of the clubs which showed more interest in me. That’s why we decided to move here<br /><br />I said it in the past. It would be beautiful to play in your home country’s championship. <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> is one of the best championships in the world, very competitive. So why not? Yes, I would like to play in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> one day<br /><br />I choose Leipzig for the project and for how they take care of the talent. If you watch over the roster you can check we are a very young team, with players with great projection but always ready for fighting for the highest goals. This season we have seen it both in <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> and Champions League. We are a young team which aspires to everything. I think if we keep working hard we could even fight for the championship</p>
