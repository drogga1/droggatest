  <p><b>[Joao Cancelo claims everybody at Juventus wants to be like Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Everybody at Juventus looks at Cristiano Ronaldo as a great example. Everybody wants to be like him, even the more experienced players like Chiellini. He is an incredible player, he works a lot and he is an example for us all. He is humble and a hard worker.<br /><br />Benfica? I am at one of the best clubs in the world but I miss the 60,000 fans of the Estadio Da Luz.</p>

  <p><b>[Juventus full-back Joao Cancelo believes that 35-year-old Dani Alves remains the best right-back in the world]</b> Dani Alves, in my personal opinion, is the best right back in the world.<br /><br />Today, I am a more complete player and I want to continue improving in order to become the best. Valencia are a great team and it’s surely going to be a special game for me. I spent three great years at the Mestalla but now I play for Juve and we absolutely want to get the three points tomorrow. I’ve learnt a lot playing in Italy as I did in Spain<br /><br /><b>[On falling to a 2-1 defeat]</b> The game against Manchester United was a strange one. We had most of the chances and controlled the match but still ended up losing. We deserved to win but football is like this sometimes</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Cancelo has hit out at UEFA for not using a video assistant referee during Euro 2020]</b> The referee has affected the outcome of the game. With the technology that we have today, I believe it is the referee’s and UEFA’s incompetence not to have VAR in the qualifying stage for the European Championship. Of course we all made individual mistakes, but I think we were clearly superior. Serbia just stayed back.<br /><br />There is a lot to play for. Ukraine and Serbia are big teams but I think Portugal have the quality to win in both Ukraine and Serbia</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Cancelo says that Cristiano Ronaldo’s hard work and dedication set him apart from the rest]</b> That is Cristiano: hard work, dedication, talent. All that is what makes him one of the best footballers ever. It’s not a mistake that he has won the Ballon d’Or five times. It’s due to all the work, all his dedication, his commitment and all the sacrifices he made. He really is a great athlete, a true professional and I think that for us younger players it’s a blessing to be able to learn from him<br /><br /><b>[if there was one player that surprised him, it was Miralem Pjanic, who impressed Cancelo with his ability to control the midfield]</b> Pjanic because he’s a a very intelligent player, he knows what to do even before he gets the ball and he really surprised me. He really is a great player<br /><br />I’ve improved myself as a player, in many ways, because I think that training with the best, automatically, you can’t help but get better. Training with players like Douglas <b>[Costa]</b>, <b>[Paulo]</b> Dybala, Ronaldo, Alex Sandro… but also the others like <b>[Leonardo]</b> Bonucci and <b>[Giorgio]</b> Chiellini, who helped me improve the defensive side of my game. My main personal objective now is to continue to grow and become one of the best</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Cancelo has called a recent Instagram controversy fake news after appearing to like a comment criticising Juventus boss <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Massimiliano Allegri</a>]</b> Honestly I heard about that today, but clearly it wasn’t me who did it. As it would make absolutely no sense for me to do something like that. <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a> is one of the best coaches in the world, I’ve always spoken well about him and his qualities. He’s a coach who’s won a lot, both at Juventus and at Milan. There would be no reason for me to like a negative post about him. That is all fake news, from people who try to put a wrench in my relationship with the coach, which makes absolutely no sense. I have a lot of respect for Mister <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a>, he’s one of the best in the world, a great person and I would not have been the player I am now without him..<br /><br />Winning the Scudetto is a wonderful feeling. I think it’s the result of all the work the team and the staff put in during the year, all working together in order to achieve all our goals. We had four objectives at the start of the season, unfortunately we couldn’t achieve two of them, But we met our other two goals. At Juventus the most important thing is winning, and like every season, we will try again next year. I’ve learned a lot this year, I went through many positive moments, with fantastic people and friends. I want to stay here, I hope my future is at Juventus, where I hope to win many different trophies</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Cancelo pointed to Dani Alves as his footballing idol]</b> Without a doubt my reference point is Dani Alves. I’ve been an admirer of his ever since I started playing football. I’ve been following him since he played for Sevilla. He’s written a piece of football history and I think that once he retires he will be regarded as a legend.<br /><br /><b>[His time with Inter proved to be a springboard towards a permanent move to Juventus]</b> When I first came to Italy it was a radical change for me, as I was coming from Spain, where people favour technique more, while here in Italy the most important thing is the tactical element. At that time Luciano Spalletti helped me out a lot, especially when it came to the defensive side of my game. I thank him a lot for what he did for me, those months at Inter were very important for me. That allowed me to come to Juventus, which has always been the best club in Italy. I’m here with Mister <a href="massimiliano-allegri.html">Allegri</a>, one of the best in the world, a fantastic person from whom I still have so much left to learn</p>

I love his style of play, his character - he’s very detail-orientated. That’s why I’m here today<br /><br />It’s a high price for a right-back but the responsibility is good for me as it will push me to be a better player and to mature to be a better player than I was when I joined. I’m aware how Kyle is one of the best full-backs. But I always love challenges, bringing myself to the limit. I’m going to compete with him and I’ll try to get my place. It will be up to the manager to choose one or the other, but I promise I will try to work hard and compete as best as I can. As a player I like new challenges; I was aware of the competition I would find here. Walker is a great player but the more competition you have the better you become as a player. I have a dream to be the best in my position and the only way to do that is by challenging yourself. Only by playing with the best can you do that<br /><br /><b>[Someone Cancelo places in that bracket is <a href="bernardo-silva.html">Bernardo Silva</a>]</b> I’ve talked with Bernardo Siva several times before and he’s said this is an amazing place to be. Bernardo is a great player. We have a great relationship. For me, he is one of the best players in the world. It’s a pleasure to play with him. The style of play of <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> is very good. I feel it is an ideal place for me to develop</p>

As I said, I don’t know what will happen in a few weeks, and in the summer we will discuss. If a player wants to leave, it’s simple. The agent has to call to the club, arrive at an agreement, and he will leave - and if he doesn’t get an agreement, he will stay here</p>
