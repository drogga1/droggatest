<p>: 2019 08 01
Manchester City have reopened negotiations with Juventus over a transfer for right-back Joao Cancelo.</p>

<p>: 2019 08 05
The completion of a swap deal involving Manchester City’s Danilo and Juventus’s Joao Cancelo has edged ever closer as the Brazilian has now agreed personal terms with the Italian champions. The former Real Madrid full-back will earn a basic salary of €4 million (£3.7m/$4.5m) per year, plus additional bonuses if certain sporting criteria are met</p>

  <p><b>[Pep Guardiola’s new Dani Alves: Man City signing a rough diamond in Joao Cancelo]</b> Without a doubt my reference point is Dani Alves. I’ve been an admirer of his ever since I started playing football. I’ve been following him since he played for Sevilla.<br /><br />When I first came to Italy, it was a radical change for me, as I was coming from Spain, where people favour technique more, while here in Italy the most important thing is the tactical element. At that time, Luciano Spalletti helped me out a lot, especially when it came to the defensive side of my game. I thank him a lot for what he did for me, as those months at Inter were very important for me</p>

  <p><b>[Man City and Juventus confirm Cancelo-Danilo swap in €65m deal]</b> City are a fantastic club, with a brilliant manager and I am delighted to be here. Everything about them has impressed me, from the facilities, to their style of play. I am always looking to develop my game and win trophies and I believe I can do that here, so now I’m really looking forward to the new season and testing myself in the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Cancelo cited Pep Guardiola as a key factor in his decision to join Manchester City, where he is ready to battle with Kyle Walker for the right-back slot]</b> Obviously, Pep Guardiola was a big reason for me to join Manchester City. I’ve always admired him and the way his teams play since he started at Barcelona. It’s not by chance that Manchester City have won the last two Premier Leagues and all the domestic trophies in England last season. I love his style of play, his character - he’s very detail-orientated. That’s why I’m here today<br /><br />It’s a high price for a right-back but the responsibility is good for me as it will push me to be a better player and to mature to be a better player than I was when I joined. I’m aware how Kyle is one of the best full-backs. But I always love challenges, bringing myself to the limit. I’m going to compete with him and I’ll try to get my place. It will be up to the manager to choose one or the other, but I promise I will try to work hard and compete as best as I can. As a player I like new challenges; I was aware of the competition I would find here. Walker is a great player but the more competition you have the better you become as a player. I have a dream to be the best in my position and the only way to do that is by challenging yourself. Only by playing with the best can you do that<br /><br /><b>[Someone Cancelo places in that bracket is Bernardo Silva]</b> I’ve talked with Bernardo Siva several times before and he’s said this is an amazing place to be. Bernardo is a great player. We have a great relationship. For me, he is one of the best players in the world. It’s a pleasure to play with him. The style of play of Manchester City is very good. I feel it is an ideal place for me to develop</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Cancelo believes he brings different qualities to the <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> squad than those offered by right-back rival Kyle Walker]</b> I’m a full-back who is more offensive than defensive, but I’m aware that the defensive side is also important. That is also why I came here, to learn. I played in <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a>, <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and I wanted to test myself in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. I think I’m in the best club to do so. <a href="kyle-walker.html">Kyle Walker</a> is a great player, very fast, very strong physically. I think we have different skills and I think that can help us in the months ahead<br /><br />I joined <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> because we have a lot of quality, there are great players here, it’s a young squad, and I think it has all the conditions I need to develop along with the team, with the manager and to build a bright future. Of course, the presence of the manager was a big reason for me to join City. I have followed <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a>’s career since his time at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>. I like the way his teams play and his style of football. I felt curious to play under his tutelage. In my first week here, I could already feel why he is such a great and successful manager. I hope we can win many things together.</p>

  <p><b>[Joao Cancelo could be the latest full-back on his way out of Manchester City]</b> This player we bought him for many years, not for six months, but what happens happens. As I said, I don’t know what will happen in a few weeks, and in the summer we will discuss. If a player wants to leave, it’s simple. The agent has to call to the club, arrive at an agreement, and he will leave - and if he doesn’t get an agreement, he will stay here</p>
