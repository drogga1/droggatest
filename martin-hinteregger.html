  <p><b>[Eintracht Frankfurt’s Martin Hinteregger flying high as a helicopter pilot]</b> I don’t just see it as a hobby. My goal is maybe after my career to be a rescue pilot or working for the police. Maybe also offer sightseeing flights. After a lot of deliberation, that could do me pretty well. There is still time until then and it remains a hobby for the time being. I enjoy having the privilege to fly a helicopter<br /><br />I may have some unusual characteristics. Not bad or good, but funny maybe. I often go out in a hunting jacket and this strange hat. And when I’m next to Kevin Trapp or <a href="timothy-chandler.html">Timothy Chandler</a>, who are always well dressed, I look out of place. But I don’t mind. My team-mates get used to it. And if I did go out in Gucci or Louis Vuitton, or whatever the name would be <b>[…]</b> I would feel uncomfortable<br /><br />There were phases when I had a month maybe and slept for an hour or two a day. It could not go on like that. I was not too cowardly to ask for help with this. Talking to a psychologist was good for me. Now I sleep normally again<br /><br />Our season is undulating, we have great victories like against <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a>, Leverkusen, Leipzig or <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and then have very weak performances. We are probably a surprise bag. Everyone in Frankfurt dreams of the Champions League, we have high goals ourselves. In any case, we want to be at the top in the next few years. Winning the title with Frankfurt would be very special</p>
