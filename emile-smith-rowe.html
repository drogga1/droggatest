  <p><b>[Emile Smith Rowe might not have grabbed the headlines like some of his England Under-17 team-mates when they became world champions in 2017, but if his start to life in the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> first team is anything to go by then the Gunners could have a true star on their hands]</b> When I was kid I looked up to <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <b>[Andries]</b> <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>. Watching them play for <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> inspired me so much. The link-ups they had and the goals they scored and created were amazing<br /><br /><b>[when pressed on which player he aspires to replicate]</b> Someone I inspire to play like is probably Kevin De Bruyne because of the way he plays. I learn so much from the entire coaching staff and players every day. The training sessions are so intense which is really good for me to learn every day. I need to stay focused every day, keep learning and keep taking on what all the coaches are telling me. I’m obviously in a privileged position to most people but for me it’s about staying focused and getting the right advice from my family and the people around me<br /><br /><b>[his previous outing against Qarabag in the Europa League marking the occasion of his first senior goal]</b> It felt great. I was very happy and it was a dream come true for me, something I’ve dreamt of since I was a kid. It was such a proud moment for me and my family<br /><br /><b>[Family is a common theme whenever Smith Rowe speaks]</b> I think it’s very important <b>[to have my family and agent around me]</b>. Especially when I talk to my family and agent every day. Even the little things they do for me are really important but the main thing is to stay focused and keep my feet on the ground<br /><br /><b>[The next step for Smith Rowe is, of course, breaking into the Gunners’ <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> squad on a regular basis]</b> I’m keen to get as many minutes as I can. With these opportunities I think it can be good for me to gain experience and if I do perform well hopefully I can progress into more important games</p>

  <p><b>[Emile Smith Rowe admits to having shunned interest from <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in the past as <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are ‘the right club’ for him and his ongoing development]</b> I used to watch that <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> team, <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a>, <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a>, <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, when they were in their prime. So when I found out that they were interested of course I was very happy, but I can’t explain to you how much I feel that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is the right club for me<br /><br /><b>[He is determined to follow <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> into the senior England squad, but is aware that he needs to earn a <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> debut first]</b> That’s my main goal at the moment. Just getting that first appearance behind me and hopefully going on from there and starting games<br /><br /><b>[When asked which of those players he looks to for inspiration]</b> It’s hard to pick anyone out now because they are all helping me, but it’s good speaking to Hector <b>[Bellerin]</b> and Alex <b>[Iwobi]</b> because they have been through it, they have been in my position. They just tell me to be confident. They say, ‘You’re obviously here for a reason, so be brave. When you make mistakes, don’t worry about it because you will get another chance’</p>

  <p><b>[Smith Rowe eyeing <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a>’s No.10 role as he seeks to join <a href="gabriel-martinelli.html">Martinelli</a> &amp; Saka in <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> side]</b> I like to be versatile and I can also play in other positions. But I probably would say I do enjoy playing in the No. 10 position the most. At <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I look up to <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> a lot. I watch him in training and the movement he has and the little touches he does. For me to train with him every day, I can’t think of anything better<br /><br />My dream was always to play for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I used to watch <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> a lot. <a href="dennis-bergkamp.html">Dennis Bergkamp</a> was definitely a player I always looked up to. We play in a similar position. <a href="freddie-ljungberg.html">Freddie Ljungberg</a> was there and he is working at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> now, helping all the young players. In that era when <b>[Lionel]</b> <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, <b>[Andres]</b> <a href="andres-iniesta.html">Iniesta</a> and <a href="xavi-hernandez.html">Xavi</a> were in the <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> team, I used to watch almost every game with my dad. Since <a href="kevin-de-bruyne.html">Kevin de Bruyne</a> joined <b>[Manchester]</b> City, I like to base my game around him. I look up to him so much. I just like the way he plays and everything he does. I am obviously happy for all the other boys but I definitely want to go back and play as well. I think it will be great if more young players play.<br /><br /><b>[On his immediate future]</b> Nothing has been confirmed yet. The main thing is to finish the season with <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> as strong and as well as I can and then go back to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> in pre-season and we will see what happens</p>
