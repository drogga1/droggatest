  <p><b>[Victor Astafei has big shoes to fill coming into Selangor as a replacement for Andik Vermansah]</b> I don’t have any personal targets. Every match that I play, I want to help the team. If you’re a good player working hard and helping the team, the goals will come. Every goal that I score is a bonus<br /><br />This isn’t the first time that I’ve scored on my debut but it was still a very proud and happy moment to have been able to do it with Selangor as well<br /><br />I was happy to have scored but at the same time it was only a draw and not a win, so it was ultimately disappointing result. However this is only the beginning of the season and we still have time to improve from game to game. I’m sure that we will be better as a team because Selangor have good players</p>

  <p><b>[Selfless Astafei only wants what’s good for the Red Giants]</b> I’ve played for many years, teams change and bring on new players all the time, players come and go.<br /><br />I think those who have seen me <b>[play]</b> and understand football, would know my qualities; how I can help, and that I am a team player. Before I joined Selangor, I told them I don’t act like a star, I don’t play like a star, I don’t want to be a star. I want to help the team<br /><br />Maybe it’s a good thing for me, motivating me in the last two games <b>[before the transfer window]</b>. It’s a good thing for Selangor, not for me… In the long term Selangor need to win, not me or Andik Vermansyah</p>
