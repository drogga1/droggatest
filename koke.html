  <p><b>[Atleti captain Koke was full of praise for his former team-mate <a href="filipe-luis.html">Filipe Luis</a> as he thanked him for the success he has helped deliver]</b> I want to thank you for everything you’ve done for Atleti. You’ve been one of the world’s best left-backs, and of Atlético de Madrid’s history. I’m going to miss you greatly</p>

He gave two assists, scored and hopefully continues at this level. The boy is excited and you don’t have to put pressure on him. Let him listen to his team-mates and the coach</p>

  <p><b>[Koke is confident <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> has the character to handle his €126 million price tag but urged fans not to get on his back if he does have a couple of bad games]</b> He has a lot of personality.

If he plays two bad games, you can’t kill him<br /><br /><b>[Koke, who has been at the club since he was six years old, enjoys the Portugese youngster’s creativity]</b> He enjoys playing football. He has a lot of quality, but what I like most is the mischief <b>[he creates]</b>, the dribbling. He likes to have the ball; he is not afraid to ask for it<br /><br /><b>[Among them are full-backs <a href="kieran-trippier.html">Kieran Trippier</a> and Renan Lodi, who face a steep learning curve as they come to grips with <a href="diego-simeone.html">Simeone</a>’s disciplined defensive structure]</b> That is no problem because the coach will instil it.

  <p><b>[Koke fuming as <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> fall to <a href="juventus.html">Juventus</a>]</b> We are very angry, the team has given everything, we have created chances, but we have not had the fortune to win. They have not dominated us, in the last play of the first half they score a goal. The team has tried everything, we had the ball, we attacked well…we just need to put it in.<br /><br />Many times we are criticised for playing badly and winning, now we play well and we don’t win. The results are going to come, we are creating chances, in the opposite area we have to be more decisive. Granada on Saturday <b>[a 1-1 <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> draw]</b> there was nothing to reproach and today neither</p>

To win you have to score goals. The team defends well, gives everything, but we need to be more precise to all, the strikers, the midfielders, the defenders</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> captain Koke said <a href="joao-felix.html">Joao Felix</a> can fulfil his enormous potential]</b> Everyone can see what is expected of Joao, he’s a young boy and he has lots of room for improvement. Many great players have had to adapt to Atletico and it’s not easy, he’s young. If he listens to the boss and his team-mates, he will be the player that everyone wants to see. He’s not been lucky with injuries, but I’m sure that, in the future, we’ll see the Joao we want to see</p>

We go to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> with confidence, as there is a place in the last eight at stake. They are a great team, and it will be very difficult. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are going to be champions in England, and of course I would like Atletico to be at that level. We have to learn lessons from the defeat in <a href="juventus.html">Turin</a> last year, as it will take a great effort to go through</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> captain Koke has urged his team to hit the ground running when the <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> season resumes]</b> We are preparing at home trying not to lose too much intensity, or too much strength. What we will lose the most is the work with the ball. When we start individual training and then with the rest of the group we will be taking it little by little. It is a mini-season after we’ve come from competing at the highest level in <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. We have to prepare in the best way and not think that it is a pre-season. This has been a break to start strong for the remainder of the season<br /><br />It seems that we are going to play without an audience. Playing at home without our people is going to be odd because they are always supportive, especially in the most difficult moments. Hopefully it will be as short <b>[a time]</b> as possible <b>[without them]</b> and wherever they are, we will feel your support</p>

  <p><b>[Koke fears for <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>’s Champions League hopes after record 13th Liga draw]</b> I believe it was a very strength-based game. It was a tough situation to be in. We didn’t take our chances. We have to suffer and accept the draw. We want to be in the Champions League and we need to get hold of the points. It’s difficult from this position that we’re in. They were better placed than us all over the pitch. We managed to change things after the first goal and a couple of minutes after found the equaliser. Santi had the chance at the end to get us the win.</p>
