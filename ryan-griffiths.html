  <p><b>[Western Sydney Wanderers have signed Australian striker Ryan Griffiths for the rest of the season]</b> It’s definitely exciting times and I was very excited to come here when <b>[coach]</b> Tony <b>[Popovic]</b> called me and asked if I was available and he was really enthusiastic to get me back. That was something that showed me a lot of respect. I’ve heard a lot of good things about him as a coach. I wanted to join the squad and come back and do well for Western Sydney in the ACL and the league and give 100 per cent that’s for sure</p>

  <p><b>[New Western Sydney Wanderers striker Ryan Griffiths says fans shouldn’t be worried about his age]</b> Definitely there will be goals there. It’s one thing I love to do, that’s why I play. I’ll do my best to help whether I score or someone else, it doesn’t bother me as long as we can get some results and get back into the top six.<br /><br />A lot of people do criticise older players but also a lot of people criticise players and they haven’t seen what they have done recently or where they have played or researched the player. People are quick to jump on anything. I guess they can only judge by looking at me on the field. I’m in good nick, I feel good and there was definitely offers there still in Asia. But it was nice to get an opportunity to come back home and play for one of the biggest clubs in Australia. My plan is to play until I feel I can’t anymore. Everyone says ‘you’re 35’ but you see a lot of players play until they’re 40 and recently a player play until he was 50. If you keep yourself in good shape, it shouldn’t be a problem … I just have to use my experience and be smart. I’m going to run 100 per cent in every challenge until I fall over and they have to drag me off the pitch<br /><br />I have played in the ACL before and I guess that’s one of the reasons Tony wanted me back here to help some of the younger lads. To express my experience and show them the ropes of the ACL. It’s exciting to play in the ACL again … obviously Western Sydney have had some amazing success there and I’d like to be a part of that again</p>

  <p><b>[From being pelted with bottles to smashed windows on the team bus, Western Sydney Wanderers striker Ryan Griffiths has experienced it all when it comes to local derbies abroad]</b> I’ve played in the Bucharest derbies and they are very intense. If you lose that you get bottles thrown at you and if you win that you get even more bottles thrown at you from the other team so it’s impossible. I also experienced the derby in China as well when had to stay in stadium for four hours after full-time. I think we left the stadium at 3am. And even when we left the stadium, the bus got pellets thrown and smashed windows, some of the boys got cut and blood all over them. So I’ve been involved in some pretty fierce rivalries<br /><br />It’s a spectacle. It’s fantastic for Australian sport and for football and shows how far the A-League has come to get over 50,000 for a Sydney derby. It’s fantastic and something when I was a youngster I couldn’t comprehend that that would happen <b>[in the future]</b>. I’m excited to be a part of that.<br /><br />It’s a massive game. Wanderers fans are saying to me it doesn’t matter if you lose against Central Coast as long as you win the derby. There’s a lot of pride on the line … hopefully we can make Sydney red and black<br /><br />I’m not superstitious in that way but sometimes it gets in the mind that you can’t win at a place. You have to overcome the obstacles and mind games where everyone says ‘you can’t win at Homebush’. Hopefully we can overcome that and put in a really good performance on Saturday</p>
