  <p><b>[Referee Webb says <a href="fabrice-muamba.html">Muamba</a>’s collapse left lasting impact on him]</b> I turned and saw <a href="fabrice-muamba.html">Fabrice Muamba</a> lying face down on the floor with no-one else nearby - this was clearly a major concern and clearly something more than a normal injury. The fact that he wasn’t rolling around screaming in agony, the way he went down with no contact, meant immediately it was serious. And it was not only me - the players recognised it. You see William Gallas’ reaction - an opposing player - immediately waving to the bench to come on. If the game had not been stopped within 20 or 30 seconds, that might have made a difference to his chances of recovery. One of our obligations as a referee is to try and observe fair play and keep the game flowing when we can. But, if players cry wolf too many times, then there is a possibility that maybe we will not react in the way we need to do based on what we saw there. If we come under criticism for stopping the games too many times for doctors or physios to enter the field of play then referees might be inclined not to stop the game. I’m not saying it’s a particularly big problem but I have seen games stopped where players weren’t as seriously injured as they would have you believe and that is an issue when you are dealing with something as serious as this<br /><br /><b>[Webb said like many of those at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">White Hart Lane</a>, the incident had had a profound effect on him]</b> The sensation I got was that the crowd was pushing with <b>[Bolton doctor]</b> Jonathan Tobin and his colleagues to get <a href="fabrice-muamba.html">Fabrice Muamba</a>’s heart going. It was amazing, absolutely astonishing. It was just the most unbelievable crowd reaction I have ever experienced in football and thinking about it now makes me feel emotional. It just puts things into perspective. The game is important, the result is important and it does affect people’s livelihoods, we are reminded of that on a regular basis - but without life there is no football at all<br /><br /><b>[Webb said he had had little hope initially that <a href="fabrice-muamba.html">Muamba</a> would pull through]</b> There was a numb sensation about what you’d witnessed, what you’ve seen. There was a numb sensation about what you’d witnessed, what you’ve seen. No news was good news as I was going back up the motorway, toward to the north of England, back home. I was listening to the bulletins. The next morning, still no news and we thought ‘Wow, this is maybe a good sign’. That he has made the recovery he has now is an unbelievable miracle.</p>

  <p><b>[Retired referee Howard Webb has been hired to oversee development, assessment, and assignment of Video Assistant Referees in Major League Soccer]</b> I’m delighted to join the Professional Referee Organization for this new challenge and contribute to the implementation of what I view as a crucial development for the sport. I have tremendous respect for the Organization that Peter Walton has created and am excited to be on board for the continued development of this initiative</p>

  <p><b>[How does VAR work? A guide to video review in MLS]</b> Because of the subjectivity of the sport, it’s important that people know we’re not going to deal with the 50-50 calls or 70-30 calls. And we’re not asking the VAR to ask himself or herself the question, ‘Was the decision right?’ They’re going to ask the question, ‘Was the decision clearly wrong?’ The default position is that the on-field decision is correct unless we have evidence to the contrary in the video.<br /><br />Players must remember that they have to play to the whistle and not the flag<br /><br />We continuously check all of these situations. Just because you don’t see anything on the field doesn’t mean things aren’t being checked<br /><br />It’s not going to change the way the game is played. If it does that, then it’s not doing the job that it’s meant to do. The game is beautiful, we love it for what it is - it’s fast flowing, it has ebb and tempo, and it’s not a series of set pieces. Yes, it does take a bit more time with video review. But we feel it’s a price worth paying to get to a decision that’s not a clear error.<br /><br />Will the assistants be more tempted to keep the flag down <b>[on offside decisions]</b> because they know they’ve got the safety net of VAR? Well we’re saying to them, ‘Don’t do that. If you’ve got doubt, give the benefit of the doubt to the attack, but don’t change the basic way the game is being officiated from your side’.<br /><br />We’ll make some mistakes, there will be some bumps in the road, we’ll miss some things that are clear and obvious. But we’re hoping that the big bulk situations are ones where the referee says, ‘Thank goodness we’ve got VAR</p>

  <p><b>[What is VAR?]</b> We’ve been satisfied with the way it’s gone. We always knew that it was a big undertaking for any competition that decides to implement VAR. It’s a big thing to implement, and a lot of work goes into both training our people and preparing our stadiums. Me personally, I’ve been really impressed by the way that’s been put together by MLS.</p>

  <p><b>[Howard Webb says We don’t expect VAR perfection, but we aim for it]</b> There’s no doubt, though, that the existence of VAR gives officials confidence. because when they will make the decision, they will know it’s going to be checked by a colleague who’s highly trained and an intervention will come if, in the opinion of that highly trained individual, it’s clear error has been made. So we don’t expect perfection, but we aim for it. We find we’re getting better each time and more efficient each year. But I would caution people never to expect they’ll agree with every single outcome every time because we’re still dealing with human beings and I think in some ways people don’t don’t actually mind that<br /><br /><b>[<a href="mls.html">MLS</a> Vice President of Competition Jeff Agoos]</b> and I both sit on the <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> working group around innovation in video review, so we’re keeping a close eye on how the auto offside tracking, for example, develops. If it’s something that is proved to be accurate and can deliver messaging to the officials in an efficient way, a quick way, then we’d certainly look to try it out in our competition<br /><br />They’re not quite there yet in terms of the automatic body part tracking on offside. Undoubtedly it’s something that I think they will get to, and it will assist us in delivering precise offside determinations. The key for me though is how quickly that is communicated to the on-field officials because offside is also is only one part of the equation. Being in an offside position is not in itself an offense; there has to be something done by the player in the offside position to be penalised. That’s where you need the human element as well. So, something that could tell the officials that a player is in an offside position is useful, that’s the starting point, then the outfield officials can make a judgment as to where that person needs to be penalised<br /><br />What we’ve learned over our VAR journey is that,at the end of the day, a human being is utilising the system as a VAR, and he’s making a judgment based on their professional experience and expertise as to whether or not to intervene<br /><br />I remember, going back to 2017, when I presented a town hall session and people were saying ‘VAR will stop all controversies and stop talking points!’, when you would never do that. What you could do though is reduce the number of clear errors that will impact our game or situations where we miss something that’s significant. And there’s no doubt in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> over the three seasons now that we’ve used it, it’s had a net positive on the game. We’re seeing lots and lots of really good interventions that are helping the game but there will always be subjectivity and a lot of our training is based around that, around identifying consistently what isn’t clear and obvious from an outfield point of view</p>
