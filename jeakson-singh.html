  <p><b>[Jeakson Singh - India U17 team’s Manipuri midfield destroyer who croons in Punjabi]</b> Since my father was a coach himself, he acquainted me with the basics of football through his training. I started practising with my father at seven years of age and four years later I headed to Chandigarh Football Academy <b>[CFA]</b>.<br /><br />Amarjit Kiyam and I are cousin brothers. When I started playing, he too did after 3-4 months following my start. We are both from the same district named Thoubal in Manipur. Amarjit is my paternal cousin - his mother is the cousin of my father. We used to stay nearby and were also in the same school as kids. We also joined CFA together<br /><br />I learnt a lot of Punjabi in my five years at Chandigarh as I was surrounded by Punjabis all around. So eventually I picked up the language too. It’s not just me, even Amarjit and Sanjeev <b>[Stalin]</b> can speak Punjabi, too. We converse in Punjabi here. I also enjoy Punjabi music, particularly the mellow or romantic tracks and I can sing in Hindi too<br /><br />At CFA, I trained for at least five years and later left for Minerva Punjab as they were contesting in the U-16 I-League unlike CFA. I thought I had a better chance of being scouted for the U17 World Cup at Minerva Punjab rather than at CFA<br /><br />Amarjit Kiyam and Sanjeev Stalin were already selected from CFA and I wasn’t selected then. I used to practice a lot but the competition among the kids at CFA had reduced as the number of kids had gone down<br /><br />When at Minerva Punjab, I met many people like Surinder sir <b>[Surinder Singh, former Minerva Punjab coach]</b>, Ranjit sir, <b>[Ranjit Bajaj, owner]</b> and others. They wanted me to eventually play for the senior team. I played in the U-16 I-League twice and won both times. So the club signed me for the senior side and made me play in the Durand Cup and DSK Cup which boosted my confidence. I played against Gangtok XI and Indian Navy in the Durand Cup. My game had improved a lot and finally, I made the shift to AIFF, joining the Indian U-17 team<br /><br />Luis Norton is a really good coach I believe. He does not only pick one player, he keeps an eye on all of the lads. He gifts a chance to each one to prove himself, too. I am very thankful to Abhishek sir for giving me this chance to join Indian side. I had high hopes but never thought that I would make it<br /><br />The confidence of the team depends on every individual’s level of belief in himself. I think that if we believe fully in ourselves and perform as a unit, we can achieve a lot while performing well. There will be lots of support from the home crowd everywhere so that will help us and motivate at the same time</p>

  <p><b>[Jonychand Singh - Jeakson’s brother - was part of India’s U-19 squad in the Asian Cup qualifiers]</b> When he started to play the age-group tournaments here, he used to score tons of goals. I am in Gangtok now, so can’t say what’s happening at our village, but it’s a big moment for the country.<br /><br />When I talked to him just before the first match, he sounded disappointed not to start but said that he would most likely play in the second game<br /><br />My father used to train both of them</p>

  <p><b>[Amanpreet Singh On Jeakson Singh]</b> His biggest strength is he commits very few mistakes with the ball. He has good technical abilities and a very good peripheral vision. Since he was a striker in childhood, he can also shoot and score with headers<br /><br />Even after he was rejected the first time, he never lost hope of making it to the final team. I would not compare him with my other students but I think they all have special qualities<br /><br />The coach must have had a plan but I couldn’t understand why he didn’t take Jeakson. He showed what he is worth. He has always been loyal to football and the reward has now arrived</p>

  <p><b>[Jeakson further impressed Luis Norton de Matos in Minerva’s 1-0 win over the India Under-17 team]</b> I am very thankful to Abhishek sir for giving me this chance to join the Indian side. I had high hopes but never thought that I would make it</p>

  <p><b>[Jeakson Singh - The Real Madrid fan who admires Sergio Busquets]</b> My ultimate aim is to represent Real Madrid. I’m very happy, it’s a great feeling. It’s not something life changing though. I spoke to my mother and she’s a bit disappointed that we didn’t get the result. We’re all prepared for what comes next. We won’t let the disappointment get in our way. We will give a tough fight. I saw Udanta <b>[Singh]</b> and Milan <b>[Singh]</b> and I dreamt of playing in the Indian national team. I want to dedicate this goal to my parents. My father can’t talk much after his brain stroke.<br /><br />The players were all very excited and happy about the goal. It’s sad we conceded soon after though<br /><br />I’ve learnt a lot from Matos especially about playing in the midfield. I won’t commit any mistakes. I also learnt a lot about how to be a better midfielder at Minerva<br /><br />Sergio Busquets is my favourite player</p>
