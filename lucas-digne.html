  <p><b>[Barcelona defender Lucas Digne has hailed the contribution of Lionel Messi]</b> Messi is like that: when you think you have seen it all, he surprises you. It was a fantastic goal at a fantastic time - it simply could not be any more important than that. Messi surprises me every day, and I am happy for the thought of one day telling my future children: ‘I played with Messi’. He is from another planet, and it is amazing that he has already scored more than 500 goals for Barcelona - and that’s not talking about all the assists that he has created for other players to score as well. It is truly incredible.<br /><br />The atmosphere in the changing room after the win at the Bernabeu was great, and everybody was happy for the result, but we all know that we have a lot of hard work to do from now until the end of the season. So, it was important to go out and win the next game after El Clasico as well. Now we will play five finals to win two trophies. We will play every league game like it is a cup final where only winning counts. We must win every game for sure, and we will do exactly that. It is a close race in the best league in the world, but we want to win the Spanish title again - like Barca have done so many times in recent years. And then of course we also have the real final in the Copa del Rey<br /><br />Our attacking game is amazing and by far the best in the world. Our fantastic number of goals proves that. In many games, we score goals for fun. But please note that we also have better defensive stats than the team we are in the title race with - I mean that we have both more clean sheets and fewer goals against us<br /><br />We dominate most matches so massively that as a defender you often play one on one with your opponent in their counter attacks, and that is a great challenge for every defender in the world, but we are Barcelona, so of course we can manage that. I am happy to have the confidence of my coach, Luis Enrique. For me it is a question of always working hard at training, keeping completely fit and ready to play - and to have the right mental balance, when my team needs me. And I felt that I showed that kind of performance against Osasuna. I also showed that I feel comfortable in a three-man defence - and not only in my normal position as a left-back<br /><br />I have always been in the match squad, and I have played 24 matches in my first season in Barcelona. I was only 22 when I signed last summer, and of course my stats of minutes on the pitch looked even better two months ago, but I know that I play for the biggest club in the world, so of course we all have to serve the team and play the role that our manager wants us to do. I do that with pleasure, and I believe that I will be part of a great Barca future</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona defender Lucas Digne has said that the Catalan club are doing everything to go through the Primera Division campaign undefeated]</b> We’ll do everything we can on the pitch to say thank you in his last games at the club. I have been asked so many times about playing with Lionel Messi, and everybody knows that he is from another planet when it comes to football. But I am also extremely proud to have played with Iniesta. For me he’s one of the greatest players of all time, and he is a true idol on and off the pitch. When I arrived in Barcelona, Iniesta was the first player to give me a call and say: ‘Welcome to the club.’ He is so classy.<br /><br /><b>[Only Levante and Real Sociedad stand in the way of Barca becoming La Liga’s first ever Invincible]</b> We want to be the ‘Invincibles’. That would be an amazing achievement in the strongest league in the world. Of course it’s a record that the team wants to go for. It’s important for us and we’ll give everything to achieve it. We have so much quality in the team and in the whole squad, and we have shown that consistency this season going unbeaten for so long. We’ve gone 43 matches unbeaten in La Liga since last season, and that record shows the hard work of the whole group<br /><br /><b>[Barcelona gave a show of strength in midweek as they thumped Villarreal 5-1]</b> I am not surprised that we played so well against Villarreal. Winning 5-1 with a super performance from the whole team just proves what we are made of. We play for titles and we have bagged them. But we don’t stop playing well and working hard because we also play for the pride of the club and of the culés, the supporters<br /><br />Winning the double is something exceptional. We have to remember that this is a fantastic season, even considering the extremely high standards of Barca. There has only been one negative: leaving the Champions League too early. But it is a cup competition where anything can happen and where just one single off-day or one small piece of bad luck can change white to black<br /><br />Sometimes I have to pinch myself: I am only 24 and the Copa del Rey a few weeks ago was my 11th club title, and now La Liga is number 12. All players love to win games and titles. I have been in Barcelona for two years now and it has been great. For sure I have progressed a lot since arriving as a 22-year-old. Playing with the greatest players in the world and in the best league gives you fantastic experience on the pitch. I feel that I have played well, when I have played. And that is all I can do. I had a great feeling that I had given a good performance after the Villarreal game.</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Digne has said goodbye to Barcelona and the club’s fans as he nears a move to Everton]</b> The last two years have been a childhood dream that I have been able to realise. I want to say thank you very much to all. First, to the club that has given me everything since I arrived. Thanks to all the physios, the staff I have worked with, the coaches, the security people, the kitchen staff and all who make sure the club is a family. The crowd that is always behind the team and that has given me a lot of warmth during the last two years. The city of Barcelona that will always stay with me for what I have lived and for the people who are always incredible. And finally my colleagues, who before being the best players in the world are amazing people who always help you. All this to say that Barca is more than a club, it is an incredible family. A very strong hug to you all and a lot of luck for the season</p>

  <p><b>[Everton have completed the signing of Lucas Digne from Barcelona for £22m]</b> Everton is a big club with a great history. I want to play games, win games and excite the fans with the quality of our football. I want to show my best football here and discover the best league in the world. Everybody loves the Premier League. I am loving the fact I am coming here. I am not afraid, I am excited. For me, it is a new challenge to discover a country, a league, people and a great club such as Everton. It is fabulous.</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Digne enjoyed his time working alongside Lionel Messi]</b> Training alongside great players has made me better - but, for me, Messi is the best in the world. Messi is pure talent. He sees everything before ­anybody else. You know what he wants to do, but you just can’t stop it. You close his left foot, he goes to the right. You close the right side, he goes with his left. We trained every day for two years and it was crazy. I also played against him twice for Roma against ­Barcelona. Let’s just say it was a hard game.<br /><br />Of course, Barca is the biggest club in the world - and everybody knows that. But I came to Everton because I felt there was a very good project here. I had such a good feeling about the club that I said to Barcelona, ‘Please let me leave to go to join Everton ­because it’s the best thing for me and my ­career’. In the beginning, they didn’t want to sell me. But when the coach Marco Silva called me I had such a good ­feeling. I knew I wanted to come Goodison Park. Now I am here, I want to win a lot of games and, if it’s possible, a trophy too<br /><br />I can tell you that I said ‘no’ to ­Liverpool twice - because it’s true. Everton fans have sent me a lot of messages on Twitter about it. It was a good start for me here, but I am only telling the truth. The first time Liverpool asked about me was when I was a young boy and I went to Paris from Lille. The second time was when I went to Barcelona</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Digne has revealed that he elected to leave Barcelona in the summer and join Everton]</b> I wasn’t really planning to leave Barca and they were not looking to sell me, but when I spoke to Everton manager Marco Silva on the phone I got this special feeling. He really lit a fire inside of me and I thought: ‘Wow! I really want to play for this club and manager’. Then I went to Barca and asked them to please let me go. After a few talks, they accepted, that this was my wish. I am thankful for that, because now I feel happy in Everton. Barca was my childhood dream, so yes, it was difficult to leave, because I could have stayed to continue a great life in the club and the city. The club wanted me to stay. But I am 25 years old now and in a phase of my career, where I want to play every week, have a bigger role in the team and feel the full confidence of the coach. So I could not turn down the Everton project. I was only 22 when I signed for Barca, and it was the perfect place to develop myself. In my two years at Camp Nou I played 46 games for what I consider the greatest club in the world, training every day with the very top players in the world, like Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, Neymar and so many more. Of course, I am a better player now. I enjoyed both seasons in Barca tremendously and chose to leave after a great season, winning the double in Spain, playing fantastic football, and for me personally developing as a player.<br /><br />Getting into the Premier League has been a pleasure. Football is great everywhere - and different. I’ve learned a lot and developed myself as a player and as a person from these different experiences in different countries. Both the Premiership and La Liga are top class, but the difference is the incredible intensity during the game. In the Premier League there are challenges all the time and it’s full speed ahead every week. The style of football gives me a lot of pleasure. It is very physical and box-to-box for 90 minutes, and I enjoy going forward and getting a lot of crosses into the box. It is also intense because of the supporters, not only in the home games but also away, where they are simply fantastic. They give you extra power on the pitch<br /><br />I feel fantastic with Everton and in English football. It has been a super start to life in the Premiership, and the everyday life in the club gives me an extraordinarily good feeling. For me it was great to join other French speaking guys like Kurt Zouma and Morgan Schneiderlin, who I know from Les Bleus - and Idrissa Gueye, who I knew for six or seven years in Lille. But in general, we have a great group of players both on and off the pitch<br /><br />The recent results show our progress. We have done well with four league wins and only one defeat - and our latest game was a 0-0 draw away against Chelsea. It was a tough game, but we fought well and got a deserved point and a great clean sheet in a difficult stadium. It is still early days for us as a team with many new players and a completely new style of football for the club with a new manager. But there is a great appetite for success, and the manager has an extremely good mentality and a great idea of football. I believe, that now every player understands what he wants. The manager and his staff have been working hard to implement the new style, and we as players have also been working hard both in training and in the matches. And that is why we are improving as a team and we are now getting good results. The next step is to believe in ourselves even more in the games against the biggest teams in the league because then the future will look bright for Everton. We are a club with huge traditions and a great history, and most of all we want to give our supporters something new to celebrate</p>

  <p><b>[Everton left-back Lucas Digne is looking forward to facing off against his old team-mate Mohamed Salah]</b> I know Mohamed Salah because I played one year with him in Rome. He’s a very good guy and a very good player, but you play football to play against the big players, against Messi, against Neymar. I play football to play against the biggest players in the world and I came to England to play against the best strikers because, for me, the best football is in the Premier League. When you play in the big games, it’s a very good thing for you as a player. I play every game the same. I’m a defender and it’s down to the team. We work together and it’s not down to one player or two players. It’s down to the team and we need to work together.<br /><br /><b>[The Toffees are winless in their last 17 Merseyside derbies, dating back to 2010]</b> The stats are here to change. Maybe you can lose for one year, two years or three years, and the fourth you win and the stat is finished. Football is like this and we need to change the past. We want to change and we want to win. Liverpool play well now, but we play well too. We have a good mentality too and we work hard every week. I think we can change something. We have the mentality to win every game. We went to Chelsea to win and proved we can win. We played well, we drew – it was a good result because Chelsea were unbeaten. Before we played against Man <b>[United]</b>, we played well before the referee made, for me, a mistake. It’s football. We play well against great teams and I think it’s big game this weekend and we do the same like always</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> free-kick king Lucas Digne relishes emerging from <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>’s shadow]</b> Taking a free kick is not some new skill that suddenly appeared out of the blue. I took free kicks when I was young, but the last time I scored one was with France Under-19 when we beat the Netherlands 6-0. I knew I could take free kicks well, I just didn’t have the chance with my previous clubs. At the elite level you know the hierarchy, and when you play in a team with absolute world-class players - legends, even - like <a href="zlatan-ibrahimovic.html">Zlatan</a> in <a href="psg.html">PSG</a>, <a href="francesco-totti.html">Totti</a> in at Roma and especially <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, then there is no way that you just walk up and take the ball out of their hands before a free kick. These guys are specialists with proven records, and you accept that in football. But, of course, I always hoped that one day it would be my turn - and now it is my turn to take free kicks at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. I enjoy that, and I love the responsibility - every free kick is a chance of making the fans happy! It’s a great job for me, and I’m especially happy if I score, just like I’m happy delivering assists for my team-mates when they score<br /><br /><b>[Digne, though, is not about to lose sight of his primary task on the field just because he has an additional offensive responsibility]</b> The attacking impact is a part of my job, but I am first and foremost a defender, and I have enjoyed every one of all our clean sheets in the last six months almost as much as a goal - and actually there has been many. A clean sheet is normally a defender’s variation of scoring a goal. It’s a feeling of success for both yourself and for your team. But of course it is a special feeling for me as a defender to be part of a match-winning goal - like <a href="richarlison.html">Richarlison</a>’s header from my cross against Wolves<br /><br /><b>[He also explained the unique excitement that each free kick situation brings]</b> The feelings around a direct free kick are very special because it doesn’t just happen out of nowhere within a fraction of a second, like when you score from open play. There is a build-up, when you prepare yourself for the free kick, you read the positions of the wall and the goalkeeper - then you hit the ball trying to find exactly the right amount of power and precision. And then the explosion inside your own head - and in the stadium - when you see it in the net. I did not take a single free kick in <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> for two years, playing 46 matches, before joining <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. Of course not, because <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is the world’s best at free-kicks - and left footed like me. So imagine how much I enjoyed netting my first one for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> against <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>!<br /><br /><b>[And just how much work does he put into honing the skill?]</b> I don’t practise free-kicks every day, but once or twice a week I do practise them with Gylfi Sigurdsson</p>

  <p><b>[Lucas Digne has said that he sees wearing the captain’s armband at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> as a special honour]</b> I must admit that it’s been a great honour for me wearing the captain’s armband for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. I’d only been at this club for a season when I was chosen for this, so it’s a great sign of confidence. Aside from my time with the France youth national team, I had never worn the armband, so it is special. Maybe it also shows that I’m now more mature as a player and a person. It’s a task I treat seriously - that’s for sure. We have a list of four club captains, and I was the fourth, so I thought that maybe it wouldn’t happen this season. But I also knew that it could happen, and now I have been lucky enough to get the job as captain for a few games. It makes me feel really proud - it’s a responsibility that I enjoy<br /><br /><b>[Digne has not set any specific targets personally or for the club, he says the aims for the campaign are quite straightforward]</b> The goals are simple in the club; we must do better than last season. As an individual, it’s the same thing for me. I study my statistics, the percentage of duels won, the number of successful crosses, key passes, aerial duels won - and I always want to improve every aspect of my game<br /><br /><b>[Such figures have helped justify the player’s decision to leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> for Merseyside little over 12 months ago]</b> When I chose to leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> in the summer of 2018, it was a difficult choice for me, but it was really important for me to come to a club where I would be able to develop myself playing every weekend - and I am enjoying that. In <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a>, I was probably seen as a defensive alternative to <a href="jordi-alba.html">Jordi Alba</a>, but in <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> I am expected to be very offensive. This again involves many duels in defence one against one because the matches are very open with a lot of end-to-end stuff. I enjoy this style of football a lot.<br /><br />In my second season with <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a>, I did not play enough in my own opinion, and even though it’s not bad playing 46 matches over two seasons for what in my opinion is the greatest club in the world, I had to look at myself in the mirror and make this decision to leave <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barca</a> in order to move to the next level personally. Now every week there is a new and challenging game in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and it makes you a better player. The key to handling this is to take care of yourself, to focus on training, when you are at Finch Farm, and on recovery, when you are home. Modern football in England is a 24/7 lifestyle, not a 9-to-5 job, and it involves every moment and aspect of your life, like food, sleep and generally good, healthy habits<br /><br /><b>[Further credence to Digne’s surge at <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> has been given by a recall to the national team]</b> I believe that the stability of playing every week for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has helped me to perform well for France. I am happy to play for my country and I feel proud that I have done so many times. To qualify for the Euros is a step on the way. We have a great group of players, and our ambitions with Les Bleus - a bit funny that both my teams are in blue - are obviously very big. When we enter a tournament, we want to win every game. But we know that the competition is great and other countries go into the Euros to win it. So it really is one step at a time</p>

He won three Champions Leagues, he has a lot of experience. He can give a lot of advice to the players, you can learn a lot from him. I think all the players listen very carefully to what he says. If you learn you can be better, and with him I think we can build something very good<br /><br /><b>[Digne thinks a return to Champions League football]</b> The next year, or in two years, I think we can fight for it. We are a young team, we need a little bit of time, but I think we can do something. If you want to do something good, you have to take your time, keep a lot of the same players, you need a good relationship between them, and if you have to buy players, make sure you do that right. I think the club are doing that, taking our time, but building something and in a few years, I think like what <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> did, why can’t we do that too? We have a lot of young players, with good quality. The club bought a lot a few years ago, the year with me, <a href="richarlison.html">Richarlison</a>, <a href="andre-gomes.html">Andre Gomes</a>, <a href="yerry-mina.html">Yerry Mina</a>, and sometimes you need a bit of stability and I think we can do something good.<br /><br />I needed to play, they said I could enjoy life in England because <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> will be perfect for me, the high intensity and the challenge, and I was thinking the same. After I chose to come to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, when I arrived for my first game against <a href="valencia-fc.html">Valencia</a>, the welcome was amazing. It’s different for the weather, but it’s a football city. You feel the football is everything here. That’s what I want, when you play for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>, you know you have a lot of fans behind you. We know our fans are so important for us when we play at home, for us against the opponent for sure, because they make a lot of noise. Maybe against <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a> we missed them, they push and they push and can intimidate the opponent. I feel good. I’m happy, I have a lot of responsibility, I’m happy the coach has given me this responsibility. I’m enjoying since I’ve arrived, I play every game, if we can finish in the Europa League it will be fantastic.<br /><br /><b>[<a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a>’s influence on Digne has been a demanding one]</b> He’s asked me to be more high, to go back in defence, I have to run a lot! But I love it. For me it’s perfect. I can play maybe a little bit more free, and this role is perfect for me. The intensity is very different, it’s very high in England, the challenges are very strong, you might see a striker make a challenge which you might not in France.</p>
