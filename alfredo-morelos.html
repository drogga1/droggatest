  <p><b>[Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos has revealed that he intends to head to the Premier League]</b> There are a lot of people watching me from other clubs, but now I have Rangers in my head. Rangers and the national team - I am focused on them. I’m only 22, maybe in five years who knows I might be with a much bigger team, hopefully in England because I am very ambitious. But I am very happy to work with Steven Gerrard. Day-to-day training is excellent. To have such a prominent figure, both for club and country - you have to take advantage of it. I have learned a lot from him and fortunately his feelings towards me have been positive and I am very happy with that. To get the call-up for my country was also very satisfying because I knew nothing about it. It’s made me very proud<br /><br />The truth is that I have had several red cards in my career, but I think that’s been more because of the bad refereeing decisions that altered my temperament. I know that the referees also make mistakes too. Sometimes they make the wrong decision to take a card out on me needlessly. But that’s the way football is and I’ve got to accept it. Yes, I am aggressive on the pitch, but it’s manageable. I have to remain calm and there are many positive aspects for me at the moment</p>

  <p><b>[Alfredo Morelos has been linked with the likes of Leicester and Borussia Dortmund]</b> There is a lot of speculation about my possible departure, but there is nothing concrete yet. I know what there are many interested clubs asking and as soon as there is something official I will be announcing it. But I’m committed to Rangers just now. I’ve had a good season and many clubs are interested and hopefully everything will be done in the right way.<br /><br />I dream of playing in a much better, more competitive league. I look at the English Premier League and the Spanish League. The leagues in France and Italy are very big leagues too and very competitive. But I am very happy with what has been a great season with Rangers. I’ve scored a lot of goals and on Sunday I hope to end the season with another goal and be the top scorer in Scotland.<br /><br />I am really happy with everything that we have accomplished this year with Rangers. For me, it was an incredible season. I’ve scored nearly 30 goals and I also got an award from my fellow players too. Being recognised by them is one of the best moments of my career. Here in Glasgow I lead a very quiet life, the people here have welcomed me in the best way. It is a city with very welcoming people. The architecture is striking and there are many castles, it’s very different from Colombia and it’s a region with a lot of history. But I always miss my home in Colombia too</p>

  <p><b>[Hearts have opened an investigation into the alleged racist abuse of Rangers forward Alfredo Morelos during Sunday’s Scottish Premiership meeting at Tynecastle]</b> The club is aware of an incident of alleged racism and is currently investigating it. It goes without saying that Heart of Midlothian Football Club utterly condemns any form of racism and any individuals found guilty of such an offence will face an indefinite ban from Tynecastle</p>

  <p><b>[The release went on to defend Alfredo Morelos, who has been criticised for an apparent throat-cutting gesture following his red card at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> Park]</b> There can be little doubt Alfredo is singled out for special attention, on and off the field of play. Indeed, some of the things said and written about him leave a lot to be desired and do nothing to suggest Scottish football is the most welcoming of environments. Even Alfredo’s gesture as he left the pitch is now being portrayed in some quarters as something sinister when, in fact, it is a gesture used commonly throughout South America to indicate quite simply that something - in this case, the match - is finished</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers forward Alfredo Morelos expects to have no shortage of offers to leave Ibrox in the summer]</b> I think they are aware (of me). I imagine that is the case with the coach we have, who played for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> for so long. I imagine he has friends and directors who come to the games, as well as scouts from other teams. It’s a motivation to keep doing well. There many interested clubs, let’s wait until the end of the season to see which leagues are asking for me and then I can make a decision. If God grants me the opportunity to go to a good club, it will happen<br /><br /><b>[Despite those assertions, Morelos insisted that his priority was delivering silverware at Ibrox]</b> My dream is to be a champion, to be a champion with Rangers is the only thing I am lacking to continue making a mark with this club. Then if there’s an opportunity with a bigger team it’ll happen<br /><br />I hope <b>[Alfredo will not be driven out]</b> because we love working with Alfredo. He’s a fantastic player. I know I’m always going to be biased towards him but I think he brings something to this league. He makes the league a lot more exciting, so I hope not. I know he feels strongly about these issues. My advice to Alfredo is to continue to be strong - we’re here for him if he needs that support - and to continue to do what he does best, which is scoring goals and making our supporters happy</p>
