  <p><b>[Shane O’Neill made the jump from Major League Soccer to Europe in 2015]</b> It’s been a crazy journey. Thinking back to the teams I trained with, and thought I’d be signing with, it’s crazy. And the time in Belgium and England, it really was a humbling experience. I kind of underestimated what going to Europe would really be like. I had this image in my head of what it would be like to just go to Europe and play and it just wasn’t like that<br /><br />I was in this 100 percent only French-speaking town and just sitting in the stands every week. I kind of lost my confidence there. It didn’t even feel like I was part of the team<br /><br />When I went to Cambridge it was really just picking up the pieces. I didn’t really have much confidence. I was questioning a lot of stuff in terms of what was going on. I was playing in the midfield and thinking, ‘What is going on?’ To be fair to Cambridge, they were fantastic people, it was just the situation. It wasn’t good for me. I learned from the experience there though. You go to League Two and think that you can just boss it. Then you go and have guys trying to elbow your head off of you in training. You learn how to fight for your spot<br /><br /><b>[Cambridge manager]</b> Shaun Derry sat me down before I left and said, ‘You really need to figure out what you are and who you are as a player and just focus and put all your energies into that’. After that I fully committed to being the best center back I could be, and I really feel like that helped me a lot through this whole process<br /><br />With everything that happened at Breda, that’s a special club, and a club that I think will always be really special to me. Coming out for night games in Breda, with that atmosphere, was incredible<br /><br />We played out of the back at all costs at Breda and I just feel like that helped my game so much in terms of confidence on the ball and playing through the lines. You had to be able to play through the lines and play it forward, and I love that style<br /><br />Deep down I wanted to come back to Holland really badly. After last year, and seeing the passion in this country, I really wanted to try and play in the Eredivisie. Luckily Excelsior came through with an opportunity to play in this division<br /><br />I think a lot of people felt that last year was good, but wonder can I do it in a top division. That’s going to be a big thing for me. It’s not going to come quick because obviously I have to get my fitness up, but if come October, November, I can start getting some games then hopefully I can make something good this year<br /><br />I have ambition of playing in the Eredivisie and beyond. I do really believe I can do well here. It’s just about staying fit and staying patient for the opportunity</p>
