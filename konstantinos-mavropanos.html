  <p><b>[Arsenal new boy Konstantinos Mavropanos has revealed his delight at signing for the club]</b> In this moment I cannot describe exactly how I feel. From my heart I would like to thank the Arsenal officials for the great honour they’ve shown <b>[to me]</b> because they’ve put me in the family of a huge club with millions of fans all over the world. I am very touched. I will give all my strength with my performances to repay this honour and trust in order to make the club and its supporters happy. I had the luck to make my first professional steps at PAS Giannina, a club that has a tradition to offer young players the opportunity for a big step in their careers. Mr. Christovasilis <b>[PAS Giannina owner]</b>, Mr. Petrakis <b>[PAS coach]</b>, my team-mates and the entire city of Ioannina stood by my side. I’m grateful and thank you to all. I’d also like to publicly thank my agent Mr. Konstantinos Farras for all of his actions over the last few months which have brought today’s outcome. From now I am a Gunner!.</p>

  <p><b>[Konstantinos Mavropanos on <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a>]</b> <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> is an incredible coach. He thinks a lot about football and he really inspires you. Emery and <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> have differences. When a coach goes to a team, there is joy in the team because everyone wants to see his philosophy and way of thinking.<br /><br /><b>[Speaking about his decision to leave on loan in January]</b> The team was not in very good shape, so <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> did not have the time to give me opportunities and so we decided to continue in Nuremberg.
