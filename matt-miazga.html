  <p><b>[Matt Miazga also capped his season this weekend and did it in style, adding his fourth goal of the season]</b> FC Utrecht really has a good team. It was difficult, but the reward was also greater. This is a wonderful end of the season</p>

  <p><b>[Vitesse experience has Miazga ready for ‘next level’ with USMNT and Chelsea]</b> I remember when I was with Red Bulls, and at Chelsea as well, and my first few caps with the national team, when you’re playing rondos, the boxes, five-v-twos, the youngest always starts in the middle. I don’t have to start in the middle anymore. So then I realize, wow, time flew by, I’m the old guy now.<br /><br />I felt more confidence and more trust from the coach this year for sure. But also, I just thought I’m getting older. I’m in a position where you need to be commanding, you need to communicate a lot, you need to be a leader. And I just kind of took it upon myself to be that leader, to be more of a presence and help my team-mates out any way I can. Organize and just be prepared for everything.<br /><br />When I was first brought up, 2015, it was still that era of the older generation. The Tim Howards and Clint Dempseys, and you always looked up to them. When I was growing up, in 2006 and 2010, these are the guys you were looking up to. I remember when I came into camp you really felt like you’re here because these guys have been here such a long time. But now, I’m getting older, everyone’s getting older, and I think there’s a new wave, a new generation of players coming in. That’s normal, it happens in every transition. Players are getting older, and young players are coming up, and that’s how it goes<br /><br />I’m confident in my abilities. I’m for sure ready for the next level. I’m a confident player. I know what I can do, I know what I can bring. I just need to control what I can control. Every time I have a chance, every time I have an opportunity to play, try to make an impact, try to impress and play well, and try to win football games<br /><br />I wouldn’t say I wasn’t ready, because at the time you think you’re ready. But then you realize as you’re getting older and you’re playing more football games and getting better and improving and analyzing and all that stuff, you realize how much you improve and how much more I’ve added to my game, and how much more assured I am of myself. That’s the way it should be. You don’t want to stay stagnant. You want to keep improving. I’m not trying to be the best version of myself at 20 years old. I want to keep improving every year, and keep adding to my game, and being the best I can be year by year. It would be bad for me to say that at 20-21 years old I’m peak product, I’m not getting any better, because I’m always going to strive for more, strive for consistency, for perfection<br /><br />It boosts your confidence. It was my third cap and I was scoring a goal on my home soil. These are things you dream of, you envision. I always envisioned myself being a national team player, playing big games for the national team, scoring goals. It was a good feeling. I was happy about it, but I was more happy about the performance, that we won and how I played. The goal was just a cherry on top. And we got a clean sheet. I like clean sheets more than me scoring my own goal. That was my first start for the national team. I felt like, okay, I got my first 90 minutes, scored a goal, got a clean sheet in a fairly important game. It was in the Gold Cup, in a competition, and it helped us get first place. I was like, okay, let’s build on it now, let’s continue to focus, and push myself along<br /><br />The group here is pretty young. I’m one of the more experienced players here. That’s personally good for me, to try and help these younger guys, because I always liked it when older guys take you under their wing and help you integrate more. It happened to me at Red Bull, Chelsea, so on and so forth, even in my first few caps with the national team. So I’m going to try and help these young guys as well. I know a few guys, like <b>[Matt]</b> Olosunde and <b>[Josh]</b> Sargent, so I’m going to try and help them. We have a young group, and hungry group, and we’re going to work hard and try to establish ourselves.<br /><br />I’m excited. I think all the guys are excited to take on this challenge of three games. France is going to be a big test, but you can’t look too far ahead. We have Bolivia first, make sure we come out flying and ready for that game, and we’re playing on home soil so we’ve got to put in a good performance. But like I said, it’s a good challenge. Any time it’s the national team it’s a big privilege. You’ve got enjoy it and give it your all</p>

  <p><b>[Diego Lainez and Matt Miazga jawed at each other while the defender made gestures about Lainez’s small size]</b> It’s normal. We talked a little smack. It’s part of the game. It’s mental warfare. We got in their heads, they got a red card right after and you saw what happened. We took control and we won the game.</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea loanee Matt Miazga still sees his future in the Premier League as he returns to England with the United States national team]</b> Obviously growing up, England was a powerhouse nation and they still are. For me, it is exciting to be here and face them with the U.S. national team. The Premier League is the best league in the world so it was always a goal of mine to come here, I did that. Now hopefully I can come back here, but we will see what the future holds.<br /><br />I am at Nantes now until the end of the season so my main focus is to give my all until the end of the season for that club. Obviously I need to earn my starting spot back through training and go from there. Right now, my main focus is here with the national team. When you go from playing every game to not playing then people are going to write things and assume things. One will say this, one will say that, but it doesn’t really matter to me. They can say whatever they want, my main focus is Nantes and to earn back my spot</p>

  <p><b>[Matt Miazga has described England as a ‘world-class’ team]</b> It feels nice to be back in London. Obviously I was here for seven or eight months and to go with the national team is always a privilege. I’m very excited to be here and I’m excited for Thursday. Playing England at Wembley is going to be a very big test for us. The main objective is to play good football and get a good result. We are going for the win so that’s the most important thing. I think the main focus is for our generation to establish themselves in this national team. To gain experience and to continue to help move this nation along in footballing terms to reach the top. We are all players who have high aspirations. Many of us play for good clubs in Europe as well. Even in America, there’s a lot of players in Europe challenging themselves. I think for us it <b>[the aim]</b> is to continue to establish ourselves on the national stage. We all know about the quality of players that England has but it’s nothing different for us. We have played a lot of good opponents with the U.S. national team this past year and it will be nothing different. It is one team versus another team and it will be a good test to show ourselves against a well-renowned country and nation like England. It is a world-class team and they all play for world-class clubs. Every player that puts on an England shirt is going to be top, top notch. I know Ruben <b>[Loftus-Cheek]</b>, so it will be nice to see him again. They are top notch players playing for world-class clubs and England did really well at the World Cup.<br /><br /><b>[Ruben Loftus-Cheek]</b> It is great to see, I was close to Ruben when I was there <b>[at Chelsea]</b>. We were the younger guys in the squad so it is great to see him doing well and maybe after the game we can swap jerseys, but the main focus is for the U.S. and getting the result against England. Whatever comes after that, comes after that<br /><br /><b>[On John Terry and Rio Ferdinand]</b> I’d say John Terry, Rio Ferdinand, top central defenders like that. I have always watched and tried to learn from them, taking little bits from their game to implement in mine. So I am constantly growing, learning and developing. For me a memorable England team was when it was <b>[Frank]</b> Lampard, <b>[Steven]</b> Gerrard, <b>[John]</b> Terry and that core. Obviously growing up, England was a powerhouse nation and they still are</p>

  <p><b>[How Chelsea’s Matt Miazga is growing after Nantes loan move]</b> I have no regrets at Nantes. Nantes shaped me to become a better player and person. It went well. I had a great time there, met a lot of good people, played good football. There was a managerial change, and then I was out of favour. This happens in football. You see it happen everywhere. It is what it is. I was lucky that Chelsea had the option to bring me back, then got out of one and into another. Chelsea knew it was best for me to get out of Nantes and go to a new club to contribute to my development. So, that’s what happened with Reading. At Nantes, everything was fine and then finished off fine. I didn’t like the way the coach said some things that were not true. Everyone was aware that I was leaving, then when I was injured, we had a protocol to come to Chelsea. Everyone was aware of that, and you see it with many of the other loan players. Then Nantes, me and Chelsea agreed it was best for me to leave and go on loan somewhere else. I had really good conversations with the manager here and some of the directors at the football club. I knew that not playing for two months at Nantes in winter, I knew coming in here I had an excellent chance to go and contribute. That was a big factor as I needed to continue to build my games this season and showcase myself. My goal is to become a consistent Premier League player. At the back of my head is that I am contracted to Chelsea, so it would be good to be a player there. Most of the eyes are on England. You have to showcase yourself in England. I figured I could come to the Championship, play at a well-known club like Reading, that’s near London, Chelsea were happy with the move. They can monitor me even more closely. Eddie Newton and Marina <b>[Granovskaia]</b> thought it was a great move, so I didn’t think twice. I knew my goal was to play in England. So I came here to showcase myself in front of the English presence and people. I want to thank Nantes for everything. I still keep in touch with all the players. I am happy with my time there. I grew a lot, learned a lot. I can’t say anything bad. These things happen<br /><br /><b>[On Sala]</b> He had a break <b>[after signing]</b>, so he came to Nantes to say goodbye to everyone. I didn’t see him because I was injured. The next day, I was texting my buddies at Nantes, he told me the news. I was in shock. The plane was gone, then there was the search. I was very, very sad for everyone who knew him. You never want to see this happen in football or life in general. I knew him for six months, we lined up together in the same shirt, fought together, travelled together, ate together, trying to win football matches. We spoke French, and he let me practice my French. It is very, very sad. Rest in peace. No one wants to see it happen, especially to someone you know. You would never think it could happen in 2019. A good guy, a good player which was shown by his big-money Premier League transfer. He had a nose for goal, a fox-in-the-box type. Great in the air, I went against him in training. I pray for him and his family<br /><br />I would be lying to say I wasn’t better than I was after leaving Red Bulls. Coming into Europe, I had relatively low experience, as I had only played in the MLS. I felt like I was on top of the world on my Chelsea debut versus Villa, but I didn’t want to feel like a bit-part player, so you go on loan to get experience. You are not playing because you are on loan, a foreigner, he is a native player, you are younger, he is older. You have to fight through that. You change the coaches’ mind. Gain trust. When you have opportunities, you take them. Taking opportunities like that have helped me. Playing across different competitions. I have played in the Eredivisie, Europa League, cups, Ligue 1, won a trophy. It is my path, and I am very happy with the experience and what I am accomplishing. It has shaped me today. I am continuing to improve. I was lucky to sign with Chelsea at 20 years old and get first-team experience, but the reality was that I was young with only MLS experience. You have to go and get more experience to be trusted by a big club. It is common sense. A lot of people don’t realise that, but real people who give proper insights will understand it. The loan system is good. It helps players all the time. It is hard to break into Chelsea. You are a young player, you develop your craft, learn something else and challenge yourself on loan. Eddie Newton, for the past two years I have been working diligently with him. He has been coming to Vitesse to watch games, study films, analyse the things I am doing and what to improve on. At Nantes, he came over, and at Reading. We keep in touch and once a month or month and a half, he comes to visit me, and we have a proper talk. It is a video session where we analyse my game. We have an app where analysis is sent with video on my game and what I can improve on. It has all our touches. The next day after the game, you get a 20-minute video showing just your touches. Reviewing these things is nice. It shows they are tracking your development and I have learned a lot from Eddie in these past few years. I hope to finish the season strong and to continue to learn more. The platform here at Reading, there’s a lot of eyes looking here in the Championship in what’s arguably the toughest league in the world. Schedule, intensity, the style of play, the way people fight and all that stuff. It is more coming here and playing football matches to propel myself forward. I am happy here, and I am enjoying it. Take it one game at a time, perform to the best of my ability and contribute to the team in any way I can<br /><br />When I was at Chelsea, I spoke with John Terry a lot. I looked at his career a lot, a world-class defender who achieved a lot. You can learn a lot from him. His pathway, he went on loan when he was younger, developed fast at a young age and became a leader and captain. I look to myself and want to be a leader and captain one day. For me, I look at a lot of good footballers and take little things from them, while also being myself. I speak with Ryan Nelsen, my agent. He was a central defender. A Premier League veteran, me and him always talk about football. He is always helping me and analysing games. I have him in my corner. I am open to everything. I see new things. I am smart enough to realise I can improve. I watch a lot of football. I can talk all day about it. I watch the world’s best defenders and how they cope with situations, I slow down the game to see what happened when a goal goes in, could they have avoided it or done better? I see it to learn about it and to apply it to myself. When we concede a goal too, I do that. Could I have done something else? It helps me. It is a craft. You don’t just become the best; you have to devote time to it</p>

  <p><b>[Matt Miazga is hoping Christian Pulisic’s £58 million move to Chelsea will inspire a generation of U.S. youngsters]</b> It is good <b>[to see him join Chelsea]</b>. He is a world-class talent. You saw at a young age what he can do in the Bundesliga. This season he has been injured a lot, so it has been difficult for him to kick on, but everyone knows the talent he possesses, he is a great player. He possesses a talent where he is very comfortable on the ball in tight space. You don’t see that too often from American players, to have that level of technical ability and savviness in tight spaces to get in and out and create goalscoring opportunities. You can see from his play that he can create those goalscoring opportunities, and be a nuisance for a defender on the wing. He can isolate a defender and beat him one-on-one with speed and technique. Chelsea have added a great player, and I think he will add a lot, particularly beating players one-versus-one. He is a world-class player or on that trajectory. Next season I hope he can really kick on with Chelsea and showcase his talent and help the club. It is nice to see young American players playing in Europe. Particularly in the Bundesliga, Premier League, Dutch league and Championship. Making that move gives you confidence. You see a big club pay big money for an American player, it is good, it inspires young players in America to keep working and move forward. Hopefully, many people follow in his path. I haven’t spoken to him. It happened in January. I hope we meet up in the national team and catch up about the move next week. I will answer any questions about what to expect. I have been around the first team for six-seven months, but he will be fine. Chelsea is one of the biggest clubs in the world. I remember as an American player, when I first got there, it was a big platform with a lot of media attention. I imagine for him, being a big-money player, he will get a lot of exposure and a lot of people watching. So, that’s good, because it raises the awareness and popularity of the sport in America. We want to grow our country’s game, get players playing, then moving to Europe to challenge themselves against the best players. That’s what this new generation is doing<br /><br />Our country is young in football terms. The MLS is young, started in ‘95. You see all these big leagues have been established for over 100 years. Everyone has their path, so it doesn’t matter. My path, I was in America, grew up in America, developed in America. It was very good. I do see a lot of players who have good opportunities and can make the jump to Europe and test themselves. Come into deep water and get better. My path was different. I could have easily stayed in MLS, in my comfort zone, at my hometown club every year. Have this and that, be at home, be with my friends and play in the MLS. I have, in my humble opinion, big goals to try to get to the highest level of football. I knew that I had a year left on my contract at Red Bulls. There was pressure to sign a new one, but I said no. I want to see what options I get, what offers come. I had some offers, Chelsea came, and I went there. That’s an opportunity you can’t miss. I think it is about pushing yourself and if you get the chance to go to Europe, go to Europe. That’s no disrespect to the standard of the MLS, but the best leagues are in Europe. They set the standard here. The best players are here. Everyone looks to Europe. We have a lot of talent to push themselves. That’s even though the MLS is a great league for young players, I developed there in the MLS as a young player<br /><br />He plays his style of football, possession-based, with an attacking approach. Creating chances, disorganising opponents. He is a good manager, I have already spoken to him a few times, he is detail orientated. I think he is going to try to build a new culture in the national team. A good atmosphere to really grow this country because we have all the resources, all the talent to become a big country in world football. Hopefully, we can continue to build on that every year. I hope this will be a great appointment. Berhalter understands European football, and he has played in Europe for most of his career. He knows the ins and outs of European football. With his experience, hopefully, good times are ahead. We have players at big clubs in Europe, but the more players we have here playing consistent minutes, then we will be better off. European football sets the standard. We have a good mentality, a lot of talent in America. I encourage more players to leave their comfort zone, come to Europe and challenge themselves. Discomfort makes you grow. A lot of young players are doing that. We need to get more experience together, on the international stage and develop together. We have a lot of games coming up now, the Gold Cup in the summer. Hopefully, it is a good experience. We want to win that. We want to win every game. We will build a good atmosphere and culture in the squad and enjoy representing our country. That’s the greatest honour, I think</p>
