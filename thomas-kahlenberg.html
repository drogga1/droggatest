<blockquote>
  <p>[Christian Eriksen’s performances for Tottenham and talismanic displays for Denmark make him deserving of a Ballon d’Or nomination] I do not know how many players are named on the list but he really had a great season. After that, he’s also a very quiet guy who does not talk much to the press, who is more focused on football. If he continues like this, he will definitely be shortlisted for the Ballon d’Or.<br /><br />Eriksen expresses himself very well in this team. We do not have world stars like France, we are more dependent on some players. And Eriksen is very, very important. He’s one who makes the difference. I do not know how his performances are perceived in France. You have a lot of world-class players in France so it’s normal to talk less about a player like him. Here, Christian is watched very closely, watched in the media because he had an extraordinary season in Tottenham and with the national team. In Denmark, we know he’s a world-class player, and I think he can still improve. But he’s already very, very good<br /><br />[Asked to name those who are capable of making a positive impression] Andreas Christensen, who plays for Chelsea, has huge talent. He is a smart player. There is also Thomas Delaney who has really progressed since he is playing at Werder. He’s a midfielder with a box-to-box style, very effective, which works well in our system</p>
