<blockquote>
  <p><b>[South American clubs and countries are increasingly turning to western European coaches]</b> The trend effect in Brazil is very strong. First, we had the older generation. Clubs started to appoint <b>[experienced managers]</b> Luiz Felipe <a href="luiz-felipe-scolari.html">Scolari</a>, Vanderlei Luxemburgo, Abel Braga. They went well and in consequence, all the other clubs wanted to appoint an older coach. Then, the old coaches began to be sacked and we had the younger generation. Tiago Nunes, Roger Machado and Fábio Carille. They went well and again, other clubs wanted to follow
<br />The new trend that began last year is the foreign coaches and more specifically the European coaches. <a href="jorge-sampaoli.html">Sampaoli</a> and Jesus had new styles with a lot of intensity, and it worked. Now the other clubs want to do the same
<br />By being a foreign coach in Brazil, the players naturally demonstrate special interest. They want to demonstrate more to the foreign coach … they have in the back of their minds the <b>[possibility]</b> of playing in Europe. It makes them run more, strive more, do their best</p>
