  <p><b>[<a href="david-beckham.html">David Beckham</a>’s Inter Miami selected striker Robbie Robinson with the first overall pick of the 2020 <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> SuperDraft]</b> Inter Miami CF continued to fortify its roster with the selection of two college standouts in the 2020 <a href="mls.html">Major League Soccer</a> (MLS) SuperDraft. With the first overall pick, Inter Miami selected the 2019 Mac Hermann winning striker Robbie Robinson, 21, from Clemson University, and the 2019 NCAA Division I Men’s champion full-back Dylan Nealis, 21, from Georgetown University with the third overall pick. Additionally, the Club traded its natural fourth-round pick (No. 79 overall) in the draft to FC Dallas today in exchange for the College Protected List Rights to Dylan Castanheira. Robbie and Dylan Nealis have both had exciting collegiate careers and will bring more offensive and defensive depth to our roster,’ said the Club’s Sporting Director <a href="paul-mcdonough.html">Paul McDonough</a>. ‘As for Dylan Castanheira, he’s a promising young player that we look forward to continue watching this season</p>
