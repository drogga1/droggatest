  <p><b>[Vahid Halilhodzic taks that the Parisians will struggle getting over events at the Camp Nou: <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona FC</a>’s historic comeback win over <a href="psg.html">Paris Saint-Germain</a> in the <a href="uefa.html">UEFA</a> Champions League Round of 16]</b> This defeat will not only leave a mark on <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> this season, it is a trauma that will not heal so easy and will haunt future <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> generations. They need to unite quickly, players, coaches and board - everyone must invest a big effort to keep focused on the <a href="ligue-1.html">Ligue 1</a> title race. It is hard for me to understand what happened at <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Camp Nou</a>. Maybe <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> were not prepared psychologically, maybe they were over-confident and maybe they feared a debacle. But believe me, their players will never forget this defeat!</p>

  <p><b>[Former Dinamo Zagreb manager Vahid Halilhodzic has called on Luka Modric to deliver more for Croatia as they prepare to face England in Wednesday’s World Cup semi-final]</b> Of course Modric is leader of this team, he is best midfielder in the world and a candidate to win Golden Ball. But it will not be that simple, he scores too little, he should have more courage to shoot from distance.<br /><br />The biggest problem for the England game could be that the players are exhausted. Look at Mario Mandzukic, he always gives 110 per cent! The key people in the Croatian team are now doctors and physios<br /><br />Croatia has to play better to reach the final, they had some luck against Denmark and Russia but you can’t count on that in the semi final.<br /><br /><b>[Halilhodzic believes that Zlatko Dalic’s side have already surpassed expectations by reaching the semi-final]</b> Croatia achieved a lot, with population of only 5 million, compared to 150 million Russians. I knew Croatia had a great team, but during the World Cup I saw in them determination to go all the way. And they had some luck, but that is necessary to get a big result</p>

  <p><b>[Nantes head coach Vahid Halilhodzic has slammed Paris Saint-Germain]</b> The behaviour of the team before the match was incomprehensible. How they could accept that the players arrived alone to the stadium two hours before the match? The preparation of Paris before the Manchester United game was a serious mistake. It’s unworthy for a big club. It’s unprofessional. In Paris, there may be traffic jams or an accident <b>[that would delay the arrival to the stadium]</b>. The main lesson is: ‘You acted like a child, so you have the result of a child</p>
