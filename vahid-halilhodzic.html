  <p><b>[Former Paris Saint-Germain coach Vahid Halilhodzic believes the repercusions of the French champions’ 6-1 defeat to Barcelona on Wednesday could hamper the club for years to come]</b> This defeat will not only leave a mark on PSG this season, it is a trauma that will not heal so easy and will haunt future PSG’s generations. They need to unite quickly, players, coaches and board - everyone must invest a big effort to keep focused on Ligue 1 title race. It is hard for me to understand what happened at Camp Nou. Maybe PSG were not prepared psychologically, maybe they were over-confident and maybe they feared a debacle. But believe me, there players will never forget this defeat!<br /><br />In first leg I was shocked how poor Barcelona looked, I couldn’t believe a team with such players, including Lionel Messi, the best in history, could play so badly. Marco Verratti, Adrien Rabiot and Blaise Matuidi totally outplayed them in midfield and if Edinson Cavani, Angel Di Maria and Julian Draxler had been more accurate, it could have ended worse for Barca<br /><br />But in the second leg Barcelona took a risk with three defenders, PSG were naive and we must mention the referees too. PSG shouldn’t have lost so heavily, but it remains questionable whether the referee would awarded those two penalties to a smaller club. I don’t think so - especially the one on Suarez, which came from situation that we see a million times in one match.<br /><br />There was also the Javier Mascherano situation, and even Gerard Pique could have been awarded a red card for a foul on Cavani. All the dubious decisions went Barcelona’s way. PSG were tactically a disaster! No aggressiveness, no possession, no passing - they were intimidated, had no midfield, no rhythm, no fight… I understand Verratti and Rabiot are young players but they had to do much better. Yes, they have the right to be mad at referee, but most of all they have to blame themselves. Especially defensively, they were catastrophic<br /><br />Thiago Silva was not at a captain’s level. He is one of most experienced players in the team - he had to be the one to shout, do something, make some foul, anything to lift his team when things got bad. To affect other players with his confidence, to calm them in dying minutes. And to me he seemed lost!</p>

  <p><b>[Former Dinamo Zagreb manager Vahid Halilhodzic has called on Luka Modric to deliver more for Croatia as they prepare to face England in Wednesday’s World Cup semi-final]</b> Of course Modric is leader of this team, he is best midfielder in the world and a candidate to win Golden Ball. But it will not be that simple, he scores too little, he should have more courage to shoot from distance.<br /><br />The biggest problem for the England game could be that the players are exhausted. Look at Mario Mandzukic, he always gives 110 per cent! The key people in the Croatian team are now doctors and physios<br /><br />Croatia has to play better to reach the final, they had some luck against Denmark and Russia but you can’t count on that in the semi final.<br /><br /><b>[Halilhodzic believes that Zlatko Dalic’s side have already surpassed expectations by reaching the semi-final]</b> Croatia achieved a lot, with population of only 5 million, compared to 150 million Russians. I knew Croatia had a great team, but during the World Cup I saw in them determination to go all the way. And they had some luck, but that is necessary to get a big result</p>

  <p><b>[Nantes manager Vahid Halilhodzic has slammed United States international Matt Miazga]</b> I do not know what is happening behind my back. Some even blackmail … There are many things that are wrong and I am sad, very sad. The blackmail I was talking about yesterday was about Matt Miazga. He assured me that he had a sore back. After exams, however, there was no problem… He just wanted to leave the club.<br /><br />This morning Miazga was in England, in Chelsea. He didn’t warn anyone. These things bother me. But it has to be done with, even if it disappointed me a lot.</p>

  <p><b>[Nantes head coach Vahid Halilhodzic has slammed Paris Saint-Germain]</b> The behaviour of the team before the match was incomprehensible. How they could accept that the players arrived alone to the stadium two hours before the match? The preparation of Paris before the Manchester United game was a serious mistake. It’s unworthy for a big club. It’s unprofessional. In Paris, there may be traffic jams or an accident <b>[that would delay the arrival to the stadium]</b>. The main lesson is: ‘You acted like a child, so you have the result of a child</p>
