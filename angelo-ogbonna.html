  <p><b>[<a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> defender Angelo Ogbonna has been highly critical of the manner in which the coronavirus crisis has been handled in England]</b> I am happy and relieved that everything has now been suspended, including the minor leagues. It was almost as if they wanted to ignore such a serious problem. It’s not just football, but this problem is ingrained in the English mentality. They still don’t realise the danger of a virus that can be passed on in seconds if you don’t behave in the right way<br /><br />It’s completely unacceptable that the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> game against us was allowed to go ahead. They had just played against <a href="olympiacos-fc.html">Olympiacos</a>, whose president tested positive for coronavirus. It’s almost as if they were waiting for someone to die before taking action<br /><br />I haven’t been tested or checked over in any way. That is another testament to an attitude that is at the very least superficial</p>

  <p><b>[Italy international Angelo Ogbonna thinks Britain underestimated the impact of the coronavirus]</b> Initially there was scepticism, the emergency was handled superficially. I think there was also an intention to try to protect the country economically after Brexit. They underestimated a very serious, global issue. Initially they laughed at Italy, they thought we were exaggerating the matter. I live in London, but I was immediately worried about us and my family in Italy. I have to tell you the truth, at least in London there was concern. Empty supermarkets, fewer people around. But London is not England<br /><br />We await future directions from <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> to understand what we will do. There are other priorities. Now that <b>[British Prime Minister Boris]</b> Johnson is positive for Covid-19 too, the concern has grown. We train from home. We have our guidelines, given by <a href="david-moyes.html">Moyes</a> and his staff. We keep the club informed daily. The problem is that we live in an apartment. For some players, the accommodation is still temporary and, for ad-hoc preparation, it will take time. It’s right to think that we will need a month to get back in shape. The problem, however, is that you have no way of training how you would like</p>
