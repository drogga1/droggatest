  <p><b>[Leigh Broxham has argued Melbourne Victory aren’t in a form slump]</b> In Wellington we didn’t perform to the level that we wanted to. In Perth we had a lot of chances and the performance was generally good, and a few things we could have done a bit better … so it’s not a form slump. We win on Thursday and everything’s forgotten, isn’t it.<br /><br /><b>[Thursday’s Big Blue is]</b> an important game in terms of closing the gap on Sydney. They’re doing very well. They deserve to be where they are - obviously they’ve got the points on the board - and it’s up to us to close the gap on them and it starts on Thursday<br /><br /><b>[the club’s A-League games record holder with 225 matches to Leigh Broxham’s name]</b> It’s a big club. There’s a lot of great people here, so it’s something special that I can be able to do that at a club like this</p>

  <p><b>[Western Sydney Wanderers deserve to be challenging for a top-four spot in the A-League]</b> In my opinion, I don’t think a lot <b>[has changed]</b>. They were playing some good football earlier in the year and things weren’t falling their way. They have good players, <b>[Brendon]</b> Santalab’s scoring for them now as well and I think the results they’re getting now are the results they might have deserved earlier on.<br /><br />In that game they had some very dangerous moments and they caused us trouble going forward and we scored some good goals against them. So, you know, it does give us confidence that we’ve managed to beat them and contain what they try and do against us</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory midfielder Leigh Broxham has warned no-one should expect the Video Assistant Referee <b>[VAR]</b> system to work perfectly immediately]</b> We are pretty critical on referees but sometimes things happen very, very quickly, and they are only human. The new video technology can only help and I think it will still have some teething problems to begin with because they’re still practicing as well, so I’m sure it won’t all be smooth sailing but everyone’s got to have an open mind. Everyone says in the media, we’ve been waiting for this, so I’m not going to sit here and go ‘well, geez, I don’t know’ now. It’s definitely a positive thing so it’s just another platform to help them <b>[referees]</b> make the right decisions.<br /><br />All major incidents in the game will be quietly reviewed anyway. So, you know, you go running to them - ‘that was a penalty, that wasn’t penalty’ or whatever - they’ll be reviewing it anyway. They’ve given us confidence that there’ll be no need for that. It’s a natural reaction though, isn’t it? You see something, you go running over and say ‘look at the screen’ or whatever. I think a lot will go on in the background that we won’t even know about</p>

  <p><b>[Melbourne Victory duo Leigh Broxham and James Troisi are unfazed about playing on a potentially dodgy pitch at Allianz Stadium when they face Sydney FC in the A-League grand final]</b> It is what it is, so you’re going to get a normal answer from me - they’ve got to play on it as well. Yeah, it’s not ideal but we’re happy to go up there and I think the spectacle of the grand final, and how much pressure it is, the ball doesn’t get down and play as much as a normal game.<br /><br />Everyone knew <b>[against Brisbane]</b> that you’re one game away from the <b>[grand]</b> final and it’s the last time this group will be together, and that’s a fact. So I think the penny dropped for a few people, and it’s a finals game and you always get that little bit of extra intensity, and I think it’ll go up again for the grand final</p>
