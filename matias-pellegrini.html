  <p><b>[Beckham’s first Inter Miami signing Matias Pellegrini embraces groundbreaking new life in MLS]</b> It’s something that doesn’t happen a lot. This doesn’t happen to many players. I’m enjoying it. I’m a very young player, but right now I’m adapting to how this club operates and I want to make sure I’m doing my best to make sure I’m at the level that the club is at <b>[…]</b> I’m just very happy, very excited. I’m lucky to be a part of this great project and this ambitious club. It has been a beautiful experience for me. This is very new. I wasn’t used to doing anything like this in Argentina, and I’m very excited to be a part of it.<br /><br />I talked a lot with Titi Rodriguez from D.C. United, Leo Gonzalez Pirez from Atlanta. They told me about the league, about the clubs and they convinced me even more to join. It’s a league that’s growing a lot with a lot of talented players. For me, it was always a goal to come here. It’s a great step in my career. I love the club’s ambitions and the club’s objectives. I’m really excited and looking forward to being a part of it<br /><br />I know that <a href="diego-alonso.html">Diego Alonso</a> has done great things in his career, especially in Mexico. Also, for me, it’s a plus that he’s a Uruguayan, so we have a very similar culture. We speak the same language so I’m really looking forward to working with him<br /><br />I have to continue doing things how I had been doing them in Argentina. Since I’ve been a young player, I’ve worked hard and I’m going to continue doing so here in Miami. I want to contribute to the club and make sure that I can help the club achieve its goals and make history<br /><br /><b>[Pellegrini said of Beckham]</b> He was and still is one of my idols. When Inter Miami reached out and I found out he was one of the owners, I was very, very excited to be a part of his project. This has been an incredible experience. Everything, all of this, is new for me. I’m enjoying it. I’m taking advantage of it. I’m sure this will be an experience that I’ll never forget in my life. I’m very, very, very happy to be here</p>
