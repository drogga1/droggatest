<blockquote>
  <p>[MISC had been in the spotlight this week after three of its players were arrested on suspicion of match-fixing] MACC has remanded a man suspected as a match-fixer, due to the statements given by the players. When it comes to match-fixers, we have to be extra [cautious]. We know what will happen, and we will be vigilant. We want to go all out against match-fixing. For example today, even if we lost, we lost fairly. We won’t be distracted by the presence of match-fixers or other influences, or by the thoughts of players who are on the take. Regardless of whether we lose or win, we will go all out against match-fixers, to any extent.<br /><br />[Mohan then added that they will assist the police and MACC] Whatever it takes, we will cooperate with the police and MACC. And the new [FAM] president has to focus on the issue of match-fixing<br /><br />[When asked by the press regarding the fate of the arrested players] We’ll see how the investigation and their statements go, if they are guilty then they will be out [terminated] automatically. But if they are found not guilty then it is up to the [head] coach and manager. If the players’ services are still required they will be retained, if not they will be released</p>
