  <p><b>[Henrikh Mkhitaryan admits he wasn’t happy at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and struggled to adapt to English football]</b> Now I am in Rome and I focus on them. This is not a step backwards as a great football is played here. I wanted to change scenery and for me it is an opportunity to be seized. I have to enjoy playing football, no matter the place. I no longer felt happy. Maybe I was not fitting so well in English football. The messages after the two national matches made me happy, but now I have to concentrate on Rome. I will never give up and I will fight to the end. I’m not afraid of pressure, I’m used to it having already played with great teams. I know that the slightest mistake is criticised while a good performance is exalted. If you agree to play soccer you must be ready to face criticism. <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> is a great opportunity, I accepted immediately with enthusiasm. We didn’t even talk about money</p>

  <p><b>[Mkhitaryan blames <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>’s methods for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> exit as freedom was removed from his game]</b> He paid more attention to tactics, so my role changed. I was starting as a winger, but had to build play with the defensive midfielder. It’s why I couldn’t contribute as many goals or assists. I like to play more freely and move wherever there’s space, but you have to do the job that the manager asks<br /><br /><b>[He began to slip down the pecking order as a result, with it quickly becoming apparent that he would need a move in order to find the regular game time he craves]</b> I couldn’t accept that I had to sit on the bench for some matches. I know my qualities and what I can do. I’m 30 years old now and I like to play football, not just sit on the bench and waste my time.

  <p><b>[Arsenal loanee Mkhitaryan opens up on ‘complicated’ <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> relationship at <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and father figure Klopp]</b> <b>[My relationship]</b> with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> was the most complicated in my career. He is a winner by nature. He wants you to win and you do what he asks you, it is difficult for anyone. There were differences and conflicts, but they did not have a big impact on the hard work we did and the three trophies we won. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is a friend, like a father or brother to me. When I left <a href="borussia-dortmund.html">Dortmund</a> I had started to truly understand football<br /><br />I chose Roma to start having fun again. On September 1, two hours after playing with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> <b>[a 2-2 draw with Tottenham]</b>, <a href="mino-raiola.html">Mino Raiola</a> told me to get on the first flight to Rome. It all happened very quickly. I had promised myself that things would change this season. When you are 30, you no longer have time to waste and you need to keep trying to have fun. At the beginning of the season our goal was to reach the top four, reach the Coppa Italia final and go as far as possible in Europe.<br /><br />Pressure here isn’t an issue for me. Not because of my age, but because I have played at clubs like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. The people here live for football, it’s great. My goal is to continue playing until I am 37. I don’t know what will happen to me, or if I will be able to carry on physically that long. I want to play at the top level for as long as possible. That’s my goal, but we’ll see</p>

  <p><b>[Henrikh Mkhitaryan says Roma’s football better for me than <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> under Emery]</b> When I was at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I had different things asked from me by the coach, people were expecting different things from here. The philosophy of Emery was different from <a href="paulo-fonseca.html">Fonseca</a>, but here I’m feeling much better because we’re playing better football and I think it matched me. I prefer <a href="paulo-fonseca.html">Fonseca</a>’s football because we’re playing very offensively, we’re trying to have the ball all the time here and of course I like this kind of game.<br /><br />I can’t say anything at the moment because the season is stopped, we don’t know when we’ll start playing again and what will happen in the summer. Football changes so quickly. One day you’re here, the other you’re there. You never know what can happen and what will happen with you<br /><br />We’re trying. It’s not easy. In this difficult moment you can’t do many things. You can only stay home to be safe and wait for everything to be resolved. I’m waking up, having breakfast, talking with family members about different things: the virus, life, the future, the past. Then in the evening I’m trying to watch a movie, with the family or sometimes on my own. Besides that, we have the programme from the team for training at home, so I’m trying to keep myself fit. When I heard the situation wasn’t the best and everyone was asking us to stay home, I stopped going outside for a walk or a run. It’s better to stay inside and be an example to everyone, to show them that this is more important, to follow the rules and be at home</p>

  <p><b>[Mkhitaryan makes <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> future admission as he approaches the end of Roma loan]</b> Since the first day I arrived here in Rome, I feel very good in the club, in the city, and of course it would be nice to stay here. The main target will be the Champions League, other wins and titles. People underestimate <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, the Italian league, but it’s more than interesting to play here. The league is getting better and better, and last year’s transfers speak for themselves<br /><br />I do not have a lot of time left until the end of my football career, but I’m pretty sure that I’m doing my best to achieve more, because at the end of your football career everyone will remember what you have done for the club, what titles you have won. It’s very important to leave a positive note by winning a trophy or doing something good for the club. I always had a dream to play in the best European leagues and the best European clubs. And I’ve fulfilled my dream. I’m working hard and mixing my talent with hard work. It’s not always easy, but sometimes you must make a sacrifice</p>

It’s up to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and Roma if they will agree on terms of the transfer fee. So my thinking is to train hard, to play hard, to look forward to what’s going to happen. Of course, if I’m not going to stay at Roma I have to go back to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I’m not complaining, football life changes so quickly so you have to be ready to play wherever you are.
