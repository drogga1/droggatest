  <p><b>[Henrikh Mkhitaryan retains full faith in Arsene Wenger]</b> It’s not the easiest time for the club, but we are here to help, do our best, and put Arsenal on the level that it was before. I know it’s not going to be easy, but we’re trying, and doing our best. It’s a pleasure to work with <b>[Wenger]</b>. He knows a lot about football, he can give you good advice, and I’m very happy to be here. Of course it’s not very easy for him either, but we have to play for the club, play for him, because he is a big role model for this team, big person at this club, so we have to do our best to show we are ready to fight for him.</p>

I’m just enjoying playing with Mesut and he’s an amazing football player. I’m getting better playing with him, everyone knows his skills, abilities, so why not? Everything is possible, why not have two No. 10s on a pitch? You know, even if we play very good, there’s always room for improvement - even if we were playing offensive football, we can still improve. I mean maybe we can improve in every aspect, it doesn’t matter if we are strong in one side and weak in the other - I think there are a lot of spaces for improvement.<br /><br />Yes, I’ve been watching many times Arsenal games in the past and of course I was following the team playing in the Premier League and Champions League. Also, Arsene Wenger, how he was treating and working with the young talent. I don’t know why but that was the drive and small details that changed myself to saying I have to support Arsenal. I’m very happy to be here and it’s a dream come true</p>

I thought it could only be in a dream that we could join another club other than Dortmund but I am very happy for that. I know him very well, he is one of my best friends and one of the best team-mates I have ever had. I am very happy to have him here and I think all the fans are happy to see him in an Arsenal shirt.

I just have to enjoy myself, do my best and at the end I will see where I can reach.<br /><br />I won’t mention all the details because it is not fair but yes, when I signed for Arsenal, I was in touch with him saying ‘so, the first step is done, now we are waiting for the second one’. I think it could only be in a dream that we could join another club other than Dortmund but I am very happy for that. I have known him very well, he is one of my best friends and the best team-mate I have ever had. I am very happy to have him here and I think all the fans are happy to see him in an Arsenal shirt.

  <p><b>[Arsenal midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan has defended his stint at Manchester United despite struggling for consistent game time at Old Trafford]</b> I think I left an impression in Manchester, although I had difficulties. We won three titles in a year and a half - not every club does that. We won the Europa League, and I scored a goal in the final. If people say that I did not have enough success it is their opinion but I believe that I had a lot of success at the club.<br /><br />Mourinho required a lot from his players, he was very hard. Arsene Wenger is more friendly, he understands and can think about players’ situations. He is calmer - that’s the difference. Wenger’s philosophy in three words?

  <p><b>[What the hell went wrong for Mkhitaryan at Manchester United?]</b> At the beginning, we had some difficulties. It’s not very easy because you know when you have a new manager you have to try to adapt yourself to him, to the team, to the training session, to the game. But, at that time, even when I wasn’t playing, I always had a smile on my face because if I would be sad or if I would be mad, nothing would help me. That’s why I was just being patient, waiting for my time. I was sure that my time would come and I would have one more chance.</p>

It <b>[his death]</b> was a pity but that is life and life continues. I just hope he is proud looking down at me from the sky because I try to do everything to make him proud.<br /><br />My favourite team is Arsenal. I like their attacking play and fast style.

I like that and want to play there one day.<br /><br /><b>[When asked whether there is life after Alexis Sanchez]</b> There is always life.

This is not the first time that two No.10s play together. It’s just a pleasure to play alongside such a player like Mesut Ozil, because everyone knows that he is a world class player. If I’m not mistaken, he provided two assists for the first and second goals. Why not? He can assist me and I can assist him as well.<br /><br />It’s still too early to make comparisons with Manchester United, but I can say that I feel comfortable, the atmosphere is good, the team is good and the guys are good. We made a very good impression, especially in the first half when we managed to get the two goal advantage. Maybe we were not as concentrated for the second half and couldn’t play the football we wanted, but it is important that we won 2-0 and got an advantage before the second leg. I am fully concentrated on football and I want to help Arsenal. There’s still a long way to the final and a lot of games to play. We should concentrate on every match</p>

Everyone in the club is a professional himself - everyone knows what he should do and what he is expected to do.<br /><br /><b>[On difficult departure of Wenger]</b> Not only the players but the whole staff were sad. It’s not that easy to handle the exit of a man who managed the team for 22 years. You can’t imagine how amazed everyone was about the atmosphere he created.

I know very well what I am giving to the team and what the team gives me.<br /><br />We have a new manager and are trying to adapt to his philosophy and also his demands. It has been a tough start of course - we faced two good teams in Man City and Chelsea - but you don’t have any easy opponents in this league. We lost the first game and the second one as well. But that’s football. We just have to stay positive and continue working hard and the good results will come. We don’t feel any pressure. We are not thinking that something is going wrong because we are moving in the right way even if we lost two games. I don’t know why people are criticising so much. I’m not paying attention because I know if I’ve played bad or well<br /><br />I don’t think you’re going to see the Dortmund Mkhitaryan, because in Dortmund the philosophy was different, the playing style was different, the league was different. Arsenal are playing in a different league with a different manager and different team-mates. I don’t want to see the old Mkhitaryan being here at Arsenal. I want to be someone new, someone else who can show that he’s capable of doing the same for Arsenal as well. I’m not just playing football to play, I’m always playing football to win games and titles. At the end of your football career, people are going to remember you for what you have achieved, what you have won. I’m playing to win titles, I’m doing my best for this club to win titles and of course that’s my main goal</p>

Even if you have tired legs, the most important thing is to be fresh in the brain, in the mind. If you force yourself, if you push yourself to get to the end, then you will do that. You don’t have to listen to your legs, even if they are heavy or it’s hard to play. You have to do the maximum.<br /><br />Maybe that’s the positive to take, maybe it’s not. Everyone wanted to win, especially at Old Trafford. We know that it’s always hard to win here. At the end of the day, we’re also happy to get this point and try to win the next games.

The most important is to be focused and to be ready for every game because we are not going to think that we are in the top four and nothing will change. We just have to keep working and trying to our best to win three points in every game. It is not the main thing at the moment. The season is not done as we still have lots of games to play. The most important thing is to stay focused and keep winning games.<br /><br />It doesn’t matter where I play. The most important is to be in the starting line-up and to help the team win games, that is the most important thing. I don’t care if I play from the left, the right or the middle - the most important is to do something good for the team<br /><br />Everyone knows what they have to do. There is nothing to be under pressure about because we know exactly what we have to do. We know how to play the ball and understand each other to have a good connection between the players to score goals</p>

  <p><b>[Henrikh Mkhitaryan admits he wasn’t happy at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and struggled to adapt to English football]</b> Now I am in Rome and I focus on them. This is not a step backwards as a great football is played here. I wanted to change scenery and for me it is an opportunity to be seized. I have to enjoy playing football, no matter the place. I no longer felt happy. Maybe I was not fitting so well in English football. The messages after the two national matches made me happy, but now I have to concentrate on Rome. I will never give up and I will fight to the end. I’m not afraid of pressure, I’m used to it having already played with great teams. I know that the slightest mistake is criticised while a good performance is exalted. If you agree to play soccer you must be ready to face criticism. <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> is a great opportunity, I accepted immediately with enthusiasm. We didn’t even talk about money</p>

  <p><b>[Mkhitaryan blames <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a>’s methods for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> exit as freedom was removed from his game]</b> He paid more attention to tactics, so my role changed. I was starting as a winger, but had to build play with the defensive midfielder. It’s why I couldn’t contribute as many goals or assists. I like to play more freely and move wherever there’s space, but you have to do the job that the manager asks<br /><br /><b>[He began to slip down the pecking order as a result, with it quickly becoming apparent that he would need a move in order to find the regular game time he craves]</b> I couldn’t accept that I had to sit on the bench for some matches.

He is a winner by nature. He wants you to win and you do what he asks you, it is difficult for anyone. There were differences and conflicts, but they did not have a big impact on the hard work we did and the three trophies we won. <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> is a friend, like a father or brother to me.

At the beginning of the season our goal was to reach the top four, reach the Coppa Italia final and go as far as possible in Europe.<br /><br />Pressure here isn’t an issue for me. Not because of my age, but because I have played at clubs like <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. The people here live for football, it’s great. My goal is to continue playing until I am 37. I don’t know what will happen to me, or if I will be able to carry on physically that long.

  <p><b>[Henrikh Mkhitaryan says Roma’s football better for me than <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> under Emery]</b> When I was at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I had different things asked from me by the coach, people were expecting different things from here. The philosophy of Emery was different from <a href="paulo-fonseca.html">Fonseca</a>, but here I’m feeling much better because we’re playing better football and I think it matched me. I prefer <a href="paulo-fonseca.html">Fonseca</a>’s football because we’re playing very offensively, we’re trying to have the ball all the time here and of course I like this kind of game.<br /><br />I can’t say anything at the moment because the season is stopped, we don’t know when we’ll start playing again and what will happen in the summer. Football changes so quickly. One day you’re here, the other you’re there. You never know what can happen and what will happen with you<br /><br />We’re trying. It’s not easy. In this difficult moment you can’t do many things. You can only stay home to be safe and wait for everything to be resolved. I’m waking up, having breakfast, talking with family members about different things: the virus, life, the future, the past. Then in the evening I’m trying to watch a movie, with the family or sometimes on my own. Besides that, we have the programme from the team for training at home, so I’m trying to keep myself fit. When I heard the situation wasn’t the best and everyone was asking us to stay home, I stopped going outside for a walk or a run. It’s better to stay inside and be an example to everyone, to show them that this is more important, to follow the rules and be at home</p>

The main target will be the Champions League, other wins and titles. People underestimate <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a>, the Italian league, but it’s more than interesting to play here. The league is getting better and better, and last year’s transfers speak for themselves<br /><br />I do not have a lot of time left until the end of my football career, but I’m pretty sure that I’m doing my best to achieve more, because at the end of your football career everyone will remember what you have done for the club, what titles you have won. It’s very important to leave a positive note by winning a trophy or doing something good for the club. I always had a dream to play in the best European leagues and the best European clubs. And I’ve fulfilled my dream. I’m working hard and mixing my talent with hard work. It’s not always easy, but sometimes you must make a sacrifice</p>
