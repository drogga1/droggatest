  <p><b>[Henrikh Mkhitaryan says Manchester United are not looking for records]</b> We have to win, try to win the next game. We are not looking for records, we are doing our best to be in the top four and to do that you have to win games. Do not think about records because one day they will break. We are just trying to do our job by winning every game.<br /><br />Not only Marouane <b>[Fellaini]</b> but also Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata put freshness in the team. They helped us a lot up front and we are happy that they could change something in our game. We are happy to have them coming on</p>

A trophy is a trophy. It doesn’t matter if it is the League Cup, the FA Cup or the Europa League. We want to do our best to try and win them all.<br /><br /><b>[On competitive debuts to Axel Tuanzebe and goalkeeper Joel Pereira]</b> It’s great for them to play their first game. You know as a player that, when young players come into the squad, you have to help them and offer them some advice and I thought they both did well on what is a great experience for them</p>

  <p><b>[Henrikh Mkhitaryan feels too much pressure has been placed on Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba]</b> He has a very big potential. For him, it is a little bit hard because he is still 23 years old and maybe he is thinking he needs to do more than he’s doing but I know with the manager he is going to find the solution to solve it and he’s trying to do it already. Maybe people are waiting for something extraordinary from him, some miracles, but everyone has to know he’s a football player, a human being, so he just has to play the way he can play and he will do better.<br /><br /><b>[Next up for Pogba and Mkhitaryan is a trip to reigning Premier League champions Leicester City]</b> It doesn’t matter which position they are in now, they are going to play every game as a final because they are in a dangerous position. Sunday will be a big fight, a big battle, so we have to be ready for that</p>

  <p><b>[Henrikh Mkhitaryan admits he had to come through some black days before proving himself at Manchester United]</b> I really enjoy my life in Manchester, my training, my games, everything. I have settled very well and I’m working very hard to get better because I know I can do more. Coming to Manchester, maybe I didn’t show all my potential but in every game I’m trying to do my best because it’s very important for me, the fans and the club. Maybe in some games it doesn’t work, but I still keep working and trying to improve. You cannot always have good times in your life. Sometimes you have black days and maybe I wasn’t expecting that but I was ready because I had such a situation in Dortmund already.<br /><br />Everything comes from your mind. You have to push yourself to get things going in your direction. If you are stubborn, nothing will help. If you are sad, nothing will help. You have to keep positive and to work very well for your next chance</p>

As a footballer you just have to try to learn what you’ve done badly and what I could do well. During that time, I had conversations with Jose Mourinho. You can feel the confidence he gives you. I kept talking to <b>[my agent]</b> Mino Raiola. We are friends before anything else and he said ‘Micki, you know what, this is life experience’’. I said ‘I know and I will never give up. I’ve had a long way to come to Manchester United and one day for sure I will play.</p>

He helped me to become a player.<br /><br />They are both very friendly and very good at their jobs but the way they work is different. It is the first year under Jose’s management and we are working very hard. He tells us what he wants to see. Of course, it is not very easy when you have a new manager. You have to adapt to him and the team, the training sessions and the games. At the beginning we had a little bit of difficulties but then we started winning in November</p>

He spoke to me a lot. He understood what he had to do to make things better for me. To get me to grasp the psychological fundamentals. If I missed a good chance, I used to take it so badly that I wouldn’t sleep that night. Now, I’ve learnt to savour my performances.</p>

It was a very bad injury and, when I saw the footage of it, I felt very bad about it. I want to support him and tell him to stay strong and to come back as strong as he can. It is not nice to see but also that is football. Danger is a part of the game and you have to be ready for it. Of course not that kind of injury but that is football. He could not have thought that something would happen like that. It was a battle between him and the opponent and he got a very bad injury.</p>

  <p><b>[Henrikh Mkhitaryan believes there is a lot more to come from him at Manchester United]</b> No, not yet. I still have places where I can improve and room to improve. I know myself very well and I am sure than I can do better, and I will do better, because I am confident. I know very well within myself I can do more. I want to say that, for next year, I am going to have more goals and more assists. Of course, you can improve in every aspect. There is not one side that you can say I am good on it and then I don’t have to work on that facet. You have to work on every side to your game, in every aspect, because you just have to keep working hard to improve.<br /><br />Yes, of course, I missed the EFL Cup final but the most important thing is the fact that the team won it. For me, it’s the team success in the first place, more than any individual one, so I will be happy if I can get to another final this year. You don’t ever know what will happen tomorrow but we will keep our heads clear, try to think positively and get the best for us. It is one of my goals for this season - to win the Europa League. Of course, I know it is not going to be easy, particularly at this stage of the competition as there are no easy opponents. Obviously, we understand the importance of the tie with Anderlecht in the quarter-finals.<br /><br />We know that we are going to have two very tough games and, of course, Anderlecht are not easy opponents. I realise some people think: ‘Ah, we’ve got Anderlecht, so it is going to be easy to beat them’ but it is not like that. I know this because I have watched some of their games during their participation in Europe and I can say they are playing very well and they have very good with players of high quality</p>

They are very good players. They are, I think, Manchester United players. Matic does a big job on the pitch. He tries to recover all the balls. He defensively does a big job.

Last year, we drew too many games and that was the problem. We could create many chances to score, but we couldn’t; I don’t know, maybe we had no luck, or maybe the luck was more in Europa League games but, this year, we are focused on improving that aspect: to win the games, and to not have too many draws.<br /><br />It’s a very good start, but we still have to play 36 games. Every game is a new game, and it doesn’t matter about what we have done before.<br /><br />Now we are going to play Leicester and it won’t be easy because they have started very well as well. Of course, they lost the first game 4-3 <b>[at Arsenal]</b> but they were amazing. In the second game <b>[against Brighton]</b>, they won 2-0, so it’s going to be very hard. It’s always tough to play Leicester, they are very good and they are playing very well. Of course, for us, we have a big responsibility because we are the first in the table after two games, but we will try to win the third game, and to make sure everything goes very well</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> loanee Mkhitaryan hoping for permanent Stadio Olimpico switch]</b> Of course I would like to be at Roma next season, not only next season <b>[but]</b> for another few years. But I still have a contract with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and it’s not up to me. It’s up to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and Roma if they will agree on terms of the transfer fee. So my thinking is to train hard, to play hard, to look forward to what’s going to happen. Of course, if I’m not going to stay at Roma I have to go back to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I’m not complaining, football life changes so quickly so you have to be ready to play wherever you are. If not in Rome, I’m going to go back and play for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, if not, I’m going to stay here and play for Rome</p>

  <p><b>[Henrikh Mkhitaryan extends Roma loan deal from <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> I’m very pleased. I’m happy to extend my stay here, because I still have things that I haven’t achieved yet that I want to achieve. I’m looking forward to it</p>
