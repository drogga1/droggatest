<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Lisa Fallon: ‘Travel agent’ jibe inspires new London City Lionesses coach]</b> It genuinely hasn’t been an issue with those I’ve worked with. They’ve all judged me on being able to bring value to the set-up. I’ve loved every part of the journey. Every part has challenged me in different ways. Working in various environments has been brilliant because you experience different cultures<br /><br /><b>[The Lionesses have appointed a manager with an impressive CV. In the early days, Fallon became the first woman to manage an Irish men’s side when amateur club Lakelands offered her the job]</b> It was football. I met the players, took a training session and the players were great. Maybe they didn’t know what to expect but I know they enjoyed it because they were all there for the next one!<br /><br /><b>[The Lionesses finished fourth when the Championship season was curtailed]</b> I’m delighted. Once I had the chance to speak to chairwoman Diane Culligan, I could see there was an opportunity to build something at the club. The timing felt right<br /><br /><b>[The early days in the job involved hours of video conferencing - so what’s it like meeting your players via Zoom?]</b> It’s different, but the key is being able to adapt and adjust. You are getting to see people at home and see their dogs! It’s been great to see people face to face rather than over the phone. <br /><br /><b>[Her last role was working as an analyst and strategy coach under <a href="emma-hayes.html">Emma Hayes</a> at Chelsea]</b> It’s an incredible club with incredible infrastructure. The work Emma has done for the women’s game has got to be lauded. She is fantastic. I think there’s a great passion for women’s football and the growth has been significant over the last few years. I just don’t see that stopping. The women’s game has encountered many challenges through its journey and I don’t see this being a challenge that will knock it too far back. There are too many people who believe in the game for anything other than the development to continue</p>
