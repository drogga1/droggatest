  <p><b>[Mexico, SUM confident relationship can continue to prosper]</b> That doesn’t change. We are committed to continuing the tour as we’ve organized it, with the same quality, the same experience the fans have come to expect. What this does is just assures us that we’ll be in Dallas the next four years. It helps us build programming around the games. What we believe is this is an unbelievable team, but ultimately the experience, what fans feel, is different, so we want to make sure we start building more around it and make sure we hit those cultural touchpoints for fans.<br /><br />It just means we have to work a little bit harder in terms of the dates that are available for the games and how we schedule them. Fortunately, we have a wonderful relationship with Concacaf as well, so as we get the calendars over the next four years and as they actually brought to life the Nations League, we worked very closely to identify the windows that made sense to continue to do what we do which is important to us and important to the federation. It’s been very well thought-out. We have no concerns about being able to maintain the pace, the quality and the experience we’ve been able to build over the 16 years</p>
