  <p><b>[David Luiz explains why he returned to England for a second spell with the newly-crowned <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> FC]</b> I was winning everything in Paris. I was there for two years and won all the titles in France. I had a great life, great credibility with the club … I had everything. But then I took a risk to come back to the one country that was not that happy with me. Where they always criticised me a lot even after winning the Champions League, the Europa League or where I’d played all the games. That’s why it was a risk. And I love the risk. If you don’t take risks in your life - in your professional life but also in everyday life - you never feel anything new, so I <b>[chose to]</b> taste something new. I don’t like to stay always with the easy life, but I’m happy now because I took the right decision</p>

Of course it is a big step up and it’s up to everyone to do their job<br /><br /><b>[Luiz insists it is up to the youngsters themselves to work hard and stay focused during the ups and downs of a gruelling season]</b> I think when you’re young you have to think about you opening the door - not the door opening for you. The young players have to work in this mentality. Because life is not easy. Every day another boy is born and another boy wants to be a footballer. And it’s up to everybody to work hard and for them to knock on the door and open the door the have the talent for that they have the potential for that, they just have to show that every single day</p>

It’s great to have him back and not just him but all his staff as well because they have known this club for a long time, they love this club and they were waiting for this opportunity<br /><br />Everybody understands this moment and we have to be patient but in the end everybody wants to win. If you don’t think about winning trophies then you cannot play for Chelsea. The ambition has to be high.

It will be good to work with him, try to help him and also give him a bit of my experience in football around the world. I hope we both can do big things here<br /><br /><b>[Martinelli and Luiz have become the ninth and tenth Brazilians to link up with Arsenal]</b> Edu was a great player, a very talented player - someone who everyone enjoyed watching play. He was a great guy, a great person and he is ready for this role because he’s intelligent, he knows how to be with people, he knows how to win things, he is a winner and he is going to try to improve the club. I think around the world people are attracted to good players, especially Brazilian players, so Gilberto was one of the best Brazilian players, maybe the best Brazilian player who played here. I had the opportunity to play with Denilson when I was 10 years old, we played together. Gabriel is my friend, Andres Santos is my friend, so everyone is trying to do big things with this big club</p>

  <p><b>[David Luiz has urged his Arsenal team-mates to dream]</b> In life you have to believe. If you don’t try things you are never going to know if you can do it or not. My philosophy on life is to be positive and to be a dreamer. But understand to dream is one thing and to achieve your dream you have a lot to do. I can dream and we can fight for something big. That is always going to be my speech to everyone - it is possible for us and everybody. It is up to the team, the team is going to dream more, the team is going to prepare better, understand the game and that is it<br /><br />I try to give what I have learnt from my life. I think you can give when you have something to do. I had many fantastic moments in my career and many titles and I just try to make them understand that everything is possible if you work hard and if you believe, are humble, keep your feet on the ground and take it step by step<br /><br />I am a guy with ambition and that is why I moved. I could choose a comfortable zone and get money and be cool and that is it. But I like a new a challenge and new things in my life. This is what gives me oxygen and give me motivation and also to really enjoy this moment of my life. Everyone knows I was so happy in Chelsea and won many trophies there. I had a real honest conversation with Lamps and Lamps had different ideas for his plans for the year. So the best way for me to respect the club where I can was to move on and try to do a new challenge. And give him the opportunity to do his job<br /><br />One day football will finish and you have to try to do things and improve every day as one day I will miss football. I am trying to be first honest with my heart and honest in the way to try to feel new things. I am so happy here as since the first day I felt this welcome. This is a big club and I want to be here and see it shine - on the pitch and outside. This is what my motivation every day. That is why I left my family when I was 14 to try to do something around the world and I’m going to try and do my best here<br /><br />The game against Newcastle and on Saturday shows the team now understands what is the moment, how is the game and how to take the three points. Burnley are a fantastic team who know how to be physical. It is never easy to play against them and I am so happy about the debut, the points and the atmosphere. I’m also so happy as the team understood the moments of the game. Moments where you play more with possession and moments where you play more physical and win the second ball. In the end we did great</p>

He saw the shirt like that, but I don’t know. It’s difficult for them so I cannot complain with their efforts because it is difficult for them too. If you play with an extra-large shirt now, there could be a penalty every time. It’s interpretation, so I think if you pull someone with power and you change his strength to go to the ball, it’s different. It was just a reflex but that’s it, it made the penalty and after that he gave me the yellow. So on the third goal I could not make the foul and put my team in trouble with 10 men. So I think it conditioned my game a bit after that and it was more difficult<br /><br /><b>[Luiz claimed the power of a shirt tug, thus the influence it has over play, is often difficult to judge]</b> If I pull your shirt like that and if you put your hand like that, it’s different, the power is different. That’s what I said. With VAR it is difficult for them, they cannot see the power, so if I pull like this <b>[gives demonstration]</b> it’s more power than just like this. So it depends on the interpretation, like I said. But if you see the shirt going like that it’s also difficult for the referee to say it is not a penalty. That’s why I don’t judge him and complain against him. I’m just saying my view. The reflex is in one second you turn, you do, and you take <b>[away your hand]</b>. But it’s like that, football is like that. We have to look forward. I spoke with Mo, he’s my friend and he said he didn’t feel that. But that’s football. Football is like that</p>

Football is like that. Every week is a new history and we have to try and learn and improve our game<br /><br />I think I am just trying to bring here what I did in the last clubs I play for, trying to make everybody believe we can do some big things. For me it is about the end, it is not about the beginning.

I think in life you have to be able to learn every single day.<br /><br /><b>[Jurgen Klopp’s side ran out deserving winners after the interval, but Luiz’s insists there were positive stories take from the display]</b> Of course we are not happy when we lose a game.

Also, we’ve had some games in the cup, in the Europa League, where we’ve changed the team <b>[but the results]</b> have been amazing. That’s what <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> means today - we have a lot of players in the squad with quality, so everybody can play. Everybody is trying to help the team<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether the Gunners deserved all three points]</b> Yes, I think so. We could have scored more in the first half, but we controlled the game. The second half was more of a typical <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> match. Bournemouth have amazing players, so the second half was more difficult. They created some chances, we created some chances and it’s always like that. When you have the opportunities to kill the match, you have to try to kill the match. If not, all the teams have the quality to come back. In the second half, they were trying to come back into the game but we were strong enough to keep the clean sheet and win the game<br /><br />When it’s 1-0, if you don’t concede, you win the game. I think it was more about that. Our style is to play with the ball, but sometimes it’s good to understand if you have to win 1-0.

I have a two-year contract with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I have ambitions and goals here with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, so I came here. But we never know in the future<br /><br />For me, if you start something, and we’ve just started <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and all of the competitions, if you don’t think you can win the competition then you won’t start anything in your life. I want to win titles with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. I want to improve and adapt myself for the style of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, as a club and how the manager wants us to play. I think we can do that together. My vision, my ambition and my will is always to fight for the title and between the club, the players and the coach, we have the possibility to fight for the title. I think this club deserves to shine again</p>

  <p><b>[David Luiz offers passionate response to critics &amp; states <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> ambition]</b> People watch television and have their own clubs, and they speak for their clubs. In England I have won everything. In France also. Portugal as well. In the end, to risk a pass where I want my team to score or just take that easy pass and don’t take anything from the game, it’s not me. It’s never going to be me, I want to play to win and make my team win. To have a reputation or not, people can say what they want to. I respect them but if you take my numbers and my statistics, I have won more than others.<br /><br />I am never going to hide. I have played with many players in my career who don’t have the personality, they hide themselves, they don’t want the ball to make a mistake. They are scared to play football. My actions and my life, I try to live in an honest way. I’m going to win some things, I’m going to lose some things but I never want to lose my character and the way that I love football. I play football because I love football. If not, it’s better to stop and go and do another thing<br /><br />What I can say about <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is that we have the opportunity to make this club shine again. How? Working hard and winning titles. This has to be the mentality. I don’t like to start something and just be ‘let’s fight for the top four’ or ‘our team wants to win just one cup’. No. My team, when I see the players and the club, when I see the supporters and the vibe, this club has the opportunity to fight for everything. It is my oxygen every day, I want to fight</p>

I have had the opportunity to have many coaches during my career. He is intelligent, he was a player, he is clever. I think he’s going to be one of the best, but it’s part of our job to help him do that, especially in the beginning because everybody doubts. But I really trust in this philosophy, I really trust in the way he sees football. That’s why we could see <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> dominate the first half with amazing football, with a lot of quality. I think if we scored the second goal, it would have been a different game<br /><br />He knows football. When you know football, it is much easier to explain. It’s much easier to try to help and it’s much easier to understand the heads of the players on the pitch. It’s not an easy job for him, especially coming in the middle of the season. He didn’t choose the players or anything, but he’s going to try to do his best and we as players have to try to do our best too because this club deserves to shine. It deserves to play amazing football like in the first half.<br /><br />We are not in the best position in the table. It has not been a very good year for us. But there is still the possibility to improve, to learn, and to do what we did in the first half. I think everybody saw a team with personality, with ideas, with a connection with the fans, with top players. I think Mikel is trying to impose his philosophy as soon as possible. We have a lot of players with talent and a lot of players who are going to be top players in the future. They are trying to learn quickly. Then it is up to us to try to get some points and results because we need that</p>

If you don’t believe and you don’t dream, or believe in that dream, it’s impossible to do it.<br /><br />The first thing is you have to dream and then after that you have to study how to do it.

  <p><b>[Arsenal not part of David Luiz’s retirement plan as he approaches final year of contract]</b> I always said that I would like to end my career at <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>. In football everything changes, what is true today, tomorrow is a lie, but my feeling is not! I love <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>. My dream is to step on the pitch of Estadio da Luz in their colours. For all that I lived and felt, for what <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> is in my life and in my history, for everything, <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a> is bigger than any player</p>

  <p><b>[David Luiz’s <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> future in doubt as Gunners stall on contract decision]</b> Mikel is doing amazing, I am enjoying being almost 33 years old and still learning and improving and to see how beautiful football is. Every day he changes something more and how a new idea and philosophy can still improve me as a person, as a player and as a leader.<br /><br />I always want to play. I always play in the way the coach wants to play. It doesn’t matter the side, it doesn’t matter which position. You guys know I played a lot of positions during my career. I’m always ready for that.</p>

  <p><b>[David Luiz contract decision sheds light on <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s difficult transfer future]</b> Mikel is doing amazing. I am enjoying being almost 33 years old and still learning and improving and to see how beautiful football is. Mikel has tried to make us understand where to play and how to play. He gives us a plan and has brought a philosophy where everybody has to think for the best of the club. And the best for the club is to make the club shine again. It doesn’t matter when, or by who, that was lost. What matters is to bring it back<br /><br />David’s a player that has won more trophies than anybody else in that dressing room. We have to use that in a very powerful way. I wanted him to step up, I wanted him to put all his qualities - his personality and his experience - towards the team and he made a big step forward. I am very, very pleased with him. In the games he has played under me so far he has been terrific. His attitude in training, the way he communicates with his team-mates, his desire to still learn, it’s superb. I am delighted with him.</p>

My dream is to end my career at <a href="benfica.html">Benfica</a>. When, I don’t know, but it will happen… it will, if President Vieira allows me and if the fans want me to come back. It will be one of the most beautiful moments of my career</p>

  <p><b>[David Luiz has accepted responsibility for his role in <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s 3-0 loss to Manchester City]</b> It was not the team’s fail, it was my fault. The coach is amazing, all the players did amazing, it was just my fault. I should have taken a different decision in the last two months. I didn’t - it was all about my contract. I don’t want to use that as an alibi or excuse, it’s just my fault and that’s it. I love to be here that is why I continue to train hard and that is why I came today. Nobody asked me to speak, it is up to me to show my face. I want to stay. The coach knows and wants me to stay, we are waiting for the decisions</p>

What Mikel is trying to build is something big and I really believe in his philosophy. He has tried to help us and give us the direction and how to live life, how to be inside the club and for me, this is so important to have</p>

  <p><b>[Arteta’s comments suggested that Luiz was not in the right frame of mind to play because of the doubts over his future, something the defender seemed to admit when he faced up to the media after the defeat]</b> It’s not the team’s fault, it was my fault.

I took the decision to play, I should have taken another decision in the last two months, but I didn’t. It was all about my contract, whether I stay or not. I have 14 days to be here, and that’s it.
