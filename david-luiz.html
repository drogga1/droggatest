I love him and I think everyone has already seen that I have a good relationship with him. He was playing in lower divisions and was getting better and better and now he is one of the best midfielders in the world. For Leicester he was one of the keys for the title, and I hope he can be one of the keys for the title this season too!</p>

He’s a great player who’s in fantastic form right now. He’s playing well, and I’m happy for him because sometimes people talk a lot without knowing anything, and he’s had to go through that. But it’s normal people talk about the best players in the world, Diego is one of them. I don’t know. Things were normal. Everyone has offers, everyone has things to talk about. He’s happy, always wants to play football, that’s what’s important for me.<br /><br />I think <b>[for]</b> Diego, the most important thing is he scored.

For sure, he is playing with a little pain in his knee, but he is a warrior. I think he is playing very well and I am pleased for him, but I hope to continue in this way. For sure, he is showing me great attitude, great will to continue to fight despite sometimes having a bit of pain.<br /><br />I don’t know about this news <b>[Willian to Manchester United]</b>. This is not important for me. What’s important is the present and to be focused. To try to make the best choice for the team - to try to win. There is this possibility <b>[they could start against Burnley]</b> because we are talking about two great players and to have Cesc and Willian on the bench or on the pitch, it’s very important. I think that also Pedro is playing very well. He is in great form. Cesc, when he plays, he is playing very well. Will I call him to come on the pitch <b>[and start]</b>? I could. I have different solutions, for sure, but for me the most important thing is that I can count on the squad and every single player is in good form. It is very important to have good form and, above all, a good attitude, a good behaviour to be involved totally with the team. Whether you start in the XI or on the bench and then you play</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea vs Spurs is a battle of ugly guys vs monsters]</b> For me, they are an amazing team with an amazing coach. I think it is the best physical team in the league. All the XI guys are monsters. I love that team. It will be a difficult game for us. We need to be ready to play against one of the best teams in this league. It will be a nice game because it is a semi-final. Chelsea also has some monsters, some ugly guys like a monster. Some guys who play like a monster, like <b>[N’Golo]</b> Kante. Different kinds of monster. No <b>[I joke]</b>, it will be a fantastic game. Two teams in amazing shape. It will be top quality to watch and we have to play top quality to win.<br /><br />This is history, this is the magic of football. I think that rivalry is the nice part of football. If you look at it in a positive way, you have positive eyes and not look at it in a bad way. Is rivalry about fighting? No it is not, it is about two amazing teams want to win and to win trophies in the best league in the world and get into the Champions League every year. I have the opportunity to be there. It is good to be there in the semi-final of this amazing competition. I had the opportunity to win it one time. Let’s go step by step, it will be a difficult game against Tottenham.

  <p><b>[David Luiz delighted with life at Chelsea after PSG move]</b> I am a positive guy, I always imagine the best for myself. I am also a realist so when I decided to come back here, I knew I would come back to the most difficult league in the world. It was difficult for us in the beginning but we played very, very well after that. Not just me but all the team, all the players. It is good to live in this way. Of course, I am happy but there is still a long way to <b>[go to]</b> win the title. I don’t remember the past but, no, I think I am playing very well. It is also down to the results and the team. Sometimes it is good to see good things when you don’t get the results. I am in good shape, the team is in good shape. I am happy with this. I am old and I have more experience, yes. I am more mature, yes. I am happy..<br /><br />It is not finished yet. I am trying to give my best every game. Of course, it is nice to hear from ex-players who won a lot and know everything. I understand football. In football, everything can change from one day to the other day. I keep calm and I keep my feet on the ground. I keep working hard. We are in front, yes, but we didn’t win yet. So keep calm, let’s play game-by-game and I will do my best in every game.<br /><br />I want to win all the games so if you win the league before, you can concentrate on the FA Cup. You can rest, it is one less pressure, so it is normal to think like this but it doesn’t matter. When you play for a big club, you need to be ready every day. You need to be mentally strong and to work hard every day. Of course this season, without being in Europe we have more time to prepare for our games, rest and everything. I am happy with all the players, the coach, the club. I am happy.<br /><br />I think it is more the tactical position <b>[in the middle of a three-man defence]</b>. You need to be ready to occupy the space for the others. You are more reacting than being in the action. So it depends more on reactions. I think the system is very good because we have all the right players to play in the positions. So you can say, ‘Victor Moses is amazing in this position and no-one knew that before’. It is not just the system, I think it is about the characters of all the players. I think they exactly mix well and this is good for the team. I am happy with this</p>

I think the experience gives you many things, and yes, as a person and a footballer, you have to if you want to learn. If you are open every day. I read more of the game now, I can understand more of the game, it is a different pressure now with the big games. Many, many things. I think if you want to improve, you need to think you are a better player than you were. I’ve worked with six, seven, eight coaches, they have improved my game, different leagues and different countries.<br /><br /><b>[Pressed on whether the English top-flight had changed in away way during his stint in France]</b> I think the intensity is the same, I think the level is the same, because it is always six, or seven teams fighting for the title. I don’t see a lot of difference. It continues with the high credibility, it is one of the best leagues in the world, if not the best, and it is difficult to win</p>

If I could win both that would be amazing.<br /><br />You always hope for the best and hope for great things. When I decided to come back I knew I would work with a fantastic coach, at a fantastic club, in a fantastic city and with many fantastic players. You hope and have ambition to do something big but it depends on your work throughout the season. I think we are working very hard and trying to improve the team every day, which is why we’re fighting for the title. It’s nice to have the pressure, it means we are fighting for something big but we must keep our feet on the ground and try to do our best</p>

  <p><b>[David Luiz explains why he returned to England for a second spell with the newly-crowned <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> FC]</b> I was winning everything in Paris. I was there for two years and won all the titles in France. I had a great life, great credibility with the club … I had everything. But then I took a risk to come back to the one country that was not that happy with me. Where they always criticised me a lot even after winning the Champions League, the Europa League or where I’d played all the games. That’s why it was a risk. And I love the risk. If you don’t take risks in your life - in your professional life but also in everyday life - you never feel anything new, so I <b>[chose to]</b> taste something new. I don’t like to stay always with the easy life, but I’m happy now because I took the right decision</p>

In the rules that’s a penalty but if the referee gives that one, he has to give many more.<br /><br />The performance of the team was amazing. We played a great game and controlled it from the first minute. It’s not easy to play against Atletico, one of the best teams in the Champions League from the last few years. They know how to play against everybody. I was happy with the performance of the team and in the end we got what we deserved.<br /><br />We need to be honest, we played really well, with character and experience. We didn’t lose our passion, or our style of football, and we deserved to win. We have four more games to play and we have to get more points to qualify. We now have two very difficult games against Roma so let’s keep our feet on the ground because it’s not easy to get points in the Champions League</p>

We play high, with a lot of possession of the ball, in a technical way. He’s trying to help us every single day to quickly learn his philosophy, to do our best for Chelsea. You guys know me - I like to be happy, to enjoy my life. We have the best job in the world. He came with this idea as a human being, so I think if you’re not happy to do your job it doesn’t matter if you’re a footballer or not. We have to be happy to do our best. A new philosophy always takes time. But it also depends on us.<br /><br />We are dedicated every day and doing things every single day in training, especially in this beginning with these friendly games - we are trying to learn quickly. It depends also on us. It is a physical and tactical challenge in pre-season, every single aspect every day, physical, tactical, technical. Football depends on everything. It is not just tactical, it is not just physical, you have to try every single day. Yes, it is a challenge for everybody. It is good to have fantastic players, more than just 11. You have many players that can play in the starting 11, so it is a positive challenge for everybody. We are trying to train really hard every single day, double sessions, to learn quickly. It’s not just like that, we’re doing that every single day.<br /><br /><b>[On Jorginho]</b> He’s a fantastic player, I’m so happy to play with him. He’s top, top class.

I have played with many players, different age, different times of life, so it is great to a player like him here.

To leave Chelsea, he would have to do something totally out of reality, or if he really wanted to leave, or if Chelsea really wanted to kick him out. This is not the reality. Chelsea loves Willian, Willian loves Chelsea, so that’s great. He’s a fantastic player and a fantastic friend. I’ve known Willian since I was eight, so a long time. Willian loves Chelsea.

I was just working, and trying to do my best, and start this new season with a new coach. He said to me, ‘everybody has the opportunity’, you just have to show him character, physical quality, technical quality, so since the first day I’m trying to do that. I was thinking to stay here because I have a contract. <b>[Pep]</b> Guardiola is a fantastic coach, and also Sarri is a fantastic coach. At the moment I’m in love with his philosophy, with the way he works, the way he is training, the way he loves football. Everything: the way he thinks about football, the way he loves football, the way he works with us, the way he sees the details, the things he can see. He just tries to help us to understand his philosophy and then after that, the collective results are going to be on the pitch<br /><br />I have won 17 titles in my career, and only two of those <b>[playing]</b> in a back three. It doesn’t matter, you just have to understand the collective philosophy. If you win, it’s good - it’s always like that. I’m always happy to do my best to help the coach and the club. I hope we can understand it quickly and can fight for all the titles. When you play for a big club you have to be ready to try to fight for the titles, and we’re going to fight for that<br /><br />It was a difficult game against one of the best teams in the world, everybody knows that. We have started a new philosophy, a new method, with a new coach. City are in the third consecutive year with the same coach, the same philosophy. In the first year, there was a struggle and it was not easy <b>[for them]</b> to understand the Guardiola philosophy, and now you can see every single one knows what they have to do on the pitch. We are starting now, building a new philosophy with a new manager, so it’s never easy to play against them. It was a great game, congratulations to them</p>

It’s not easy to win points in the Premier League so if we can get them now, at the beginning of the season, when we are adapted to the style it’s going to be even better for us.<br /><br />It’s always difficult to play against a line of five, and then a line of four, playing a low block. We were trying to move the ball as quickly as possible and trying to find some gaps to score but we dominated the game and we deserved to win. It wasn’t easy, especially in the first half. In the second half we started to create more chances because they became a bit tired and spaces started to open for us so that was good. They were trying to kick the ball long, win the second balls and create superiority in the box. It was a typical Premier League game. We went 1-0 up and then they scored to make it 1-1 but we were mature enough to be calm and try to score another goal, which is what we did, so that’s good. We played another great game, it’s always difficult to get points at Newcastle but we controlled the game</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea failed to maintain their winning streak against West Ham]</b> Of course we are disappointed. We didn’t play a fantastic game, we didn’t create a lot. It was too slow, moving the ball to create the gaps or our movements without the ball, and that is why we couldn’t score. I think our plan is fantastic. On Sunday we didn’t play at our high level so that is why we didn’t win. We know that many teams now are going to play against us this way, with a low block and trying to play on the counter-attack, so there was not a lot of space but it is up to us to try to find a solution.<br /><br /><b>[Chelsea will have the opportunity to leapfrog Jurgen Klopp’s side]</b> The best games are like that.

  <p><b>[David Luiz thinks that talk of Chelsea being Eden Hazard dependent has been overblown]</b> We have many talented players here, not just Eden. It is every single one. Even when we lost Pedro in the first 10 minutes of the game and in came Ruben <b>[Loftus-Cheek]</b>. We have other talented players also. This is a big club and at a big club, you cannot just play with 11 players. You have to have a minimum of 18 or 19 players ready to play and we are happy because we have more than 20. This is why you try to prepare well during pre-season to be ready during the season. During the season anything can happen, some injuries, some players not being well, many things can happen. We try to do our best and answer every question. Thursday <b>[against BATE]</b> was almost another team playing but with the same mentality, spirit and happiness. Everyone has to be ready to play. Alvaro <b>[Morata]</b> is a great player. He is doing amazing. Sometimes when the strikers don’t score and the pressure comes on them they love that. They love to score goals. We just say to him to keep doing what you are doing and the goals will come naturally, like they did today.<br /><br />I think when you are a leader, you try to give that for the others. Sarri is our leader, he tries to show us what he wants to do and that’s it. We follow him. We just try to enjoy, to do our best and try to win some games. I think life is also about that. If you are not happy about something then you have to change so this is the main thing you have to do every single day. It is one of the best jobs in the world. So we try to train hard every day, to train with discipline, to try to play with responsibility but also happiness. Of course, he has his philosophy and he tries to show us every single day. We try to improve ourselves and the team. We are trying to do it. The results are coming because we are working hard every single day. I am so happy also because he is a great human. He knows how to teach us, how to improve us, when he is like that then it is easy to understand him and to try to be fantastic inside the pitch. I think I had the opportunity to play in many fantastic squads and I won with a great teams and lost in great teams. I think this team is trying to improve every day. The manager has been here for three or four months now. He is trying to improve our style of football and philosophy. The Premier League is not easy. It is just the beginning, we are keeping our feet on the ground and going game-by-game<br /><br />When you play for big clubs and big clubs have the opportunity to play in many many competitions. I think it is amazing. I think it is better to have games than training. I think then you have the possibilities to win titles. I am a lucky guy because I am always playing in big clubs and at big clubs you always try to win titles. I love that</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea matchwinner David Luiz happy to accept criticism]</b> I know what it means to play for a big club. Big clubs it’s like that: if you win, everything is good. If you lose, it’s your fault, especially defenders and goalkeepers. Strikers never lose games… we have to be honest and say that. We have to accept that in the right way, in an intelligent way. It was good to play against a fantastic team, keep the clean sheet and have a great game.<br /><br />It’s never easy to play against Man City. They are synchronised, they have three years together, so they know what they have to do.When you press high and if you’re able to come out of this pressure, after you have a lot of space to enjoy. It was a team with humility, but also a team with the right planning. It was a bad result against Wolves. We’re happy because we did great against the best team in the league.

Not just with Antonio but with Gary Cahill, Andreas Christensen and Ethan Ampadu. I think that in this kind of philosophy, we have to be ready to defend as a collective team but also in individual moments. I think every year, it is the same. It is a big club and we don’t have just two names for this position, we have four or five names. I think it is normal and great for us. We have five fantastic players<br /><br />I think in the first half we did well and what we wanted, but the second we were a bit passive. Brighton noticed that, we moved the ball too slow and we gave the opportunity to the other side. I think we didn’t dominate them <b>[Wolves]</b> so much in the first half like we did yesterday, but it is something we have to work on, to change our mentality.

We have had many meetings already asking that if someone doesn’t believe, they can say. Nobody said anything. It’s because everyone believes. The most important thing is for us to keep our philosophy, to believe in what we are doing. We did that against Malmo; we were trying to play from the beginning to the end. We are doing what he wants us to do and we are trying to improve. It is part of the process. We lost against maybe the best team in the world in Manchester City. They were better than us from the beginning to the end. We lost a few matches because it is part of the process. The teams that are at the top of the table now are ones with managers who have been there for more than three years. There is a big difference when you have already understood everything; it is much easier to play football. I think we are in the right way to still improve and become a fantastic team. This is normal. I have played in big clubs for many, many years. When you win it is good, but when you lose nobody is going to be happy, and the pressure is going to be there. We are working together and we work for them <b>[the fans]</b>. We will try to make them happy and we will do everything we can to try to make them happy. I think we have to be positive and think about what we can do now because the past is the past - we cannot change it. We have to do things that we can do now..<br /><br />Yes it was important, to put our minds on our goals for the season. We did a great game against a difficult team and it is never easy to play here. It was a great atmosphere. The other team were great physically and tactically. They fought to the end but we controlled the game. We could have scored more but they were dangerous sometimes. We still won and that is what we came for. It is never good to concede a goal; it is part of our job not to concede just as it is part of our job to score. It was still a positive night because we won, but it will be tough at Stamford Bridge<br /><br />Even before <b>[<a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> took over]</b> they were a great team, with a great manager. <b>[Jose]</b> Mourinho tried to do everything for the best of Manchester United but they decided to change. <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> has come in and he is doing amazing.

Sterling’s hit the bar and went in. Aguero’s <b>[squeezed in]</b>. Sometimes the luck is not on your side. I think we did a great game and you have to be intelligent in life to take the positive sides, positive things and learn from it. The coach has the power over the group. He has our respect. People can think in a negative way or a positive way. It is about our lives, it is always like that. People are negative, people are positive, people are happy, they are sad. For me, there is not a problem here for that. We all believe in his philosophy, we all believe in the way he wants us to play. That’s why we did a great game against the best team in Europe at the moment. Apart from that, it was a misunderstanding and we all want to do what is best for Chelsea.<br /><br />It was more of a misunderstanding because it is never easy for us to listen from afar. I didn’t know if the coach wanted to make the change because it was his decision or because he’d <b>[Kepa]</b> already been on the floor twice. Kepa was saying, ‘No, I’m good, I can stay on the pitch’, but from far you can’t understand. You have the fans too, they start to boo <b>[so it’s hard to hear]</b>. We saw that. I’m sure if Kepa knew the coach wished to change him because it was his decision, he would have come off because he is a great professional, he is a great boy and would respect that. But I think he just didn’t know if the coach was changing him because he was on the floor twice or if he wanted to change him because it was his decision<br /><br />During the season we had some great performances like the one at Wembley, but our problem has been not being consistent. We have to learn from that and be consistent. We have another important game to play against Tottenham on Wednesday. It’s another big, big game and we have to play like we did against Man City.

It’s also going to be the final of the Super Cup next season. So I think the English sides are finishing this season well and will start the next one well too. For many years it was difficult for the English teams to understand how to rotate the team and how to get to the same level for every competition. This season they did great.<br /><br />I think during the season we have had different periods. I remember in the first three months, people were so excited with us. They were saying ‘everyone has understood it so quickly. Oh, Sarri-ball - everyone is playing well’. ‘Now we can see Chelsea with the possession blah blah blah’. After that it changed to ‘nobody knows anything, Chelsea are not good enough’. I think this is normal in the first season of a coach. We have done our best throughout the season. Nobody bet that we would go to the last game of the Premier League having already qualified for the Champions League. We can finish in the top three, not just the top four. Remember, we were at one stage 11 or 12 points behind Tottenham and now we are there. It is not about how you start. It’s not about the beginning. It’s how you end.

He is passionate about his work. He builds the team with spirit and passion for the game, I think it was great for him to be at <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and now also <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because he can speak French and all the top players from his team now, they speak French and it is great to connect with players.<br /><br />odern football the first striker is the goalkeeper with his feet, and the first defenders are the strikers. I love that and it is the evolution of football. I remember when I started no one wanted me to play from the back, no one wanted me to kick the ball long and it depended on the style of the coach, but now everyone understands</p>

I have had the opportunity to have many coaches during my career. He is intelligent, he was a player, he is clever. I think he’s going to be one of the best, but it’s part of our job to help him do that, especially in the beginning because everybody doubts. But I really trust in this philosophy, I really trust in the way he sees football. That’s why we could see <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> dominate the first half with amazing football, with a lot of quality. I think if we scored the second goal, it would have been a different game<br /><br />He knows football. When you know football, it is much easier to explain. It’s much easier to try to help and it’s much easier to understand the heads of the players on the pitch. It’s not an easy job for him, especially coming in the middle of the season. He didn’t choose the players or anything, but he’s going to try to do his best and we as players have to try to do our best too because this club deserves to shine. It deserves to play amazing football like in the first half.<br /><br />We are not in the best position in the table. It has not been a very good year for us. But there is still the possibility to improve, to learn, and to do what we did in the first half. I think everybody saw a team with personality, with ideas, with a connection with the fans, with top players. I think Mikel is trying to impose his philosophy as soon as possible. We have a lot of players with talent and a lot of players who are going to be top players in the future. They are trying to learn quickly.

I didn’t know <b>[about him]</b>. I had heard some things about a little guy doing well. When I saw him I said ‘wow’. Not just because of the talent as a footballer <b>[but]</b> especially because of the mentality. I think he wants to improve, wants to learn and understands that he has the opportunity of his life. He wants to change his status, wants to be part of the team and part of the club - I think this is a very important thing for players to understand today</p>

  <p><b>[David Luiz on sleeping]</b> If you sleep four hours happy, you’re going to sleep better than eight hours sad. The result of people when they are happy is 10 times better than when they are sad. For me, you have to have fun not just in football, but in life. That’s the most important thing - and Mikel has brought that back</p>

  <p><b>[David Luiz contract decision sheds light on <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s difficult transfer future]</b> Mikel is doing amazing. I am enjoying being almost 33 years old and still learning and improving and to see how beautiful football is. Mikel has tried to make us understand where to play and how to play. He gives us a plan and has brought a philosophy where everybody has to think for the best of the club. And the best for the club is to make the club shine again. It doesn’t matter when, or by who, that was lost. What matters is to bring it back<br /><br />David’s a player that has won more trophies than anybody else in that dressing room. We have to use that in a very powerful way. I wanted him to step up, I wanted him to put all his qualities - his personality and his experience - towards the team and he made a big step forward. I am very, very pleased with him. In the games he has played under me so far he has been terrific. His attitude in training, the way he communicates with his team-mates, his desire to still learn, it’s superb. I am delighted with him.</p>
