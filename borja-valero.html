  <p>For me the game was fun, but it stopped being like that when I joined <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a>’s youth academy aged 11. As a youngster I lived with 300 other boys and 85 per cent of them did not make it. All of them sacrificed their adolescence for nothing. You would watch those who were disgarded going off with their backpacks. It was like the X-Factor, only there was no public there to save you. At Real they give you the best salary, a house, a car and a luxury watch. I had other offers, but none which gave me the opportunity to live in such a nice place <b>[as Florence]</b>. Maybe people appreciate me because I do my shopping in the local supermarket, tidy my children’s room and go round the city like any other tourist. I’m privileged. There are people working 12-hour days and we train for three. We must stop treating players like stars and take away this myth surrounding our work</p>

  <p><b>[Inter midfielder Borja Valero says <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> is intense in everything he does]</b> I could define <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> in one word: intense. He throws himself fully into everything he does, even the most common tasks. He is deeply passionate and has a winning character: he wants to win at all costs and works to do so<br /><br />It’s important to understand what sport can give us. Having a competitive mentality and applying this in all contexts of life can really help. I like playing tennis when I can. For Spaniards, Rafa Nadal is an example to follow, both as a player and as a person. He’s incredible<br /><br />The most important thing at this time is to show strength and courage and, above all, make people understand that staying at home is of the utmost importance. This makes the difference and is the only way we’ll be able to return to our normal lives as soon as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Borja Valero says Lautaro should stick with Inter and <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> will come good]</b> We have a very important project here, which is for all to see. For it to take off, it’s better if he stays. <a href="christian-eriksen.html">Eriksen</a> arrived midseason. He played for <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> the week before, and a week later he changed league, country, language, training: it’s not easy. The stop came just as he was hitting form. He has everything to succeed at Inter, he only needs time.<br /><br /><b>[on <a href="marcelo-brozovic.html">Marcelo Brozovic</a>]</b> In the three years I’ve been playing for Inter, he has grown a huge amount. Over time he realised how strong he was and took possession of a new role, as a ‘regista’. He can grow further</p>
