  <p><b>[Liverpool do not have a transfer deal in place for highly-rated Gremio forward Luan]</b> Luan is a player who said he would have proposals but so far none have come, except for one about three years ago when he was on a different level. We have no approach, no official proposal <b>[from Liverpool]</b>. We have absolutely no concrete proposal.</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona and Liverpool target Luan has signed a fresh deal with Gremio that extends his contract up until 2020]</b> We are very happy because this is what Gremio always wanted. Luan had said that he was ready to renew and that he would not leave Gremio unless the situation was resolved. Additionally, it shows that we are willing to keep our players, our key assets, and most importantly those who have come through our youth ranks. This is typical of what our policy of capitalising on what we have inside the club, and to make Gremio more competitive, can achieve. This is a time to celebrate.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> exit talk surprises Gremio president Romildo Bolzan]</b> Arthur is a very good player technically. It’s true that he’s going through a phase where he hasn’t met expectations, but he’ll be important to any club he’s with. At Gremio, he was a great player.
