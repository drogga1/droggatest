  <p><b>[Juventus are in talks to sign Mattia Perin from Genoa]</b> I’m not afraid to go play in a big club or play the place for a place with another strong goalkeeper. I’ve come to a point in my career where I want to test myself and I want to get out of the comfort zone. I can do that now because Genoa helped me to grow and develop. Now I want to get involved and find out how far I can go.</p>
