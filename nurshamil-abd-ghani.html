<blockquote>
  <p>[Melaka United striker Nurshamil Abd Ghani has had a challenging time ever since his arrival at Selangor as a loan player at the start of the season] I’m struggling somewhat due to to the lack of playing time, in terms of my fitness. I have talked the coach into giving me more playing time, and God willing I will prove myself. He [Maniam] told me to give more to the team as a backup striker. Due to all that’s going on with [Liberian striker] Forkey Doe, it’s down to me and Afiq [Azmi, Selangor’s other backup striker]. Maybe my time will come now, and the coach has told me to show me my best.<br /><br />At Melaka, I could not see myself being picked for matches by the coach. But I get more chances at Selangor, especially because I have played for the Selangor state team in the 2012 Malaysian Games, and they are already familiar with my abilities<br /><br />That is slightly out of my expectations, but if Selangor need me, I will stay for the sake of my experience and career</p>
