  <p><b>[Jamaican sprint legend Usain Bolt is gearing up to swap his track shoes for football boots]</b> Usain is 30 and could still race for another four years and go to the 2020 Olympics but he has achieved everything he needs to achieve. There are a million other opportunities for him and he is ready to move on to the next chapter.<br /><br />Football he has always talked about. If you ask him he will want to play football and because he has said that we have had a dozen clubs who would like him to go for a trial with them. I don’t want to name names but he will go to Dortmund because the CEO of Puma, who is a good friend of ours, is on the board at Borussia Dortmund. He will go to train with them.<br /><br />Can a sprinter who is 30-years-old play in the Bundesliga or the Premier League? Realistically that is a step too far. I think if he had six months or nine months playing and training with a team then he could play at some level whether that is League One or League Two. He would hit me on the head for saying he is not going to play in the Champions League, but I don’t know realistically if he has the motivation at this stage of his life to go training with the reserves on a rainy day in Manchester or Munich or somewhere as he is a wealthy guy and has a great life. With football though, in some form you will see him</p>

  <p><b>[Usain Bolt’s attempted transition into a football player]</b> There is a lot of interest in Usain playing football. We are regularly approached by clubs from all over the world. The only difference with the latest offer is that it was made through the media. I can confirm that Usain does not want to pursue the opportunity in Malta.</p>
