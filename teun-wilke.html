  <p><b>[Teun Wilke hopes to one day be in a position where he has to choose between Mexico and the Netherlands when it comes to his senior international allegiance]</b> The truth is that all my life I lived in Mexico, my heart is there, my family lives there. I feel Mexican, but I am not someone who likes to close doors so early in my life. I want to prepare and improve, work so hard that I can get to that level where I have to choose between Netherlands and Mexico, that’s what I’m focusing on right now. When the time comes I will make a decision<br /><br /><b>[He added on his efforts at Heerenveen, where he remains part of the U19 set-up for now]</b> It is very difficult to say <b>[how far or close I am to the first team]</b>, you never know when the chance will come. I focus on being prepared, being better than the one in front of me. I am one step away. If God wants, it will happen quickly; there is no rush.<br /><br /><b>[Edson Alvarez and Erick Gutierrez are looking to catch the eye at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and <a href="psv.html">PSV</a>, with Wilke saying of them]</b> They play in the two best clubs in the Netherlands. <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> played in the Champions League semi-final last year, it’s no small thing to come to such a club and suddenly win a place. They have enough quality and have to work harder to get there, I am sure they will. It is not easy to play in the two most important clubs here, people misperceive and do not realise how difficult it is<br /><br /><b>[Wilke was left out of Mexico’s squad for the 2019 U17 World Cup. <a href="javier-hernandez.html">Chicharito</a> having previously missed out on success at the 2005 event through injury]</b> He has always been an example for me, not only for the things he has done. It is very admirable. Even if I hadn’t had that example, I know what I’m made of, what I’m capable of. I am sure that I will get over it and do great things. Missing an U17 World Cup will not harm my career at any level</p>
