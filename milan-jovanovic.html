  <p><b>[Milan Jovanovic has insisted that there was never any doubt that he was going to sign for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> despite manager <a href="rafael-benitez.html">Rafael Benitez</a> departing from the club for Inter]</b> I chose to sign for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club, and that is it. It’s very simple. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was always my biggest wish and to be here is a great day in my career and in my life. I knew they were following my games for Standard Liege and also the Serbian national side and when they first made contact with me I was very happy. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> was my only choice and I’m pleased the negotiations were successful. Now I want to do as well as I can for the club over the next three years. When you speak about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> you are speaking about one of the biggest clubs in the world - maybe for me, the biggest. You are talking about an historical club which has won the Champions League five times<br /><br /><b>[The 29-year-old is also looking forward to sampling some of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a>’s unique atmosphere as well as working alongside the players and new manager <a href="roy-hodgson.html">Roy Hodgson</a>]</b> I can’t wait to play at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Anfield</a> and hear ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ - the best song in the world. I also can’t wait to play with players like Torres, <a href="steven-gerrard.html">Gerrard</a>, <a href="dirk-kuyt.html">Kuyt</a>, <a href="javier-mascherano.html">Mascherano</a> and <a href="pepe-reina.html">Reina</a> - some of the best players in the world. It’s hard for me to tell the fans what I can bring to the team, I’d prefer to leave that talking to someone else. But I know I need to be good on the pitch and show my quality when I get the chance. Mr <a href="roy-hodgson.html">Hodgson</a> welcomed me to the club this morning and I’m looking forward to working with him, with all the players and hopefully being successful together and winning trophies<br /><br /><b>[Having been handed the No.10 shirt, Jovanovic wants to live up to the great names who have worn the shirt for <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> in the past]</b> <a href="john-toshack.html">Toshack</a>, <a href="john-barnes.html">Barnes</a>…I know the players who have worn the shirt. But the number isn’t special. It’s what I do on the pitch that matters</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> attacker Milan Jovanovic has expressed his love for Belgian champions Anderlecht]</b> I know that Anderlecht rate me very highly and their interest flatters me. Anderlecht are considered to be the biggest Belgian club wherever you go. I really love Anderlecht, but I won’t leave <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> any time soon. I appreciate it that Anderlecht are ready to pay a hefty transfer fee for me, but I’m only thinking about <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. I will stay at the club, because I’m not a quitter. I will do my utmost to succeed at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. Everything I achieve here feels like a present. I have a great contract with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and have no plans to move on.</p>

Up to now, I still haven’t received an official offer from Olympiakos, but I am looking forward to hearing their plans</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to allow Milan Jovanovic to leave for free amid interest from Anderlecht]</b> I’m still under contract with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a>, but they’ve agreed to let me go on a free transfer when I find a new club. I’ve had a meeting with Anderlecht and it was quite interesting. I had dinner with <b>[club president Roger]</b> Vanden Stock and <b>[director of football Herman]</b> van Holsbeeck. They made a good impression on me. We’ll have to wait and see, but it’s definitely an interesting option</p>

  <p><b>[Milan Jovanovic is excited about the prospect of returning to Belgian football with Anderlecht after an unsuccessful stint at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> My wife adores Brussels and is pushing me to return to Belgium where I only have on offer. I am still buzzing after my meeting with Anderlecht in Qatar. I was moved by the importance given to me by the Belgian sporting press over the past week. And that makes me think because Belgium is my second country!<br /><br /><b>[<a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a> are also thought to be interested in his signature and the forward said that he would consider moving to the French champions]</b> <a href="lille-fc.html">Lille</a>, like Anderlecht, are a nice option for me. This is a good club, which plays at the top of the French game, a high-level competition, and who will play the group stage of Champions League. That’s interesting. For now, I listen to everyone</p>
