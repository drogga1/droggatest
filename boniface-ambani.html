  <p>[Former Kenyan international Boniface Ambani believes Harambee Stars have a golden opportunity of making it to the 2019 AFCON] This is a very easy group which we can get through unscathed. As a matter of fact, only Ghana is a problem there, we can easily beat Ethiopia and Sierra Leone. However it is not going to be easy because everything is about early preparations, we need to start preparing now.<br /><br />Playing many international matches is another factor that will enable us to perform in these matches, and that still goes back to planning</p>

  <p>[Former Kenyan international striker Boniface Ambani feels that a number of KPL clubs are simply filling numbers instead of signing quality players] Many teams just buy players without considering what value they add to the club and end up releasing them at the end of the season. If it is all about buying a player, analyze the situation and buy someone who will add value to the club, a player the club really needs. Go for quality players who you will use the whole season; not just a player who adds up the numbers</p>

  <p>[Kenyan international Boniface Ambani says it is high time the two top bodies found a lasting solution on composition of league] According to me, it is not about FKF or KPL. It is not about who won this battle or that but it is all about Kenyan football and the Kenyan player. The issue of Nick Mwendwa or Jack Oguda, won this and that battle in courts or tribunals to me is not important. What is important is the development of our football. That is where the focus should be. The number of teams in KPL does not matter as long as things are in order and that is my prayer.<br /><br />The two parties should come into agreement. If the league is run well then it even does not matter how many teams should be in the league. Ages back we used to have 20 teams in the league and even wihout sponsorship all was well, it is all about proper management of the clubs</p>
