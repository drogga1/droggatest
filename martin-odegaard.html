  <p><b>[Martin Odegaard insists he does not regret joining Real Madrid]</b> Real Madrid is a good club, the best in the world. But everyone knows how hard it is to get playing time there. I don’t regret my choice because I played at the best club in the world. To train and develop there is very good for a young talent.<br /><br />This is a very nice club and I look forward to this adventure. I don’t see myself as a wonderboy. I look at myself as a normal guy and I don’t really pay attention to what other people say of me. I had a good talk with the club and for that reason I came to this club. They are looking at my development and that is the most important thing.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid have announced that Martin Odegaard will join Vitesse Arnhem on a loan deal for the 2018-19 season]</b> The past year and a half I have played in the Eredivisie. I was impressed by Vitesse. I got to know Vitesse as a good footballing team, with an offensive and dominant view of the game. I think that way of playing is good for me. Vitesse has also shown that it gives young players a chance. That is why I am happy with the opportunity that Vitesse offers me.</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Odegaard remains determined to break into Real Madrid’s first team]</b> am satisfied, I’m finding my way more and more here <b>[at Vitesse]</b>. Recently, I finally scored. against Heracles. With that, there was a burden lifted off my shoulders. One of my goals is to get better statistics in goals and assists. I have to play and learn as much as possible. Of course, I hoped that I would have a place in Real’s team. I was training all summer long and got some minutes in the first team. At the end of the summer, the club and I decided that it would be better for me to play elsewhere. That would be the best choice for my own development. Then you are looking for the best conditions for yourself. After the conversation with this coach <b>[Slutsky]</b>, I knew it would be Arnhem.<br /><br />You have to be modest and keep your goal in mind. How many 19-year-olds play in the first team of Madrid? The road is long and I am convinced of myself. Work hard, learn more in every game and make more minutes. My goal is clear: I want to play for Real Madrid. I do everything for that. My contract has already been renewed. I take that as a sign of trust. Vitesse is absolutely no step back, it is a step forward towards the top<br /><br />I am only 19, but I have been playing professional football for five years. Then I can expect that I will dare to be more dominant. I understand better what this team wants, what the coach wants and how we enjoy working. I feel I have come to the perfect place to take the next step. But it is first about the team. If I am important to that, then I will also do well. The free-kick was a great reward, but I will think longer about the missed opportunity after that</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid-owned Martin Odegaard has joked that being coached by Zinedine Zidane wasn’t good for building confidence]</b> I trained with the first team and played games with the reserves when Zidane was our coach. I also got some minutes in the first team. I had to get used to the pace and the quality. It was great to be coached by Zidane but sometimes it wasn’t good for your self-confidence - when he showed us how we should do certain things in training… what a technique!<br /><br />Of course I was hoping for more games, but in the end of I’ve played with the biggest stars. It was a giant step for me. From Stromsgodset to Sergio Ramos and Cristiano Ronaldo<br /><br />I could have gone to many clubs but Real Madrid was a dream come true. It’s the biggest club in the world - and for me, it was the best choice as well</p>

  <p><b>[How is Real Madrid-owned wonderkid Odegaard developing at Vitesse?]</b> It’s not possible to predict anything in football, you just have to work hard and develop and in the end you see. But of course, I would like to go back to Madrid and play there. That is my goal.<br /><br />Vitesse is absolutely not a step back, it is a step forward towards the top. I feel I have come to the perfect place to take the next step<br /><br />Right now it has been nice, but it is clear that I want more stability over time. Then you must take an assessment of how to get it. I’m happy where I am. Then we’ll see how the season was and hear the feedback from Madrid. If I don’t get an opportunity there, then I have to find other ways</p>

  <p><b>[Odegaard’s early years in Madrid]</b> Everything was fast. In Norway there was no star player for a long time, so the media enlarged everything. I was 15 years old and it was a madhouse every day! I am a sober person, the prototype of a Scandinavian person. I do not like attention or exaggerated expectations at all. At 16 I went to Madrid with my father, who was my driver. My mother stayed with my two sisters in Norway. Our family has been separated for several years and that is a sacrifice. Of course I expected to play more minutes, but I was with the most important stars like Sergio Ramos or Cristiano Ronaldo. It was a giant step for me.<br /><br />I will talk to Real Madrid and we will see what happens. Ajax is a great club. I think €20m is a lot of money for me!</p>

  <p><b>[Martin Odegaard admits it will be difficult to play at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> next season]</b> I do not want this summer to pan out like last summer. It was a very good year; I took big steps and I grew more in my game. Now I want to go on vacation, but I do not want summer to repeat itself, it was not good for me. The indication from <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is that they are very happy with me, but it is difficult to play there and probably it will also be the case next season. They have also sold many players with a repurchase clause. I just want to go somewhere where I have the opportunity to play and a coach that believes in you.</p>

For me it’s a bit crazy, nowadays. I don’t feel I’m worth that much money, even the money they paid for me… that’s too much! It feels strange for me and now it’s getting more and more crazy. I don’t like it really, to be honest<br /><br /><b>[He already has two goals to his name, having managed 11 across all competitions for Eredivisie outfit Vitesse last season]</b> It’s better to be here and getting used to <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and the language, so it was the natural step in this way. There were a lot of teams interested after last season but for me, it’s important to have the feeling the club really wants you and the way this club plays suits me. These things are more important than Champions League football to me at this stage. I got really inspired here, and I felt like the project was perfect for me.
