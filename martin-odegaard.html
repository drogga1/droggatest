  <p><b>[Martin Odegaard sees his long-term future at <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> despite currently taking in a loan spell at Real Sociedad and sparking talk of interest from the likes of <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Manchester City]</b> My intention is to stay <b>[at Sociedad]</b> two years and I think that’s important for me, too. I have had two seasons in a row where I’ve changed teams. To have some stability is good <b>[and]</b> this is a great club and hopefully we can get European football for next season. Of course I want to play there <b>[Madrid]</b> but I’m still young so I’m happy here at the moment. I am here two years and after that we will see. Madrid will always sign good players, that’s important for the club, they want to be the best club in the world and that’s normal. I’m dreaming to be the best I can be. You never know what happens in football but my dream, and what I’m hoping for is to play for Madrid<br /><br /><b>[Odegaard was acquired by Madrid for an initial outlay of just €3 million]</b> I’m glad they didn’t pay as much as they are these days. For me it’s a bit crazy, nowadays. I don’t feel I’m worth that much money, even the money they paid for me… that’s too much! It feels strange for me and now it’s getting more and more crazy. I don’t like it really, to be honest<br /><br /><b>[He already has two goals to his name, having managed 11 across all competitions for Eredivisie outfit Vitesse last season]</b> It’s better to be here and getting used to <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and the language, so it was the natural step in this way. There were a lot of teams interested after last season but for me, it’s important to have the feeling the club really wants you and the way this club plays suits me. These things are more important than Champions League football to me at this stage. I got really inspired here, and I felt like the project was perfect for me. I felt like the club really wanted me and the way the coach wanted to play was the perfect match for me. It felt right</p>

He is confident that he will be fit enough to play some part in that contest]</b> My ankle is much better, I hope to be at the Bernabeu on Saturday. I played through the pain against Levante and after I think it was the right decision to stop for a bit. Now I feel better. I haven’t stopped working in order to return as soon as possible. Playing against <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> is a special match, but I want to play every game. If I score at the Bernabeu, I won’t celebrate. If I score against La Real in the future, I won’t either</p>

  <p><b>[Odegaard has learned to deal with the pressure that comes with being touted as ‘the next big thing’]</b> I don’t care much about hearing criticism. When I started in Norway at 15 years old I had a lot of attention, above all positive comments. Later, when I was at Madrid, they were negative, maybe some very negative attention. I think that it’s not always black and white. I try only thinking about the next day and to keep improving; that’s the most important thing. When you play football you can’t always think about what other people say<br /><br /><b>[Odegaard turned heads in the capital with his fine display in <a href="real-sociedad.html">Real Sociedad</a>’s 2-0 win over <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a> on September 14]</b> Before signing him we had seen him and we knew what he could do.

Playing against the best teams in the world is something that is great for a player and it’s a dream for me. However, there are some very good teams in the fight, like Getafe, <a href="atletico-madrid.html">Atletico Madrid</a>, <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> and Valencia<br /><br />Two things make me very excited, as we want to win the Copa del Rey and qualify for the Champions League. I spend every day looking at the photo in Zubieta in which you can see the cup which was won in Zaragoza. I learned very quickly of the importance of this picture and now I look at it with envy. It’s been a long time for the fans and it’s normal for them to be excited, we are too<br /><br /><b>[Sociedad have built a strong squad this season, with players such as <a href="adnan-januzaj.html">Adnan Januzaj</a> and <a href="nacho-monreal.html">Nacho Monreal</a> adding both quality and depth]</b> We have very good players and a deep squad, in which changes can be made without noticing them</p>
