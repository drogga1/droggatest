  <p><b>[Former <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> teen following in <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a>’s footsteps and trying to cook like Gordon Ramsey]</b> If I can do as well as <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> has done so far then I will be really happy. He is a great player. I have always known that since being at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> with him, how good he can be and how good he will be. Hopefully he can help me as well. Obviously at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> it is tough, all the players are top players. It wasn’t that I couldn’t see a pathway - I believe in myself. But it was more that I had the opportunity to go and play first-team football and at the time I didn’t have that at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. I preferred to play first-team football so I took the opportunity. When I was younger I always believed in myself. I always thought: you will be playing at a good level when you are 17, 18, 19. That’s what I am doing at the moment and hopefully I can keep improving<br /><br /><b>[Now a part of the Wales national team and deemed a talent by manager <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Ryan Giggs</a>, Matondo is looking to keep his head down in Germany and continue impressing]</b> I go on Gordon Ramsay a lot on YouTube and see what you can cook up - I try to copy. It’s not quite similar but I try my best. I am not around any distractions of living in Cardiff or Manchester with my friends. It’s nice to be around your friends but <b>[living]</b> alone I just do more for myself. That’s improved me. I am doing little extras, going to the gym and eating good food</p>

  <p><b>[Rabbi Matondo: Schalke’s wing wizard following in <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a>’s footsteps after out-sprinting Leroy Sane]</b> I’m not particularly impressed with the fact that I was the fastest player. Pace is important today, but it’s not everything<br /><br />When I arrived in Germany, <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Jadon Sancho</a> wrote to me. He gave me tips and explains how things are in Germany, it was great to talk to him and hear what he has experienced</p>

  <p><b>[Rabbi Matondo admits advice from <a href="leroy-sane.html">Leroy Sane</a> edged him through the exits at <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> in January 2019]</b> At <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>, I was doing well and getting a lot of attention from other clubs, telling me they wanted me in the first team. I wasn’t really in and around the first team at City so much. I wasn’t getting a sniff of being on the bench. <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a> is a top club and I’ve lots of respect for them. At the time I was thinking about my own development and thought a move abroad might be the one for me. There was a lot of talk at the time about how not many young players were breaking through in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> and I was thinking it might be right to move abroad and get some good experience. Maybe some life lessons as well. Not a lot of people can say they moved abroad to work at 18 and lived alone. I thought it would be good for me. I thought I was mature and it’s been the right thing for me.<br /><br />He told me the fans were top fans and would love me forever if I worked hard and did the right things. He gave me advice on the Schalke way<br /><br />It’s been tough at times. Sometimes you don’t play and you can be frustrated when things are not going right. You’re away from your family and friends but overall it’s been an unbelievable experience so far. I’ve really enjoyed it. It was 100 per cent the right decision</p>

  <p><b>[Rabbi Matondo reveals why he opted for <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> before Schalke move]</b> City were interested a year before I moved <b>[from Cardiff]</b>. Everyone in Cardiff knew about it. At the time I was not 100 per cent sure that I was ready to leave my home. Cardiff is my city. After my father and my agent had looked at the youth academy in Manchester, they were so enthusiastic that they told me I would be crazy if I didn’t take this opportunity. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> were also interested in me. The way City persisted in trying to get me convinced me in the end<br /><br />When I went to Schalke, he said to me: ‘You know we are rivals now?!’ I respect him as a person and as a player, but when we meet on the pitch, the only thing that counts for me at the moment is victory. I don’t compare myself with him. I want to go my own way. I am pleased that things are going well for him and I hope that continues, despite the rivalry</p>

  <p><b>[Rabbi Matondo says he is not thinking about a potential transfer amid reports <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are interested in signing him]</b> Obviously there are people talking, asking me and stuff but I am not really thinking about it. I am concentrating on Schalke. I still have to achieve my goals for Schalke. I am just concentrating on that and we just see how things go, but for now I am just focused on Schalke. Hopefully I can get into the team and help them climb up the table<br /><br />I haven’t really thought about it like that. I just want to do well at Schalke and give back what they have invested into me. I just want to give my all and then whatever happens in the future happens. Never say never</p>

  <p><b>[Schalke winger Rabbi Matondo has praised team-mate <a href="weston-mckennie.html">Weston McKennie</a> for the courage he showed in paying tribute to George Floyd during his side’s <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> match against Werder Bremen]</b> It was Weston’s decision. I spoke to him about it as well, on the matchday. I didn’t realise he was doing it. If I knew I’d have got involved with him as well. It was his decision and he decided to do it himself and I feel like we need more people, if they believe that, to be strong enough to do what Weston’s done. We saw other players do that at the weekend. Right now, it’s the perfect time <b>[to send a message]</b>. I totally respect what the guys have done. <a href="marcus-thuram.html">Marcus Thuram</a>, Jadon, Weston, <a href="achraf-hakimi.html">Hakimi</a> - all the other players have got involved. I think it’s amazing to show that courage and confidence to go out there and speak about what they believe<br /><br />I feel strongly and respect the guys that went out and did it last weekend. I will participate in the best ways I can. I feel like it doesn’t matter what you’re doing in sport, or if you’re not doing any sport, if you feel like you should speak up in a certain way, yeah, then why not? There’s too much going on around the world right now, there’s obviously destruction, a lot of things. So hopefully us footballers and the platform we have, I think it’s perfect to speak up and say what you believe in</p>

  <p><b>[Schalke and Wales winger Rabbi Matondo says he is ‘proud’ of how young players have used their profiles to take a stand against racism]</b> I feel proud that people are standing up for their rights. It’s obviously tough times for a lot of people and I’m glad that a lot of players have addressed it and shown how they feel about it. This is the perfect time to address things now, and with our profiles we can do that in a positive way<br /><br />What <a href="weston-mckennie.html">Weston McKennie</a>, <a href="jadon-sancho.html">Sancho</a> and <a href="marcus-thuram.html">Marcus Thuram</a> did, plus other players in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>, was perfect. It’s a good thing to show that black lives do matter. Of course every life matters, but in the situation we’re in, black lives matter now. So we have to show that in every aspect we can in football. You get an idea when you are playing foreign teams as an international that people are saying something. I’m not a guy to make a big deal about it, even if it is a big deal. Sometimes I feel like that’s just the way people are; that’s the way they have been brought up. I feel like I would go about it differently than I would have when I was younger</p>
