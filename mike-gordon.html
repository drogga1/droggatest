  <p><b>[Ian Ayre will leave his position as Liverpool’s chief executive officer ahead of schedule at the end of February]</b> It goes without saying that his leadership of LFC has been instrumental to the club’s progress under our ownership. It is a measure of his character and his commitment to LFC that we have been able to collectively plan and execute such a gradual, natural transition. On both a professional and personal level, he will be missed. The last step remaining is to conclude the process of identifying and hiring a successor to Ian. We are very pleased with the search progress and fully expect to have our new CEO in position by our original deadline of the summer 2017. We are quite confident that LFC will have the right structure and the best people operating within that structure to fill the lofty ambitions of LFC and its supporters.</p>

  <p><b>[New <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> contract thrills FSG]</b> As we are sure our supporters would agree, it is truly wonderful news and we are all extremely thrilled, not only professionally, but personally too. We feel this represents one of the big moments of our stewardship of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club so far as we believe there is no better manager than Jurgen. The decision also keeps with the club’s overall strategy of building from a position of strength. It means Jurgen will oversee the ongoing transition from <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Melwood</a> to the new Kirkby training base as the club continues to pursue a vision of being elite in all facets of the industry<br /><br />It also provides us with continuity with the existing football operations management structure, overseen by sporting director Michael Edwards, whose input into the project cannot be overestimated. He has been - and will continue to be - as indispensably important as anyone else to the direction of <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club. In Jurgen and Michael we are blessed with world-class leadership.<br /><br />This is a collective partnership that has seen the club reach and then re-establish itself as an elite performer at home and abroad. Back in 2015 we used the phrase ‘ideal fit’ when we appointed Jürgen. This continues to apply today and, if anything, the circumstances make it more pertinent. We consider him to be the best there is. If <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> Football Club were looking to appoint the most outstanding, elite manager for our current status today, Jürgen would be the first choice - no question. We believe this deal cements a relationship built on trust and mutual benefit: Jürgen has delivered for LFC and LFC has delivered for Jürgen. Both parties have come to the conclusion that by continuing to work together and build on the work of the last four years, the opportunity exists to maximise each other’s potential</p>
