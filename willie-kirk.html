  <p><b>[Willie Kirk’s <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> were the last team to try their luck against the reigning champions before Christmas]</b> The thinking was it would be three at the back, and we said, ‘Do not make it five at the back’ - but against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> it’s hard not to be pinned back. I watched their game against Reading and the wingers both come in all the time, constantly switching and we just wanted to have as many bodies in the middle as possible. We wanted to load up the middle of the park and protect the goal but when you leave the best striker in the world unmarked for the first goal it’s a little bit frustrating. Maybe we had one centre back too many. Maybe they were all expecting the other to pick <a href="vivianne-miedema.html">Miedema</a> up</p>

  <p><b>[Everton’s WSL ambition is putting <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> to shame]</b> Regardless of the men’s team doing well or not well, regardless of who the manager is, the support for the women’s team has never wavered. It’s always been really strong since I’ve come in here<br /><br />The Goodison game shows the support the club are giving <b>[us]</b>, they think it’s the right thing to do at the right time. It was a good one. A very good one<br /><br /><b>[His grin comes as a consequence of three brilliant signings for Everton: goalkeeper Sandy MacIver, who he describes as a future England No.1; Izzy Christiansen, who signs from six-time European champions Lyon; and Australia star Hayley Raso, who will link up with the squad later this month after Olympic qualifying]</b> I think we’ve caught everybody out with that. It’s made a statement. The league’s probably gone, ‘Woah’. Obviously, we had a good first half of the season, everybody was praising us for that. We just wanted to go strengthen when we were doing well, which I think is the best time to strengthen<br /><br /><b>[Their struggles are felt outside of the club, too. Man United boss <a href="casey-stoney.html">Casey Stoney</a> said earlier this season that, despite the rivalry between the two clubs, she would not want to see <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> relegated. Kirk feels the same]</b> Some people are talking about wanting <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> relegated - that is the last thing I want. That takes two massive games away from you. I get the rivalry, but certainly, as a head coach, I do not want to lose two of the biggest games of the season.</p>

  <p><b>[Everton boss Willie Kirk on Sandy MacIver]</b> She has huge potential - an England No.1 in my eyes. She’s fantastic with her feet, left and right, she’s got great distribution.</p>
