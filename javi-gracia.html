  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> manager Javi Gracia praised <a href="gerard-deulofeu.html">Gerard Deulofeu</a> after his latest match-winning brace guided <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> to a 2-1 victory at <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> Town]</b> He’s scoring important goals and very good goals. All goals are good for me, but in this moment I think Gerard is scoring and he is living an important moment for him and for the team, helping the team with his goals. In other moments he didn’t score, but always he plays with good commitment and he tries to help the team<br /><br />There are five games left to finish and when we are in the position we are, it’s always important to get the points that are in play. We need all of our players to keep going and keep playing and we can achieve these kinds of things, when you really are a team and living all the season as a team</p>
