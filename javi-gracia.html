  <p><b>[Alli won the penalty that he scored to level proceedings, with Watford defender Christian Kabasele sent off after felling the star]</b> It is hard to accept, first the penalty and then the red card - I don’t understand that decision. I don’t understand why the referee showed the red card. I am very proud of my players. I think we played very well and I would like to respect the referee’s decision and to support them because I know it is not easy. We tried to the end and competed against a very good Tottenham team, I am proud of my players. I would have liked my players to have the reward because in my opinion they have played very well.</p>

  <p><b>[Watford boss Javi Gracia says Troy Deeney is the best striker England have to offer]</b> There are good English players in that position, but in my opinion Troy is the best one. He’s in a very good moment now, but it’s not my decision and I always try to be respectful with the national team.<br /><br />He handled it very well, you have to have that personality and he knows in that moment all the people were looking at him. It was an important moment for the team and club and he managed really well, scoring the goal and doing something really special for the team. In my opinion, he always shows the right attitude, sometimes he likes to speak and say different things, but he always shows a very good attitude and he’s veyr respectful. Sometimes he can say some words like ‘cojones’ or other kind of expressions, but if you know and spend time with him you can see he’s very respectful and only is thinking of the way to help the team</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> manager Javi Gracia praised <a href="gerard-deulofeu.html">Gerard Deulofeu</a> after his latest match-winning brace guided <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> to a 2-1 victory at <a href="huddersfield-town-fc.html">Huddersfield</a> Town]</b> He’s scoring important goals and very good goals. All goals are good for me, but in this moment I think Gerard is scoring and he is living an important moment for him and for the team, helping the team with his goals. In other moments he didn’t score, but always he plays with good commitment and he tries to help the team<br /><br />There are five games left to finish and when we are in the position we are, it’s always important to get the points that are in play. We need all of our players to keep going and keep playing and we can achieve these kinds of things, when you really are a team and living all the season as a team</p>

  <p><b>[Watford vs Southampton]</b> I think before playing the game, my players know perfectly that we need the points more than them. It is the best mentality to get the points available. If we don’t play with that feeling it is difficult to get results. We have to be concentrated until the end, if we don’t do it in the next games, I’m sure we won’t be able to achieve the results we want</p>

  <p><b>[Javi Gracia happy at Watford, but plans Spain return in the future]</b> I’ll go back to Spain, that’s 100 per cent. I do not know when, because I have a long contract here. You never know what’s going to happen, but I’ll come back. Although right now I don’t even think about it. I like to enjoy my profession and I believe that here, on a daily basis, I have very good conditions to do it. Five fields at my disposal, a training centre, very private, very welcoming, with many possibilities and I also have a team with which to compete in the Premier League. On a professional level it is a challenge and also a very nice opportunity to develop my profession. Apart from this, I believe that the living conditions are good, my family is comfortable, my children also. Those are the most important things<br /><br /><b>[Javi Gracia signed a four-and-a-half-year contract in November 2018]</b> Yes, it’s something that goes out of the ordinary. The list of coaches in recent years is extensive and it is not usual for a coach to start a second season. It had not happened for many years. It is not usual to renew the contract as I did for four more years. What it does is reinforce you, not only internally but also externally. It gives you an authority in front of players, and they will say, ‘hey, this coach is going to be here longer, it’s not going to be like the previous ones that have been a short cycle’. That generates a little more confidence in your work</p>

I would like to speak with him and the club and see if he is able to carry on next season, we have to speak about that<br /><br />We will see, the keeper on Saturday, I don’t like to speak about it. I only focus on the game and try to choose the best keeper for the game, after that we will see what happens in the future<br /><br /><b>[Gracia admitted to having a limited knowledge of the FA Cup before arriving in England]</b> I didn’t know much about this competition before coming to be honest. I watched on TV some games but I didn’t realise how important it was until I arrived here and I could feel the supporters and the importance of this competition. Now I can say that I know it and I’m very proud to be here</p>
