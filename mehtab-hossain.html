  <p><b>[Mohun Bagan plan on spoiling East Bengal’s Mehtab Hossain’s potential last Kolkata Derby]</b> Every derby is important for me. Of course, life won’t end for me but every player has to leave a club someday or the other. Yes, I had told that if we won’t win the league, I will leave East Bengal. Players are scrutinised when they don’t perform well and that has been the case for us after our lull following a good start to the league. If we win the I-League, I will continue here at East Bengal, else I will walk away.<br /><br />We have been getting close to winning the league for the last seven to eight years but if I walk away and someone else gets the opportunity to win, no one else will be more happy than me. This has been my family for the last ten years</p>

  <p><b>[2016 Indian Super League runners-up Kerala Blasters have not retained Mehtab Hossain and the midfielder is all set to join the draft later this month]</b> Yes, it is true that Kerala Blasters had contacted me and I had spoken to the owners. But, I chose not to give it another go and instead go into the draft. Let’s see what the future holds.<br /><br />East Bengal is a club close to my heart and there was an offer too but my words have some value too. I had always said that I would leave them if we did not win and so I did</p>
