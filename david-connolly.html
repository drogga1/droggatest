  <p><b>[Former Republic of Ireland striker David Connolly says that the Boys in Green must take nothing for granted]</b> I’m really hoping they have a good tournament. I hope they do well. The longer they stay in it the better it is for the country. The last one, obviously, ended quite early and there was massive disappointment for the fans who went over there.<br /><br />They’ll have to have a good start, and then it will be a really good test. The tournament has expanded and is not as difficult as it was previously. But once you get into these games there are no easy fixtures. They are all, tactically, really competent and there are no easy matches. You sometimes get this in qualifying - some games are easily winnable - but in a competition format you can take nothing for granted. The team have to start well and be tactically astute, which didn’t happen in the last Euros. And, as always, Ireland have to be stronger as a team than maybe the sum of their individual parts</p>

  <p><b>[Marko Arnautovic needs to follow the lead of Riyad Mahrez, not Dimitri Payet, as he seeks to secure a move away from West Ham]</b> I don’t think Arnautovic and Payet are exactly the same. I don’t think Payet went about it the right way but he was going for sporting reasons. He wanted to go back to France and with Marseille he reached the Europa League final. Arguably, it wasn’t for the money. With Arnautovic, he’s obviously not going for sporting reasons.<br /><br />Refusing to play is a real negative and <b>[what about]</b> Riyad Mahrez who was in a similar situation? He buckled down, got on and played. He sulked for a couple of days but then he was back in among the team. They welcomed him with open arms and he got his move to Man City in the end. That would be the right way to go about it and he might do that.<br /><br />If Arnautovic does go they look really, really light. Andy Carroll hasn’t even played 100 games in his five years so you can’t rely on him. They were struggling against Burnley until they brought on Mark Noble and <b>[Michail]</b> Antonio who made a difference - then Arnautovic got a couple. I’d be worried if they lost Arnautovic. They’ve got technical players - Samir Nasri is a terrific signing for them - and for the first time in a good few years, they’ve given the youngsters a right good chance and they look good enough.<br /><br />Whether it’s Xande Silva, Declan Rice or Grady Diangana, they look like they can actually make the grade like Joe Cole and Rio Ferdinand did. I’m not saying they will be that good in the end but they look like they’ve got a right good chance. West Ham always need youngsters, that mix. <b>[Manuel]</b> Pellegrini is nearly there. They’re missing <b>[Manuel]</b> Lanzini but the technical way for them suits. But Andy Carroll doesn’t suit that way so, if Arnautovic goes, they’ll need a front man desperately</p>
