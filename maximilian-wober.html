  <p><b>[Salzburg team-mates Maximilian Wober on <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a>’s performance]</b> He is phenomenal. With his height, to be so nimble and have such command of the ball. It’s really hard to play against him in training, you just have to foul him. Once again, he proved why he’s definitely going to become one of the best strikers in the world</p>

  <p><b>[Salzburg hotshot <a href="erling-haland.html">Haaland</a> has 17 goals in 10 games - Is he ready for the big time?]</b> Erling is crazy. Last night, our captain was walking with his daughter. Then, a car stopped. Erling was inside. He rolled down the window and there he was, listening to the Champions League anthem!</p>

  <p><b>[Red Bull Salzburg defender Maximilian Wober has hailed team-mate <a href="erling-haland.html">Erling Haaland</a> as a top professional]</b> He is an absolute top professional. While we play cards on away trips, he only reads scientific articles on how to improve his sleep or nutrition. He’s always looking for the smallest details<br /><br />We want to win the game. With the race to catch up and the two games against <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a>, we have shown that we can compete with the best teams in Europe. If we become more consistent and experienced in a few situations, then we can defeat those teams as well. With a bit of luck, a good gameplan and a good team performance everything is possible<br /><br /><b>[With <a href="liverpool-fc.html">the Reds</a> flying domestically at the top of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, Wober has had plenty of opportunity to study their strengths]</b> You cannot give them free space. When <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> or <a href="sadio-mane.html">Sadio Mane</a> get going, it becomes incredibly difficult. We have to be close to them and put pressure on them early so they do not start any individual actions. If we go into the match with a battle plan, then we can surprise Liverpool</p>
