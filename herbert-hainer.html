  <p><b>[Hoffenheim owner <a href="dietmar-hopp.html">Dietmar Hopp</a> has hit back against protests against his ownership of the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a> club, saying he will not stop attending matches]</b> All of us at <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> are still stunned by yesterday’s incidents in Hoffenheim. We are ashamed of the behaviour of a few so-called ‘fans’ in the <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> terrace and seating area during the game. <a href="dietmar-hopp.html">Dietmar Hopp</a> was insulted in the worst imaginable way by a few idiots with a banner. He was defamed, from a distance, anonymously, namelessly, and in a cowardly way. The events of yesterday were an absolute low point. It is high time to act decisively. Racism, exclusion, insults and discrimination of any kind and against anyone must stop now. This is also the opinion of the overwhelming majority of <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> fans. They are expressing their incomprehension and indignation via all conceivable online platforms, on social media and in numerous emails to us. Our fans stand together, football stands together, against hate, against intolerance, against defamation</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> president Herbert Hainer expects a significant decrease in transfer fees following the coronavirus pandemic]</b> As I said, although serious predictions are difficult to make, it’s obvious there’ll be changes. I agree with Uli Hoeness’ assumption that transfer fees will decrease. That’s just logical. When income decreases, there’s less money in circulation. And given the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis on people’s everyday lives, outrageous sums in the millions are even less justifiable than they already were. My hope is that more common sense will be applied here as well. I have to take my hat off to <a href="hasan-salihamidzic.html">Hasan Salihamidzic</a> and our sporting leadership. They’re handling the coronavirus situation very well<br /><br />Of course, the situation is very tense. It’s about the existence of individual clubs. And even <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> faces a major financial challenge - that’s no secret. But our club is in an excellent position. We work day after day to ensure that <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a> can navigate through this phase without any major damage. Despite this immense task, we’re looking to the future with confidence</p>

  <p><b>[Herbert Hainer says <a href="thomas-muller.html">Muller</a> is symbolic to Munich, like Oktoberfest!]</b> It is, of course, very good news and I was incredibly happy when I heard <b>[that <a href="thomas-muller.html">Muller</a> had signed a new deal]</b>. <a href="thomas-muller.html">Thomas Muller</a> is a hero, a symbol of <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> Munich</a>. He’s spent his entire footballing career here and he’s blossomed once again in recent months under <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a>. He provides so many assists, he’s an outstanding player, and I think that <a href="thomas-muller.html">Thomas Muller</a> belongs to <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC Bayern</a>, much like Oktoberfest belongs to the city of Munich. And in that respect, that’s really great news<br /><br /><b>[Hainer said of <a href="hansi-flick.html">Flick</a>’s contract]</b> When the matter was brought to the supervisory board, we made a very quick and unanimous decision. As head coach of <a href="bayern-munich.html">FC <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> Munich</a>, you will of course be measured by titles and that will certainly be the case with <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a>. But we are absolutely convinced by <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a>. If you look at what he has done with the team over the past few months, he has not only got the team winning, but it’s also about the way the team plays. They play incredibly attractive, great, attacking football, they score a lot of goals and win most games. They’re already so good, but I’m convinced <a href="hansi-flick.html">Hansi Flick</a> will continue to develop this team</p>
