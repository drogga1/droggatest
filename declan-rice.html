  <p><b>[West Ham midfielder Declan Rice has announced he will continue his international career with England]</b> This has been an extremely difficult decision and, in all honesty, not one I ever expected to be making at this stage of my career. Like so many people around the world, I consider myself to be of mixed nationality. I am a proud Englishman, having been born and raised in London. However, I am just as proud of my family’s Irish heritage and my affinity and and connection with the country. Ultimately, it is a personal decision that I have made with my heart and my head, based on what I believe is best for my future.</p>

It’s unbelievable <b>[the London Stadium]</b>. I love every minute of being at West Ham. Being compared to players, being linked to other teams, I don’t really take any of it in, to be honest. If you think about it too much you get caught up in it. I’m only 20, you’ve got your whole career ahead of you. I’m just focused on playing for West Ham and playing with a smile on my face and enjoying it</p>

  <p><b>[Declan Rice urged his team-mates not to pass up the opportunity of winning a first piece of international silverware for England since 1966]</b> It’s massive, not only for me but for the whole squad and the nation. It’s a chance to win the first Nations League and an opportunity to win a trophy for England for the first time since 1966.<br /><br />It’s massive for us as a nation and the players are aware of that - it’s up to us to do the business. Netherlands are a really exciting team. Everyone saw that in the Champions League with <a href="matthijs-de-ligt.html">Matthijs de Ligt</a>, <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a> and <a href="donny-van-de-beek.html">Donny van de Beek</a> for <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a>. But in our squad as well we’ve got fantastic young players who have performed at such a high standard this season. We know the game is going to be tough but it is one that we are confident ahead of. We beat Croatia and Spain to get here and put in good performances - we will do that again against the Netherlands<br /><br /><b>[And the <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> midfielder, named as part of <a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a>’s final 23-man group for the tournament, already feels like a valued member of the squad]</b> I felt comfortable here since the moment I walked through the door for my first camp back in March. All the lads, most of whom I know from playing against them, made me feel welcome. One thing I can say is that Gareth has really got this squad together<br /><br />If you look back to the start of the season at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, I was dragged off at half-time and then missed a few games before returning against <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>. It’s been a whirlwind season for me and one that I have dreamed of; one I never thought would happen. I’ve just got to take it all in my stride. Consistency is key. I’ve kept myself in good shape to play in pretty much every game this season and I have a manager who has put trust in me. I’m the youngest player in the squad but my team-mates have given me the confidence to go out and perform at the level I’ve been performing at.</p>

  <p><b>[Declan Rice is prepared to play dirty in England’s bid for Nations League glory, with <a href="frenkie-de-jong.html">Frenkie de Jong</a> needing to be contained in a meeting with the Netherlands]</b> He is a fantastic player. I am relishing the chance to put myself up against him. You cannot give him too much respect on the pitch because that is when he starts to dictate the game. You have got to be dirty, up in his face and try and disrupt him from playing his game. I am sure as a team we will do well to stop the Dutch. This will be, if I am involved, the biggest game of my life. We are in the semi-finals against a great side.<br /><br /><b>[Declan Rice enjoyed a productive 2018-19 campaign at club level]</b> With the season I have had, most people would have seen that for a young age I have done really well. But this is another level. You are playing against world-class opposition and you need to be on your game<br /><br />Most people would have thought that was tough to take on, with loads of papers in Ireland writing about me and Irish players speaking about me. But it is always going to blow over and I am so laid-back, I do not really take much notice of it. I am just focused on what I have got to do for club and country. I have had to be mentally strong and I have been like that since I was a kid</p>

  <p><b>[Declan Rice admitted he was ‘gutted’ after the Netherlands progressed to the Nations League final at the expense of England]</b> It’s gutting, it really is, it really is gutting. It’s tough. I’m lost for words. First half, we went out there and tried to play our stuff and we obviously had the lead, which I thought was deserved. Holland didn’t really create any chances at all in the first half and then, the second half, we just kind of sat back and we didn’t do what we did in the first half. We didn’t get up in their faces and make it difficult. They obviously got the equaliser from a corner, which is gutting because we work on them day in, day out, and obviously <b>[we had]</b> that VAR controversy again, which was really tight and might have changed the game a bit. Holland won and we cost ourselves the game with two mistakes and I’m gutted about it.<br /><br /><b>[The <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> midfielder went onto defend <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a> for his costly mistake]</b> Look, he is a great player, <a href="john-stones.html">John Stones</a>, and that’s his game, he takes risks. It doesn’t matter that he’s done that, we’re all behind him. We all know we make mistakes in football. The manager backs him, we all back him and it’s one of those things in football where, if you make a mistake, you’ve got to pick your head up and go again. I’ve made plenty in my time and it’s one of those where you’ve got to lift your head and go again but it was tough to take.</p>

I’m loving it at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>, the connection between me and the supporters is special.

The positions he gets himself in, I can tell he’s training with Frank and they are working really well together because he’s like a second striker, making those runs which <a href="frank-lampard.html">Lampard</a> used to. He’s pretty much immaculate. He’s playing the same way Lamps used to play. I am not surprised he is doing that for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and he is going to keep doing that there for years. Since we were young, in training and games, we have always been egging each other on to get better.<br /><br />We have always had a winning mentality. We always want to do well. We went our separate ways but always stayed in contact, dropped each other a message now and then, and it just shows the type of character he is that he has come on and done excellently, and he has started at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> like that. It was special <b>[to see him debut]</b>. From the moment he was lined up to come on, I had a smile on my face. When he ran out and the reception he got, it was really special. I don’t know how he was feeling but I felt like a proud best friend. It was really special for him and his family<br /><br /><b>[On playing alongside his good friend]</b> We never spoke about it until this summer. The season he had at Derby was outstanding, he did really well with the Under-21s and the call-up from Gareth <b>[<a href="gareth-southgate.html">Southgate</a>]</b> was waiting for him. When we were on holiday together this summer, we said, ‘What if it happens?’ with a smile on our faces. When the squad came out the other day, we had a phone call to each other, we were really happy and we have been enjoying it in camp as well. That’s the main thing. I think this would be the last way of us playing together. You would maybe think we would rekindle <b>[our partnership]</b> at a club somewhere but for it to come with England is really special. It is the best way to do it<br /><br /><b>[Rice himself impressed as he completed the full 90 minutes on Saturday in what was just his fourth appearance since committing himself to England over the Republic of Ireland]</b> It is not a lot of time at all. When you get the tournament, you need to be in the best frame of mind for the team. Gareth’s got decisions to make for the squad but, with seven games to go, everyone is fighting for a place and it is healthy and everyone wants to do well. I know I have got to get better for sure. We have had a good start to the season at <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a>. I know I can go up another level. It is only the start of the season. Tonight, I have probably had the most touches of the ball I have had all season, so I want to keep getting on the ball as much as I can, keep it ticking, intercepting the ball, reading the game well - pretty much my all-round game I am trying to improve. I am looking forward to Euro 2020 and hopefully by then I have gone up another level</p>

That’s what clubs are saying. You need at least three weeks of high intensity interval training to get yourself back in shape with the football.
