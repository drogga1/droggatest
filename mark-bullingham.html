  <p><b>[What are sin bins? Sin bins are 10-minute dismissals issued to a player by the referee as punishment for dissent]</b> Dissent is a key part of the game that needs to be tackled, and our pilot phase has proved that sin bins work well. They allow referees to address incidents of dissent quickly and effectively. The trial showed a huge impact on behaviour that we want to roll out to the whole game and make it more enjoyable for everyone</p>

  <p><b>[FA Cup final to take place on August 1 as dates confirmed for quarters &amp; semi-final ties]</b> The competition has been an integral part of the English football calendar for nearly 150 years, and we’d like to thank <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> executive and clubs for their support in scheduling the remaining matches during this unprecedented time. This has been a difficult period for many people and, while this is a positive step, the restart date is dependent on all safety measures being met. The health and wellbeing of players, staff and supporters remains our priority</p>

  <p><b>[FA to make 124 positions redundant and predicts £300m loss due to coronavirus impact]</b> Today we are proposing to make 124 positions redundant. Because we halted recruitment the day we left the offices in March, we are able to take 42 vacant positions out of the structure, which means that we are proposing to remove 82 roles from the organisation. We recognise that this is an incredibly difficult time for those employees who have been affected by these proposals and we will do everything we can to support them during a consultation period, which will start soon<br /><br />All areas of <a href="fa.html">the FA</a> will be affected. One of the most difficult decisions a board and a senior management team have to make is taking really tough financial decisions in the face of a financial crisis which could result in people losing their jobs. We need to save £75m a year and we’ve got a £300m potential hole to fill over the next four years<br /><br />We have a responsibility to preserve our core functions that regulate and serve English football. We also have a duty to support our men’s and women’s senior teams in their efforts to win major tournaments. That means we have set out in our proposals some difficult choices because we do not think we can afford to do all the things that we did before. We believe the impact of this crisis is to force us to focus more than ever on our key priorities</p>
