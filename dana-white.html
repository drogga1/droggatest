  <p><b>[Georges St-Pierre announces he will take a break from fighting]</b> I think this is the right move for <a href="georges-st-pierre.html">Georges St-Pierre</a>. You can hear by listening to him he’s got a lot of issues personally that he needs to deal with<br /><br />At the end of the day, it’s really not that big of a deal. The guy’s <b>[Georges St-Pierre]</b> got some things that he needs to deal with. He was classy enough to say ‘I’m not going to jam up the 170-pound division while I deal with these things, I’m going to step aside and handle myself and then I’ll be back’<br /><br />And as far as working with us, there’s nobody better.

  <p><b>[Dismissing the notion that <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> made a mistake by not aligning with one of the respected California boxing trainers, like Freddie Roach, Abel Sanchez or Virgil Hunter, since he’s been out of the octagon since November]</b> It looks damn good. I’ve got to say I was impressed. Here’s the thing: Boxing guys have been going after <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Floyd Mayweather</a> for years and nobody’s been able to do it. What are they going to teach Conor? Conor knows how to fight. Conor fights in real fights, and he’s going to show Floyd a completely different look than traditional boxing guys. Conor’s going to … fight Floyd Mayweather</p>

It was the darkest press conference I’ve ever been a part of. <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> is the master of mental warfare. Yes, you’re not human if that doesn’t affect you. It’s impossible not to affect. Conor knows that. Conor came in and did what Conor does. That’s why I say he’s the best ever.</p>

The fight that happened tonight, the UFC is a global sport, so tonight <a href="weili-zhang.html">Weili Zhang</a>’s performance was so good and so big that people were watching this fight in Canada, United States, Brazil, and the Middle East.<br /><br /><a href="weili-zhang.html">Weili Zhang</a> became a huge star tonight.

You’ve got <a href="tony-ferguson.html">Tony Ferguson</a> versus <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>, you’ve got Jorge Masvidal out there right now, you’ve got Israel Adesanya who is saying ‘Everybody thinks Yoel Romero is so tough, I’ll fight Yoel Romero’. And then you’ve got Paulo Costa out there too. There’s a lot of good fights next. And oh, we haven’t talked about <a href="jon-jones.html">Jon Jones</a>.

  <p><b>[Dana White has verbal deal in place with Floyd Mayweather]</b> It’s true. We sat at the Clippers game. We started talking and we literally got a deal done right there on the court. And if things play out the way things Floyd and I think they will, I will probably sit down with Al Haymon <b>[Floyd Mayweather’s manager]</b> in March and get a deal on paper. If everything goes our way, Floyd and I would be doing something in October or November <b>[of 2020]</b></p>
