  <p><b>[Everton loanee Henry Onyekuru ‘longing’ to realise Premier League]</b> I’ve been longing and waiting because playing in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> has been a childhood dream even before I left for Qatar. I always watch <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and learn more from him. I want to be just like him in the same league. At the moment I still watch some of his games on YouTube to learn how to move and score like him. I still don’t have my work permit, but that’s why I chose to go out on loan to get the exposure to move me closer to realising that dream<br /><br /><b>[In July 2018, he was shipped to <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> on a season-long loan and has made 26 league appearances to date, scoring 12 goals]</b> I did a medical for Paris St-Germain on a Friday and we had to wait until Monday so they could make both signings <b>[me and another player]</b> official. Then I spoke to my friends because I have some good friends, and I asked if it was a good idea to play in Paris and they gave me their opinions. I also spoke to my mother and she said she just wants me to play because I’m young and still need to improve, and from there the right club will come. So I decided to go with my mother’s advice so I just cut the deal off - just like that. I told my agent to call <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> that we are not going ahead with it.<br /><br />The conversation with my mum helped my decision-making, so it was to a club with better plans for my development. We had <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> before <a href="psg.html">PSG</a> and we all knew getting a UK work permit was going to be difficult. But their relationship with Anderlecht helped a lot in finalising things. I was going to be an <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> player then play on loan at Anderlecht who were competing in the Uefa Champions League. I wanted to get the exposure and experience of playing in the Champions League hence the decision to join <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> via Anderlecht</p>

  <p><b>[Galatasaray star Onyekuru reveals his most memorable goal]</b> I will not forget the goal I scored against Basaksehir throughout my career. I was very happy, when you look at the photos, you can see how I ran to the fans. Everyone was very happy. They were shouting, cheering and saying ‘CimBomBom’. It was an amazing feeling for me.<br /><br />After Sofiane Feghouli’s equaliser, Fernando Muslera said to me, ‘Okay, brother. Now it’s your time. Do not worry and forget about the goal not counted; Forced until the end, luck will come to you’. I also received great trust from him. I had teammates were twice, three times champions in other clubs, but that was very special for me. In fact, I felt it even in the warm-up section that day. I was ready to give all my concentration, my full capacity. We were playing at home. We had fans who supported us incredibly from the very beginning. It was incredible. Thank God we did it.<br /><br /><b>[Onyekuru returned to <a href="galatasaray.html">Galatasaray</a> in January for another loan stint after finding it difficult to secure regular playing time at Monaco, and he has scored a goal in seven league games so far]</b> The most important thing for me is my family. Because you can’t expect to be good in every game. You go home, you are bored; but when you see your wife and your child, you relax. You forget your boredom.<br /><br />Whenever I go home tired, when I see my son, I feel comfortable and feel good. This is the best feeling in life.<br /><br />Before every game, I just call them to have a chance. The support they give me is very important. Unfortunately, they weren’t at the stadium in the match we won last year, but they will definitely be around for the next one</p>

  <p><b>[Onyekuru reveals how Anderlecht denied him a chance to play in <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> and World Cup]</b> Anderlecht wanted me to have surgery but <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> said no and asked me to come back to England. I had a check and one of the specialists there said I could just go through rehab and would be fine in a couple of months. I went back to Belgium to play but the coach of Nigeria had to call Anderlecht to ask them to allow me to play even 15 minutes so they could confirm I was OK to play.<br /><br />The coach was a crazy guy. When we lost it was our fault and when we won he said it was him. I was scoring goals but he’d say I’d been s*** and stuff like that. They <b>[Anderlecht]</b> were angry at that <b>[going back to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and not having surgery]</b> and also the fact my contract gave me the right to decide if I stayed.<br /><br />The new president was mad and was saying ‘who sorted this contract?’ They wanted me to stay one more year but I said no because of what they did stopping me going to the World Cup. The best chance for me to get a work permit was for me to go to the World Cup. The plan to go from <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> to Anderlecht was because I didn’t have the permit. I remember <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> signed <b>[Romelu]</b> <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> and we spoke to the president at Anderlecht because they wanted me to go before leaving Belgium.<br /><br />I felt it was good for me as they were in the Champions League and I wanted to gain more experience and play against big clubs. It’s why <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> were pushing Anderlecht for me to play. It was a big disappointment and was like a bomb had hit me. It’s the biggest tournament in the world and everyone wants to be there</p>
