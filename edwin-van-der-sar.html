There are a few <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> goalkeepers playing at the club who can also take the step up. I was 34 when I went to United, so there are lots of opportunities there. The decision needs to come at a certain point. It’s taken a long time now, so it’s a case of ‘yes’ or ‘no’ but I’m not a director of United<br /><br /><b>[Van der Sar insists that all great players go through dips in form and expects <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a> to be back to his best soon]</b> That happened to me, it happened to <b>[Ryan]</b> <a href="ryan-giggs.html">Giggs</a> also, to everyone.

So I think there’s always been strong characters.

So it’s a long way from the position where they are in now. And of course they have changed managers a couple times now and the real progress is not seen yet, only the thing that they bought in the summer. They bought younger, inexperienced players with a certain desire and hunger, and not like the big names they bought the last six, seven years<br /><br /><b>[Van der Sar admits the club’s lack of recent success may make signings in the future increasingly difficult]</b> Of course, the name is there. And of course the following they have all over the world. But for a player … you want to play at a certain level, you also want to have an idea that you can win trophies and they must take that opportunity also to improve the squad and make the world-class players they have, or the players that they’re going to sign, that they feel welcome and that there’s a good path to where they’re going to go to</p>

  <p><b>[Van der Sar hopes ‘two or three’ new <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> signings will ensure they can compete with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> The honeymoon period <b>[under <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> was great. Then they hit a rocky patch and I think the last seven, eight, nine weeks, they’ve been playing better football. The points were coming in. They had some good results against good teams also. Of course, for them, I hope that the league is going to resume because they probably will need those Champions League places. I think the main thing for them is to focus on the next season and hopefully, with two or three additions, they’ll be competitive again to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Manchester City<br /><br />Consistency, a winning mentality. Maybe they can solve what’s going to happen with Paul <b>[Pogba]</b>, is he going to stay?

And besides that, they’ve also a lot of young players developing as always at United, so in that way, I’m positive for next season for them.<br /><br />In my view, with the type of football they played and the points they are ahead, it would be extremely harsh. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is a well-run league and of course there are big interests on the financial side, the commercial sides. But I’m sure they will make a wise decision if they keep on playing or if the league stops, what the results will be depending on Champions League places, relegation or awarding a title to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>.
