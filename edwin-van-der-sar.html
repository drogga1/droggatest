  <p><b>[On Ederson]</b> Ederson has already shown in the Champions League that his talent is undisputed. He is always focused and has an excellent reading of the game, even without the ball. I think this is odd. It’s not easy for a goalkeeper to be focused for 90 minutes when the ball is mostly on the other side of the field, especially when playing in strong teams.<br /><br />The English league is very different to the Portuguese one, with other types of players, more pressure, more intensity and with much more work. I think Ederson needs another kind of challenge to feel another kind of pressure. But the talent is all there, he only needs to prove it under other conditions. I have no doubt that with the qualities he has can overcome anything</p>

  <p><b>[Edwin van der Sar has advised David de Gea where he needs improve to become the proper number one in the world]</b> I couldn’t imagine how well he has done. He was a very young goalkeeper when he came, replacing me, but he and also the coaches have put in a lot of work to make him the goalkeeper he is now. Eric Steele first and, after, Frans Hoek with Louis van Gaal. He is performing really well. The next step is to be more demanding from his defenders and also to play a little bit more out of his goal but <b>[in terms of]</b> his reaction saves - nobody makes better saves than David De Gea. Yes, these are areas he can work on but he’s 28 <b>[later this year]</b> and I was 34 when I came to United. So he still has a lot of time to improve and the level he has now is an immense high. Maybe he can find another thing to add to his game and the goalkeeping coaches find another thing to work on to set himself as the proper number one in the world.</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax have taken responsibility for inadequate faults in their medical treatment of Abdelhak Nouri after the midfielder suffered an on-field heart attack in July 2017]</b> We have important news about the further course of the terrible incident with Abdelhak Nouri last year.<br /><br />On the basis of new insights that we have unfortunately only been able to collect very recently, we come to new conclusions. It means that the treatment of Abdelhak on the field in Austria in July, 2017 was inadequate. We therefore recognise liability for the consequences thereof. First of all, I would like to apologise to the Nouri family at this place for allowing us to change our position so late.<br /><br />Last year we paid a lot of attention to the medical treatment on the field in Austria with regard to Abdelhak’s accident. A lot has been said and written about that. Unfortunately, we ended up in a situation in which, for a short time, our conclusions and those of the family and her advisers have diverged. I want to emphasise that we regret that this is so.<br /><br />As a club, we first based our analysis of the treatment on the field on the information we received from our own people, but also on television images and other medical data. An external medical advisor, who was assisted by an intensive care physician, assessed all available information of that moment for us and provided a professional second opinion.<br /><br />At a certain moment the situation was this: after all available information was submitted by Ajax to his medical and legal advisers, they concluded that the treatment on the field was adequate and that on the basis of that conclusion there is no reason for liability from the club. This judgement is also based on television images and on the reading of the heart rate monitor Abdelhak had.<br /><br />A heartbeat was detected by the practitioners on the field and this was subsequently confirmed by the results of the heart rate monitor. Based on that information and external opinion, we as a club have taken the position that there was no reason to assume that the field did not work well.<br /><br />The petition filed by the Nouri family with the Dutch FA <b>[KNVB]</b> contained new information for us, which was an important reason to ask other experts for a third opinion. We have begun to doubt the conclusions of our advisers. And we obviously wanted 100 per cent certainty that our position was correct. Hence questions arose about the information underlying the previous medical advice and the position taken on that basis. This had to be investigated further. In the interest of Abdelhak and his family. And of the other players, employees and supporters of Ajax.<br /><br />For a long time we, as management, but also our medical staff, were convinced that Abdelhak received the best possible care in the field. If then, by leading cardiologists, after a thorough examination of the circumstances, things are looked at differently, this is hard. Even though we have insisted on this third opinion ourselves. The first thing we will do is to consult with the Nouri family again. The point now is that we do what is necessary to give substance to the responsibility that we, as a club, but certainly also as a person, as colleagues and friends of Appie, have. We want to solve this in a good way and that is what is now focused on. The use of the arbitration case was whether we acted adequately in the field. That is not the case and we obviously take responsibility for that. We have also previously promised the family that if we find out that we are wrong, we will take responsibility. Which regulation this is going to lead to is something that we will first discuss with the family. I want to offer our very deep apologies to Abdelhak, also in front of you, on behalf of Ajax, his family and relatives. It must have been terribly frustrating that it took so long that our lectures diverged, on top of the grief of what happened to Abdelhak</p>

We strive for and want to achieve is very beautiful.<br /><br />I’ve been close to a switch to Barcelona three times. I have had a few nice clubs, but Barça did fit in. It was discussed a few times. There were different reasons <b>[for the transfer not going through]</b>. once the transfer fee was too high, another time a keeper came for free in a deal with a striker and on the other occasion a presidential candidate suddenly dropped from first to third place.

He came to Ajax aged 18 or 19 and the way he developed and the natural attributes that he already had, his speed, his reaction and I think he set himself as a great goalkeeper. He was in a rush to play first-team football quickly, but I think the level that he composed himself and that first year, playing straight away the Europa League final was a great start. Last year was a difficult season but this year again he has proven to be extremely valuable for the team and, besides that, he is a great guy. I think there are always a lot of rumours about players from Ajax. We develop great players, not only in Amsterdam but hopefully also in Cape Town and there is interest in a lot of our players, but we like to keep them for as long as possible<br /><br />I think on one end, we need to understand that goalkeeping is an art and is also a very important position to have in your club. And the demand is there that clubs can ask the money they receive now for goalkeepers like Liverpool and Man City. But the level goes up and also the type of goalkeeping is not only about shot stopping but it is about distribution and helping the team out. That was a part of my game and I am happy to see that it is prolonging and progressing along the way</p>

  <p><b>[Edwin van der Sar says six of Ajax’s young players were brought in for an inspirational meeting]</b> We said: ‘If you want to be a legend of Ajax you need to win something big’. In my eyes it was really inspirational. They had faith in the club. We needed to talk to the younger players: ‘Wait for us. Believe in us. We are going to make sure there is a team that is going to challenge.’ It has worked miracles for us. Marc and myself have been players. We have flown the nest at a certain point to find another challenge and we know that is going to happen. That’s not a problem as long as they give two, three, four good years of service to the club, win the league, play amazing football. Then you can go. Also, for the young players from the academy to have a path to the first team we need to open up spaces. If you have no spaces then talent underneath is suffocated<br /><br />Those are waves that happen at Ajax and now it is down to us to make sure we are more on the crest of the wave than the trough<br /><br />If you have a love for sport, everybody knows the success of Madrid in the 60s, Ajax in the 70s, Bayern Munich and so on. In the last 20 years, many things have changed in the world of football, mainly on the TV and commercial side. A lot of clubs have lost the perspective of what is a football club. For us at Ajax it is all about football. We have TV rights and a shirt sponsor but we are a country of eight or nine million so to compare to the top five leagues around us it is small change.</p>

  <p><b>[Edwin van der Sar says that it is inevitable that Ajax will sell several stars this summer]</b> We know that’s a fact. That’s the history of Ajax all along. It has been in the 70s, 80s and 90s, so we know that. That also gives space for the younger players, guys who are 19 or 20. In two years time, they will be playing at this kind of level. We’re not going to sell seven players. We need to make sure we can stay competitive. We like this stage of the competition and we like the recongition, so we’re not going to break up the complete team.<br /><br />Of course that’s Ajax development, giving young players a chance. It doesn’t happen every year. Once every couple of years, you have a crop of talent coming through combined with experience with players like <b>[Dusan]</b> Tadic and <b>[Daley]</b> Blind and players who have stayed like Neres. It has made a fantastic team to watch<br /><br />We don’t pay so much in wages and salary of course, a big part of our budget goes into our academy, 11 or 12 million euros are spent on the academy, and we are very proud that four or five players tonight are out of our academy and playing in the semi-final. I experienced it it myself in 1995 with the likes of Davids, Seedorf, Kluivert and Frank and Ronald de Boer and it’s great that, 24 years later, we’re reaching that kind of level again and playing the type of football that people know about Ajax, that we have played</p>

  <p><b>[Van der Sar hopes ‘two or three’ new <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> signings will ensure they can compete with <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>]</b> The honeymoon period <b>[under <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a>]</b> was great. Then they hit a rocky patch and I think the last seven, eight, nine weeks, they’ve been playing better football. The points were coming in. They had some good results against good teams also. Of course, for them, I hope that the league is going to resume because they probably will need those Champions League places. I think the main thing for them is to focus on the next season and hopefully, with two or three additions, they’ll be competitive again to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and Manchester City<br /><br />Consistency, a winning mentality. Maybe they can solve what’s going to happen with Paul <b>[<a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>]</b>, is he going to stay? I’m sure that with <b>[David]</b> De Gea, with <b>[Harry]</b> <a href="harry-maguire.html">Maguire</a>, with Fernandes, with <b>[Marcus]</b> <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a>, with <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial, they have a good line, I think, in the middle. And besides that, they’ve also a lot of young players developing as always at United, so in that way, I’m positive for next season for them.<br /><br />In my view, with the type of football they played and the points they are ahead, it would be extremely harsh. The <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> is a well-run league and of course there are big interests on the financial side, the commercial sides. But I’m sure they will make a wise decision if they keep on playing or if the league stops, what the results will be depending on Champions League places, relegation or awarding a title to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>. If the league doesn’t resume, I presume everybody will be OK if <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> wins the title</p>
