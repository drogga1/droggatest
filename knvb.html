  <p><b>[Dutch matches to halt in first minute in blanket anti-racism message]</b> Racism? Then we won’t play. We want to make clear that enough really is enough by making a statement on the field. We appreciate that all 90 minutes are important for the matches, so we asked the KNVB to add at least one minute of additional time to compensate for the first minute</p>

  <p><b>[KNVB’s statement about Van Basten apologises for Nazi slur on live television]</b> These initiatives also strengthen us in the discussions we have with politicians and our social partners. Because only together can we tackle this social problem properly. Racism is disgusting and does not belong in football. Racism must go out of the world</p>

  <p><b>[Dutch government invests €14m to fight racism in football]</b> Clubs that have made insufficient efforts to combat discrimination may be faced with points deductions, fines or (partly) playing without an audience. Players may be faced with longer suspensions (from matches and training sessions) or exclusion from matches<br /><br />The KNVB will also set up a special discrimination chamber within the disciplinary committee and the appeals committee. This puts the handling of discrimination cases for both professional and amateur football in the hands of specialists. The special prosecutor assesses incoming reports, conducts preliminary investigations and prepares disciplinary cases on discrimination</p>
