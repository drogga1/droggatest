  <p><b>[Netherlands v France to pause for Johan Cruyff silence]</b> The KNVB, including the national team and its staff is deeply touched by the news that Cruyff has passed away. Our thoughts are with his family, who were with him when he passed away. Cruyff’s death is a huge loss for Dutch football and we will honour him in a number of ways. Netherlands play France on Friday and the game will be stopped in the 14th minute for one minute’s silence. The KNVB hopes amateur sides across the country will also pay tribute to Cruyff, but leaves it up to the clubs how to do so.</p>

  <p><b>[Danny Blind has been sacked as Netherlands head coach. Jean Paul Decossaux said]</b> We have respect for what Danny did for us and for the team during his tenure. But because the sporting results are unfortunately disappointing, and because qualifying for the World Cup in Russia is now in difficulty, we unfortunately feel forced to relieve him.</p>

  <p><b>[Dutch football association has confirmed the appointment of Dick Advocaat as Netherlands’ new national team coach for a third time. Hans van Breukelen said]</b> I am very happy with the appointment of Advocaat and Gullit. We had two options. We either went for a long-term solution or we did everything within our powers to still make it to the World Cup. We went for the second option. We needed an experienced coach with authority. A foreigner was never an option. We considered Advocaat, Ten Cate and Huub Stevens.<br /><br />I never promised Ten Cate anything. I was still in talks with two candidates. I am surprised Henk thought he’d be the one. He knew I was still talking with Dick as well. When Fred Rutten pulled out as Henk’s assistant, it was clear for me that we would not go for Henk.<br /><br />I am thinking in couples. Advocaat does not have a clause in his contract this time. His departure as assistant last year? You have to ignore your emotions and go for quality. Advocaat will take charge once Fenerbahce are out of the Turkish cup.</p>

  <p><b>[Ajax to be given rest ahead of Tottenham clash as whole Eredivisie matchday postponed]</b> This is done to meet the agreed condition of at least two full days of rest between two games. That is the starting point for our competition planning. That applies to all clubs and applies to all competitions in which they play; Eredivisie, cup tournaments and European football. In addition, for the sake of a fair running of the competition, we maintain that for as long as possible we insist that on the last two matchdays all clubs play their games simultaneously.</p>

  <p><b>[Dutch matches to halt in first minute in blanket anti-racism message]</b> Racism? Then we won’t play. We want to make clear that enough really is enough by making a statement on the field. We appreciate that all 90 minutes are important for the matches, so we asked the KNVB to add at least one minute of additional time to compensate for the first minute</p>

  <p><b>[Dutch government invests €14m to fight racism in football]</b> Clubs that have made insufficient efforts to combat discrimination may be faced with points deductions, fines or (partly) playing without an audience. Players may be faced with longer suspensions (from matches and training sessions) or exclusion from matches<br /><br />The KNVB will also set up a special discrimination chamber within the disciplinary committee and the appeals committee. This puts the handling of discrimination cases for both professional and amateur football in the hands of specialists. The special prosecutor assesses incoming reports, conducts preliminary investigations and prepares disciplinary cases on discrimination</p>
