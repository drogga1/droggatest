  <p><b>[Liverpool star Salah laughs off suggestion he could leave Anfield]</b> In 2018/2019 M.

Salah is the team’s top scorer in both <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, and the Champions League. Since joining <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool FC</a> in 2017, M.

  <p><b>[Ramy Abbas says <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> star <a href="mohamed-salah.html">Mohamed Salah</a> never discussed a possible move to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> with a former coach]</b> Mohamed never discussed any career plans with any ex coach<br /><br />He actually contacted me around the end of January or beginning of February in 2015, looking for legal advice. We met for the first time in London. Looking back, I think that was the most important milestone of my career. His mind works at full speed and I think the guy is constantly switched on. I think Mohamed believes that I have no feelings. But I think we have an equal effect on one another. I’ve learned things from him.<br /><br /><b>[Abbas also revealed the trauma of seeing the star go down injured in the 2018 Champions League final]</b> The most traumatic moment in my life, never mind football, was in Kiev during the Champions League final - when Mohamed went down injured. It was absolutely horrific. I was in the stands. I tried to get to the pitch but I couldn’t. It was dark. It was the worst moment I can remember, ever</p>
