  <p><b>[Fosu-Mensah determined to prove his worth]</b> Who doesn’t want to play for United? So, yeah, I’m definitely eager to come back and to do well and to help the team and to give my all, my heart for this great club. My goal is to be a regular for the club, to win so many trophies for the club, to have memorable experiences with this club. That’s the goal. I think that’s everyone’s goal who plays in the team for Manchester. I was feeling very good to feature for the team.

Obviously I had my first training session with the first-team, it was I think around December, so that’s the first time when you really see me in front of his own eyes on the pitch.

  <p><b>[Timothy Fosu-Mensah desperate to kickstart career and thrive at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>]</b> Time flies, time flies. I wanted to say when I was younger but I am now 22. But when I was like 18 and 19 - yeah, I worked hard, everybody has to work hard - I was playing for one of if not the biggest teams in the world. I made my debut for Holland at 19, so I didn’t really know the other side of football - and the other side of how hard it could be. By me saying this I mean with the big injury like this. I never seen it coming. I don’t think anyone sees an ACL injury coming. But I developed to get my mind stronger. I developed to, yeah, be mentally stronger and to just stay positive because you just have to keep going. Things happen in life, it’s the way you react. So, this is my mindset and my mentality, and the club have helped me very well, my physio in Holland has helped me very well to be back and fit and I feel very good and strong<br /><br /><b>[The 22-year-old featured for them again against Stoke in early March]</b> I was feeling very good to feature for the team. Obviously the manager makes the decisions, but I was feeling confident to come back and make an appearance and, yeah, to enjoy the game<br /><br /><b>[Despite that frustration, there is a palpable positivity about Fosu-Mensah who simply says]</b> You can’t take it back, you just have to look forward<br /><br /><b>[United boss <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> has given him hope of a future at a club that recently triggered the extension clause in his contract]</b> He has been very positive with me. He sees I’ve been working hard, and he’s been encouraging me every single time, so I feel the trust from him. I learned so much, so many things at the club. I’ve been to college with Axel (Tuanzebe), with Marcus, <a href="scott-mctominay.html">Scott McTominay</a>, with all these all these players. We’ve been to college altogether for two years. I had to wear black boots; we were obligated to wear black boots by Brian McClair when I was in the Under-18s. We were obligated not to wear hand gloves, even in the winter! No under armour. And then when I came to the under-21s, I had Warren Joyce and all these things so, like, Manchester definitely feels like home because I came in 2014, now it’s 2020. It’s six years. They gave me my professional career, you know? My first professional match in football was for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and they developed me<br /><br /><b>[And with his contract extended until 2021, Fosu-Mensah does not want to leave his adopted home anytime soon]</b> Who doesn’t want to play for United? So, yeah, I’m definitely eager to come back and to do well and to help the team and to give my all, my heart for this great club. My goal is to be a regular for the club, to win so many trophies for the club, to have memorable experiences with this club. That’s the goal.

  <p><b>[Fosu-Mensah recently admitted his injuries were difficult to deal with mentally but revealed his determination to stay at the club]</b> It was definitely hard, mentally. I love to play football but it’s part of the game. You have to be strong in the head and it’s a physical sport so, obviously, these things can happen. I love this club. I came here when I was a kid and they took very good care of me and made me a professional player. It’s wonderful to play for this club. I don’t want this to stop. I’m definitely excited for the future - I think it looks very bright</p>
