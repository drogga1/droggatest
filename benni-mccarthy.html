  <p><b>[Benni McCarthy dreams of taking Bafana Bafana to the World Cup]</b> If the Bafana offer came up one day, I would definitely be interested. Which coach or manager wouldn’t be interested in being the head coach of his country? The national job is the biggest job for any football coach - your country’s fate lies in your hands, you have the chance to guide the team to World Cups, to win the Africa Cup of Nations - it’s huge<br /><br /><b>[McCarthy said while coaching at international level is his dream, he still wants to arm himself with experience and knowledge by coaching at club level]</b> I think one day, in the near future, that would be my aim but for now I am more interested in working with players on a day-to-day basis. I like to work hands-on with the players every single day. I want to see them grow, improve, challenge themselves and become better footballers</p>

  <p><b>[Benni McCarthy confirms he turned down <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> Cape Town]</b> If it’s the right club, the right chairman and owner, someone I can work with then sure, I’ll be up for it. But I’m not just going to take a job for the sake of taking it if it’s not the right move for both parties. The <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> Cape Town job was probably mine if I wanted it. I had a few discussions with the club’s CEO Ari Efstathiou - we had great conversations. The project could have been good but the timing wasn’t right for me<br /><br /><b>[McCarthy, who had his fifth child last year, said it would make sense at the moment for him to get a coaching job closer to his family, who are based in Scotland]</b> As much as I’m South African at heart being closer to my family is very important to me. Given all the time I spent playing in Europe, I know the football culture and the mentality there. It would make more sense if my next move would be a European club whether it’s in Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, England or Spain, which I doubt because people of my colour don’t get to coach there. But I won’t limit myself to Europe because if the right offer comes from anywhere in the world I would be happy to take it</p>
