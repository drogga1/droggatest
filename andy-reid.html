<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Dele Alli has everything it takes to be a really, really top player]</b> You would imagine the England team of the future will be built around him. He’s got everything you need from a midfielder and really is a special player. He can go up and down the pitch and score goals and has an absolutely fantastic temperament. He has everything it takes to be a really, really top player and I hope he stays at Tottenham and develops even more. It’s a good place to be and Pochettino is the perfect manager to help him develop as a player and as a person.<br /><br /><b>[Sergio]</b> Aguero is fantastic but Harry Kane is just lethal at the moment. His finishes at the weekend show he’s in a rich vein of form and when he has confidence he puts them in the top corner and doesn’t give keepers a chance. In my opinion he can get thirty-plus goals this season<br /><br />Pochettino is doing a fantastic job and if anybody is going to catch Chelsea I would say that would be Tottenham. I really hope they can and it’s certainly going to be close. I watched the game at the weekend and they were absolutely fantastic: they just brushed West Brom aside and West Brom are playing well right now. They played good attacking Tottenham-like football and that’s what the fans like to see. Harry Kane is on fire and <b>[Mousa]</b> Dembele and <b>[Christian]</b> Eriksen are playing really well while they look tight at the back</p>
