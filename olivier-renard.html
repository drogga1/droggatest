  <p><b>[The Montreal Impact have extended the loan of Finnish international Lassi Lappalainen’s loan from Bologna]</b> We are really pleased with Lassi’s loan extension and we’re happy to have him stay with us. He is the type of player with a profile we like in our roster, meaning a young player with huge potential. He showed his qualities in <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> since last July and we put a lot of trust in him. Lassi feels good in this city and wanted to remain in this club</p>
