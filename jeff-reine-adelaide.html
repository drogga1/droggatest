  <p><b>[Angers midfielder Jeff Reine-Adelaide has revealed that Unai Emery told him he wasn’t needed at Arsenal when he took the managerial reigns in 2018]</b> It is true that I would like to speak a little less of Arsenal. I was young. It was complicated. There was so much competition that it was difficult to get into the coach’s line-up. He <b>[Emery]</b> told me that the club did not rely too much on me. I took a blow, but Angers was on the lookout. It was a new chance, a new beginning. The train does not pass often and I was happy to get back in the right car.<br /><br /><b>[The young playmaker was previously deployed as a winger in north London, but he now operates as a playmaker in the middle of the park for Angers]</b> Of course. It’s a reward. My season had started well, then I had a hole. I bounced back and today I am rewarded for my work. I invested a lot and it is the reward of a beautiful season. This is clearly the position I feel best. I started there when I was younger. After, I was on the wings, but for me, it is where I can most exploit my qualities best. I am a ball player and in the middle, it is we who dictate the game. We must do it wisely, helping our partners. We must defend as well. I especially like to command the tempo. I look a lot at professional players in this position, and some inspire me a lot<br /><br /><b>[Reine-Adelaide went on to name Manchester United’s Paul Pogba as one his role models, along with former Arsenal star Abou Diaby]</b> I watch a lot what Pogba does, with Manchester or in France. Before, there was also Abdou Diaby. He is a player who has always impressed me. He was one of the best at his job. There are plenty of others, but Pogba and Diaby are the two that I have watched the most because we have the same slender profile<br /><br /><b>[When quizzed on a potential transfer this summer]</b> We do not know what is happening tomorrow, but I would like to stay in France to continue moving up before, why not, joining a big club</p>

  <p><b>[Lyon midfielder Jeff Reine-Adelaide has insisted that leaving <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to further his career at Angers was a good choice]</b> I was young <b>[17 years old]</b> when I arrived at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and it was a little complicated. There was a lot of competition and I had to learn. I wanted to go somewhere else to get playing time and it turns out that it was a good choice, considering where I am. I’ve moved forward since returning to France. I started from almost nothing again because I had a hard time. In England, I played almost no professional matches. If you look at my career, I’m basically just starting it - it really started a year and a half ago. Now, I blossom when I’m on the pitch. This summer, I was especially happy to see that many clubs were asking for me, including Monaco, who played in the Champions League not so long ago. But I thought it was better to sign with <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. I feel ready to succeed at this club, which challenges for titles in all competitions</p>
