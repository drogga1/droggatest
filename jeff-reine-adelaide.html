<blockquote>
  <p><b>[Lyon midfielder Jeff Reine-Adelaide has insisted that leaving <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to further his career at Angers was a good choice]</b> I was young <b>[17 years old]</b> when I arrived at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> and it was a little complicated. There was a lot of competition and I had to learn. I wanted to go somewhere else to get playing time and it turns out that it was a good choice, considering where I am. I’ve moved forward since returning to France. I started from almost nothing again because I had a hard time. In England, I played almost no professional matches. If you look at my career, I’m basically just starting it – it really started a year and a half ago. Now, I blossom when I’m on the pitch. This summer, I was especially happy to see that many clubs were asking for me, including Monaco, who played in the Champions League not so long ago. But I thought it was better to sign with <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a>. I feel ready to succeed at this club, which challenges for titles in all competitions</p>
