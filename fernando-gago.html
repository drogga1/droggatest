<blockquote>
  <p>[Barcelona talisman Lionel Messi is capable of winning a game in half a second] We know that he has the ability to win a match in half a second and that gives you peace of mind. In every game I have the feeling that he can make us win at any time. Messi’s way of leading is with the ball, sometimes a glance is enough. He has an incredible personality, he understands the game perfectly, he has fought for 14 years to be the best without letting himself down, and that shows how he is. He is the best I have seen in my life, without a doubt.<br /><br />[Real Madrid] made me a man. I went there to live alone and I had other responsibilities, especially that of wearing the shirt of one of the biggest teams. I have no resemblance to Fernando [Redondo] and that was for the journalists and not me. He is my idol but there was never a possible comparison. The issue is that we always stay with the last impression in Madrid, when I lost my place due to an injury. However I played more than 100 games, I won two leagues and a Copa del Rey</p>
