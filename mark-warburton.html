  <p><b>[Emerson Hyndman’s loan at Rangers got off to a flying start as he delivered the game-winning assist for his side’s 2-1 Scottish Cup win over Motherwell]</b> It was two quality finishes, a great ball in from <b>[Martyn Waghorn]</b> and then the composure and the poise from Kenny. The second is a great ball in from Emerson and he finishes it with aplomb so it is no coincidence. It is the way he <b>[Miller]</b> works on the training field, the way he eats. It is all credit to him and the senior players.</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers announced Friday the resignation of manager Mark Warburton]</b> At a meeting with the management team’s representative earlier this week the Club were advised that Mr Warburton, Mr Weir and Mr McParland wished to resign their positions and leave the Club on the condition that Rangers agreed to waive its rights to substantial compensation. Rangers’ agreement to waive compensation would assist the management team to join another club.</p>

  <p><b>[Meet Glasglow Rangers wonderkid Billy Gilmour]</b> Billy is a talented player and I’m sure many clubs are looking at him. Our job is to show him the pathway there is to get to the first team. You look at the competition at English Premier League clubs and how hard it is for young players to get into their first teams. It is incredibly difficult. I like to think we can keep him here, develop him and he can play in the first team.</p>

  <p><b>[Former Rangers boss Mark Warburton says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> youngster Gilmour can become a ‘world-class’ player]</b> David Weir and I went to his house to try and keep him for Rangers. We spent time with his mum and dad, but when the big boys come calling, it’s tough. His talent was unquestioned. I remember he played against what was a Dundee reserve side with a number of first-team players in it. I’m looking at Billy who was 15 and thinking there is a health-and-safety issue here because he was so slight. But he went out and absolutely ran the show. He had trained with us a couple of times in the first team and I am really pleased to see how he is doing now. What a talent. I think Scotland have a future world-class midfield player, I really do. I think he is going to keep on improving because he is in a great environment with Frank and Jody (Morris, assistant manager) and the players at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>. I very much hope he can continue that progress because, if so, Scotland truly will have a world-class midfield player there<br /><br />I remember one of my first academy games with <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> was against <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. We had a good team and we got beaten 9-0. I think it was Under-12 level and I saw this kid just run the show. It was <a href="jack-wilshere.html">Jack Wilshere</a>. Whichever side he was on would have won the game 9-0. He was so far ahead of his time and so talented. <a href="billy-gilmour.html">Billy Gilmour</a> is right up there with him. Jack has been unlucky in terms of being hit by injuries, but Billy is in a great environment. If you love the game of football, his development is great to see. It really is</p>

  <p><b>[Charlton boosted their Championship survival hopes with a hard-fought victory over QPR at The Valley]</b> In the second half we dominated for long, long periods, but you have to test their goalkeeper and put the ball in the back of the net. We have seven games to go - tough games - and we want to show what we’re about. We’ve had two 1-0s, today was a much better performance, but still we leave with no points</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="cyrus-christie.html">Cyrus Christie</a>’s first league goal for Fulham earned <a href="scott-parker.html">Scott Parker</a>’s team a Championship promotion lifeline in a 2-1 win at QPR]</b> I think it’s very clear what my perception will be: we’ve given away three points tonight. It was a very, very strong display; intensity, desire quality, had to maintain it second half, we did that but didn’t get the rewards tonight. There’s one team in it in the second half, we’ve hit the bar and gone close, but we’ve let in two soft goals shot from distance. Against a very talented team, I have huge respect for <a href="scott-parker.html">Scott Parker</a> and Fulham, but I don’t see how that has happened tonight</p>

  <p><b>[Wigan’s hopes of avoiding the drop were boosted as Kieffer Moore’s first-half strike earned the beleaguered Championship outfit a 1-0 win over QPR at a rain-soaked DW Stadium]</b> They probably wanted it more than us in the first half. They’ve had some shocking news, appalling news and we knew they’d be united and together and angry, and they were.<br /><br />But then the second half we came out much better and controlled the first 15 minutes, and then we have to score. We can’t miss from four yards out, basically into the middle of the goal, we can’t miss those chances</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="sheffield-wednesday.html">Sheffield Wednesday</a> took advantage of QPR’s post-lockdown blues by cruising to a 3-0 victory at Loftus Road]</b> It was more than disappointing. I’ll always defend my team when I think it’s the right thing to do but that would be foolish. We were well below the QPR of this season. We were off the pace, pointless in our passing and lacklustre. We got what we deserved today</p>

  <p><b>[Luton missed the chance to move out of the Championship relegation zone as they were held to a 1-1 draw by QPR]</b> It was a much better performance and we’re disappointed not to get all the three points. It was a soft goal given away, a very soft penalty, but after that I thought it was like a normal QPR team and a much better second half.<br /><br />We went 1-0 down again and we didn’t do our jobs as a team. We were much better at the end of the first half, a dominant second half, but we couldn’t put the ball in the back of the net. We had to respond, that was the most disappointing, frustrating, disheartening display I’ve seen from a team on Saturday. We were very clear in our assessment of that, but the players have got professional pride, you saw their response tonight, they were very keen to give a positive reaction</p>
