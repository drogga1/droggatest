  <p><b>[Chandler has proven to be an asset because of his versatility]</b> It’s just not such a difficult thing whether it’s right or left, because I can also play with my left foot. I think it’s OK. I always play there where the coach needs me and sometimes he needs me in defense on the right, left or as a centre back so it’s not a big deal for me. I always try my best and today I could score, which was important</p>

  <p><b>[Timothy Chandler hopes a change in tactics could mean regular first-team football with <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> in the months ahead]</b> We’re not as predictable with a four-man defence that we can then switch up during a game and tailor according to the opposition. It’s a good option. We just need to have the right mentality, and fight on and off the ball. The results will come if we can do that<br /><br />It took a long time to fight back and get into contention. Whether I’m playing 90 minutes or not doesn’t matter - I’m always here for the team. The coach knows I’m ready to help in any way I can - my run in the team shows that. Hopefully I’ll continue to get my minutes during the second half of the season</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a>’s USA defender Timothy Chandler has been playing so well in 2020 that even his teammates can’t quite believe it]</b> I’m running out of superlatives for him. You have to ask what magic potion he’s been drinking. I’d like to have some of it myself, so that I can score a couple of goals, too! But I’m absolutely delighted for him. He’s worked hard for it, was on the bench for a while and now he’s getting his reward</p>
