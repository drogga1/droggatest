Arsenal have made a €25 million bid to sign Saint-Etienne defender William Saliba although they are set to face competition from their north London rivals Tottenham for the 18-year-old</p>

<p>: 2019 07 01
Arsenal and Tottenham have been warned by Ghislain Printant that prising William Saliba away from Saint-Etienne will not be easy</p>

<p>: 2019 07 09
Arsenal are set to sign William Saliba from Saint-Etienne after agreeing a deal in the region of £26.5 million</p>

  <p><b>[William Saliba says <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a>’s father was my coach!]</b> I know <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Kylian Mbappe</a>, He went to my primary school when we were little, and his father was my coach when I was little, too.<br /><br /><b>[Despite growing up in a tough neighbourhood, Saliba appears to speak fondly of his roots]</b> I grew up on an estate. Honestly, growing up on an estate helps. You’re together with all your mates, you get to play in your neighbourhood on the local five-a-side pitches. You’re all together, and everyone likes football there, so honestly it’s easy. When you come from an estate, you’ve got the determination to get out of it</p>

Arsenal are hoping to seal a deal to land William Saliba from Saint-Etienne.</p>

<p>: 2019 07 24
Arsenal are continuing their pursuit of Wilfried Zaha and Kieran Tierney as they prepare to announce the signings of Dani Ceballos and William Saliba.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal unable to agree William Saliba loan extension at Saint-Etienne]</b> Throughout our discussions with Saint-Etienne, our aim has been to protect the welfare of William Saliba as well as the interests of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> Football Club, while honouring the terms of the loan. Despite the loan ending on June 30, we were willing to find a way for William to play in the <b>[French]</b> cup final on July 24, despite having no contractual obligation to do so<br /><br />As William is returning from injury, we asked that Saint-Etienne follow a clear training plan with William in close collaboration with us, to ensure he is fully fit for the start of next season. To our surprise, we were unable to reach agreement to this plan which was proposed by our medical experts, and we are simply not prepared to risk the welfare of an <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> player<br /><br />While it was not our primary concern, and ultimately not relevant as our training plan was not accepted, we also expected not to be financially disadvantaged by extending the loan. This was also not acceptable to Saint-Etienne. We know this is a disappointment for William but he understands we are working to protect his long-term interests and those of Arsenal<br /><br />ASSE, which simply wanted the extension of the initial loan until July 24, could not find an agreement in the evening with <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> to allow the defender to properly prepare and play this meeting, the English club imposing absolutely unacceptable sports and financial conditions</p>

  <p><b>[Saliba reveals reason he chose <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> over Tottenham]</b> Since I was little, I’ve been watching <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> play in the Champions League and so on. There are a lot of French players who have come through here, so that really helped me to make my mind up<br /><br /><b>[Saliba also revealed that current Gunners midfielder <a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Matteo Guendouzi</a> had his say in the move]</b> I spoke to Matteo <b>[Guendouzi]</b>, I even bumped into him at a funfair in Paris. That’s where I told him that <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> wanted to sign me! He gently advised me to come here and explained what it was like. It’s a massive pleasure to sign for a really, really big English club. This is the biggest club in England for me, so it was an easy decision. I didn’t think twice about signing here, so I’m really happy. You have to keep working when you hear that a club is interested in signing you. You have to keep working; that’s what I’m doing and I’m proud to be signing here.<br /><br /><b>[When asked why this was the right choice for the youngster]</b> Well, it was important first of all because I wanted to prove myself for another year at Saint-Etienne, before I come to try and establish myself here at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. This is a big club, and when you come here, you need to be ready. I’m going to try and have a great season with the club that developed me in order to be ready for Arsenal</p>
