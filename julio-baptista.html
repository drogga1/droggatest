  <p><b>[Julio Baptista has warned Kylian Mbappe not to get carried away following his sublime performances at the World Cup]</b> I think you have to be careful with how quickly you judge. Mbappe is a very young player and depending on how we label him … that goes around the world and the player can believe it. You have to be calm and patient because there have been many good young players, like Ronaldo or Pele. He is a great player, he is developing really well and we expect a lot from him. But it was not for nothing that they called Ronaldo ‘el Fenomeno,’ right?<br /><br />With discussions like this I think that sometimes you cannot compare certain players. Pele won three World Cups with Brazil, so you have to give space, time for the player to grow and not harm him by making him believe something he is not yet</p>

  <p><b>[Former Brazil international Julio Baptista is confident Neymar can still become the best player in the world]</b> Everything in life has a beginning, a middle and an end. For him there was the beginning in Barcelona, where he had won many titles. He was part of one of the best teams in the world, he learned how to play in Europe and other important things. But he believed that it was time for him to take the next step and to be able to fulfil his personal goal, which is to try to be the best in the world. Maybe in Barcelona he believed that he could not be the best player in the world and I think he made the decision to leave because of that. He is not yet the best, he has work to do. But if he keeps working hard, he can get there.</p>

  <p><b>[Real Madrid can move on from the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> Real Madrid miss Cristiano’s goals, logically, but nobody has ever been irreplaceable at Real Madrid, and no one will. Cristiano is the best, or one of the best players in history. But he left. And some others will come and then leave. That’s the story. After the Galacticos era, Real won four Champions titles.<br /><br />Lopetegui? Real Madrid don’t wait for anybody. It’s such a big club that needs results and quickly. Remember the Ancelotti case? Guti could be ready to be the Real Madrid coach</p>

  <p><b>[Julio Baptista has lifted a whole host of trophies during his glittering career]</b> Many people say, ‘You have to be very lucky.’ But I say, ‘You have to train hard’. I’ve seen some very talented players come unstuck along the way, and others with less talent become players. Why? Because of their persistence and their perseverance to reach their target… nothing is impossible</p>

It is a long term project, and if he is given time then he will deliver results, but he must be shown patience.<br /><br /><b>[When asked to rank <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, <a href="laliga.html">La Liga</a> and <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> in terms of quality]</b> I think all the competitions are good, but I think English football is ahead because of their competitiveness and because they have five teams that can compete for the title.
