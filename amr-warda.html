Amr Warda was expelled from the squad after Merhan Keller, a British-Egyptian model, shared screenshots of lewd and aggressive messages allegedly sent by the midfielder to her and other women</p>

  <p>[Amr Warda was expelled from the squad after sexual harassment scandal. The net result was Amr Warda - after apologising for his actions - was allowed to rejoin the panel for Egypt’s final group game, and the last-16 meeting with South Africa. Salah’s support had been crucial] Women must be treated with the utmost respect. No’ means ‘no’. Those things are and must remain sacred. I also believe that many who make mistakes can change for the better and shouldn’t be sent straight to the guillotine, which is the easiest way out. We need to believe in second chances… we need to guide and educate. Shunning is not the answer<br /><br />[Salah’s stance wasn’t only offensive, either. It was downright bizarre, given that he had championed women’s rights in an interview with Time magazine in April] I think we need to change the way we treat women in our culture. It’s not optional<br /><br />[Rightly or wrongly, some footballers are considered role models. And it is a responsibility that Salah takes very seriously. He has spoken in the past of the ‘pressure’ that comes with the job] To be the first Egyptian in [this] situation and no one has done this before. it’s something different</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[In addition, Merhan Keller, who is taking legal action against Warda, subsequently claimed that she has received thousands of abusive messages after Mohamed Salah’s tweets] This person (Mohamed Salah) is God in Egypt. Literally. He is one of the most recognised figures in the world. This has pushed people to harass me even more. You have no idea the amount of hate messages, threats and stuff that I am getting. I cannot go to my country right now if I want to visit my family. People will attack me in the streets. You know what he has done, so the fact that he (Mohamed Salah) is still siding with him (Amr Warda) is really, really painful</p>
