  <p><b>[River Plate Coach Marcelo Gallardo played down rumours he could take over as <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> coach]</b> No party came forward to start a conversation, especially knowing that we are in a very important phase for our club, playing decisive matches. Of course there is nothing that takes my focus off the goals ahead. I can’t echo the rumours. No one came to suggest a meeting or analysis of what to do in the future. This is not the time for that</p>

  <p><b>[Barcelona-linked Marcelo Gallardo to stay on at River Plate in 2020]</b> At the end of the year I usually stop to see where I’m going, what stimulates me, my state, what gets me going and what works with my professional and personal priorities. Something began to be generated regarding the decision I was going to make. I don’t want that to continue. On January 2 I will be here and I will start the pre-season, which may be in Uruguay, Buenos Aires or the south of the country. I am not interested in generating any kind of uncertainty. My wish is to continue with this team. I never had doubts about staying. Being here is hard with the requirements you put on yourself and what it means to be in charge of this club. That’s why you have to stop and reflect. Beyond my contract, which expires in December 2021, there is no clause. The leadership and I have a very cordial relationship</p>
