  <p><b>[Argentina stand every chance of securing World Cup glory this summer purely because they have Lionel Messi]</b> I think Argentina has always been a leader in global football. I think now there are two or three teams in the world better than Argentina - first Brazil, then Germany and Spain, and then us. Now that we have Messi on our team, we have a chance to win. We have this feeling. We feel like we can become the central team because we have Messi. But three national teams: Brazil, Germany and Spain, are better than us.<br /><br />I think that the point is you feel like you represent your team and your country. I think that it creates a fountain of intense emotions. Very intense because it is not just about patriotism, it is about playing in a jersey that has your country’s colors. You enjoy that the most, the process of playing</p>

  <p><b>[River wizard Marcelo Gallardo’s is Argentina’s finest tactician]</b> Right now I am not thinking about the national team, I have plenty on my mind with River. After that, I think any renewal can only be a good thing, but there must be a solid structure and base to create that renewal.</p>
