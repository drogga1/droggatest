  <p><b>[Pajtim Kasami’s career has taken him all over Europe]</b> It was a very tough year. I’m very proud the way I managed to turn it around in the end because it was something that made me feel very bad towards the people who gave me the trust, the fans. It was one of the toughest months in my career. I stayed <b>[for]</b> months at home, I didn’t go to see my family. I stayed very calm and tried to always stay positive because there were so many negative things around that it was impossible. But at the end of the day I like to stay home because it’s the place where you can wind down and relax.<br /><br />I called him <b>[Raiola]</b> and asked him to meet. He brings you the facts but he’s also very hard on you because he wants you to perform, to score goals and do well as this is how the market works. It’s also how he could bring me to another level. After one year at Palermo I had two or three different options, I had Rome and Milan in Italy and in England it was Fulham who really wanted me. I think my third year in Fulham was my best year. I was playing almost every game. Unfortunately <b>[Mohamed]</b> Al Fayed sold the club to Shahid Khan. It was a big change for the players as we didn’t know what would happen to us. Martin Jol got sacked and we felt that there was panic, then Rene Meleunsteen came in and Felix Magath came in after. Things became more stressful and most of the players left, it made my decision to leave easier<br /><br /><b>[The prospect of Champions League football with Greek champions Olympiakos]</b> It was a big team and it was easier when I saw they signed players like Ibrahim <b>[Afellay]</b> and <b>[Eric]</b> Abidal from Barcelona. I knew I would go to a club that would win titles and I was happy with the decision that I made.<br /><br /><b>[The following August, Kasami was loaned to Nottingham Forest amid fears for his safety in the country]</b> It was the anger after the game, losing the game. It caused a big impact in Greece afterwards but I don’t regret it because I love Olympiakos, the fans and the president. I defended my team-mates and the club. Two or three times I was followed by cars at strange times. After the club looked after me and gave me one of their security people who worked around my house. The hate between the two clubs is huge, you can’t imagine<br /><br />When things are going well everyone can be amazing. When things aren’t going well it shows the real person and player. To get out of the negative thoughts I try to do something, like visit my family. Even though when I visit my family when things aren’t going well you always end up talking about football. To be honest, I try to be with people who aren’t involved in football. I always get the nice comments from the Fulham fans and obviously the Olympiakos fans are dying for me to go back. They had a chant for me <b>[that translated as]</b> ‘Kasami, don’t ever leave the port’. Every move is not because I like to move. I’d love to stay in a place and be satisfied and grow something important. Obviously you have goals whether it’s England or Italy or Spain, it depends. I’m convinced if I’m patient enough and work hard then I will achieve the goals I want to achieve</p>

  <p><b>[Ex-Fulham star Pajtim Kasami on ‘keeping calm’ during lockdown]</b> I think it was more a lack of communication in my club with me. We had only been told on WhatsApp that we should agree on a salary reduction. We didn’t have chats one by one. Then, the majority of the team said no because we needed more explanation about it. My lawyer said no, then the next day we received a negative response from the club again through WhatsApp saying that we are being released because of it. It was a shock and because of the virus, there was not a lot going on in football so it was quite a big news story. It wasn’t nice to be honest <b>[that]</b> this was out there but then there were more important things going on around the virus. It was a lack of communication and I still think you should discuss things internally as is what happened with my friends at other clubs around Europe. They didn’t make the headlines but we did. We ultimately took a salary reduction while we are not training fully, but on Monday, we are back 100 per cent so things are normal again. But players with their contract expiring on June 30, we are in discussions to make an agreement with the club to continue until the end of the season. This is my scenario and I will be discussing next week with my club about this. The season starts on June 20 to finish in August. It is a problem in all leagues except Germany. My contract is until June 30 so it will not change a lot. As the season continues, I will probably extend my stay until the last game of the season and then after I am a free agent. The last three seasons here in Sion have personally been very positive. I can be happy with them.<br /><br />Of course, we can always do more. The season is still on with 13 games to play. I want to break my personal goal record this season. It is like a new season but one to finish too. It is exciting and important to stay fit and healthy. I am confident I can break this record. I think I am at my best age of football so I am ready for the next challenge in my career. In football a month ago, everyone was saying they don’t know, they don’t know but now it is a bit better. I think in two or three weeks that the situation can be much better and clearer. I just need to stay positive; my agent is doing all the work so I am staying fit and get back to form with Sion. I like to experience the best football in the best leagues. Where will that be? I don’t know yet. It is a tricky question because for me the best league in the world is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but I like Italy and Spain. I have played in England, Italy and Greece so maybe to experience Spain would be something to love. But it has to be the right project and then we go from there.<br /><br />We, as athletes, are role models in these moments. I didn’t see my parents in Zurich for a long time and I stayed living alone. I only left the house to run and go to the supermarket for my elderly neighbour and me. She has been giving me flowers from her garden in return. It was strange, tough but at the same time, you can learn more about yourself. I think we can see from the numbers that we took it seriously. I am not a virologist or a doctor, so I respect something I don’t understand</p>
