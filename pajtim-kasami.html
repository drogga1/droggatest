  <p><b>[Ex-Fulham star Pajtim Kasami on ‘keeping calm’ during lockdown]</b> I think it was more a lack of communication in my club with me. We had only been told on WhatsApp that we should agree on a salary reduction. We didn’t have chats one by one. Then, the majority of the team said no because we needed more explanation about it. My lawyer said no, then the next day we received a negative response from the club again through WhatsApp saying that we are being released because of it. It was a shock and because of the virus, there was not a lot going on in football so it was quite a big news story. It wasn’t nice to be honest <b>[that]</b> this was out there but then there were more important things going on around the virus. It was a lack of communication and I still think you should discuss things internally as is what happened with my friends at other clubs around Europe. They didn’t make the headlines but we did. We ultimately took a salary reduction while we are not training fully, but on Monday, we are back 100 per cent so things are normal again. But players with their contract expiring on June 30, we are in discussions to make an agreement with the club to continue until the end of the season. This is my scenario and I will be discussing next week with my club about this. The season starts on June 20 to finish in August. It is a problem in all leagues except Germany. My contract is until June 30 so it will not change a lot. As the season continues, I will probably extend my stay until the last game of the season and then after I am a free agent. The last three seasons here in Sion have personally been very positive. I can be happy with them.<br /><br />Of course, we can always do more. The season is still on with 13 games to play. I want to break my personal goal record this season. It is like a new season but one to finish too. It is exciting and important to stay fit and healthy. I am confident I can break this record. I think I am at my best age of football so I am ready for the next challenge in my career. In football a month ago, everyone was saying they don’t know, they don’t know but now it is a bit better. I think in two or three weeks that the situation can be much better and clearer. I just need to stay positive; my agent is doing all the work so I am staying fit and get back to form with Sion. I like to experience the best football in the best leagues. Where will that be? I don’t know yet. It is a tricky question because for me the best league in the world is <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> but I like Italy and Spain. I have played in England, Italy and Greece so maybe to experience Spain would be something to love. But it has to be the right project and then we go from there.<br /><br />We, as athletes, are role models in these moments. I didn’t see my parents in Zurich for a long time and I stayed living alone. I only left the house to run and go to the supermarket for my elderly neighbour and me. She has been giving me flowers from her garden in return. It was strange, tough but at the same time, you can learn more about yourself. I think we can see from the numbers that we took it seriously. I am not a virologist or a doctor, so I respect something I don’t understand</p>
