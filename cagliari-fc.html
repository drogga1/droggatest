  <p><b>[<a href="inter-milan.html">Intermilan</a> have announced the signing of <a href="nicolo-barella.html">Nicolo Barella</a> from Cagliari on an initial one-year loan]</b> In the life of every boy, sooner or later the time comes to leave home to continue on his own journey. It is with a touch of emotion that the club sees Nicolo leaving today. Born in Cagliari, a supporter of his city team, he grew up carrying more and more responsibility on his shoulders: with Sardinian pride he developed the temper of the leader, without trembling in front of the most difficult challenges and even wearing the captain’s armband. This Rossoblu home will always be yours too. Goodbye, Nicolo</p>

But firmly rejects the outrageous charge and silly stereotypes addressed to Cagliari supporters and the Sardinian people, which are absolutely unacceptable<br /><br /><b>[The club expressed its intent to]</b> to identify, isolate and ban those ignorant individuals whose shameful actions and behaviours are completely against those values that Cagliari strongly promotes in all their initiatives<br /><br /><b>[The one thing that Cagliari did get right on Monday was claim that everyone has a responsibility to partake in the fight against racism]</b> We believe our commitment needs a real support by the rest of the football stakeholders starting from all the true supporters, to all the stewards in the stands, from police and security agents, passing to media and as well through Lega <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> and <a href="figc.html">FIGC</a>.</p>
