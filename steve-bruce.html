He’s big, strong and athletic, and of course he’s got age on his side too which is vitally important. He’s learned the history and wanted it (the number nine shirt), and that’s always a big shirt to fill. But in his eyes, it was ‘bring it on - it’s what I’m here for’. He’s risen to that challenge, and I’m sure he will be a big, big favourite of the supporters.

  <p><b>[Harry Kane’s double took him past 200 club career goals as <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> earned a hard-fought 3-1 win at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> to keep their Europa League qualifying hopes alive]</b> I was delighted with the way we played, but unfortunately, we’re struggling defensively with the players we’ve got missing. I don’t want to make that an excuse but frustrated because I couldn’t be more delighted with the football we played and the application they showed but unfortunately, we were a bit naive in our defending at times. There’s a difference in the quality at the top end of the pitch but up until then <b>[when Kane scored his opening goal]</b>, we had kept him very quiet</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Bruce says <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> injury situation ‘ridiculous’]</b> We’re without seven, possibly eight. Five of them are centre-backs, which is just ridiculous. It’s a big frustration of ours at the minute. Most people accept you’re going to have one or two or three, but seven or eight is a huge number. But we have to get on with it. We knew there were going to be difficulties ahead, but not to this severity. We’ve had probably too many, so we will look and I will ask the question: ‘Is there anything we can do to improve?’ We’ve had far too many, especially when we’re playing Saturday, Tuesday, Saturday - we can’t seem to cope. Schar’s away to see a specialist - we expect him to have an operation. Florian Lejeune, Isaac Hayden, <a href="sean-longstaff.html">Sean Longstaff</a>, Paul Dummett, Ciaran Clark, <a href="jamaal-lascelles.html">Jamaal Lascelles</a>, <a href="allan-saint-maximin.html">Allan Saint-Maximin</a> are all big doubts.<br /><br /><b>[When asked if he expected any of the eight players to play in either of <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>’s final two matches of the season]</b> I wouldn’t think so<br /><br /><b>[Bruce hoping for Longstaff decision in next week]</b> Of course I would. I put him into the team and gave him his debut. I hope he stays - I’ve made that pretty obvious. The club has made him a great offer. I think I’ve made my stance pretty clear. We’ve done everything as a club to keep him here - it’s up to Matty now to commit himself</p>
