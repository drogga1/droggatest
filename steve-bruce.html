He has just not turned off. The latest excuse was that his gates had stuck but he couldn’t jump over a fence that was four feet six inches high. There has been too much indiscipline at this club for way too long.<br /><br />Not in 20 years of management have I gone down this road of publicly shaming a player but I have to make a stand because I won’t put up with it. Not on my watch. I ask only one thing. When I tell them they are in, everyone else is in. How can I pick him when he doesn’t want to come training? It’s happened more than once. Everyone can have an excuse for one occasion but when it is more than that I will not accept it</p>

  <p><b>[Dominic Solanke playing for England and not Liverpool is ludicrous]</b> We need the larger clubs to have associations with the smaller ones. Feeder clubs? Yes. The general consensus is that the Under-23s isn’t quite working. If you play when you are 18 and you are successful, you need the next step. At the moment, we’ve got the ludicrous situation of Solanke playing for England when he’s hardly had a game with Liverpool. That can’t be right<br /><br />We have young players all over the country doing well - but not playing. Surely any young, talented player would prefer turning out for the likes of Forest Green, Bury, Oldham Athletic - you’re better playing there for three months and learning your trade than in the Under-23s. I think something like a draft system could work. Loans definitely benefit parent clubs</p>

I have enjoyed working with Jack, and Jack is the obvious one that clubs <b>[are going to target]</b> because he had a wonderful six months. He reminded everybody as a 22-year-old what a very good player he is. On another day at Wembley he could have scored one of the great Wembley goals. He is a special talent, a real special talent, and yes, you don’t want to lose him but the inevitable thing is we have to. We have to - to keep the club up and running and keep it in line with Financial Fair Play.<br /><br />Inevitably that is going to be player sales. There are going to be people that I do not want to sell - and the obvious one is Jack - but people will know that we have got financial problems and they’ll sit and wait, and wait, till deadline day possibly.

  <p><b>[Tottenham are nowhere near Aston Villa’s valuation of star midfielder Jack Grealish]</b> There’s been discussions, I don’t think we’ve had a formal bid. There’ve been discussions and that’s been going on practically all summer. The one thing the owners have made pretty clear is that no one is for sale. We don’t want to lose our best players. They’re aware, though, that every player has got his price. The good thing the owners have been able to do is not let anybody go on the cheap. If anybody wants to come and buy our players, they’re going to have to find a premium and make sure the owners are comfortable with it. That’s their prerogative, that’s what they’ve wanted, that’s what they’ve put in place so that’s what they’ve said, nobody is for sale. Now, we all know what football is but at the moment Spurs haven’t got anywhere near what the owners even want to consider. There’s not a discussion to be had at the moment because they’ve got nowhere near the figure that they demand.<br /><br />The thought of Mendes running the club is upsetting. It’s nonsense and I shouldn’t have to waste my time talking about it. The story has come out because we’ve taken a player from a certain agent. I’ve been in it for 20 years and I’ve dealt with a lot of agents. If Jorge Mendes can bring me a player like he has just done I’ve been delighted. If he brings me the quality of player that Wolves have signed last year then I’d also be delighted. But I’m dealing with about 12 agents now and I’ll continue to deal with them. If any agent has the right player, then we’ll deal with it</p>

  <p><b>[Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce wants star midfielder Jack Grealish to focus on getting the club back into the Premier League]</b> I can understand the disappointment from Jack, in some ways, but he has been terrific and respectable towards the club. Let’s be fair, Spurs are a huge club in England and in Europe but he has taken the decision from the owner and hopefully we can move forward. He <b>[Grealish]</b> will hopefully take us to where we want to get to and fulfil his ambitions with ourselves. I think what is vitally important to everybody is that the owner has put out a statement of intent. There was no figure for Jack and he made that pretty clear that whatever Spurs offered, he was not going to listen to it. Not everybody believed it but they can start believing now. He didn’t want to lose his star player. He wants to try and build the team around Jack and we have to respect that.</p>

We keep hearing that footballers don’t want to play, Jack’s knocking on my office at ten past nine demanding that he plays. Typical Jack. All the stories you hear about him, one thing I can tell you is that he wants to play<br /><br />Obviously, it’s difficult at the moment because we haven’t got a CEO to do those discussions. But the owner - and I think we’ve learned from the owner very quickly what he says goes - he said by the end of the month we hope we can get an agreement with Jack and keep him here</p>

We certainly weren’t able to compete with the offer he had in Russia, either.<br /><br /><b>[Bruce did attempt to cover his lack of defensive options by moving for Aberdeen’s Scott McKenna]</b> Well, it’s not entirely true <b>[that we left it late]</b>. I spoke to Derek McInnes ten days before <b>[the window closed]</b>. But the stance was that he wasn’t for sale. It was like us with <b>[Jack]</b> Grealish - he wasn’t for sale in this window. We didn’t like to hear that, but a bit like what we did with Jack, they did with Scott McKenna<br /><br />I’ve got three right-backs, Alan Hutton who played the vast majority of the season at left-back, James Bree who can play anywhere, Axel Tuanzebe and Mile Jedinak. In an ideal world, I would have loved to bring one in. We’ve got three months until the window opens again. I think we’ve got enough, we’ll be fine. We’ve lost our goalkeeper, Sam Johnstone, and centre-half, John Terry, which, of course, are going to be difficult to replace. But we’ve still got the lads from last year. I think we’ll be okay</p>

He’s big, strong and athletic, and of course he’s got age on his side too which is vitally important. He’s learned the history and wanted it (the number nine shirt), and that’s always a big shirt to fill. But in his eyes, it was ‘bring it on - it’s what I’m here for’. He’s risen to that challenge, and I’m sure he will be a big, big favourite of the supporters. He’s got an incredible work-rate about him, he’s got a really good humility about him, and all the attributes a top striker needs</p>

That is the big whole thing for me, my staff, my medical staff - to keep him right, because if he is right he’ll be a handful for anybody. He does have a presence and it lifts people. He has a physicality and presence about him and, of course, he is a very good player when he is right. So he gives everyone a lift when he’s in and around the training ground and I’m delighted. He’s waited a very long time for his start but this was the place for him and it turned out okay<br /><br />Dwight Gayle has been out on the grass for the best part of a month. You can see him knocking on the door. He is not far short either. He is in my plans but the team is doing OK even though the top end is not scoring. I saw what he did last season at West Brom because he was in the Midlands. Right foot, left foot, 24 goals to nearly get them promoted. I don’t want him to go anywhere and it would have to be a ridiculous offer and amount of money. Let’s be fair, everyone’s got their price but I don’t want Dwight to go anywhere, that’s for sure</p>

They are the talking points of us going forward. We’ll have those conversations over the next two, three, four, five weeks. It doesn’t help with takeover talk in the background. That’s why we want that little bit of clarity because we need to keep moving forward</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Bruce says <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> must keep adding big signings to close gap to elite]</b> To mix with the elite is difficult these days, we have to take the club forward. The elite are still a long way off<br /><br />We’ve seen the best of Joelinton over the last few weeks - he’s looked more accomplished in a wide role and given me more food for thought. With <a href="miguel-almiron.html">Almiron</a> and Allan, we have to keep adding that bit of quality. Make no mistake, they are the ones who make the difference<br /><br />They’ve been here three or four years. For me, they epitomise the club. They know the club, what it’s like, they know the demands of what it takes to play here at <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a>. The club needs that nucleus. It’s important that you keep it. How often do you see a club that gets promoted from the Championship and, all of a sudden, the team that’s got you there is dismantled very, very quickly? All of a sudden you can get yourself in a mess. I think it’s important with the core players here that we tap into that core. Certainly the team who got the club into <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a> three years ago is still here, still playing and still rightly being rewarded with new contracts.</p>

I think if someone had said we’d taken 43 points with five games to play, I think we’d all be delighted with that<br /><br />We always want to win. What we’re trying to do and achieve is to keep the ball better but keep playing forward if we can. Once we did that, I thought we looked more of a threat and certainly when you see our goals, we played forward and ran forward and that’s the big improvement, I believe and why we’ve been so successful over the last few weeks. I’ve said it before, it’s a great club and it’s a unique club and at the minute, we’re having a decent time so let’s enjoy it while it lasts</p>

In the lower leagues, that would probably keep them all going for a season. I remember having a conversation with the chairman of Gillingham about how hard it is now with no income, no revenue from the stadium and no supporters.

Can we find a couple of million quid and put it to the football clubs who badly need it? Because if we are not careful, we are not going to have a structure like we had. It’s on the verge of, probably, collapse from what I am hearing from different managers and different chairman. It’s been very difficult, especially for those lower league ones.<br /><br /><b>[Asked if it was imperative to keep every league club going]</b> Absolutely. Unfortunately in the last few years, we’ve seen clubs collapse and they’ve been going for a hundred years, some of these clubs. People in the lower divisions work tirelessly to keep their club going, the players, the staff, the chairman in these places. What happens to them if we don’t do something about this?</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Bruce: <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> need clarity over takeover proposal]</b> We all need clarity on that. I do, the club does, everybody does. We need a decision on that of course and then we can all take stock of that. If that happens then we’ll all see what the change is, if it doesn’t, then we have just got to try and prepare as best as we possibly can and get ready for next season. It’s quite simple.<br /><br /><b>[Bruce believes every club will be affected by the uncertainties over coronavirus and that his side should not find themselves at a disadvantage]</b> It’s going to be like that for most clubs - we’ve all been put on hold if you like after what’s happened. We’re now getting to grasp the situation and what it is, we still don’t know if fans are going to get back for the start of next season. I think everybody will be cutting their cloth, we are not alone in it. However, we’ve got a big, important summer. We want to move on.

That’s why I’ve played Fab in there. He’s played in that position for his country who are eighth in the world. This debate that I’m not putting Matty in the team simply because of his contract, it’s not true. We’d all like Matty to stay and get things resolved, but the ball is in his court. But I’m certainly not picking a team with that in mind. I picked a team at <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> I thought could win the game.
