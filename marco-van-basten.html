  <p><b>[Marco van Basten on Thierry Henry]</b> <a href="thierry-henry.html">Thierry Henry</a> is now a top player himself, he is a very good player with special qualities; he scores a lot, he has unique acceleration and with his qualities he can be decisive in matches</p>

  <p><b>[FIFA’s outgoing technical chief Marco Van Basten said England]</b> They took initiative, playing out from the back.<br /><br /><b>[World Cup champions France, on the other hand]</b> France did not rely on ball possession, but rather focused on getting into the opposition’s half as fast as they could. And they had the players to do just that</p>

  <p><b>[KNVB’s statement about Van Basten apologises for Nazi slur on live television]</b> These initiatives also strengthen us in the discussions we have with politicians and our social partners. Because only together can we tackle this social problem properly. Racism is disgusting and does not belong in football. Racism must go out of the world</p>

  <p><b>[Netherlands legend Marco van Basten has weighed in on the <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> vs <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> debate]</b> <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Cristiano</a> is a great player, but those who say he is better than <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> know nothing about football, or they are saying it in bad faith. <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> is one of a kind. Impossible to imitate and impossible to repeat. A player like him comes along every 50 or 100 years. As a kid, he fell into the football genius pot<br /><br /><b>[Van Basten’s time at the top was cut short by injuries]</b> I basically stopped playing at 28. I had already won three Ballons d’Or. Just look at <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>, both over 30, where they are now</p>

  <p><b>[Why the old-school <a href="mls.html">MLS</a> shootout remains beloved 20 years later]</b> This is spectacular for the viewers and interesting for the player. With this idea, <b>[the player]</b> has more possibilities: he can dribble, shoot, wait, and the goalkeeper responds - this is more like a typical playing situation</p>
