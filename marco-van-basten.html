  <p><b>[One of the most interesting suggestions Marco van Basten mentioned is getting rid of the offside rule]</b> I am very curious as to how football would work without offside. I fear many people will be against it. I would be in favour of it, because football is increasingly resembling handball: Nine players plus goalkeeper make the penalty area dense, which is like a wall. It is very difficult to get through. All teams rely on the same effective tactics: forming a stable defense.<br /><br />Without offside, the strikers could be behind the defenders, which would be much more difficult. If they move far back in front of their goal, the attacker will have more opportunities for distance shots. This would make the game more attractive, the attackers would have better chances, more goals would be scored. That’s what the fans want to see. In field hockey, the offside has been abolished, and there are no problems. The teams would also adapt in football.<br /><br /><b>[An interesting idea put forward is that of replacing extra time and penalties with a kind of take-on challenge]</b> This is spectacular for the viewers and interesting for the player. With this idea, he has more possibilities: he can dribble, shoot, wait, and the goalkeeper responds - this is more like a typical playing situation<br /><br /><b>[Instead of giving a player a booking for a foul, he will be made to sit on the sidelines for a period of time]</b> That frightens players. It is more difficult with 10 against 11, let alone with eight or nine<br /><br /><b>[FIFA wants to find a way to stop teams from time wasting or slowing down games in order to protect a lead]</b> The spectators want to see action, goals and two teams fighting. The longer a substitution, the execution of a free kick or the treatment of an injured player, the more play time is lost. We must be careful about this … when a team scores just before the end of the game, they do everything they can to make time, for example through substitutions<br /><br /><b>[Van Basten likes the idea of giving players a maximum number of fouls they are allowed to make in a game. If they break that, they have to leave the field]</b> I’ve had the idea that a defender, like in basketball, can only make five fouls and then he has to leave the field</p>

  <p><b>[On Neymar]</b> It’s nice if you have humour and he makes people laugh, as we have seen by all those things on social media! But for me, what I have seen from him is not a good attitude. As a player, you have to try to do your best and if you act too much it will not help you. He should understand his situation, personally</p>

Impossible to imitate and impossible to repeat. A player like him comes along every 50 or 100 years. As a kid, he fell into the football genius pot<br /><br /><b>[Van Basten’s time at the top was cut short by injuries]</b> I basically stopped playing at 28. I had already won three Ballons d’Or.
