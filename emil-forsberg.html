  <p><b>[RB Leipzig star Emil Forsberg has admitted that he is not in a hurry to depart the Bundesliga side]</b> When I was young, the Premier League was everything. I grew up with the Premier League. But it’s not like I dream of it every day. I do my thing. I love football. I’ve been playing here in Leipzig for four years. I’m not worried about the Premier League, La Liga or anything else. I like it in the present.<br /><br />I’ve got my full focus on the final games of the season and just want to achieve something great with Leipzig. I’ve got a contract here and I feel fine. We don’t need to talk about anything else. That’s the way it works with the coach<br /><br />I’ve become a better player. I’ve not made as many assists or goals, but I’ve got better. It’s been a funny season. I’ve played only 12 or 13 Bundesliga games from the start. We’ve had a lot of games, so it’s been hard to get into a rhythm when you have European football and then the league</p>

  <p><b>[Emil Forsberg has offered hope to the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Roma]</b> I’m ready for the next big step. That’s going to be very interesting. I am in dialogue with RB and always had a good relationship with the club. I have the dream of playing for the strongest clubs in the world.<br /><br />I have a lot of pressure on me, but I like it. I want it to be that way. When I’m not playing well, it’s not good. So I have to be good. I’m trying my best</p>

  <p><b>[Emil Forsberg says Sweden can throw Germany out of the World Cup by beating Joachim Low’s men in Sochi]</b> The possibilities are there. It’s going to be hard but we have the possibility to throw them out. It was important to get the win against Korea and now we look forward to Germany.<br /><br />We have the quality to beat everybody, we have shown that already. And we take that to every game. To have the power to beat everybody is good and when you do it, you feel even better, so for us it’s a big opportunity</p>

  <p><b>[Timo Werner has been told to trust his gut after Leipzig boss Ralf Rangnick warned against leaving the German club]</b> Timo is the new face of German football. He’s the future. To keep him at RB would be great for the whole club. I know that he feels very comfortable in Leipzig and with what he has at the club. But I can’t talk him into anything. He has to trust his gut feeling.</p>

  <p><b>[Emil Forsberg said nobody at Leipzig was getting carried away with their impressive start to the season after helding <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> 1-1 on Saturday]</b> We are still developing. But to be the league leaders after four matchdays is very nice. The first half we ran a lot, but had little possession. <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern</a> have played very strong again. In the second half, we were much better and got our game on the pitch as well</p>

  <p><b>[Emil Forsberg says <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> aren’t here to buy <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> or <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, we’re here to develop stars]</b> Everyone’s going to have an opinion on every little thing. All we can do is go on our path and, if people want to try and stand in our way, we’re going to try and beat them - on the pitch, not off the pitch. We didn’t come up being all cocky, saying: ‘We’re going to be the best team in Germany now, now, now.’ We’ve taken it step by step; we have to stay humble and keep focused. I can feel that it’s going in the right direction now. I think more and more people feel with us, and see we do the right thing here. We’re not here to buy <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. We’re here to buy young players, develop them, play football and have fun. I think people can recognise themselves in that<br /><br />I think <a href="julian-nagelsmann.html">Julian Nagelsmann</a> made me better and made the team better: the right coach for the right club at the right time. We have a few more combinations now, a few more solutions. <b>[<a href="julian-nagelsmann.html">Nagelsmann</a>]</b> has a thought about everything. There’s always a thought around it, and then you just have to do it. You’ll get a kind of lightbulb in your head like: ‘Ah, OK, so if I do that, that and that, this will open up and I can play that pass or that pass.’ It’s fun, even at this age, that you can learn something new<br /><br /><b>[Leipzig are also looking to go far in the Champions League this term]</b> No, no, no! Not if you look at the team <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have: fantastic players, a fantastic coach and a fantastic stadium. We have a chance, of course, but we will have to be at 100% and to get every decision right</p>
