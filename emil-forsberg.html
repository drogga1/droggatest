  <p><b>[Emil Forsberg said nobody at Leipzig was getting carried away with their impressive start to the season after helding <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> 1-1 on Saturday]</b> We are still developing. But to be the league leaders after four matchdays is very nice. The first half we ran a lot, but had little possession. Bayern have played very strong again. In the second half, we were much better and got our game on the pitch as well</p>

  <p><b>[Emil Forsberg says <a href="rb-leipzig.html">RB Leipzig</a> aren’t here to buy <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> or <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, we’re here to develop stars]</b> Everyone’s going to have an opinion on every little thing. All we can do is go on our path and, if people want to try and stand in our way, we’re going to try and beat them – on the pitch, not off the pitch. We didn’t come up being all cocky, saying: ‘We’re going to be the best team in Germany now, now, now.’ We’ve taken it step by step; we have to stay humble and keep focused. I can feel that it’s going in the right direction now. I think more and more people feel with us, and see we do the right thing here. We’re not here to buy <a href="neymar.html">Neymar</a>, <a href="kylian-mbappe.html">Mbappe</a> and <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a>. We’re here to buy young players, develop them, play football and have fun. I think people can recognise themselves in that<br /><br />I think <a href="julian-nagelsmann.html">Julian Nagelsmann</a> made me better and made the team better: the right coach for the right club at the right time. We have a few more combinations now, a few more solutions. <b>[Nagelsmann]</b> has a thought about everything. There’s always a thought around it, and then you just have to do it. You’ll get a kind of lightbulb in your head like: ‘Ah, OK, so if I do that, that and that, this will open up and I can play that pass or that pass.’ It’s fun, even at this age, that you can learn something new<br /><br /><b>[Leipzig are also looking to go far in the Champions League this term]</b> No, no, no! Not if you look at the team <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> have: fantastic players, a fantastic coach and a fantastic stadium. We have a chance, of course, but we will have to be at 100% and to get every decision right</p>
