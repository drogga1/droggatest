<blockquote>
  <p>Much of the sentiment boosting <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a>’s chances for being able to pull a stunning upset over <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Floyd Mayweather</a> Jr. is rooted in the fact that <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> ended former UFC champion <a href="jose-aldo.html">Jose Aldo</a>’s 10-year unbeaten run with a knockout in 13 seconds. Aldo not only isn’t buying the theory, he thinks it’s conceivable that <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> will pocket the riches he’s fought and talked his way into and leave combat sports for good.<br /><br />Aldo made his comments fittingly at a boxing event Saturday night. The Brazilian watched near the corner as his middleweight countryman Esquiva Falcao posted an undercard victory at Microsoft Theater on the card headlined by super-featherweight champion Vasyl Lomachenko<br /><br /><a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a> sought on a four-stop international press tour to mentally infiltrate <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Mayweather</a>, 40, who has returned from a two-year retirement for the bout that could potentially become the richest event in combat sports history<br /><br />After losing the featherweight belt to Max Holloway in June, Aldo has some work to do to re-position for a rematch with <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>. Aldo doesn’t think it will ever happen because he said he suspects <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>, 29, will leave fighting after taking home an expected purse that will exceed $100 million from the <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Mayweather</a> bout<br /><br />UFC President <a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a> has said he expects <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> to defend his lightweight belt in the UFC by the end of the year if he emerges healthy from the <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Mayweather</a> bout. <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>, said White, has also said he’ll venture to Russia to fight unbeaten lightweight contender <a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>. White has attended some of <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>’s recent sparring sessions in Las Vegas, with the fighter scheduled to provide an update on his preparation at a Friday afternoon media day</p>
