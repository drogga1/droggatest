  <p><b>[Sessegnon himself bemoaned his side’s lack of efficiency in front of goal after <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> fall to Bayern Munich]</b> If you don’t take your chances against the big teams you get punished. We knew it would be tough coming here, disappointed we didn’t get the win today. We were chasing the ball but I think we got into good positions in the transitions. I felt good. Physically towards the end I felt tired but physically I felt good and to get the goal was good as well. That’s what I want to do. I came to the club injured, it was difficult at the start but now I just want to get more minutes now</p>

  <p><b>[Sessegnon became <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>’s youngest scorer in the Champions League when he netted in the 20th minute of the game]</b> I felt good. I was a bit tired at the end but to get the goal on my first start is a special moment. Definitely this can help kick-start my <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> career. I was injured when I got here and it was difficult at the start. I am back in the team now and just want to get more minutes under my belt</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Sessegnon has drawn comparisons to <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> superstar <a href="gareth-bale.html">Gareth Bale</a>, with the 19-year-old admitting that he wants to become even more like the former <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a> winger]</b> I think <b>[they are]</b> definitely a confident boost. <b>[Bale]</b> was one of the players that I looked up to when I was younger, especially when he was at Southampton bombing up on the wing. He has attributes that I want to add to my game. In terms of attacking intent, the mentality to get in behind on the left flank and dribble with the ball, I’m trying to add a little bit of that into my game. If I could ever become as great as he has become it would be a massive achievement. I’m so far off at the moment. I set my standards very high, so I’ve got a lot of improvement to do, I’m still learning the game<br /><br />I think at this moment in time I don’t have a preferred position, I see myself long term at full-back. When I watch myself in clips, the way I play, my body shape, I feel like I am more suited to an attacking left-back role. But I always have it in my mind to be strong defensively as well. It’s just getting the balance between attacking and defending</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Sessegnon says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> looking to win the title at Tottenham]</b> As a young player, it’s a manager that you want to work with because they know so much about the game and to help you improve you as a player, so it’s a no brainer. The gaffer wants to push on next year, I can’t see why we won’t be pushing for the top two or three. We’ve got a very strong squad, if we can keep everyone like the key players, it’s a strong squad. If we can add some bits to it we can go all the way and I know the gaffer is looking to win the title</p>
