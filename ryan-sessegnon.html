  <p><b>[Who is Ryan Sessegnon?]</b> There’s a lot of cages and five-a-side places in London. You see young people showing off their talents. First touch is important. That’s where you learn it, on the street.<br /><br />I think for any young player playing outside the Premier League, the dream is to be in the Premier League. I’m no different to any other player, I just want to play at the highest possible level<br /><br /><b>[On following in Bale’s footsteps]</b> People compare me to him and it’s great to be compared to someone like him. I’m happy to be myself and keep pushing forward</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Sessegnon has his sights set on playing in the Premier League with Fulham]</b> I would love it to be with Fulham in the Premier League. I have been at the club since the age of eight. It has been a dream of mine to play in the Premier League with Fulham. We are so very close I just want to get it over the line now.<br /><br /><b>[On winning the main EFL award]</b> It’s a great achievement of mine. It’s a credit to the team and the way we have been playing this season. The gaffer has put a lot of confidence in me, as someone so young, he can only improve me as a player</p>

  <p><b>[Fulham star Ryan Sessegnon was named the Championship Player of the Year at the EFL Awards]</b> is crazy to be on a shortlist with those type of players, but I’m just happy to be in and around those types of players. I just need to keep improving<br /><br />It’s a great personal achievement of mine but it’s all credit to the team for the way they have played this season. I think it is just having good people around you, never getting too carried away and always having your feet on the ground. I always want to improve and I am never satisfied with my performance. There’s always something that I <b>[can]</b> do better when I play and I never think I have had a great game. I just want to improve. I think day by day, training session by training session and match by match I am improving and that’s all because of <b>[Fulham manager]</b> Slavisa <b>[Jokanovic]</b> really so credit to him and to the club<br /><br />Coming through the youth ranks and playing for the first team has been a great honour for me. Stepping out on Craven Cottage as a local boy is extra special for the fans and young players at Fulham, I like to show that there is a pathway at Fulham to get into the first team. It would mean everything <b>[to be promoted with Fulham]</b> - it is the team that has made me a professional, and it’s the team that has given me a chance. I think the other day was a big blow for us but we need to be ready to again and hopefully we can get into the top two<br /><br />It is just about focusing on Fulham. Nothing too much with England. We have one job and that’s to try and get promoted</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Sessegnon is fully focused on playing for Fulham]</b> You always see little bits and bobs when teams are linked with you, but I was always staying focused on playing for Fulham. That’s my main focus - just getting my head down and playing for Fulham.<br /><br />Of course as a young player, when you get linked to these clubs playing Champions League football, it’s always flattering<br /><br /><b>[Regarding talks of a new contract at Craven Cottage]</b> I’m not aware of anything right now. I’m just playing and seeing how it goes</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Sessegnon has made Premier League history by becoming the first player born in the 21st century to score a goal in EPL]</b> It’s been a bit harder than I thought it would be actually in some parts in terms of the quality of opposition and the players. There are world-class players week in, week out but it’s a new challenge that I’m learning all the time. I’ve got in the gym a few times this season to get bigger and stronger to face better and bigger players.</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Sessegnon has aired his desire to follow in the footsteps of Borussia Dortmund starlet Jadon Sancho]</b> I think 18 is a good age to make your debut. That’s my target. Especially seeing players from my age group making their debuts, like Jadon Sancho, Mason Mount and James Maddison. They are players I’ve played with for England, so I look at that and I just want to be part of it<br /><br />Going up a level has proved to be harder than I thought it would. It’s been very challenging, but at the same time, that challenge has been good for me. Of course I wanted to do a bit better by this stage, in terms of performances. I don’t think I’ve been near my best in certain games. I look at all the mistakes I’ve made before I watch my good stuff. If I have misplaced a pass, I want to know why I’ve done that or whether I could have looked at a different pass. For me, I just look at it that I’m young and I can only improve. It’s still early in the season and it was never going to be the same as the Championship. I’m not trying to put too much pressure on myself. I’m just trying to work hard and be the best that I can</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Sessegnon is generating talk of interest from Tottenham and Juventus]</b> So I’m still a Fulham player and in terms of that, that’s all I can say at the moment.<br /><br />When he <b>[Parker]</b> was a player he was such an intelligent player. And he’s just brought his knowledge of his playing time into management really. Everyone just wants to play for him. Everyone respects him highly at the club and when you respect someone so highly it’s easy to get everyone motivated for games. I think he’s the right man to bring this club back to the Premier League</p>

We knew it would be tough coming here, disappointed we didn’t get the win today. We were chasing the ball but I think we got into good positions in the transitions. I felt good. Physically towards the end I felt tired but physically I felt good and to get the goal was good as well. That’s what I want to do. I came to the club injured, it was difficult at the start but now I just want to get more minutes now</p>

He has attributes that I want to add to my game. In terms of attacking intent, the mentality to get in behind on the left flank and dribble with the ball, I’m trying to add a little bit of that into my game. If I could ever become as great as he has become it would be a massive achievement. I’m so far off at the moment. I set my standards very high, so I’ve got a lot of improvement to do, I’m still learning the game<br /><br />I think at this moment in time I don’t have a preferred position, I see myself long term at full-back. When I watch myself in clips, the way I play, my body shape, I feel like I am more suited to an attacking left-back role. But I always have it in my mind to be strong defensively as well. It’s just getting the balance between attacking and defending</p>

  <p><b>[Ryan Sessegnon says <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> looking to win the title at <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>]</b> As a young player, it’s a manager that you want to work with because they know so much about the game and to help you improve you as a player, so it’s a no brainer. The gaffer wants to push on next year, I can’t see why we won’t be pushing for the top two or three. We’ve got a very strong squad, if we can keep everyone like the key players, it’s a strong squad. If we can add some bits to it we can go all the way and I know the gaffer is looking to win the title</p>
