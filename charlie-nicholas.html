  <p><b>[Arsenal have been urged to bring the tremendously sad story of Mesut Ozil to an end]</b> It’s a tremendously sad story because he’s a seriously talented footballer. But talented footballers, like everything else in the modern game, there is no passenger allowed in a team. He sometimes sacrifices a bit of his game to assist other people and help other people, but it’s not working because some of the players he is working with don’t quite get what he is about. The sad story is that he hasn’t done it. He just simply hasn’t done it on the big nights, on the big occasion. I don’t think it’s all about the wage for Ozil, I think he wants to be loved and treated as if he’s a star. He isn’t a star anymore at Arsenal. It’s time to say farewell.<br /><br /><b>[Ozil is not the only player Nicholas would discard this summer, with the Scot calling on Unai Emery to rip up his defensive options and start again]</b> I wouldn’t keep any of the defenders. Ainsley Maitland-Niles I feel sorry for because he’s not defensive-minded, he is more of a central midfield player and a good athlete. But he’s not getting taught how to defend by these players who are on survival course - Shkodran Mustafi, Laurent Koscielny. Koscielny has been in the deep end now for three years. I know there are injuries in there. <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>, when we were critical of him and it was tough to do, when he started playing Nacho Monreal as a centre-back, we all knew Arsenal were in trouble. I’m sorry for isolating these individuals because they give every ounce that they have but, at the end of the day, they aren’t good enough defensively</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas says Mesut Ozil, Henrikh Mkhitarayan and <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Lucas Torreira</a> should be sold by Arsenal to fund a major overhaul of their defence]</b> We’re being slow again in the market. The manager has identified plenty of options. Defensively is the key area. I just hope we don’t delay these deals. Arsenal need to get into the market. We can’t afford someone like Aaron Wan-Bissaka but we need a whole new defence really. We need three defenders to come in which will cost £60-£70m. Who can they get out of the door? If you can get the right offer for Mesut Ozil you’d sell. Mkhitaryan can go and you want to keep <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> and Alexandre Lacazette. <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Torreira</a> seems to be interested in going back to Italy. If you can get the right money: take it.</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas claims Arsenal need to bring in two new centre-backs immediately]</b> Two centre-backs. Immediately. They need a bit of pace - the guy who had pace was Laurent Koscielny but he kind of lost it about two to three seasons ago after the injuries. After that, I’m happy to add bonuses in midfield and potentially a winger or another striker but for Arsenal, ultimately it has to be two centre-backs. Arsenal under Emery have to be a unit. You have to get the defensive structure right. Nacho Monreal has actually done OK for Arsenal considering what his limitations truly were. He was a left-back, he was never a centre-back but he had to play there and that always told me that the reality was that Arsenal’s big problem has been centre-backs. Hector Bellerin is still a bit away from fitness and we need cover but I’m really disappointed that we haven’t got any youngsters coming through that are really threatening to take over. If we can get a left-back like Kieran Tierney then great but two centre-backs are the absolute key</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas says Kieran Tierney is not better than Virgil van Dijk]</b> I’ve read so many different stories the last few days about how they’ve put a value on him, but the fact is that Kieran Tierney plays in Scotland and that’s where the value of the market is. I mean, they sold Van Dijk for £12m. So is he a better defender than Van Dijk? No. Is £15m reasonable? I would say that Celtic in the current market could probably get £20m. So my pitch would be £20m is a cracking deal for Celtic and it’s also a very good deal for Arsenal. That’s where I see the value.<br /><br />People can look and judge in different positions and requirements, and of course I’ve been probably more vocal than anybody else about the need for a whole new back four for Arsenal, but in value terms I find it difficult to break down. The reason is; he plays in Scotland, he gets 85 per cent possession at his football club in Glasgow Celtic, but when they go to Europe the team gets found wanting a little bit. Kieran Tierney is a fabulous footballer, but he’s got a lot to learn defensively. That’s the issue in value. So I think if Celtic get £20m they’ll take it, and I think Arsenal will be relatively pleased with that.<br /><br /><b>[Nicholas added on the chances of the Gunners getting a deal done]</b> I thought Kieran Tierney would want to stay at Celtic. He’s a die-hard Celtic fan, they’ve got eight in a row wrapped up, they want to go and do nine, and I thought if Kieran really wanted it, if he does nine then he’ll want to do 10 and get in the history books. But the stories I’m hearing here in Glasgow is that he might be keen to move on to the bigger league. That’s really what it’s about, a bigger league. Will it make him a better player? Probably. There is a question mark about his defensive frailties. But then again, he would be an improvement for Arsenal - there’s no doubt in my mind about that.<br /><br />He’s power. He’s got a lot of power. The greatest Celtic full-back I ever came across was Danny McGrain and he’s the closest we’ve ever had to him. Danny could play right-back and left-back, but Kieran is just one-footed, his left foot. He’s got real power, real pace going forward. And of course in Glasgow Rangers, in Scotland, in the SPFL, that’s domination. His final ball could be a bit better, but I think it has improved</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas says <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>’s presence at Arsenal could help the club to attract top transfer targets]</b> Sometimes I like to throw one <b>[an idea]</b> in every now and then, like we all do. It’s not just because I’m trying to be controversial but <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> has been out of a job for a long time. Now, Arsenal tried to keep him as a director of football or on the hierarchy because he can help guide us in case there was trouble that was going to be there for the club. Bayern Munich have had Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Franz Beckenbauer, Man Utd have Alex Ferguson, Liverpool have King Kenny Dalglish.<br /><br />We missed out on that because Arsene said he wanted to take a break. But he’s been out of a job a long time. I would have simply have said: ‘Well, why don’t you go after <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>?’. <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> still knows the game inside out and people will say ‘well, he wanted to leave Arsenal’. Yeah he did at that time as a manager, it was painful because he felt hurt and damaged. But I still think he loves the club. If <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a> sits in a room with these different players that we are trying to attract, if he’s sitting in a room representing Arsenal Football Club, I think we’d get more of a say and more of a feel that they can generally attract these players</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas says Celtic are getting very good value in a mooted £25 million deal with Arsenal for Kieran Tierney]</b> He, would be much better than what Arsenal currently have. My honest opinion is it’s quite a high price. Celtic have got very good value at £25m. I know Celtic fans say he’s worth £40m because of how much Aaron Wan-Bissaka went to Manchester United for. He’s played in the Scottish Premiership, he’s a treble Treble winner and an absolute diehard Celtic fan but the time is right for Kieran to move on. Fans might sit and say, ‘Why does he not stay for nine in a row’. But there’s no guarantee of Celtic winning that. Neither is 10 in a row. OK, you can’t guarantee trophies at Arsenal either but what I can say as an Arsenal fan is they’re signing a very talented left-back who will get better. Arsenal will make him better. And the club had to make a statement of intent defensively because they’ve been lacking in that department</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas says Arsenal are a tremendously exciting prospect for 2019-20]</b> I am extremely happy with Arsenal’s start to the season and the way the market has gone. We have to wait on a couple of players getting fit, but I genuinely do think that Arsenal are going to be a tremendously exciting team going forward this year. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> is up and running, while Alexandre Lacazette and Nicolas Pepe will add to this. I think what Unai Emery has now after a year is very promising. People can debate whether you spend £300m or £1m, whatever it may be, but you can improve the team with coaching and create the right togetherness.<br /><br />He has identified that they are weak at the back, and that is going to take time so he will try to improve that. To counteract that he needs a plan B and that is to score as many goals as they can. He was the PSG manager with some explosive stars. Emery couldn’t control it and neither could the players, and PSG may win titles but they do not threaten anywhere else. Is the project working there? It’s not. He has a project at Arsenal that he trusts and believes he can go somewhere</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas says <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have a soft belly]</b> <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> has come under scrutiny from some supporters and they are starting to ask questions. Why have they paid the money for <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> and are not playing him, despite getting him fit? Why are you not playing <a href="hector-bellerin.html">Hector Bellerin</a> when fit? I do not understand why he gets these players fit and he doesn’t play them. <a href="bernd-leno.html">Bernd Leno</a> makes some mistakes and is young, but he is left completely and utterly isolated by the lack of a defensive partnership. I feel sorry for him.<br /><br /><a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> and <a href="sokratis-papastathopoulos.html">Sokratis Papastathopoulos</a> high five each other when they give corners away. <a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Matteo Guendouzi</a> has good energy and covers the ground well, but he is too young to understand the protective role and needs someone in beside him to pivot him and look after him. These players have a soft belly but they are supposed to provoke and win the little scraps. I would be more interested in <a href="lucas-torreira.html">Lucas Torreira</a> beside <a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Guendouzi</a> or even <a href="ainsley-maitland-niles.html">Ainsley Maitland-Niles</a> could do it with his speed.<br /><br />In attack, <a href="nicolas-pepe.html">Nicolas Pepe</a> needs a shake. He is very talented but he needs to want the ball and get on the ball. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> is scoring goals in an ordinary team and <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a> must start. I like <a href="bukayo-saka.html">Bukayo Saka</a> but you need to feed him in at the right time. <a href="dani-ceballos.html">Dani Ceballos</a> needs to be in behind the front three. If you dominate games which you should do against Palace, the middle two and full-backs will be higher up.<br /><br />Emery wanted to emulate <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>’s style of play, and when those two full-backs are high, you know there is trouble coming. Bellerin and Tierney must play higher when they play and that is when the two holding players come in handy and that is how the balance works</p>

The fact that he didn’t instantly apologise to the fans about his behaviour tells you that he’s probably upset and angry. I would imagine it’s a horrible feeling being in the position he’s in right now, but that anger must be controlled. To be a footballer of any significance, especially at the higher level, if you don’t have a thick skin to take some criticism, then you are not a footballer. You cannot live at the top end because you may get a lot of compliments, but you don’t think the likes of <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> and <a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a> ever get criticised?

Why let him talk to <a href="bayern-munich.html">Bayern Munich</a> and float about on TV when you can have that brain, fabric and understanding at the club right.

I was always teased about the hierarchy not being right, but we have around four guys arguing over transfers. Is <a href="edu.html">Edu</a> the one who says these are the players <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are getting? Is he in strong communication with Emery?<br /><br />What is <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s style? It’s a complete disaster of a style and formation. He (Emery) does not know his best starting line-up or his best formation. This is why he’s under the pressure he is under, but I don’t think he will get sacked. He is asking for time, but will he get the 18 months that takes him to the end of next season? There are plenty of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> fans wanting Emery to go now, but reports suggest the club’s hierarchy are going to stick with the Spaniard for the time being. However, if things don’t turn around quickly, it may go down the line of Emery losing his job. Come January when the transfer window opens, the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> board will say they have no money, but they need money for defenders. It’s either that, or you need to get rid of the dead wood. They got rid of plenty in the summer but in my opinion there’s more to go<br /><br />I am confused with where this is going, and that is created by Emery’s own choices. If he doesn’t sort it out before Christmas, he does come under scrutiny. The top four was there for the taking, but <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> were struggling, <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> are doing better than anticipated, but you want to be in there fighting. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are hopeless yet are still in sixth, but you have to stay at it and give yourself a chance to fight for those places.

The board will not look to ease him out, but a lot of people are wondering why they should wait</p>

The manager shouldn’t take all of the blame, but he should burden most of it.

  <p><b>[Arsenal legend Charlie Nicholas admits it feels like the end of the road for <a href="unai-emery.html">Unai Emery</a> at Emirates Stadium]</b> It definitely feels that way. After 21 years of <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>, it is hard to look at a manager leaving after 18 months and think he has had enough time. But it is not so much the time frame on it, it is the lack of improvement. They did spend a fair amount of money. Probably in the wrong positions in my opinion. <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> has come in and it has taken him ages to get fit, so he will need time to settle. <a href="hector-bellerin.html">Hector Bellerin</a> has been out. The centre-back position has been poor. Then there’s the lack of protectors in midfield. I have sympathy with him. But we all know that this is a results business and that’s down to the manager. If he doesn’t get results, his time will be up and the fans are starting to get angry now. When the anger comes to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, then the thoughts turn to the board. And when the board are shaking a little bit then they have a decision to make. Who will make the decision? It is a committee of four or five people. There are different people involved and it seems even they are confused about it. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have no leaders on the pitch and no leaders upstairs<br /><br /><b>[Nicholas added on the problems which the Gunners have failed to address]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have no excuses right now. This is an average team, but it is a pretty good attacking system within this team. The manager has found it complicated. He doesn’t know his best XI. He doesn’t know what his best defensive set-up is. He doesn’t know who his protectors in midfield should be. Because of this confusion they are all over the place. The price of £8m for <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> wasn’t much and we thought he might have improved it for a relatively small amount, but he hasn’t. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> is now the captain, but the forwards are feeling this lack of belief too - not good signs for the manager. I actually think they kept him in position during the international break because they expected to beat Southampton, before having Eintracht Frankfurt at home on Thursday and then going to <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> away next weekend. That game has now become a must-win scenario</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas claims Celtic striker <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Odsonne Edouard</a>’s situation is comparable to that of <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> star Moussa Dembele]</b> <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> is a very good technical player. There’s been comparisons with Dembele, who has now been linked with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for £40m-50m, and I look back at the balance of what <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> has compared to Dembele. Dembele is a more aggressive character and is better in the air, whereas <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> is a more laid-back individual. He’s good with both feet and he’s 6ft 1in so aerially he could be a threat. But he doesn’t really play that way. He will score a few headers because his physicality is good, but he’s more about link-up play, getting the ball into his feet, turning defenders. He will run in behind on the shoulder of defenders. Of course he could make it in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but he would need to be playing in a team structure that has a lot of the ball. At Celtic, they have it 75-80 per cent of the time. That’s why he’s become such a marketed product. He’s had his best goalscoring season and he’s scored quite a few in Europe so you are not just judging him on his tally in Scottish football. In the last six months, we have seen that defenders have tried to get physical by kicking him, we have seen him start to react in a good way. Before, he might go missing for 20 or 25 minutes, but now when that happens, he gets agitated and tries even harder. As a result, he’s become Celtic’s key player and best by a distance. He will leave Celtic. Some people are suggesting he’ll stay on next season as Celtic go in search of 10 titles in a row. People up north get so bogged down by it, but <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> is now reaching a side of his career at 22 where, like Dembele, he will be looking at who are interested in signing him.<br /><br /><b>[Nicholas believes <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> would be a good fit for Arsenal]</b> <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> could certainly play at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because the way they play, his style would be more than suitable for it. The problem is getting the judgement right over whether he’s ready right now, playing every week for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> compared to who is there already. I’m a big fan of <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a>, and <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> has got quite a bit of <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a> in style within his game. This will come down to what <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> wants. If he wants to leave, then he will leave. Celtic will take the cash rather than have a player who is not committed to the cause because historically that’s what they have done - with Dembele, Van Dijk and <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Tierney</a>. He has to go to a side that plays him. He can play with a partner and he can play on his own, but he must play in a team that’s going to give him a lot of service. If he plays in a side that sometimes gets 40 per cent of possession, he will find it really tough to adapt.

You have a problem identifying the players, then we started paying 30-40 million for <b>[Shkodran]</b> <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Mustafi</a> and defenders who, no disrespect to them, have not cut it. They have been buying wrong and the players then realise that they are not a threat to win <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, they are out of the Champions League, so the hierarchy have got it all wrong. They get there, they love the club, but then they realise they aren’t going to win any trophies - what’s the point, I want to move on to win trophies. If <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> does go, he’ll want to go to a club that wants to win trophies. It’s the same as what <b>[Robin]</b> <a href="robin-van-persie.html">van Persie</a> did, it’s what they do. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> haven’t got an identity problem, they have got a decision-making policy problem and it has to be sorted at the top end</p>

  <p><b>[Gunners legend Charlie Nicholas backed his old club to make a move for the Frenchman last month]</b> <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Odsonne Edouard</a> could certainly play at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because the way they play, his style would be more than suitable for it</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas says Any goalkeeper in the world would struggle when working behind <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s back four]</b> I thought <a href="emiliano-martinez.html">Emiliano Martinez</a> did well when he came on <b>[against Brighton]</b>, but tell me any goalkeeper who could play behind this back four? They are left so exposed. Martinez slightly got it wrong for the last goal but did not play badly at all. I cannot work out where a result is coming from for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> at the minute. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> looked more lively, and I do like <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a> but he was out of sorts. He has to earn the right to play and he is not doing enough. <a href="nicolas-pepe.html">Nicolas Pepe</a> scored a great goal but is not doing enough either. <a href="eddie-nketiah.html">Eddie Nketiah</a> will probably get a nod again and I do not have a problem with that<br /><br />How do you work it out for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>? The defence is poor - <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> left <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> out, but he does need games to get fit. He needs games to get confidence, but how do you get that in this defence? He has been brought into this. I do not know what his midfield selection is. <a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Matteo Guendouzi</a> is a talent but he needs experience with him, while <a href="dani-ceballos.html">Dani Ceballos</a> is good on the ball but not without it, and we are in an absolute mess at the minute. We do not usually get something at Southampton and the top four is long gone, but I would be grateful for yet another draw, just to get a point on the board</p>
