  <p><b>[Arsene Wenger to build on his early acquisition of Sead Kolasinac]</b> He needs another top midfield player with Santi Cazorla out. Raphael Varane or Virgil van Dijk would be ideal at centre-back and Alexandre Lacazette is the striker I wanted and hopefully the Atletico Madrid transfer ban means we’ve got a chance. We need a solution to Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil now. I think Ozil will stay but Sanchez will probably go and losing 30 goals is really damaging.</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal should have spent £50 million landing Anthony Martial from Manchester United rather than swapping Alexis Sanchez for Henrikh Mkhitaryan]</b> I appreciate he <b>[Mkhitaryan]</b> is efficient and a decent team player. Would I take the deal? Yes, I would. But to be totally honest I’d much rather pay an additional £50m to get Martial. I think if Arsenal would say to Martial: ‘You can be the next Thierry Henry’. Arsenal made £30m on selling Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, £20m on Theo Walcott, so go all-in; forget Malcom or other players who may or may not be good prospects, go all-in and give him what he wants financially. In the summer Arsenal were willing to take Raheem Sterling but Martial is a far better player and could become one of the best in the world. I would hope Arsene Wenger would be talking to his agent, who will already know he is going to struggle for playing time majorly with Sanchez arriving, and saying, ‘Come here where we’ll build the team around him’.<br /><br />If you don’t handle the situation at Manchester United then there’s a question mark over you for me. I just think the club is so enormous that it swallowed him up. He reminds me of Alexander Hleb, or even Andrey Arshavin. They have talent and are superstars in their own country but they can’t really handle the pressure</p>

  <p><b>[Brendan Rodgers will not still be Celtic manager come the end of January]</b> I am not sure Brendan Rodgers will still be Celtic manager come the end of January. It looks as if the relationship between Brendan and Peter Lawwell is broken. Major shareholder Dermot Desmond appears to have had to step in and have some strong words with them both. I disagree with Desmond on a lot of things but at least he has shown leadership qualities in trying to sort out any potential problems.<br /><br />The claims doing the rounds are that Rodgers has been told to get the team back on track while the chief executive has been told to do everything he can to back his manager. But if there has been a serious breakdown in their relationship then you can never get things back to what it was before. Rodgers and Lawwell might pose for the occasional photograph but it is clear that the relationship is no longer working. Brendan seems to have lost some of his drive with everything that has happened since the summer. He probably knows in his head that things are coming to an end. Okay, he may have said he turned down an offer from China, but other more attractive offers will come in. Will he turn them down as easily, especially if he is not getting what he wants at Celtic?</p>

  <p><b>[Arsenal have seen their transfer philosophy branded an absolute joke]</b> I’m happy with anybody now to be honest because this Arsenal transfer philosophy is an absolute joke. It really is a joke and has been ever since David Dein left the building. I’m confused because we all need defenders and they are hard to get. Liverpool spent £60m to £70m getting one of the best you can get, and we can’t seem to identify one. We’re the ninth richest club and we can only get loan deals. I don’t care if the manager likes this player or not, please Arsenal, get some defenders in!.<br /><br /><b>[Cesc]</b> Fabregas was a change from <b>[Patrick]</b> Vieira, we went from being physically competitive to technically competitive. I’m all for that, I’m not a dinosaur to say I don’t want change, but you have got to get the balance right. And Arsenal don’t get the balance right. Now we have got a new bunch of guys on a committee who sit there and pat themselves on the back for bringing us <b>[Pierre-Emerick]</b> Aubameyang. We all knew he was a fabulous footballer, but he’s another attacker. We all know these are good players but have you got the ability to look at <b>[Shkodran]</b> Mustafi, not good enough for the price. We have done it too often. Find quality defenders, bring them in and then the fans will give you the proper judgement</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic loanee Timothy Weah has been compared to former Arsenal and Real Madrid forward Nicolas Anelka]</b> He has looked lively and is quick, especially in that role at PSG. He has enthusiasm and he is trying to make his own reputation in the game, even if he isn’t as good as whichever relative played before him, but everyone will start to question that. I think he is more of an impact player, he wants to be involved in the play and get behind players. When Celtic have it, they sit rather deep, so that’s the type of game that he isn’t familiar with. He has been impressive but more impressive coming off the bench and is able to utilise his pace. Teams are liable to the counter-attack and he got the second goal against St Johnstone as a result. His celebration told me everything, of happiness and joy, which suggests he really wants to be here. He has some good assets there though, especially speed. He is being put in the shop window, but he is getting the experience that PSG are not giving to him. There will be a load of interested clubs that are looking at him. He reminds me of when Nicholas Anelka first came into the Arsenal side - the speed and desire to get in with the markers, he reminds me a bit of that. Anelka was a better player but the confidence he will get from Celtic having so much of the ball as well as the support<br /><br />His price is going up so I don’t think they <b>[Celtic]</b> will buy him. <b>[Odsonne]</b> Edouard’s value went up, it could have been £3m or £4m and we ended up paying £9m. It can advantage but also a disadvantage. I don’t think he can make that jump yet but I think you will find that when you play in front of around 50,000 fans, you have to want to do it and that spurs you on. Let’s see what happens with Edouard and <b>[Leigh]</b> Griffiths too, because if they were available when Weah came in, he may not have been in the squad. I have enjoyed watching the kid</p>

  <p><b>[On Alexis Sanchez]</b> I think that’s fair. It’s the same frustration for Arsenal with Mkhitaryan, who has suffered the exact same thing - just doesn’t know what he is doing even though he is a clever footballer. It pains people to watch <b>[what is happening to]</b> Sanchez. He was a street fighter, a warrior, with talent. He is now staying rigid on the left and he gives the ball away so often it’s frightening, the level he is playing at. He will have an occasional burst of games but never as consistent as what he’s been in the past</p>

  <p><b>[Many of the players acquired by Arsenal are poor]</b> The players that the manager has brought in are average. The goalkeeper <b>[Leno]</b> has got a chance but plays behind a really bad defence. Torreira and Guendouzi, the youngster, have done okay. <a href="stephan-lichtsteiner.html">Lichtsteiner</a>? Not good enough, don’t need him. Sokratis? The same, not been good enough. So far in the transfer window these are the manager’s signings - three have been poor and three have been okay. That’s a reflection of where we are going. He brings in Suarez and doesn’t accommodate a defender. I can’t accept that he’s going down the right direction right now. It’s reality. We are bog standard average<br /><br />They have a manager that I like what he is trying to do and I feel for him. We need to give him at least two seasons to clarify whether he is going to be good enough or not. This controlled leadership, we have an owner in America who is interested but doesn’t want to be hands on. Last season, Arsene Wenger leaving, <b>[Ivan]</b> Gazidis turned around and said it was time for revolution at Arsenal, be prepared for change in everything. He leaves four months later. It’s a mess. There is no leadership, no guidance</p>

  <p><b>[Alexis Sanchez has had a shocker at Manchester United]</b> It’s been a shocker. I watched Manchester United with interest at the weekend <b>[against Southampton]</b>. Marcus Rashford played out wide of the right and when Romelu Lukaku is fit, he looks sharp. It looks like he’s trimmed a few pounds off him so the sharpness has returned so he’s the one that scares me, and Rashford’s pace. I think they’re running down the clock with Sanchez. I think he’ll be gone in the summer - that’s the reality. They’ll look at things and say ‘what have you done? Not very much’, and he gets injured a lot these days. You have to look at what United have got coming through and they’ve just given <b>[Anthony]</b> Martial a new deal so when he’s fit, he’ll be playing. Sanchez had the huff with Arsenal over a contract so what type of mood is he going to be in when he doesn’t get a game? I don’t think you hang about for that and I think Sanchez will be gone in the summer. They can sell him, get some money, get him off the wage bill and they can get somebody else in. It might even be a younger version</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas has slammed his former side Arsenal]</b> I say it all the time. Defensively <b>[they’re a]</b> mess, <b>[there’s no]</b> leadership and no guidance. Even with <b>[Petr]</b> Cech coming back - I can actually see why he’s decided to say ‘I’ve had enough’, because since he’s came to Arsenal it’s been nothing but hard work for him. This was a world-class goalkeeper. He’s came to Arsenal to try and give them a little bit of knowledge and assistance as best as he can, and it’s as if they don’t listen. They play, truly, as individuals.<br /><br /><b>[Arsenal make a quick return to league action when they host Manchester United on Sunday]</b> This is a massive game for Arsenal because if they go and win they actually have a pretty decent run in, because Manchester United have got harder games. Chelsea have got tough games, so there’s a real opportunity for Arsenal and I would imagine Manchester United might be a bit tired, although the motivation will keep them going. Arsenal if they’re not careful, and they were to lose this game, <b>[they might]</b> not even threaten the top four after this, because they can’t get in their stride and Arsenal are playing massive football catch up, not just for the top four, but for reputation</p>

How we can’t find that is beyond me. We got Hector Bellerin from Barcelona and <a href="ainsley-maitland-niles.html">Ainsley Maitland-Niles</a> has come through but he is not a defensive type.

  <p><b>[Arsenal have been urged to snap up Adrien Rabiot when his contract at Paris Saint-Germain comes to a close]</b> They won’t spend £60m-£70m on defensive players so this manager will be identifying the good young players. You don’t need to go to Dortmund’s or Valencia’s to buy from there, but it has to be a step up from what they have right now. It should be an encouraging summer for Arsenal, but finally we have a manager that knows what the priority is and he will be the judge of who they bring in consequently.<br /><br />In midfield we will need to replace Aaron Ramsey. I am hoping that will be Reiss Nelson from Germany. I don’t know what the future holds for Mesut Ozil and who will entice him to move on - if at all - but there is a possibility of that happening. We need to add a striker, as well as a wide man. In defence, if I was to keep anyone, it would be Bellerin, as he would play right back or right wing-back. Rob Holding would hopefully be fit for the start of the season, as well as Sokratis as a squad player so those are the potentials to keep.<br /><br />We need a box-to-box style midfield player and a player that can pick a pass too, so it is a matter of bringing in the right ones. I think you need to know your system, fit them in and see where it takes you. Adrien Rabiot will be a free-agent and been linked with different clubs, but I would take him. He has the quality and is of decent level, which Arsenal need.<br /><br />In attack, I like <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> and Alexandre Lacazette but will they win you the Premier League? I think they could. Between them, bearing in mind they haven’t actually played much together, their goal return has been a very good return. Arsenal have been relying on one striker for too long and now they have two so it does give me hope. I would sell Henrik Mkhitaryan and if I got the right money for Alex Iwobi I would sell him too. Denis Suarez has gone, that was a waste of time</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas says <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> is not better than Virgil <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">van Dijk</a>]</b> I’ve read so many different stories the last few days about how they’ve put a value on him, but the fact is that <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> plays in Scotland and that’s where the value of the market is. I mean, they sold <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> for £12m. So is he a better defender than <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a>? No. Is £15m reasonable? I would say that <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> in the current market could probably get £20m. So my pitch would be £20m is a cracking deal for <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> and it’s also a very good deal for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. That’s where I see the value.<br /><br />People can look and judge in different positions and requirements, and of course I’ve been probably more vocal than anybody else about the need for a whole new back four for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, but in value terms I find it difficult to break down. The reason is; he plays in Scotland, he gets 85 per cent possession at his football club in Glasgow <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>, but when they go to Europe the team gets found wanting a little bit. <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> is a fabulous footballer, but he’s got a lot to learn defensively. That’s the issue in value. So I think if <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> get £20m they’ll take it, and I think <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> will be relatively pleased with that.<br /><br />He’s power. He’s got a lot of power. The greatest <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> full-back I ever came across was Danny McGrain and he’s the closest we’ve ever had to him. Danny could play right-back and left-back, but Kieran is just one-footed, his left foot. He’s got real power, real pace going forward. And of course in Glasgow Rangers, in Scotland, in the SPFL, that’s domination. His final ball could be a bit better, but I think it has improved</p>

After 21 years of <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Arsene Wenger</a>, it is hard to look at a manager leaving after 18 months and think he has had enough time. But it is not so much the time frame on it, it is the lack of improvement. They did spend a fair amount of money. Probably in the wrong positions in my opinion. <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> has come in and it has taken him ages to get fit, so he will need time to settle. <a href="hector-bellerin.html">Hector Bellerin</a> has been out. The centre-back position has been poor. Then there’s the lack of protectors in midfield. I have sympathy with him. But we all know that this is a results business and that’s down to the manager. If he doesn’t get results, his time will be up and the fans are starting to get angry now. When the anger comes to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, then the thoughts turn to the board. And when the board are shaking a little bit then they have a decision to make. Who will make the decision? It is a committee of four or five people. There are different people involved and it seems even they are confused about it. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have no leaders on the pitch and no leaders upstairs<br /><br /><b>[Nicholas added on the problems which <a href="arsenal-fc.html">the Gunners</a> have failed to address]</b> <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have no excuses right now. This is an average team, but it is a pretty good attacking system within this team. The manager has found it complicated. He doesn’t know his best XI. He doesn’t know what his best defensive set-up is. He doesn’t know who his protectors in midfield should be. Because of this confusion they are all over the place. The price of £8m for <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> wasn’t much and we thought he might have improved it for a relatively small amount, but he hasn’t. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> is now the captain, but the forwards are feeling this lack of belief too - not good signs for the manager. I actually think they kept him in position during the international break because they expected to beat <a href="southampton-fc.html">Southampton</a>, before having <a href="frankfurt-fc.html">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> at home on Thursday and then going to <a href="norwich-city-fc.html">Norwich</a> away next weekend. That game has now become a must-win scenario</p>

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas asks Would <a href="mauricio-pochettino.html">Pochettino</a> improve <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>?]</b> Of course. He is a top-quality coach. We did it with <a href="sol-campbell.html">Sol Campbell</a> in the past and we know what mayhem that created. This would be even more. He improved <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> dramatically and got them to the top four and the Champions League final. The question mark beside him is that he didn’t win any prizes. They didn’t always get results against the rest of the top six so that’s a question mark too. Would he improve this <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> side? I am not so sure. I think it needs a rebuild defensively right from the centre backs<br /><br /><a href="matteo-guendouzi.html">Matteo Guendouzi</a>, I like, but he is young and he is naive and he is not getting taught how to play the position properly. They are all individuals and until they get that team spirit and understanding of it, then <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are constantly going to have problems. <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Mesut Ozil</a> is now in the team and has played quite well, but a few weeks ago we were being told he would be sold in January. What is going on at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>? This is why I make the point that while it is the manager’s responsibility and the players are letting him down, the hierarchy has got to make a stand. When <a href="arsene-wenger.html">Wenger</a> was asked to move aside from his position, we were told this was the new modern <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. The young players will probably do well on Thursday, but it is the experienced players who are making <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s life a misery</p>

It’s what he does. People talk about egos, I don’t care. He has earned the right to have a big ego and, for me, to be the next <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> manager before we miss out on him. We might even get to the stage where <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a> goes ‘why would I want to go to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> right now?’ Are Manchester not interested in him? Are other clubs not interested in him? <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> need to get a bit of leadership and togetherness now.

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas says Gunners still ‘a million miles away’ from challenging for major honours]</b> The result against Olympiakos is typical of where <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are. Has <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Mikel Arteta</a> improved them? Of course he has. Has he changed the dynamics? No, he cannot do that. It is impossible. If you think he has, with the likes of <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Granit Xhaka</a> and <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Shkodran Mustafi</a> in the side, while looking at <a href="david-luiz.html">David Luiz</a> as the leader, then you are in denial.<br /><br />I am a fan of <a href="bernd-leno.html">Bernd Leno</a>, but he gets lazy and slack-minded, and the whole of the defence is like that. <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> has worked on the shape and protection with organisation - it is better and it looks better, but the issue is not solved.<br /><br />I watched them win at Olympiakos, this was their best route into the Champions League. However, they are a million miles away from a team that would win the Europa League. This is not the toughest Europa League to win. Some of the teams that have come in from the Champions League are not as great as what they were. <a href="sevilla-fc.html">Sevilla</a> are not as good, <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> are now out too<br /><br /><a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> still have a long way to go to improve. How can people say <a href="shkodran-mustafi.html">Mustafi</a> has improved? Really? Just because he has kept a few clean sheets. <a href="granit-xhaka.html">Xhaka</a> was supposedly unbeaten in a number of games too. That does not make him a great player or part of <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>’s future. Their future will not be at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>. They have been part of a group that have made it sound as though everything is good. It really isn’t.<br /><br />It is ridiculous how they cannot see out a victory at that stage, even with the pace of <a href="gabriel-martinelli.html">Gabriel Martinelli</a> on the counter-attack, or the organisation and shape at the back to defend. A simple cross and finish won the game and that is typical of the scenario and a task that <a href="mikel-arteta.html">Arteta</a> faces. It is an aspect which <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have not been taught and do not understand. He has made them better for a period but in reality it will still be the same</p>

If <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> wants to leave, you ideally want him out of <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. However, he is of a mind and age that I can see the dangers and understand comparisons with Van Persie. However, I think he will be thinking about what happened to <a href="alexis-sanchez.html">Alexis Sanchez</a> rather than Van Persie. Would he want to be a part of a superstar reload at <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>? Is there a great appeal to that? If it was <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> or <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Man City</a> I would get it, but <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are miles away from the top two. I do not see the appeal of moving to Old Trafford<br /><br />Would he win the title with United in the next few years? I don’t think so. He might not even be in the Champions League if he was to join so what is the real appeal? Is it salary? I don’t think he is that type. Van Persie jumped to a massive salary, but <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are not the same calibre as what they were then. Would he be the cutting edge for them? Maybe. But, like <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>, I think they have other issues to address. If <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were to get £100m for him to go there, I would take that. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> were once the challengers to United for the title, but now neither of them are.

The problem, however, is that as much as I would like to get my way, I have a feeling <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> will not keep him. If it means offloading <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> and others to fund his new contract and the rebuilding of the team, I would have no problem with that. But if <a href="mesut-ozil.html">Ozil</a> stays, I feel they will sell him, because they cannot afford another <a href="aaron-ramsey.html">Aaron Ramsey</a> saga</p>

He plays differently, more like <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a>. <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> is about pace and movement. Although he likes to play the No.9 role, he does not play it as what <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> could. Similarly, <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> could not play in the position that <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a> does, out wide on the left. He wants to be the key figurehead of the team as the link man through the middle. For that reason, I do not see <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> targeting him as a replacement for <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>. <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> are in a horrible position when it comes to sorting out <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>’s contract offer. <a href="barcelona-fc.html">Barcelona</a> and <a href="real-madrid.html">Real Madrid</a> have been mentioned and they have the funds to buy him.<br /><br /><a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> is too similar to <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a>, and if he was to move, it paints a different picture. <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> would then fit into the <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> team as the No.9. You would still need to give him time as he’s not been playing every week against <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> quality. His attitude has improved sufficiently enough to tell me he will become a top player but I am not quite convinced teams will yet be looking at him as a £40m player. But the current market, with the coronavirus likely to impact the value of players, this will play a crucial part<br /><br />I just do not think <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> can afford to let <a href="pierre-emerick-aubameyang.html">Aubameyang</a>’s contract run out, so they will have to renew it. Despite that, I do not see the <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> link materialising, but I could certainly see him moving to <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>. He could be more suitable to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> if they build their team in the right way. I have watched them quite a bit this season. <a href="dominic-calvert-lewin.html">Dominic Calvert-Lewin</a> has had a purple patch but <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> is a better technical player.

You put it on for three or four years - if he wants to stay that is.

  <p><b>[Charlie Nicholas claims <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> striker <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Odsonne Edouard</a>’s situation is comparable to that of <a href="lyon-fc.html">Lyon</a> star <a href="moussa-dembele.html">Moussa Dembele</a>]</b> <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> is a very good technical player. There’s been comparisons with Dembele, who has now been linked with <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> for £40m-50m, and I look back at the balance of what <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> has compared to Dembele. Dembele is a more aggressive character and is better in the air, whereas <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> is a more laid-back individual. He’s good with both feet and he’s 6ft 1in so aerially he could be a threat. But he doesn’t really play that way. He will score a few headers because his physicality is good, but he’s more about link-up play, getting the ball into his feet, turning defenders. He will run in behind on the shoulder of defenders. Of course he could make it in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, but he would need to be playing in a team structure that has a lot of the ball. At <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>, they have it 75-80 per cent of the time. That’s why he’s become such a marketed product. He’s had his best goalscoring season and he’s scored quite a few in Europe so you are not just judging him on his tally in Scottish football. In the last six months, we have seen that defenders have tried to get physical by kicking him, we have seen him start to react in a good way. Before, he might go missing for 20 or 25 minutes, but now when that happens, he gets agitated and tries even harder. As a result, he’s become <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>’s key player and best by a distance. He will leave <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a>. Some people are suggesting he’ll stay on next season as <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> go in search of 10 titles in a row. People up north get so bogged down by it, but <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> is now reaching a side of his career at 22 where, like Dembele, he will be looking at who are interested in signing him.<br /><br /><b>[Nicholas believes <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> would be a good fit for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a>]</b> <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> could certainly play at <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> because the way they play, his style would be more than suitable for it. The problem is getting the judgement right over whether he’s ready right now, playing every week for <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> compared to who is there already. I’m a big fan of <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Alexandre Lacazette</a>, and <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> has got quite a bit of <a href="alexandre-lacazette.html">Lacazette</a> in style within his game. This will come down to what <a href="odsonne-edouard.html">Edouard</a> wants. If he wants to leave, then he will leave. <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> will take the cash rather than have a player who is not committed to the cause because historically that’s what they have done - with Dembele, <a href="virgil-van-dijk.html">Van Dijk</a> and <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Tierney</a>. He has to go to a side that plays him. He can play with a partner and he can play on his own, but he must play in a team that’s going to give him a lot of service. If he plays in a side that sometimes gets 40 per cent of possession, he will find it really tough to adapt. His attitude has improved sufficiently enough to tell me he will become a top player but I am not quite convinced teams will yet be looking at him as a £40m player. But the current market, with the coronavirus likely to impact the value of players, this will play a crucial part</p>
