  <p><b>[U.S. national team legend Marcelo Balboa spent a year playing for Leon]</b> He asked me questions about Leon and I told him everything I knew, and a few days later it comes out that the president says its a done deal. It’s a great club, an absolutely fantastic club. The fans are absolutely fantastic people. They accepted me, a guy who played for the United States, and they treated me well. I can see the appeal of why Leon wants him, and all those things<br /><br />It’s not easy playing in Liga MX, he’s definitely got his work cut out for him. But since when have you seen Landon back off a challenge. I think all athletes love a challenge. He’s <b>[soon going to be]</b> 36, it’s going to be a challenge for him to get fit, it’s going to be a challenge for everything, but I think it’s a different chapter in his life and just chatting with him, and knowing how competitive he is, I think he’s ready for it<br /><br />I tried to get into Liga MX a long time before I got an opportunity after the 1994 World Cup. I always thought it was an attractive league. I think it’s a very, very competitive league. It fits the style that I wanted to play and then I played there and it was a perfect fit for me. I think there’s a lot of players out there that would love the opportunity to go to Liga MX. Landon’s just fortunate to be able to find it<br /><br /><b>[Balboa sees Donovan receiving that same sort of support from Leon fans]</b> They’re going to love Landon. The people in Leon are going to love Landon and the the people he plays against are going to hate him. That’s just what it is. When I played for the U.S. and Leon, and I got killed when I went to America or Toros Neza or Veracruz, people hated me because I was the American center back. The good thing is they all thought that I was (Alexi) Lalas so I didn’t care. I think there was a time when (Donovan) was younger, and all the stuff that happened at Azteca, where Mexicans hated him. But they respect him<br /><br /><b>[some view Donovan’s decision to come out of retirement as a bad move]</b> The guy retired at too young of an age to begin with</p>
