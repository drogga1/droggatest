<blockquote>
  <p>[Drogheda United have completed the signing of former Republic of Ireland international Stephen Elliott] Stephen will add to our attacking options and although he has played in the Premier League and has represented his country, he has succeeded my expectations as a player. He still has the hunger to score goals and he was very impressed with what he has seen at the club to date.<br /><br />[On Thomas Byrne] Thomas is a player that has the ability to light up the league next season. I have spoken with the coaching staff at Brighton and they couldn’t speak highly enough about his footballing talents. We both agree that Thomas playing regular senior football with us will be of great benefit to him</p>
