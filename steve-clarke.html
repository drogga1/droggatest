  <p><b>[Steve Clarke believes there were plenty of positives for Scotland to take after Oliver Burke’s late winner against Cyrpus]</b> The way we showed character to bounce back gives us good hope for the future. I’ve only had seven training sessions, so it won’t change overnight. I’ve given the lads a lot of information and I think some of them have taken it on too literally. It was a game we couldn’t afford to lose and we handled that pressure. I thought we did okay. At 1-0, I thought we were comfortable but we switched off from a set play. It would have been easy to feel sorry for ourselves but the players showed great resilience and that’s a good sign. I’m confident we have a group players who will certainly make it a difficult night for Belgium. A lot of things to be pleased about and a lot of things to work on.<br /><br /><b>[Meanwhile winning scorer Burke was delighted to be the one to secure a vital three points for his side]</b> It was made for me to make an impact, coming on. Conceding so late, it drove us on in search of the second goal and I think we deserved it</p>

  <p><b>[Belgium vs Scotland. Scotland boss Steve Clarke admitted that his side would need to put in a stellar showing to cause an upset]</b> We can’t make too many mistakes defensively because we know we’ll be punished. Shape and tactics are important but also the character of the players as well, the personality of the players. We’ve got good players in our squad, players who play at a really good level and they have to relish the challenge that faces us tomorrow. I always say to the players that you have to let the opposition know that you have the capability to hurt them. So it’s important to get the defensive side right, but if you go through the game and try to play 97 minutes with no attacking threat then it’s going to be a really long night, so you have to get the balance right</p>

  <p><b>[Scotland vs Russia. Under Steve Clarke, however, there is renewed optimism, despite the team struggling to overcome Cyprus in June then falling to a 3-0 loss away in Belgium three days layer]</b> It’s been a long time since we turned over one of the big boys. Russia, having been in the last eight of the last World Cup, are one of the bigger teams. We need a big win as a country. It’s about time that we as a nation, rather than being on the receiving end, are dishing out a result that’s deemed an upset. Hopefully Friday night can be the case. Over a number of years, we haven’t reached a major finals. The more often that happens, the less people start to believe in it. So one big result could change the mindset, not just of the squad, but of the whole nation.<br /><br />If you’re optimistic, you think you can win any game. Rather than put the pressure on the one game, over the next three games we have to make sure we get enough points to make sure we’re still in the group</p>

  <p><b>[Scotland manager Steve Clarke indicated at a press conference that he left <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> out of his squad at the request of Arsenal]</b> I was close to selecting Kieran, obviously <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> have indicated to us that they’d prefer us not to select him at this moment in time because he’s only played 70-odd minutes of football and you have to respect the club’s decision on that. I’d like to get Kieran in the squad and have him as part of the group but at this moment in time it’s more important that Kieran gets minutes on the pitch, gets himself back to full speed and when that happens I’m sure he’ll be a valuable member of the squad</p>

  <p><b>[Scotland suffered defeat at home when they met Russia at Hampden Park in September and they will be desperate to avoid a repeat of that fate on Thursday]</b> For a reason I have yet to determine, we stepped off the game and allowed Russia to dominate us and impose their style of play on us. Why we allowed that game to drift away from us, whether it’s a mental thing or a quality thing, we will need to assess</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Clarke was relieved to end a tough week for Scotland on a high by hammering San Marino 6-0 for the Tartan Army’s biggest win in four years]</b> It’s not often a Scotland team score six goals. It’s a nice reward at the end of a difficult week. They’ve got character and resilience. They were on a hiding to nothing tonight. They showed the character to come back from a bad blow. We’re working towards an end target, which is the play-offs in March. We go to Cyprus one point behind with a chance to go above them<br /><br /><b>[Heavy rain and a sodden pitch made conditions increasingly difficult in the second half]</b> It was difficult to pass the ball. We wanted to pass the ball. We moved the ball really well and very fast in the early part of the game, which got us in front. We wanted to do that in the second half, but obviously it started sticking in the puddles. We still managed to find the right passes into the box and got some good goals for us</p>
