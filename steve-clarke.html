  <p><b>[Chelsea have the financial power to stop Diego Costa leaving and make him see out his contract]</b> At the moment Costa is making it difficult for himself. He hasn’t gone back to the club, he’s not training, he’s not earning his money. I think Chelsea have got the financial power to make him see out the rest of his contract. If Costa doesn’t want to come back in and honour his deal, then Chelsea have got the financial power to say, ‘ok, you’ll sit for two years and not play’. But that’s not an ideal situation for anybody<br /><br />I think they need to get all the parties together, sit them down and thrash out some kind of a solution that’s best for everybody - even if it’s a short-term one. I think they need somebody at the top, probably right at the top - it’s probably a job for Mr Abramovich to be honest<br /><br />He will always be the biggest loser. You can never go against a club. You are never going to win. You can try as hard as you want, but the club has the longest breath. As a player, you have to make the right decision. You don’t want to kill your career because of the situation he is in now. Both of them <b>[Costa and Conte]</b> don’t want to work together. Now it comes down to Chelsea saying ‘Costa, come here, let’s talk about the situation and make sure you can go’. He wants to hold out and say ‘I don’t even want to come back, I want you guys to close out a deal so I don’t come back to the Bridge’, but it doesn’t work like that. No player can do that. No player has the right to do that</p>

  <p><b>[Eden Hazard may have to be sold by Chelsea in order to free up for funds for summer additions]</b> You can always look to replace players. They come and go, they always move on. The club is the most important thing. They have to rebuild that squad a little bit. It wasn’t good enough to be in the top four. They have got a lot of work to do over the summer. To help fund other transfers for the club this summer, maybe they do have to sell Hazard</p>

  <p><b>[Kilmarnock vs Rangers. Steve Clarke had previously called for Jermain Defoe to be suspended for two matches]</b> There was a media furore, a witch hunt against the player. There’s been nothing on the same scale from Saturday’s game, Rangers versus St Mirren. I just want consistency. So if our player gets a two-game ban, I look forward to seeing what happens this week</p>

  <p><b>[Rangers vs Kilmarnock]</b> The goal was a long time coming. It was nice to see the ball hit the back of the net. We’ve had a tough run. The boys have put in a lot of effort. I thought that was just reward for their efforts. It’s nice to get within a point of Aberdeen. Hopefully we can close them down, certainly keep in touch with them after the split and see what happens.</p>

  <p><b>[Mourinho to Celtic?]</b> I did have a little grin. I’m not sure Jose would come to Scotland. He’d probably be looking to go to a more high-profile European league. And to somebody who is going to pay him a little bit closer to £12 million per year!</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Clarke has officially been named as Scotland’s new permanent manager]</b> In my time at Kilmarnock, I’m sorry I didn’t win you a trophy but I stand here in front of three stands of Kilmarnock supporters - that is my trophy.<br /><br />It is an honour. I firmly believe we have a talented group of players who can achieve success on the international stage. I look forward to working with them and helping them to fulfil those ambitions. I appreciate the Scotland supporters have waited a long time for the national team to qualify for a major tournament. Now we have a Women’s World Cup to look forward to in France this summer and it’s my motivation to emulate the success of Shelley Kerr and her squad by leading us to Euro 2020. I believe we can qualify and look forward to that journey with the players and the fans, starting against Cyprus and Belgium next month</p>

  <p><b>[New Scotland boss Steve Clarke says door is open for exiled internationals]</b> The door is open to everyone. If players have retired, they have to un-retire themselves. If they want to come back to the fold they have to get in touch with myself or the Scottish FA and say they want to make themselves available. I won’t be chasing down players who have retired. I only want players who are 100% committed to Scotland.<br /><br />A burning ambition of mine is to take Scotland to a major tournament. It should be the pinnacle of any players’ career to get to a World Cup finals with their country. The ones who have maybe pulled out of a squad a little too easily, it’s down to me to have that conversation with them, to sell my vision of what we’re going to do as a national team and how we’ll approach this tournament<br /><br />We want to make the Tartan Army proud of their team. The numbers have dwindled but it’s my job to make sure the players are focused. I’ll give everything I have to qualify through the group stages. We have slipped up and have to pick up points - the two games in June are crucial</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Clarke believes there were plenty of positives for Scotland to take after Oliver Burke’s late winner against Cyrpus]</b> The way we showed character to bounce back gives us good hope for the future. I’ve only had seven training sessions, so it won’t change overnight. I’ve given the lads a lot of information and I think some of them have taken it on too literally. It was a game we couldn’t afford to lose and we handled that pressure. I thought we did okay. At 1-0, I thought we were comfortable but we switched off from a set play. It would have been easy to feel sorry for ourselves but the players showed great resilience and that’s a good sign. I’m confident we have a group players who will certainly make it a difficult night for Belgium. A lot of things to be pleased about and a lot of things to work on.<br /><br /><b>[Meanwhile winning scorer Burke was delighted to be the one to secure a vital three points for his side]</b> It was made for me to make an impact, coming on. Conceding so late, it drove us on in search of the second goal and I think we deserved it</p>

  <p><b>[Belgium vs Scotland. Scotland boss Steve Clarke admitted that his side would need to put in a stellar showing to cause an upset]</b> We can’t make too many mistakes defensively because we know we’ll be punished. Shape and tactics are important but also the character of the players as well, the personality of the players. We’ve got good players in our squad, players who play at a really good level and they have to relish the challenge that faces us tomorrow. I always say to the players that you have to let the opposition know that you have the capability to hurt them. So it’s important to get the defensive side right, but if you go through the game and try to play 97 minutes with no attacking threat then it’s going to be a really long night, so you have to get the balance right</p>

  <p><b>[Scotland vs Russia. Under Steve Clarke, however, there is renewed optimism, despite the team struggling to overcome Cyprus in June then falling to a 3-0 loss away in Belgium three days layer]</b> It’s been a long time since we turned over one of the big boys. Russia, having been in the last eight of the last World Cup, are one of the bigger teams. We need a big win as a country. It’s about time that we as a nation, rather than being on the receiving end, are dishing out a result that’s deemed an upset. Hopefully Friday night can be the case. Over a number of years, we haven’t reached a major finals. The more often that happens, the less people start to believe in it. So one big result could change the mindset, not just of the squad, but of the whole nation.<br /><br />If you’re optimistic, you think you can win any game. Rather than put the pressure on the one game, over the next three games we have to make sure we get enough points to make sure we’re still in the group</p>

Why we allowed that game to drift away from us, whether it’s a mental thing or a quality thing, we will need to assess</p>

  <p><b>[Steve Clarke was relieved to end a tough week for Scotland on a high by hammering San Marino 6-0 for the Tartan Army’s biggest win in four years]</b> It’s not often a Scotland team score six goals. It’s a nice reward at the end of a difficult week. They’ve got character and resilience. They were on a hiding to nothing tonight. They showed the character to come back from a bad blow. We’re working towards an end target, which is the play-offs in March. We go to Cyprus one point behind with a chance to go above them<br /><br /><b>[Heavy rain and a sodden pitch made conditions increasingly difficult in the second half]</b> It was difficult to pass the ball. We wanted to pass the ball. We moved the ball really well and very fast in the early part of the game, which got us in front. We wanted to do that in the second half, but obviously it started sticking in the puddles. We still managed to find the right passes into the box and got some good goals for us</p>
