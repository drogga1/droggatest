  <p><b>[Abhishek Bachchan reiterated his stand that India will improve its footballing standards by leaps and bounds when they adopt a singular league]</b> When we genuinely play in the Asian Football Confederation Cup, there are going to be times when we will take on some of the big boys and might hopefully upstage them, that day isn’t far away.<br /><br />When I made my entry into the ISL, I said, ‘Give us 10 years and then you will be talking to a very competitive football nation. We are on our way to achieve that. And you never know, with the support from the Premier League, if we can absorb their knowledge, we can export some of our talent to the Premiership as well</p>

  <p><b>[Abhishek Bachchan went on to explain the reasoning behind the management’s decision to appoint John Gregory]</b> We wanted a technical proficient coach and somebody who would fit in to the family. We were very impressed with John. He has managed a lot of teams and he is also interested in blooding young talents. He ticked all our boxes. He has the attitude we want. He is a leader.</p>
