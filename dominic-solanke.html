  <p><b>[Dominic Solanke has completed his move to Liverpool from Chelsea]</b> It feels amazing and everyone has made me feel welcome already. Even just pulling on the training top, I was over the moon. Hopefully I can put on the shirt in the near future and make some good history here.</p>

  <p><b>[Dominic Solanke considers Jurgen Klopp to be one of the best managers in the world]</b> He’s one of the best managers in the world and he’s worked with some of the best players in the world as well. When he gives positive feedback, it’s warming for me. I definitely need that. With me playing my first proper season in the Premier League I know there is a lot to learn.<br /><br />When you achieve something, you always want to do more. When you’re not achieving as much as you think you can, it is always something you want to <b>[change]</b> as soon as possible. I’ve just got to try and stay patient and then at the right time it will happen</p>

  <p><b>[Crazy talent of on fire Mohamed Salah and his fellow forwards is keeping Dominic Solanke frustrated on the sidelines at Liverpool]</b> Being at Liverpool there’s a lot of competition and there are going to be tough times. But coming to England is always another time to express yourself. There are crazy players at Liverpool, especially in my position, and I’ve definitely learnt a lot. You always have to take the positives and we are doing so well at the moment. The front players have been phenomenal, it’s a good lesson. Mo Salah is on fire, I’m so happy for him, and he is unstoppable and it’s helping us a lot. It’s always frustrating when you’re not playing, but I’m enjoying it at Liverpool. You can say it’s different to Chelsea.</p>

  <p><b>[Dominic Solanke is happy Steven Gerrard has got the Rangers manager’s job]</b> He has done so much for Liverpool and for football. I’m happy he has got the Rangers job and it will be good for him. I’m intrigued to see how he’s going to do.<br /><br />Everyone knows how much of a big club Liverpool is. I’ve enjoyed my first season. It’s gone in quickly and we have such a good bunch of boys. The front three are phenomenal with the stats they have got this season. We are so lucky to have them and for me to watch them every week and learn from them definitely helps my game</p>

  <p><b>[Liverpool youngster Dominic Solanke says he has full faith in his development under Jurgen Klopp]</b> Jurgen is a great manager and he knows what he is doing, especially when he is bringing people through. You can see what he has done with Trent <b>[Alexander-Arnold]</b> and Joe <b>[Gomez]</b> at the moment and how far they have gone. They have been two vital players for us this season. I have known them for a few years now so I have seen them breakthrough and he definitely helped them. All the team are good <b>[providing support and advice]</b>, really. Everyone has helped me. From the moment I got to Liverpool, they all made me feel welcome and I settled in quite quickly. Whenever they see someone they can give a hand to, they always will. It is always nice when you come away and get minutes, especially for your country. Of course, everyone wants to play for their clubs and when you have been away, you have got to go back and fight. But these little breaks are always good, especially if you are getting minutes</p>

Growing up, watching great players like R9 <b>[<a href="cristiano-ronaldo.html">Ronaldo</a>]</b>, Ibrahimovic and <a href="karim-benzema.html">Benzema</a> to name a few, you always saw top players in that number so I’m delighted to get it. I’m really looking forward to the start of the season, I arrived midway through last season so it’s a fresh start for myself and everyone else in the squad. With the new number, hopefully I can score goals and make an impact, we’re looking forward to that first game</p>
