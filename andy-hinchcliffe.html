  <p><b>[The best right-back in the world? How <a href="trent-alexander-arnold.html">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a> is reinventing the full-back]</b> Back in the day, you defended against the winger because both teams matched up with 4-4-2. In the late-80s I had the energy and intention to overlap and get up and down the pitch, but that was your only attacking option</p>

  <p><b>[Andy Hinchcliffe has explained how <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> has influenced Derby County]</b> It’s what <a href="phillip-cocu.html">Phillip Cocu</a> has done too but <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a>’s impact has been absolutely enormous. We saw what <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> himself can do with that free kick against Preston, but it’s also what he has brought to the young players around him as well, the influence he is having as a person on those around him, too<br /><br />Derby in the past have spent big money and wages bringing players in, but they have invested a lot in their academy, and Max Bird and Louie Sibley have been outstanding. The structure of the team has been a lot better, the young players are excelling and if <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> wants to go into management, that is what he has to do, inspire people around him, both young and old<br /><br />Earlier in the season I was watching Derby and I couldn’t see what identity they had and what <a href="phillip-cocu.html">Phillip Cocu</a> was trying to do. But now it’s 4-2-3-1 with <a href="wayne-rooney.html">Rooney</a> in the team and lots of energy. You can see what the plan is<br /><br /><b>[Their odds for promotion have shortened to 22/1]</b> If Derby continue in this form, you won’t be surprised if they finish in the play-offs, and that will be some story. They’ve got five of the current top six left to play, which is tough, but with the form they are in the sides they’ve got to play will be more worried about Derby than Derby are about those teams. They are a team you simply don’t want to play at the moment</p>
