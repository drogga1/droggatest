  <p><b>[The agent of Napoli defender, Mario Giuffredi, Elseid Hysaj has admitted to receiving contact from England for the Manchester United and Arsenal target]</b> There are several scouts who have come to view him, representing German and English interest, but we have no need to leave Napoli. Elseid is in his second season at Napoli and I think he can do well next term as well. The lad really wants to fight for the Scudetto, so both his intentions and those of Napoli coincide. Having said that, Hysaj has a release clause in his contract and if a club arrives that is intent on paying it, the player could leave. If that were to happen, we’d keep Napoli fully in the loop on everything and wouldn’t take any other paths without informing the club first.</p>

  <p><b>[Premier League-linked Elseid Hysaj has admitted he is ready for a new challenge]</b> I’m absolutely ready for a new challenge because I need change. I’m not the type of person who likes to stay at a club for too long. I want to have new experiences, learn about a new country, meet new people, play for another team and maybe try to win something. For me, my time at <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> is over and I hope to find a team that will give me what I need.</p>
