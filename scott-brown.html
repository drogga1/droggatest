  <p><b>[Scott Brown says that he is hopeful Brendan Rodgers will remain at Parkhead]</b> He’s taken us into 2018 properly. He’s brought more professionalism more than anything. He’s been at top-quality clubs down in England and he’s seen how it’s worked in the Premier League. He wants to bring that look into the Scottish game and he’s been doing that well so far.</p>

  <p><b>[Over the course of his 12 years at Celtic, Scott Brown has become a club legend]</b> As soon as it went over the line I saw Greegsy <b>[Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor]</b> diving and I thought: ‘He’s not getting there - I’ve done it! I couldn’t quite believe it myself and my next thought was: ‘Where’s Diouf?’ And it couldn’t have worked out any better to be honest.</p>

  <p><b>[Hibs vs Celtic]</b> Tonight was a huge game for us. It was sad to see a manager of that class leave. The gaffer’s come in and it’s great to see him back at the club. For us it’s about continuing and making sure were getting better and better. Everyone wanted Lennon to come back in. He puts a lot of faith in his players so we’ll try to be as positive <b>[in spite of]</b> a huge loss and a huge gain.</p>

  <p><b>[Celtic vs Rangers]</b> We need to make sure we’re on our game and focused. We had a slight slip-up against them in the last game so that’s still in the back of our minds. We’re still hurting a little bit from that. But yet again we’ve gone on a fantastic run since coming back from Dubai. Now we’re lucky enough to be 10 points clear. I wouldn’t say <b>[our record against Rangers]</b> was tarnished. We’d been on a great run against them before but there is always going to be one of those games where we don’t turn up or play that well. It turned out to be that one but we’ve had a couple of fantastic seasons and we want it to continue</p>

For the fans, it’s unbelievable and that was people saying we’ve had a poor season. We’ve done the treble yet again and it’s the third one in a row. It shows you the lads are relentlessness. They threw the kitchen sink at us and we held out. Hearts have given us a very hard, very physical game, but we stood up to it. We know, if we turn up, we win the game.</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> team-mate Scott Brown says <a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a> is phenomenal]</b> They have been phenomenal. They have been chatting away to everyone like nothing has happened. It’s great but once you’re a top quality player like he <b>[Tierney]</b> is, like what Callum is, what James is, you are always going to get bids. You are always going to get speculation and you are always going to get teams wanting to poach your better younger players. That’s what they are and they have been phenomenal for us over the last three, four, five seasons and they are only going to get better so it’s no wonder people are looking to put their money where their mouth is and go out and sign the players. But again, they are <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> players now and here’s hoping they stay that way.<br /><br /><b>[Brown admits that the opportunity to play in the <a href="epl.html">English Premier League</a> will be a draw for any player]</b> It’s always going to be. That’s what happens when you’re a top quality player. If Kieran goes or if he stays, it will be great for <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> either way. Whatever happens, happens. But as it stands now, Kieran is a <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> player</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="kieran-tierney.html">Kieran Tierney</a>’s move to <a href="arsenal-fc.html">Arsenal</a> is a fairy-tale according to ex-Celtic team-mate Scott Brown]</b> All the lads are delighted for him. He got a fantastic move and he’s got a fantastic club as well. He loves this club so much that it was a hard thing for him to do, but he’s going down to England, he’s going to play against the best players week in, week out and he’s going to be in Europe as well. Here’s hoping we get to the Champions League though. But we all wish him the best, he has been a fantastic servant to the club. When you look at it, he came through the youth, he has supported <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> all the way through, he has not cost the club a penny and we have sold him for £25 million<br /><br /><b>[Brown believes it is hard to ask for a better outcome]</b> For me personally, it should be a fairy-tale story. When you look at <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> and other teams like that, when they sell players that have come through the youth and given so much to the club, they have a big, massive party on the street and all the fans come out and cheer. It’s sad that we couldn’t all wish him a farewell at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> Park but I’m sure he will be back up</p>

They can come back as well, that’s what this club is all about. I see <a href="ajax-fc.html">Ajax</a> bringing players through and selling them on - and they have a party for them leaving. We try and criticise. It’s a different level. We wish him all the best. We just concentrate on now and <b>[new left back Boli Bolingoli]</b> has to push on and try to get to the levels that Kieran did</p>

  <p><b>[Scott Brown believes <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> will need to hit the ground running if they are to claim an unprecedented tenth consecutive league title next season]</b> We need a good start, getting a good start is always huge for us. We’re disappointed we couldn’t finish the season but the way we were flying - that’s the standard we want to get back to. Whether it’s a friendly match, cup match, league or Champions League - we need to go in with the same attitude, same work rate and same fitness levels as we did at the end of last season. So we need to make sure we work hard in the next three or four weeks, work so whenever the league says it safe to start then we’re ready to go and firing on all cylinders<br /><br /><b>[However, despite admitting it will be ‘hard’ without the vociferous <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> support behind them, Brown believes it does not bring any added pressure in their title quest]</b> There’s always pressure on us at <a href="celtic-fc.html">Celtic</a> to play and to perform as well as we possibly can do, whether it’s from the fans or the media. It’s always hard without the fans at the start but for us, it’s still playing football and doing what we enjoy doing - the main thing is we make sure we win every game. But the lads are looking forward to getting back to playing because it been so long but here’s hoping we can get the fans back in the stadium when it’s safe to do so as soon as possible too</p>
