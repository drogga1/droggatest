It wasn’t a Del Piero-esque type of thing off the pitch. Going back to the football … the bar for Victory is to be champions, they were third and they got knocked out in the elimination final</p>

How can someone do that to a man that has put so much heart and soul into something and make him out to be something that he was not…it really is disgusting. For them (the FFA) to backtrack like they did basically tells the story. He was set-up and they wanted him out. I can’t tell you how mad I was when I saw it. It’s really disgusting that you can sack somebody just because you don’t like the way they speak, they look or you don’t like the sound of their last name - it’s shocking</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Bosnich claims Manchester United should be considering a move to bring in N’Golo Kante alongside Paul Pogba]</b> In terms of Pogba, and I feel very strongly about this, I would build the team around him. I think what they’ve got to do is look at where Pogba has been most successful, at Juventus and at the World Cup, and who was playing with him? Well, at the World Cup it was N’Golo Kante and Blaise Matuidi. So, if you’re looking for players, either look to bring those two in with him, or players of that ilk to play alongside him and bring the very best out of him.<br /><br /><b>[Paul Pogba has hinted that it may be time for a change after three testing seasons back in England]</b> It’s a little bit worrying, but you don’t know about the games going on behind the scenes. I don’t know the lad personally, I can only go on what I see, what I read and what I hear. He seems to be the guy who needs to know he’s wanted and needs an arm put around him, so maybe it’s just a little bit of that. Maybe he wants to know the club are 100 per cent behind him, because he does carry the can when anything goes wrong. But that’s understandable. The best players get all the credit when things go right, but when they go wrong it’s usually the best players and the manager who cop it as well</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Bosnich says Under-fire <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> manager <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a> should be given time to turn things around at Old Trafford]</b> They’re not winning football games and you have to say, at the moment, they’re not playing particularly good football. We’ve spoken before about the big gap that was going to be there when <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> left and we understand that. But there’s been three managers now, Ole’s the fourth manager. I can understand everybody’s impatience but they’re going to have to gather patience. If things continue how they’re going they may be left with no choice, but I don’t think they’re at that stage at the moment.<br /><br />I would stick. I’m biased, I must admit that, because I’m an ex-team-mate of his. He was not only a world-class player but a world-class person and I would stick with him. To be honest, if you look at the availability around the world, it’s not as if a <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> or a <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Pep Guardiola</a> is free and available. Stick with him. However, there is a cut-off point. I said this with <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Jose Mourinho</a>. If in another 20 games, 28 games into the season, if he’s third from bottom they may be left with no choice<br /><br /><b>[Bosnich believes <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Solskjaer</a> and his predecessors have been hamstrung by ill-judged moves in the transfer market]</b> Let’s be really frank, the recruitment has been poor over the past three or four years. Regardless of what the personal situation was, it was a mistake to let <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> go without having a ready-made replacement to come in. Especially at that stage of the season<br /><br />They didn’t <b>[sign a replacement for Lukaku]</b> and now Martial, <a href="marcus-rashford.html">Rashford</a> and all of them have to find their spirit, find their soul and fight back. There’s no use just sort of turning up at training, doing your job, going to the game, hiding, hoping that you don’t get any criticism and picking up your wages. That doesn’t work at a club like Manchester United</p>

There’s a lot of talk from <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> fans about whether Solskjaer should stay or go, but you’ve got to have some patience. What are they going to do, just keep sacking managers year-in, year-out? You’ve got to give the man a go! <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Jurgen Klopp</a> has had four years at <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a>, and it hasn’t even been a year since Ole was appointed - you’ve got to give him time!<br /><br />It’s always a massive game against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> and hearing that two of their players are out is not great, but <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> when they’ve got their backs to the wall can be very, very dangerous. No one is giving them a chance in hell, but they’ve got a very good record against <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> at Old Trafford. <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> are going great guns, but they’re away from home and it’s after the international break, which can throw the chips in the air, so you never know</p>

Regardless of the player you are on a world standing, you can ill afford to be spending four or five months on the bench.

If you look at the team the other night <b>[against City]</b>, a young side, and that’s why we’re talking about progression. He <b>[Solskjaer]</b> has obviously gone for a young side and looking towards the future. That’s reliant a lot on the patience of the supporters. A young side may or may not come good within two years.<br /><br />They are doing something very similar to what <a href="sir-alex-ferguson.html">Alex Ferguson</a> did in the time that he was there, when he had that group of young players that he brought through the youth system and was lucky enough to put them in and continue the success. Sir Alex, before that, was given a lot of time - four years before he won his first major trophy against Crystal Palace in that FA Cup final. I don’t think people these days have got that much patience.<br /><br />I think after the result the other night, and not just the result but the performance and the quite apparent difference in class between the two sides, he has got no other option but to go and strengthen that squad because there are players all over it - there’s no need to get into naming and shaming - that you look at and compare them to other players in other teams that are doing so well and they are just not up to it</p>

The top four is still possible for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>, they had to go and get somebody.

Six points at this stage of the season for me is still nothing. The big question of them not scoring goals is the way that they’re playing. People would have a lot more confidence if they had been watching performances and saying okay this team is actually going somewhere. I do believe that they are. Whether or not they’ll be able creep into that top four at the end of the season is a different question entirely. There’s a still a chance, regardless of what anyone says they’re still in the mix</p>

It will be interesting to see where they finish this season, but they have got the right man and he is doing a good job. I always thought that one day he would be a really good manager. He has been at the club before and knows how to handle the pressure. He has good people around him to make sure he can always ask for things and I am sure Sir Alex <b>[Ferguson]</b> is always available if he needs him. All those ingredients are there.

  <p><b>[Bosnich says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> should stick with Kepa]</b> I was probably in the minority as a goalkeeper as I didn’t mind competition for places. I thought being a goalkeeper was the same as any position that if you are not playing well, then it is understandable that someone else comes in.<br /><br />With Kepa, it is a little bit different because of the price tag that surrounds him but it wasn’t <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> who bought him. It was somebody else. I was impressed with the way he came back but he has been struggling a little bit this season. It is completely understandable as a manager if someone is not doing it for you at a big club you think somewhere else. There are stories around about <a href="gianluigi-donnarumma.html">Donnarumma</a> or <a href="andre-onana.html">Onana</a> but with any goalkeeper you talk about purchasing, especially from abroad, there’s nothing like playing the position in England. There’s more physical challenges on the crosses that you get in England than anywhere else in the world. You have to be careful.<br /><br />I am not privy to what’s gone on behind the scenes but if a manager-player relationship breaks down, then that’s a different matter. I just think it was down to his form which in terms of the standard when he first came, it hasn’t been up to scratch this season. Frank was well within his rights to leave him out when he did but I thought he did well when he came back.<br /><br />I rate Kepa, I thought he was a superb shot-stopper with good agility and his kicking was okay for me. I think people make too much of his problems with distribution but the first job is to keep the ball out of the net. Kicking is a bonus. In terms of dominating his box, he is young and slight so it has taken time to get to grips with that. That’s something they need to work on.<br /><br />For me, he has not been a disaster in any sense of the word. He has done okay so far. It is difficult to follow <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a> in their most successful era at the club. Then you have <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Thibaut Courtois</a>, who was exceptional as well. I believe that Kepa has the ability given time to get to that level.<br /><br />I was very close to Frank before what happened to me happened. He had fantastic footballing knowledge; he was one of the greatest midfielders in the world at the time. He won everything there was and he had a real advantage of playing under so many different great managers which gives you many different perspectives to learn off. He had the transfer ban which was overturned but then they didn’t sign anyone in January. Using young players, he has done a fantastic job. Patience is like gold these days and I think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> need some patience. Once he gets the chance to sign players he needs to add to his team and open up the cheque book, I believe he will be fine in terms of getting it right to challenge for titles. I don’t think it will take as long to challenge than it will <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I don’t think it will take as long for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because they didn’t drop as dramatically as United since the Sir Alex days</p>

  <p><b>[Bosnich says De Gea is still the main man for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> despite Henderson emergence]</b> Henderson has done absolutely fantastic and proven himself to be an excellent goalkeeper. The bottom line is though that De Gea has done brilliantly over a longer period of time, he has had ups and downs but every goalkeeper does, there’s no doubt about that. When you are at a bigger club it is far more exacerbated. At this moment in time, I would stick with De Gea. <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a> is too good for the bench and it is a waste for him so I would keep loaning him out. Things can change very quickly. De Gea has had ups and downs but over a long period of time, he has been excellent. Unless they get ridiculous money for him, then I would keep him on. Give it time, he will get it right. We have seen the signs of that and he will get it right. So far so good, I don’t know if they will get into the top four but if they do I regard it as a really top season for them. It is going to take time for them. We saw what happened to <a href="liverpool-fc.html">Liverpool</a> after their dynasty ended and it took them a really long time to get to the top of English and European football. It will take time with <a href="manchester-united.html">Man Utd</a> and they are vying for a top-four place, maybe third with <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> but they look good to qualify, the way they are playing with <a href="brendan-rodgers.html">Brendan Rodgers</a>.

I think he could have left last time when they last got relegated but he didn’t and he stayed. I think that was a real mark of a man. He helped them get promoted. He didn’t do it all on his own but he was a big part of that. He has been in a team that has struggled in a position where he has to make things happen and been a standout. That is in a position where it isn’t easy to do that. I hope from the bottom of my heart that Villa stay up and we don’t know what will happen with the lockdown. He has shown his loyalty. <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> are where they belong. If they do stay up, then I think <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> should try to keep him and that includes the scenario if the season is voided.

If he is in <a href="epl.html">the Premier League</a>, playing for the club he loves, then he should stay. Maybe one day, he needs to leave. If they stay up, though, stay at Villa. He is part of a great generation in England.

There’s a lot of them around but there’s just not as many playing for the top clubs as the golden generation. For whatever reason, that’s the way it is. I want the next generation to do better. That will come as the clubs and the AFA have changed. We have a new CEO of Football Federation Australia called James Johnson who worked for <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and AFC. He was an ex-Socceroo and he worked for City Group. He is a football man to his boots. He is determined to make the change. They brought former <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> CEO Richard Scudamore in to advise the A-League clubs so things are looking up. There’s no doubt about that. Like anything good, it takes time<br /><br />One of the reasons we kept going as much as we could because there are a few clubs in a precarious situation. The strange thing is, in saying that, with everything going on in the world so far, they are used to surviving in recent times. The unity and purpose generated between clubs and the federations - in such a bad time I think it is decently placed to go forward. This is like playing roulette and all the chips are on the table and someone throws them up in the air. We will see how things land but at this moment in time, a lot of the clubs are just used to surviving and could come out of this strong. For the national team, if you look back, say from 2006 to 2020, it has gone backwards a bit. There’s no doubt about that. That initial generation was a once in a lifetime generation and the bottom line, the production line is not good, despite participation here being the biggest of any sport. Two million play at all age groups, we have that many players available, the best technical directors from everywhere, the best coaches we have had and yet the production line has dried up. That’s really something to look deeply at.<br /><br />The other thing that’s a bugbear of mine is the amount of fees kids are being charged to train. It nearly amounts to extortion because some of the fees they pay for the SAP (Skills Acquisition Programmes), which is a more advanced programme clubs can give out through the AFA. Some kids pay $2,500 a year and that’s like £1,200 in the UK. When you see the session cost you expect something like <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> or <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> but they are just normal sessions. You think when I was growing up and the golden generation were growing up. It was a working class generation. It was $30 or $40 and the coaches were volunteers. My dad, people’s uncles, often immigrants who would just come back after work and give time for free. We produced really good players, arguably world class players</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Bosnich says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should be looking to keep <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a> at Old Trafford]</b> I think they should for as long as the player wants to stay at the club, and only they know that because they are with him day in, day out inside the four walls. I think they should persist with him. The bottom line is that they paid a lot of money for him, it’s doubtful that they will get that kind of money in return and if he is making all of the right noises and performing as he can - if he performs at the best of his ability, him and Fernandes in the middle will be absolutely sensational. You have to remember as well that if you let go of a player of that kind of ilk - it would still be for a considerable amount, I don’t think it will be what they purchased him for - you still have to replace him and that must be in their mind</p>

He’s a superb signing. Anyone who had followed him at Sporting would have seen what a top player he was.

  <p><b>[Mark Bosnich has pointed out a key technical flaw in <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>’s game]</b> He’s had a season which had been full of mistakes that he hasn’t made on a consistent basis in the past. In terms of the mistake against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, the most important thing from a technical point of view is there is something wrong when he sets for shots. As a goalkeeper, if you set for shots and your feet are outside the width of your shoulders, you’re going to have problems because the natural reaction then is to go backwards when a shot is hit quite hard. You’ve got no room to manoeuvre your feet and if you start going backwards as a goalkeeper and the ball hits you, invariably it’s going to go in the back of the goal. That’s something they definitely need to work on. Obviously they’ve got Henderson who is playing so well at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> aswell, and Gary is right in saying it has been more than a blip this season</p>
