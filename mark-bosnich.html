  <p><b>[Tim Cahill saw red in dramatic circumstances in the Melbourne derby]</b> I’ve spoken to him <b>[Cahill]</b>, to be fair to him, he told me and he said I could say it straight. He was red-carded by the referee <b>[because]</b> he told the referee to ‘have a look at the big screen’ and that ‘you’re a effing disgrace’ … He said nothing more, nothing less. He’s not excusing it in any type of way nor is he hiding from it, he’ll take any punishment that’s afforded to him. But that’s basically exactly what he said</p>

  <p><b>[David de Gea deserves criticism for his recent performances in a Spain shirt]</b> David de Gea is an excellent goalkeeper, he is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, but the other night he made a mistake that was a horrible mistake. That’s a goalkeeper’s nightmare. He rightly got criticism and he has got to come back from it now. Of course he is world class. That’s why the spotlight goes more on world class players and especially goalkeepers. When you do make a mistake, people don’t expect that. When it is a goalkeeper that no one has heard of before and he makes a mistake then they pretty much brush over it. When it is someone like David de Gea, when it is someone like Manuel Neuer or Thibaut Courtois, when they make mistakes people are going to turn around and say; ‘Hang on a minute? What’s going on?’. It is only human nature.</p>

  <p><b>[Daniel Arzani and Mathew Ryan are the two Australia players capable of rising to football’s highest level]</b> There’s a young player we have got called Daniel Arzani. He is the youngest player at the World Cup. Iranian refugee, it is a wonderful story. He didn’t even play domestic football, A League football until January and now he is in the Socceroos squad. I think he should play, he is a player that we have not got in our side. I think he is good enough to play at the highest level. He has come from nowhere. We have a very structured, too structured in my opinion but that’s another story, pathway in Australia, from what you have got to do, to where you have got to go. He never did any of that. He is a player from the street. You will pick that up straight away, he is just off the cuff and he excites people when you are watching him.<br /><br />Well, he is <b>[the star]</b>. Himself, Aaron Mooy, as well. Obviously, he plays for Huddersfield. Tim Cahill as well, he is in the squad but he is not the force he once was. I thought Mat Ryan, in the first 10 minutes <b>[against France]</b> kept us in it, and settled the whole team down. I think he had a very calming effect on everyone. That first 10 minutes, it was crucial that we didn’t concede a goal. In that first 10 minutes if we conceded then maybe France would have run away with it. There’s a few people asking questions about his positioning for the second goal but I thought that was very harsh. I thought overall that he did very well and, in that first 10 minutes, he was crucial. Of course he can <b>[play for a bigger club]</b>. It takes a lot of hard work and good luck. He has definitely got the talent and ability, and we have seen that this year in the Premier League</p>

  <p><b>[It’s time for Australia to start Daniel Arzani and play Tim Cahill against Denmark]</b> I’d say to him <b>[Cahill]</b>, ‘I’m not going to start with you but you are going play a major part tonight. In my opinion, if you start him, he’s in great condition for his age but he’s only played 65 minutes in the last 10 games or so in the Championship <b>[with Millwall]</b>. To play a full game, he’s not in that condition. Whether you start him and play him <b>[for]</b> the first bit or you bring him on with half an hour to go, I think he needs to play some type of part. I think basically he will play some part in this game.<br /><br />I would start with Daniel Arzani. The other day, Robbie Kruse put in a good shift defensively but from an attacking point of view offered us nothing. Daniel Arzani is a player who offers something completely different that we haven’t got. He’s a player that we aspire to produce all the time and somebody that we are going to enjoy watching for a very long time.</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Bosnich thinks that Tim Cahill has given the greatest contribution to Australian football of any player in the country’s history]</b> There has been far better players <b>[than Cahill for Australia]</b>. You know like Mark Viduka, Harry Kewell and maybe half a dozen. They were better players than Tim but no one has performed better for the Socceroos than Tim Cahill. He has got over 100 caps and his performances for the Socceroos have been the best of anyone over a consistent period. He will forever be in Australia’s minds about that. The goal against Netherlands in the last World Cup, that was a world-class goal. He will remain in the minds of Australian football followers and sport followers forever. He is our greatest capped outfield player. He will have that and be revered for that and have that significance attached to him forever, or until there’s another one turns up and I don’t think there will be for a very long time.<br /><br />It is a toss up between him and Arzani. I think the plan was that it would be 1-1 or 0-0 and then it was a draw but then they got that rather fortuitous goal. You have got to say fair play to <b>[Paul]</b> Pogba, he pushed really hard with good interplay but then it came of <b>[Aziz]</b> Behich and came off Matt Ryan but whatever. I think then Van Marwijk and Mark van Bommel were like, okay, we have got one sub left. Do we go Timmy or Daniel? Cahill has only played like 60 minutes in his last 10 to 13 games for Millwall so you can understand why people were a little bit <b>[hesitant to use him]</b>. But I think with 10 minutes to go, it is something a little bit different. I know we have developed a way we like to play on the ground and all that but I think that was the time to start getting it out wide and actually start lumping it in. Timmy is a real danger in the air</p>

  <p><b>[Replacing Petr Cech with Bernd Leno is not going to solve Arsenal’s problems]</b> He made <b>[Cech]</b> captain. Leno is going to eventually take over, but I don’t see that solving their problems<br /><br />If the ball goes in from a silly back pass he might be out of the team anyway. What’s the worse choice? If the ball goes in from one of those clangers, he’ll be kicking himself saying ‘I should have just put my foot through it’. He’s obviously been told to play out, but there’s no shame whatsoever in putting your foot through it if it’s not on. He’s got to take responsibility because if those two clangers go in then there’s a problem and it doesn’t exactly fill the defence with confidence. He’s experienced enough to say: ‘I will do everything I can to play out’ but there are times in the game if the ball goes in it’s his responsibility<br /><br />When you’re an outfield player there are quite a few occasions when you’re tired and you don’t want to take that risk. They don’t want to take a risk going forward at certain times so they’re passing it to him. If they pass back to him in a poor position, there’s no problem for them.<br /><br />The stats are backing him up and he’s doing the right thing the vast majority of the time. Why take the risk doing silly things just for the sake of going extreme and playing out all times? If you see goalkeepers in training, you’ll see tricks and things like that. You do it on a matchday, it takes so much courage. If you get caught with it, nine times out of 10 it’s going to end up as a goal</p>

  <p><b>[Paul Pogba is world class]</b> Without being disrespectful, some of the players around Pogba aren’t of the same quality of Rakitic, Suarez or Messi. When you come up against some of those really top teams in Europe, you need to have people around you to help make you look good. You also need the tactics to be on your side. You need the team set up to make sure you shine and I don’t think that was the case last night. Pogba’s a world class player, there’s no doubt. I understand the frustration of people who basically want him to dominate and become the best player on the park. That will happen, but when you’re coming up against the best teams in the world, you need a lot of help.<br /><br />If you said at Christmas, ‘Man United will be playing Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-final’, everyone would’ve said you were nuts. People shouldn’t get their expectations up too much. They came up against a team <b>[Barcelona]</b> which is one of the best in the world and has been for some time, so you’ve got to keep your expectations realistic</p>

  <p><b>[Bosnich questions Honda’s Victory stint]</b> I have to say from a football perspective, no. I enjoyed it as much as everyone watching him play at his best but obviously that injury, it hurt Melbourne Victory. In terms of off the pitch, only the commerical people would be able to say that. It wasn’t a Del Piero-esque type of thing off the pitch. Going back to the football … the bar for Victory is to be champions, they were third and they got knocked out in the elimination final</p>

For them (the FFA) to backtrack like they did basically tells the story. He was set-up and they wanted him out. I can’t tell you how mad I was when I saw it.

  <p><b>[Mark Bosnich says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> should be looking to build around <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>]</b> I think a lot of that has been thrown at him and a lot of that has been unfair. People have their own style and the way they go about things and people need to realise he is a world-class player. It’s synonymous of the team right now how things are actually going. Because they’re not going the best and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> aren’t really where they should be. People have got to keep that in the back of their mind. As I always say, the best players in the team always get the plaudits when things are going well, and when they’re not, they get the biggest criticism as well.<br /><br />I don’t think we’ve seen the best of <b>[<a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>]</b> yet. For a long time you would have to say under <a href="jose-mourinho.html">Mourinho</a> he wasn’t used in a role that you could say suited him. And I understand he’s very, very divisive but for me both him and <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a>, again coming back to the attitude thing, and when I say attitude - just be up front. The club needs to go and say ‘Do you want to be here, seriously do you want to be here, yes or no?’. If both of those players want to be there then those two, along with De Gea, should be the people they’re looking to build a team around.<br /><br />I know he’s had his detractors and you know sometimes it comes across a little bit of a different way because he does sometimes have a blasé attitude towards things and I think a lot of people, especially people from Manchester, sometimes see that a little bit of a different way. But he is a top, top player. When I say top player, he is a world-class player. And I think if he wants to stay it should be made painfully clear to him that we’re going to build a team around yourself around <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> and around <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>. And basically I say to you if I got rid of <a href="paul-pogba.html">Paul Pogba</a>, how much money am I going to get for him and who am I going to replace him with, because that won’t be easy</p>

From a <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> perspective, the fact they’re banned for two transfer windows and have lost their best player in <a href="eden-hazard.html">Eden Hazard</a>, it may not be a smooth ride for them, but having a club legend will give them some breathing space.

If he stays with Derby and just say, for example, he loses seven of the first 10 games and things aren’t going particularly well, he’ll forever be saying to himself, ‘I should have taken that opportunity’. I think it’s a really good move and I really do hope it works out for him. I was very close to Frank during my time at <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a>.

I don’t know the lad personally, I can only go on what I see, what I read and what I hear. He seems to be the guy who needs to know he’s wanted and needs an arm put around him, so maybe it’s just a little bit of that. Maybe he wants to know the club are 100 per cent behind him, because he does carry the can when anything goes wrong. But that’s understandable. The best players get all the credit when things go right, but when they go wrong it’s usually the best players and the manager who cop it as well</p>

Six points at this stage of the season for me is still nothing. The big question of them not scoring goals is the way that they’re playing. People would have a lot more confidence if they had been watching performances and saying okay this team is actually going somewhere. I do believe that they are. Whether or not they’ll be able creep into that top four at the end of the season is a different question entirely. There’s a still a chance, regardless of what anyone says they’re still in the mix</p>

  <p><b>[Bosnich says <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> should stick with Kepa]</b> I was probably in the minority as a goalkeeper as I didn’t mind competition for places. I thought being a goalkeeper was the same as any position that if you are not playing well, then it is understandable that someone else comes in.<br /><br />With Kepa, it is a little bit different because of the price tag that surrounds him but it wasn’t <a href="frank-lampard.html">Frank Lampard</a> who bought him. It was somebody else. I was impressed with the way he came back but he has been struggling a little bit this season. It is completely understandable as a manager if someone is not doing it for you at a big club you think somewhere else. There are stories around about <a href="gianluigi-donnarumma.html">Donnarumma</a> or <a href="andre-onana.html">Onana</a> but with any goalkeeper you talk about purchasing, especially from abroad, there’s nothing like playing the position in England. There’s more physical challenges on the crosses that you get in England than anywhere else in the world. You have to be careful.<br /><br />I am not privy to what’s gone on behind the scenes but if a manager-player relationship breaks down, then that’s a different matter. I just think it was down to his form which in terms of the standard when he first came, it hasn’t been up to scratch this season. Frank was well within his rights to leave him out when he did but I thought he did well when he came back.<br /><br />I rate Kepa, I thought he was a superb shot-stopper with good agility and his kicking was okay for me. I think people make too much of his problems with distribution but the first job is to keep the ball out of the net. Kicking is a bonus. In terms of dominating his box, he is young and slight so it has taken time to get to grips with that. That’s something they need to work on.<br /><br />For me, he has not been a disaster in any sense of the word. He has done okay so far. It is difficult to follow <a href="petr-cech.html">Petr Cech</a> in their most successful era at the club. Then you have <a href="thibaut-courtois.html">Thibaut Courtois</a>, who was exceptional as well. I believe that Kepa has the ability given time to get to that level.<br /><br />I was very close to Frank before what happened to me happened. He had fantastic footballing knowledge; he was one of the greatest midfielders in the world at the time. He won everything there was and he had a real advantage of playing under so many different great managers which gives you many different perspectives to learn off. He had the transfer ban which was overturned but then they didn’t sign anyone in January. Using young players, he has done a fantastic job. Patience is like gold these days and I think <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> need some patience. Once he gets the chance to sign players he needs to add to his team and open up the cheque book, I believe he will be fine in terms of getting it right to challenge for titles. I don’t think it will take as long to challenge than it will <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a>. I don’t think it will take as long for <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> because they didn’t drop as dramatically as United since the Sir Alex days</p>

  <p><b>[Bosnich says De Gea is still the main man for <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> despite Henderson emergence]</b> Henderson has done absolutely fantastic and proven himself to be an excellent goalkeeper. The bottom line is though that De Gea has done brilliantly over a longer period of time, he has had ups and downs but every goalkeeper does, there’s no doubt about that. When you are at a bigger club it is far more exacerbated. At this moment in time, I would stick with De Gea. <a href="dean-henderson.html">Dean Henderson</a> is too good for the bench and it is a waste for him so I would keep loaning him out.

Give it time, he will get it right. We have seen the signs of that and he will get it right.

I think he could have left last time when they last got relegated but he didn’t and he stayed. I think that was a real mark of a man. He helped them get promoted.

  <p><b>[Bosnich: Australia’s football development is broken but there is talent ready for Europe]</b> There have, there have <b>[been some good talents coming through]</b>. <a href="daniel-arzani.html">Daniel Arzani</a> didn’t go through the system. Him and his family knocked it on his own when he was younger. Isn’t that ironic?<br /><br />There are two young boys Al Hassan Toure and Mohamed Toure, who are two refugee boys who came to Australia. One is 16 and another is 18 or 19. They have just burst onto the scene and they have been amazing for Adelaide United. There’s a few others that we have seen in Riley McGree and Connor Metcalfe coming through at this moment in time. The problem is that do they stay here and stay comfortable or go overseas and really give it a go at a young age. During my time with <a href="harry-kewell.html">Harry Kewell</a> and Mark Viduka, your only option was to go overseas. Now, there’s another option to stay which is great but you pay the price for everything.<br /><br />There’s only 11 teams here playing at the top level so if you don’t get the opportunity to start during those formative years and start developing your game then it is all of a sudden you start asking what happened to that young player? <a href="daniel-arzani.html">Daniel Arzani</a>, <a href="aaron-mooy.html">Aaron Mooy</a> and Mat Ryan as well as a few in the <a href="bundesliga.html">Bundesliga</a>. There’s a lot of them around but there’s just not as many playing for the top clubs as the golden generation. For whatever reason, that’s the way it is. I want the next generation to do better. That will come as the clubs and the AFA have changed. We have a new CEO of <a href="ffa.html">Football Federation Australia</a> called James Johnson who worked for <a href="fifa.html">FIFA</a> and AFC. He was an ex-Socceroo and he worked for City Group. He is a football man to his boots. He is determined to make the change. They brought former <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> CEO Richard Scudamore in to advise the A-League clubs so things are looking up. There’s no doubt about that. Like anything good, it takes time<br /><br />One of the reasons we kept going as much as we could because there are a few clubs in a precarious situation. The strange thing is, in saying that, with everything going on in the world so far, they are used to surviving in recent times. The unity and purpose generated between clubs and the federations - in such a bad time I think it is decently placed to go forward. This is like playing roulette and all the chips are on the table and someone throws them up in the air. We will see how things land but at this moment in time, a lot of the clubs are just used to surviving and could come out of this strong. For the national team, if you look back, say from 2006 to 2020, it has gone backwards a bit. There’s no doubt about that. That initial generation was a once in a lifetime generation and the bottom line, the production line is not good, despite participation here being the biggest of any sport. Two million play at all age groups, we have that many players available, the best technical directors from everywhere, the best coaches we have had and yet the production line has dried up. That’s really something to look deeply at.<br /><br />The other thing that’s a bugbear of mine is the amount of fees kids are being charged to train. It nearly amounts to extortion because some of the fees they pay for the SAP (Skills Acquisition Programmes), which is a more advanced programme clubs can give out through the AFA. Some kids pay $2,500 a year and that’s like £1,200 in the UK. When you see the session cost you expect something like <a href="pep-guardiola.html">Guardiola</a> or <a href="jurgen-klopp.html">Klopp</a> but they are just normal sessions. You think when I was growing up and the golden generation were growing up. It was a working class generation. It was $30 or $40 and the coaches were volunteers. My dad, people’s uncles, often immigrants who would just come back after work and give time for free. We produced really good players, arguably world class players</p>

For someone like <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a>, that’s near impossible. He is one of the best players in the world and we’ve seen what he can do. Okay, <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> fans and people in the media have called for more consistency from him, that is understandable. I really do think with the addition of <b>[Bruno]</b> Fernandes and the fact that he’s seen a genuine direction put forward by <a href="ole-gunnar-solskjaer.html">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>, who has handled this situation really well, there seems to be a different type of enthusiasm around the club. I really do think if he’s fully fit and played in the right way then he should stay. It would be fantastic for Man United and the player himself. If you look down their spine, he’s an integral part of that. I’d love to see him stay and hopefully he will</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Bosnich has pointed out a key technical flaw in <a href="david-de-gea.html">David de Gea</a>’s game]</b> He’s had a season which had been full of mistakes that he hasn’t made on a consistent basis in the past. In terms of the mistake against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Tottenham</a>, the most important thing from a technical point of view is there is something wrong when he sets for shots. As a goalkeeper, if you set for shots and your feet are outside the width of your shoulders, you’re going to have problems because the natural reaction then is to go backwards when a shot is hit quite hard. You’ve got no room to manoeuvre your feet and if you start going backwards as a goalkeeper and the ball hits you, invariably it’s going to go in the back of the goal. That’s something they definitely need to work on. Obviously they’ve got Henderson who is playing so well at <a href="sheffield-united.html">Sheffield United</a> aswell, and Gary is right in saying it has been more than a blip this season</p>

  <p><b>[<a href="dean-smith.html">Dean Smith</a> should stop complaining about <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>’s fixture pile-up]</b> I’m forever an optimistic especially when it comes to one of my old clubs who I love dearly. I still think that they will stay up but it really is going to go down to the wire. I can understand where <a href="dean-smith.html">Dean Smith</a> is coming from but if I was asked advice I would caution about coming out publicly and making excuses. We all knew what it was going to be once it was decided to continue on with the season. There was going to be game after game after game and you don’t want to publicly come out with things like that in my opinion because your team can read into it and to start subconsciously thinking that you have an excuse<br /><br />They know exactly what they have to do. I think they need a minimum of 10 points more to make sure they stay up and that still will still be very, very close<br /><br />They know exactly what they have to do. I think they need a minimum of 10 points more to make sure they stay up and that still will still be very, very close<br /><br /><b>[Bosnich believes off-field problems could damage <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>’s chances of maintaining their top-flight status if they are allowed to continue]</b> It would be a huge dent and as they’re pretty much in the same boat as <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a>, <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> and <a href="bournemouth-fc.html">Bournemouth</a> and all those teams around them. There was one time in my career at Aston when we flirted with relegation and one thing I do remember was that when it’s becoming desperate everything you touch seems to go wrong and that seems to be what’s happening now with <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a> and a few of the other teams down there<br /><br />Like I said if I was able to give some advice to <a href="dean-smith.html">Dean Smith</a>, it’s exactly the same to <a href="watford-fc.html">Watford</a>. They’ve got to put whatever it is behind them and just look forward. But at these times it’s so difficult to do as they can’t see where another win is coming from but they got to try to change the mindset as soon as they possibly can.</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Bosnich says <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> favourites for top four]</b> I think they have been very good for some time, even before the restart. The restart has just confirmed what everybody thought and basically proved a lot in terms of the fact that <a href="paul-pogba.html">Pogba</a> alongside Fernandes has turned them into a formidable force. Even before that, they were on a tremendous run but seeing them after this - even though obviously they were a little bit rusty in their opening game against <a href="tottenham-hotspurs.html">Spurs</a> - they have been absolutely fantastic. And look, everything being equal, maybe I would say one, possibly two more signings maximum, I think that sooner rather than later they will be challenging for the top spot<br /><br /><b>[Bosnich thinks it was crucial United did not lose momentum]</b> I am going to stick by my original tip at the start of the season and say that <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> are definitely favourites <b>[for the top four]</b>. <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> have had a very difficult time since they have returned from the break and <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> and <a href="chelsea-fc.html">Chelsea</a> - and definitely <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> - have real momentum, so I am going to go for them two to finish inside the top four and unfortunately for <a href="leicester-fc.html">Leicester</a> to be outside of it<br /><br /><b>[Bosnich is adamant that Villa’s win confirms what he has long suspected]</b> That was amazing wasn’t it? Obviously, it was do or die for <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> and they did it, but like you just said, all the teams around them as well did it. Three games to go, in my opinion it will go down to the wire. I was looking at the draw for the run-in, for the last three games, <b>[and]</b> there’s no one that really stands out. You still have to say probably up until Brighton are in it, even though another Brighton win would secure their place. But I have just got a feeling it will come down right to that last game when <a href="aston-villa-fc.html">Aston Villa</a> play <a href="west-ham-united.html">West Ham</a> and like I said, it really is up in the air. All teams that are down there right now, they have just got to forget about it. The natural thing to do is to think ‘if we had just done this’. You have just got to forget about it now and just do your very, very best to try to finish off with three wins</p>
