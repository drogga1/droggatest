  <p><b>[Tranmere chairman Mark Palios says the club are considering legal action after the curtailment of the League One season resulted in their relegation]</b> Many of you have been asking whether the club intends to take legal action against the EFL in respect of the vote to demote Tranmere from League 1 last week. We have been very clear that we regard the vote as unfair, unjust and an entirely unnecessary infliction of damage on our club when we are already grappling with the impact of a global pandemic.<br /><br />Emotions are running very high, but our first duty is to act in the best interests of the club. The EFL changed the regulations to require arbitration proceedings directly challenging the vote to be commenced within seven days of the vote, but the club intends to take a more considered approach, as we have many other legal remedies with no such time constraints<br /><br />We have been taking detailed legal advice from experts in this specialist field of litigation and are closely following the legal actions in Belgium, France and Scotland <b>[amongst other places]</b> where similar decisions are being challenged and overturned on the basis of anti-competitive behaviour and unfair prejudice. At this stage we are keeping an open mind as to what legal action may be appropriate and/or necessary, and the timing of that. Our preferred option is of course to resolve the dispute in an amicable fashion working together with the EFL - and we invite the EFL to do so with the best interests of the footballing pyramid in mind - but to date the EFL has given no indication of any inclination to work with us to find a reasonable solution without resorting to formal legal proceedings</p>

  <p><b>[Dundee United Owner Mark Palios on Micky Mellon]</b> Micky has been with us for a long time by the standards of football. Having joined us at our lowest point in the non-League, he led us to three Wembley trips and back-to-back promotions to League One, and in doing so secured his place in the Tranmere history books. Although the current season, which ended in our demotion to League Two in the cruellest of fashions, is a sad note on which to leave, I have no doubt that, had we been allowed to play the season out, he would have kept us up. I am disappointed that Micky wished to move on but, as a Scot, the opportunity to manage in the Scottish <a href="epl.html">Premier League</a> was one which was too good for him to miss and I did not feel it was right to stand in his way. We are already fairly advanced in our planning of a very competitive squad for next season, and I will now turn my attention to ensuring that we identify the right person to complete that process and lead our challenge for an immediate return to League 1</p>

  <p><b>[Mark Palios is confident Mike Jackson is ready to lead the Tranmere Rovers forward]</b> Mike has been a big part of our success in recent years and has earned his chance to make the step up to managing the team. He is a great coach with a forward-thinking approach to the game and understands the Tranmere DNA. On top of all of this, he is a proven winner in his career to date<br /><br />Having spent many hours talking to Mike over the last couple of weeks regarding his plans for development of the team, I was excited by his ideas and also mindful of the benefits of the continuity that his appointment would represent; he knows the players in our squad, how to get the best out of them and where we need to strengthen. I am looking forward to working with him in his new role at the club</p>
