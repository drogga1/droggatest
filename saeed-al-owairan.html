  <p>[Former Saudi Arabia international Saeed Al-Owairan believes Liverpool forward Mo Salah can star for Egypt at this year’s World Cup] I’m an optimist and we have enough time to prepare properly for the World Cup. We have some clever players like Mohamed Salah who has shown some excellent performances with Liverpool, and many other players who are top professionals. The World Cup is an opportunity for them to raise their value and their reputations, but also to share their happiness with their countries. I expect the Arab teams will show good performances in this tournament.<br /><br />I think our group is great with Egypt and Russia and the result in our opening game will determine our future. We know that the beginning is always hard but we have to make a draw at least, and why not a win</p>

  <p>[Retired Saudi Arabia international Saeed Al-Owairan does not think there is any need to put his legendary goal up to Diego Maradona’s legendary 1986 strike] Mine arrived from a farther distance. But well, Maradona was elected that year’s best player of the World Cup. There is no need to put myself up to it. But it is certain that our goals are similar. We met several times, we talked together. He is a very great player. A huge player, in every sense of the word. And also a very respectable person.<br /><br />When I remember this tournament, I feel only pride because I was able to contribute to the excellent course of the Saudi team. We reached the stage of the round of 16. And I remember of course the goal that I put against Belgium and that was the most beautiful of this competition<br /><br />It’s rather that after the match has ended, that we have qualified and that I have seen all the reactions that there were, that I realized the importance of this goal<br /><br />We could have gone further than last 16. After the success against Belgium, we were a bit on a cloud. And with this qualification in the second round, the expectations of our supporters became greater. It is certain that against Sweden, where we lost 1-3, we should have done better<br /><br />[Al-Owairan also confirmed that he had interest from teams in Brazil and Portugal after his performances with Saudi Arabia, but was unable to move] Yes, I received [interest]. From Brazil and Portugal. Unfortunately, I was not allowed to go there<br /><br />[When asked if anyone could repeat his goal] It will be difficult. But why not ? I’ll be happy, anyway. We have some good players, I can mention Mohammad Al-Sahlawi or Fahad Al-Muwallad</p>
