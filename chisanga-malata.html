  <p>The former UFC featherweight champion, 30, became one of the most distinguishable athletes in the UFC thanks to his long reign at the summit of the 145lbs division, which was ended by Max Holloway earlier this year.<br /><br />Followers of the sport across the globe often ask themselves the same question when they take a quick glance at the former WEC superstar. That question is: How did he get that huge scar on the left side of his face? Did he sustain it during a gruesome fight? Or was he born with it?<br /><br />Aldo, the two-time ruler of the UFC’s 145lbs division, sustained the life-changing injury as a baby. The unfortunate incident took place at a family party when Aldo’s eldest sibling, Joseline, picked up his crib to throw at her sister during a fight. As Joseline threw the crib, Aldo, who at the time was only a year old, ended up landing face first on a lit barbecue.</p>

  <p>KHABIB NURMAGOMEDOV has revealed he doesn’t plan on attending his scheduled before the Nevada State Athletic Commission<br /><br />Last month, Nurmagomedov was ordered by the commission to attend a disciplinary hearing for his actions after the main event of UFC 229, in which he locked horns with <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">Conor McGregor</a>. Moments after successfully retaining his lightweight title with a fourth-round submission victory, Nurmagomedov sparked a mass brawl by scaling the Octagon and attempting to attack <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>’s team-mate Dillon Danis<br /><br />After seeing Danis being involved in a scuffle with Rizan Magamadov, ‘The Eagle’ lived up to his moniker by soaring through the air and attempting to dropkick the Bellator welterweight<br /><br />Nurmagomedov’s moment of madness resulted in him being receiving an indefinite suspension from the NSAC and the commission withholding his £1.57m ($2million) guaranteed purse, though £785,000 ($1million) of his winnings has since been released<br /><br />In the UFC 229 post-fight press conference, Nurmagomedov defended his actions and insisted they were no worse than <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>’s rampage in Brooklyn last April.<br /><br />Nurmagomedov, 27-0, earned the biggest payday of his mixed martial arts career for his grudge match with <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a>, his successor at the summit of the lightweight division. And the grappling phenom’s manager <a href="ali-abdelaziz.html">Ali Abdelaziz</a> reckons his client should earn upwards of £39million (£50million) for his next outing inside the cage</p>

  <p><a href="khabib-nurmagomedov.html">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a> has shut down fresh talk of him fighting <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Floyd Mayweather Jr</a>, insisting his next outing must be against Tony Ferguson<br /><br />Nurmagomedov’s father, Abdulmanap, recently restoked the fire in an Instagram post telling <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Mayweather</a> he ‘respects his wish to fight’ his son. The prospect of facing <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Mayweather</a> - who is currently enjoying his third retirement - was put to Nurmagomedov during a recent press conference in Moscow. ‘The Eagle’ was quick to dismiss suggestions the 41-year-old could be his next opponent, declaring former interim lightweight champion Ferguson his next foe<br /><br />Nurmagomedov does, however, believe a fight with <a href="floyd-mayweather.html">Mayweather</a> could come to fruition if the boxer decides to test himself in the mixed martial arts world<br /><br />Earlier this month, UFC president <a href="dana-white.html">Dana White</a> confirmed a fight between Numragomedov and Ferguson - who have been scheduled to face one another a staggering four times - is in the works<br /><br />The UFC brass are hopeful of having the fight take place in Las Vegas in March, but Nurmagomedov doesn’t plan on setting foot in Sin City again unless the Nevada Athletic Commission apologises for handing him a hefty £369,000 fine and a nine-month ban for his part in the post-fight brawl that marred his victory over <a href="conor-mcgregor.html">McGregor</a> last October</p>
