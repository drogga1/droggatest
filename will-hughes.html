  <p><b>[Watford midfielder Will Hughes has insisted he is not taking heed of any speculation linking him with a place in Gareth Southgate’s latest England squad]</b> It is not at the forefront of my mind. I’ve just got to knuckle down and keep my head focused, play games and that is the main thing. I said from the start I just want to start a run of games in the Premier League. It is still very early days on that front, so I want to have a good season in the Premier League and who knows what will happen in the future.<br /><br /><b>[Hughes is enjoying working under Javi Gracia]</b> It’s really enjoyable. I think you can tell from the way that we are playing on the pitch that everyone’s battling for each other and running about. Sometimes they are the basics that you’ve got to do to get results. I think we have done well this season, we look very organised offensively and that’s helped a lot</p>

  <p><b>[Chelsea forward Eden Hazard only sits behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo]</b> His <b>[Hazard’s]</b> agility and the way he moves the ball so quickly in tight spaces is different class. Sometimes you have to just admire him. The reason he’s not talked about like Messi and Ronaldo is because he’s unselfish, he’d rather pass it to a team-mate, which people don’t notice as much. They’re a quality team with great players, so we have to be on our game 100 per cent, but we know we’ve got good players as well who can hurt them. They’ve got pressures themselves, they want to be in the top four so they have massive things to play for, but we do too and we’re going to go there and treat it as a big game</p>
