  <p>[PKNS FC announced the appointment of Sven Gartung to replace E. Elavarasan as the head coach of the Super League club] The main target given by the management to me is to stay in the Super League. Looking that we have only managed 3 wins thus far, there’s a lot to be done. After two successive defeats, We have to start getting wins starting with the Malaysia Cup match against Kuala Lumpur. I’ve seen the team in action in the past couple of matches and I see that they have the potential to be better than the current position suggest.</p>

  <p>[PKNS FC head coach Sven Gartung has credited the formation change he implemented for the side’s revival in the Super League] My players were exhausted but they gave their all to defend the lead [2-1]. I’m very excited to see the attitude of the players who never gave up, and they deserve this victory. My decision to switch to the 4-2-3-1 formation have also worked so far, and the players seem to be comfortable with the plans. We had been conceding two goals on average every match, and this is too high because we would then have needed to get three goals if we want to win. That’s why I changed the formation and so far it has been working because we’ve only conceded one goal in the last three games, while scoring three.</p>
