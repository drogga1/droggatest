  <p><b>[PKNS FC announced the appointment of Sven Gartung to replace E. Elavarasan as the head coach of the Super League club]</b> The main target given by the management to me is to stay in the Super League. Looking that we have only managed 3 wins thus far, there’s a lot to be done. After two successive defeats, We have to start getting wins starting with the Malaysia Cup match against Kuala Lumpur. I’ve seen the team in action in the past couple of matches and I see that they have the potential to be better than the current position suggest.</p>

  <p><b>[PKNS FC head coach Sven Gartung has credited the formation change he implemented for the side’s revival in the Super League]</b> My players were exhausted but they gave their all to defend the lead <b>[2-1]</b>. I’m very excited to see the attitude of the players who never gave up, and they deserve this victory. My decision to switch to the 4-2-3-1 formation have also worked so far, and the players seem to be comfortable with the plans. We had been conceding two goals on average every match, and this is too high because we would then have needed to get three goals if we want to win. That’s why I changed the formation and so far it has been working because we’ve only conceded one goal in the last three games, while scoring three.</p>

  <p><b>[Gartung content with outcome as priority lies in Super League]</b> Very proud of the boys. They fighting 90 minutes. But when I took over in the job, we said the focus is on the league, this is the cup. You can see that Perak wants to move on in this cup. They wanted three points, so they came with the full orchestra. We made some changes and I’m very proud of the players that played tonight <b>[Saturday]</b>.<br /><br />We want to win every single match. We don’t go into the pitch to lose. Even if we don’t put our best XI. End of the day, it was a penalty and a nice set piece conversion. We tried everything that we can but at the end of the day it wasn’t enough<br /><br />He’s in hospital right now. He has something on the side of his leg, in the bone. It’s a pity. Perak played very physical, but we know what we need to prepare for next week’s match</p>
