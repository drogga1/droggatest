  <p><b>[Dominic Calvert-Lewin says that he is proud to be wearing the No.9 jersey for Everton this season]</b> It’s a dream come true to wear the No.9 shirt at such a big club with a great history. With such a big number comes a great responsibility so I have to accept that on my shoulders and live with what comes with it, good and bad. It is not a burden, it is just part and parcel of being a No.9. Being in the best league in the world you are expected to score goals. I am disappointed when that doesn’t happen but that is not to say I’m not working on it and trying to improve every day<br /><br /><b>[Calvert-Lewin joined Everton in the summer of 2016 from Sheffield United and feels that he has improved significantly since then]</b> I have been here three years now and I’ve grown as a player and a person. I have worked with a lot of different people who have helped me along the way. I have definitely grown to be in the position that I am in now in order to try and lead the line as best as I can<br /><br /><b>[The club’s forward line was recently bolstered by the arrival of Moise Kean from Juventus]</b> It can only improve you. If you’ve got competition for places then you always need to be on top of your game</p>

  <p><b>[Everton vs <a href="manchester-city-fc.html">Manchester City</a>. Dominic Calvert-Lewin bagged a brace in the victory and the striker says that <a href="everton-fc.html">the Toffees</a> will use the result to build towards potential points against Man City]</b> Collectively, it’s a chance to pick up momentum. You have to try to take that from wins. Personally, I want to take momentum after scoring twice in the cup. It will be a tough game on Saturday but that is what you expect <b>[in the Premier League]</b></p>

  <p><b>[Dominic Calvert-Lewin saluted new <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> ​boss <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Carlo Ancelotti</a> after the striker’s brace saw his side defeat <a href="newcastle-united.html">Newcastle</a> 2-1 at <b>[St James’ Park]</b>(newcastle-united.html) in the Italian’s second game in charge]</b> For me personally I am enjoying my football as you can see, but for the lads it has been a great period and a great month. We have got that togetherness back in the team. We are getting back to where we want to be after a below-par start. It was not good enough and it was vitally important we turned it around. We wanted first to get into that middle cluster and go beyond that<br /><br /><b>[The former <a href="napoli-fc.html">Napoli</a> boss encouraged the young forward to do more of his work closer to goal and down the middle of the pitch, in order to increase his goal return]</b> He is a fantastic manager who has worked with great players and for me as a young player it is the best possible experience. I just have to be like a sponge and take it all in. I am just happy to hit the back of the net. That is what I am there to do. The work doesn’t stop for me now</p>

  <p><b>[Dominic Calvert-Lewin was dumbfounded by the decision to rule out his stoppage-time winner for <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> against <a href="manchester-united.html">Manchester United</a> on Sunday, calling it a disaster]</b> That is a disaster. Oh my gosh. He’s not even obstructing the line of sight<br /><br /><b>[Moments later, he gave a more measured response]</b> In the moment, I wasn’t sure. Seeing it back I think Gylfi on the floor doesn’t obstruct the line of sight. Fair enough, he’s in an offside position but then it takes a deflection, the keeper is going the other way and he’s got his legs out of the way. The keeper is never going to save the ball so I’m not sure what it is. For me, as a striker, I think it’s a goal but VAR says otherwise and cancels out the emotion at the end. What can you do?</p>

  <p><b>[Calvert-Lewin commits to <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and targets Europe with <a href="carlo-ancelotti.html">Ancelotti</a>’s Toffees]</b> This is a very proud day. The turnaround we have had since December is fantastic and the belief in ourselves we are back up there and can compete with the best is well and truly there. And with a man like Carlo leading the ship it makes it easier for us to believe in the process. We want to be in Europe and competing in the top competitions. It would mean that bit more to win trophies here because of the journey I have been on with <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> and Evertonians<br /><br />I like to think I have shown I am ready to live up to the expectations of being <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a>’s number nine. But I am well aware of how much I need to improve and how much better I can do</p>

  <p><b>[Dominic Calvert-Lewin rued the late chances <a href="everton-fc.html">Everton</a> passed up to end their Merseyside derby misery against Liverpool]</b> Yeah, it was just instinct at the end, we had a few chances but it wasn’t our day. Sometimes they go in, sometimes they don’t and unfortunately today it didn’t. Well take the point but that was a big chance for us today<br /><br /><b>[Merseyside derby without fans took some getting used to]</b> It was strange, I can’t lie to you. Playing with no atmosphere and no fans, it was a little bit bizarre for a game of this magnitude. Usually the place is bouncing and it was hard to get used to. But we play football for a living and it’s all about focus. The only thing that changes is sometimes you get that little uplift from the fans when they’re all roaring. That had to come from within today, which I think it did, and we were unlucky not to nick it.<br /><br /><b>[Calvert-Lewin also acknowledged the lack of quality for large chunks of the contest was inevitable to some extent after the lengthy lay-off]</b> Obviously it wasn’t as sharp as you’d expect when we had the rhythm of the games before. It’s been a long time out and the players are a little bit rusty. Myself, my timing was a bit off, with my check challenges and my duels and things like that. Those are things you can’t really replicate and it comes with games.</p>
