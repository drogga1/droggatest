  <p><b>[Manchester United vs Intermilan. Defender Alessandro Bastoni, a former graduate of Atalanta’s youth ranks, who has spent the last two seasons away on loan from the club, is hoping to make 2019-20 his breakthrough campaign]</b> It’s an honour for me to represent these colours. I’ve been hoping to reach this point for two years now and I’ve finally got this opportunity. It’s certainly the case that I’ve immediately been made aware of where I am. Working with high-quality staff and great players is a great honour and privilege for me, and I’ll try to learn as much as possible</p>

  <p><b>[Intermilan defender Alessandro Bastoni says <a href="antonio-conte.html">Antonio Conte</a> is the <a href="lionel-messi.html">Lionel Messi</a> of coaches]</b> Everyone had spoken highly of <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> and I’ve only received confirmation of how great he is. As far as I am concerned, <a href="antonio-conte.html">Conte</a> is the <a href="lionel-messi.html">Messi</a> of coaches. He is phenomenal, has exceptional footballing ideas and always wants to go on the attack. The training schedule is very tough indeed, but so was <a href="gian-piero-gasperini.html">Gian Piero Gasperini</a> when I played for Atalanta. The difference was that we were training in China over the summer and the humidity was incredible, so I admit that did make me suffer a lot. But when the quality level goes up, you must raise your game to meet it. There’s no point denying it, we want to change the way the <a href="serie-a.html">Serie A</a> seasons have been going recently. We have the Coach and the squad to do that, but must prove it one game at a time<br /><br /><b>[For now, he is happy to continue learning his trade under one of Italy’s most revered coaches of recent years]</b> It’s tough marking <a href="romelu-lukaku.html">Lukaku</a> in training but on the plus side it’s good practice for when you do go up against physically strong strikers, because they’re a piece of cake compared to him! Romelu is like a force of nature. I’ve been so impressed by the humility of my teammates at Inter, despite them being some of the best in the world, and they give me such great advice. I’ve always supported Inter, so looking at myself in the mirror with this jersey on is a dream come true</p>
